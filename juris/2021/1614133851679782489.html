No. 3-2000 dated June 15, 2000.<br><br>Moreover, Rosare intentionally detached or severed pages 73 and 74 from the FF cashbook for no apparent reason. She also deliberately understated her collections on JDF and SAJF in several instances in January 2017. As to the STF, the applicable rules regarding the liquidation of cash advances made by the process server were not fully complied with.<br><br>Also, MTC Labo has no official cashbook on the GF account contrary to the rule that each fund account must exclusively use one official cashbook. In addition, certifications as to the correction of entries in the cashbooks on all fund accounts were not regularly observed by Rosare or any accountable officer. Several entries on the triplicate copies of the issued official receipts in FF and STF were not legible. Finally, the recommendations made in the first audit conducted on November 1 to 12, 2014 were not fully complied with by Rosare.<br><br>In a Letter dated March 23, 2017,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Audit Team recommended that Rosare be directed to: (a) submit all necessary documents to support all unauthorized and unaccounted FF and STF withdrawals in the bank or otherwise restitute the shortages in the amount of P469,464.38 within ten (10) days from notice; (b) explain in writing within ten (10) days from notice why: (i) she incurred such shortages and failed to comply with the Court circulars and issuances regarding proper handling of court collections; (ii) she purposely detached or severed pages 73 and 74 from the FF cashbook; and (iii) she understated her collections for JDF and SAJF in various instances in January 2017; and (c) submit all required financial reports by the AD, FMO, OCA.<br><br>The Audit Team likewise recommended that Hans P. Camu, the Court Interpreter and Officer-in-Charge, be advised to: (a) deposit or remit all judiciary collections on time; (b) certify the correctness of entries in the cashbooks on all funds; (c) remit all GF collection in the Bureau of Treasury Savings Account No. 3402-2745-13; (d) follow the procedures on proper handling and disbursement of STF account; (e) use the prescribed cash book on GF account; (f) ensure a legible entry in the triplicate copies of official receipts; (g) reconcile the book balance with cash on hand on a daily basis and follow the provision of Chapter 2 (10) of the Cash Examination Manual; (h) remit all GF collections in Bureau of Treasury Savings Account No. 3402-2745-13; and (i) coordinate with the FMO, OCA regarding the requirements on Fidelity Bond in compliance with Section 101 of P.D. No. 1445.<br><br>In her Explanation dated April 28,2017,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Rosare reasoned that she never received the letters of Atty. Gilda A. Sumpo, the Chief Judicial Officer of AD, requiring her to submit monthly or quarterly financial reports on different fund accounts of the court. She claimed that the said letters were received by Lovely Camonas, the Court Stenographer of MTC Labo, who did not turn over said letters to her. She showed the alleged registry receipts to the Audit Team as proof that she mailed the alleged unsubmitted reports required by the FMO.<br><br>She explained that the shortages on FF or STF were based on the following: (a) the unauthorized or unaccounted FF/STF bank withdrawals in the amount of P213,000.00 referred as bail bonds were withdrawn and received by the bondsmen; (b) the over-withdrawal of interest charged in the amount of P894.18 is not allowed by the LBP; (c) the amount of PI 6,000.00 was no longer deposited because Aida Francisco, the bondsman, withdrew the cash bond on November 26, 2014; (d) the unauthorized STF withdrawals in the total amount of P13,000.00 were not yet accounted for because of missing files; (e) there was no double withdrawal of P3,000.00 on STF because of erroneous input of case numbers; and (f) the portion of the undeposited amount of P144,595.00 was not yet turned over to her for deposit while the rest of the undeposited amount had not yet been accounted for because of missing files.<br><br>Furthermore, she clarified that the shortages in the STF were due to the following: (a) the undeposited STF collection in the amount of P28,000.00 refers to the cash advance of the process server which was not yet liquidated as there was yet no court order from the presiding judge; (b) the shortage in the amount of P12,000.00 was erroneously deposited in the FF account; and (c) the unsupported bank withdrawal of P1,000.00 was withdrawn on March 26, 2015 for a certain case.<br><br>Rosare further explained that the shortages on the JDF and the SAFJ in the amounts of P3,842.20 and P4,228.00, respectively, were due to her failure to reconcile the amounts indicated in the official receipts and in the cashbook due to heavy workload. Lastly, Rosare reasoned that the shortage on the MF was due to missing files.<br><br>She elucidated that she purposely detached or severed pages 73 and 74 from the FF cashbook because of her writings on it, that is, <i>"GUSTO KO NG MAGPAKAMATAY PAGOD AT HIRAP NA HIRAP NA AKO. SHIT! SHIT! MGA PERWISYO! SORRY IYA!".</i> She insisted that she did not defy Court circulars and other Court issuances regarding the proper handling of court collections. She maintained that she submitted all the required reports to the AD on time as per the registry receipts she mentioned. She prayed that she be given enough time to locate the missing files. However, she is willing to pay and restitute the unaccounted amounts in case she fails to find them.<br><br>On March 21, 2018, the Audit Team submitted its Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which found Rosare guilty of violation of A.C.

No. 3-00<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> mandates that the daily collections for the JDF and the GF in the MTC shall be deposited everyday with the nearest LBP branch or if depositing daily is not possible, deposits for the fund shall be at the end of every month, provided, however, that whenever collections for the Fund reach P500.00, the same shall be deposited immediately even before the said period.<br><br>Undoubtedly, Rosare violated OCA Circular No. 32-93<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> when she failed to regularly submit monthly reports of collections and deposits and official receipts and other documents, despite this Court's repeated orders. As a Clerk of Court, Rosare is responsible for court records and physical facilities of the court and is accountable for the court's money and property deposits as per Section B, Chapter 1 of the 1991 Manual for Clerks of Court and the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court (A.M. No. 02-5-07-SC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As a custodian thereof, the Clerk of Court is liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of said funds and property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, Rosare should be steadfast on her duty to submit monthly reports on the court's finances pursuant to OCA Circular No. 32-93 and OCA Circular 113-04 and to immediately deposit the various funds received by her to the authorized government depositories in accordance with COA-DOF Joint Circular No. 1-81, SC A.C. No. 3-00 and OCA Circular No. 50-95.<br><br>Evidently, given the findings of the OCA Audit Team coupled with Rosare's admissions, the latter not only failed to perform the duties of her office but also fell short in adhering to the high ethical standards expected of court employees. We reiterate the pronouncements made in <i>Efondo v. Favorito</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that as a Clerk of Court, Rosare, is accountable to the people and expected to act with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, to wit:<br><blockquote>In almost all administrative cases, this Court has reminded everyone in the public service that public office is a public trust. No less than the fundamental law of the land requires that "[pjublic officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives." [N]o less can be expected from those involved in the administration of justice. Public servants are even mandated to uphold public interest over personal needs. Everyone, from the highest official to the lowest rank employee, must live up to the strictest norms of probity and integrity in the public service.<br><br>Specifically in this case, the Clerk of Court is an important officer in our judicial system. The said office is the nucleus of all court activities, adjudicative and administrative. The administrative functions are as vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice as his judicial duties are. The Clerk of Court performs a very delicate function. He or she is the custodian of the court's funds and revenues, records, property and premises. Being the custodian thereof, the Clerk of Court is liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of said funds and property. Needless to say, thus, Clerks of Court should be steadfast in their duty to submit monthly reports on the court's finances pursuant to OCA Circular Nos. 50-95 and 113-2004 and to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories.</blockquote>Furthermore, Rosare incurred shortages in the amount of P456,470.38 and delay in the remittance of her cash collections in violation of COA-DOF Joint Circular No. 1-81, OCA Circular No. 50-95 and SC A.C. No. 3-2000. Her failure to promptly remit her fiduciary collections was in flagrant violation of the said circulars. Such acts constitute gross dishonesty and gross neglect of duty which is punishable with dismissal pursuant to the Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Dishonesty is defined as intentionally making a false statement in any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, registration, appointment or promotion. Dishonesty, like bad faith, is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention. In ascertaining the intention of a person accused of dishonesty, consideration must be taken not only of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the act committed by the respondent, but also of his state of mind at the time the offense was committed, the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act, and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Rosare's act of misappropriating court funds, as evidenced by the shortages in her accounts, by delaying or not remitting or delaying the deposit of the court collections within the prescribed period constitutes dishonesty which is definitely an act unbecoming of a court personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Failure of Rosare to remit funds upon demand by an authorized without any justifiable reason constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence that she has put such missing funds or property to personal use.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As a Clerk of Court, a vital post in the hierarchy of positions in the trial court, Rosare was expected to live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>.

In addition, Rosare is subject to the following administrative disabilities, namely: (a) cancellation of any civil service eligibility; (b) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; and (c) perpetual disqualification from re-employment in any government agency or instrumentality, including any government-owned and government-controlled coiporation or government financial institution.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court <b>FINDS</b> and <b>DECLARES</b> respondent Eden P.
