In 1999, he was issued a brand new service vehicle, a Mitsubishi L200 Pick-up with Plate No. SFG 496. This vehicle, under his directive, was previously subjected to maintenance service and repairs for four times. He was surprised when petitioner Dela Cruz, the owner of DEB, presented a DV and other documents for him to sign, allegedly for the payment of the repairs in the amount of P22,420.00. While he was at first hesitant because he did not give any advance payment for the service and repairs, he agreed to sign the DV. The IAS Office showed six DVs with six checks covering repairs on his service vehicle reportedly done by J-CAP, but the signatory in the DVs are co-accused Martinez and Arias, instead of witness Jimenez as end-user. In these alleged transactions, there were no actual repairs or services done on his service vehicle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan summarized the defenses raised by petitioners:<br><blockquote><b>MAXIMO A. BORJE</b> testified that in 2001, he was the Chief of Motor Pool at the Bureau of Equipment (BOE), DPWH. He is primarily in charge with the administration of the Motor Pool Office. A request for repair begins when the request is relayed to the secretary of the Motor Pool who then relays said request to the Special Inspectorate Team (SIT). The SIT conducts the pre-inspection repair and thereafter prepares the Job Order. The SIT will then inform him of the parts needed for repair. He recommends the approval of the Job Order. It is the Chief of the Central Equipment and Spare Parts Division, Erdito Quarto, who approves the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>CONCHITA M.

DEB was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 22, 2001 and is in the business of supplying spare parts, repair and maintenance of light vehicles with the DPWH since 2001. She was the owner of DEB before its registration with the SEC. It was a sole proprietorship then. DEB Corporation started doing business with DPWH when invited to submit prices regarding the repair and maintenance of light vehicles, particularly Toyota, Mitsubishi, Isuzu, Ford and Nissan. They submitted a quotation and canvass by giving prices on the parts required by the DPWH. Their liaison officer fills up, signs and submits the canvass forms to the DPWH. Thereafter, they would wait for the evaluation of award as to which vehicles will be assigned to them as the lowest bidder. She does not know who evaluates the canvass forms and determines the lowest bid because DEB's liaison officer is the one who goes to DPWH to attend the evaluation of the prices. A notice is given by the DPWH to the liaison officer when the project is awarded to them. It is their liaison officer who oversees their transactions with DPWH. She has no knowledge that the cash invoice that was being used by their liaison officer in transacting with DPWH was the cash invoice where her name was indicated as proprietress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><b>Ruling of the Sandiganbayan</b><br></div><br>On November 10, 2016, the Sandiganbayan promulgated its Decision finding petitioners Borje and Dela Cruz among those guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Estafa through Falsification of Documents and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A.

Hernandez:<br><blockquote><b><i>These violations are aplenty. At one point, the Court asked whether there were penalties for those observed violations; the prosecution's witness stated there was none in the rules. This could well be a reason why strict compliance was not observed. Yet the sheer volume of these occurrences easily incites suspicion that government funds may have been dissipated through these violations. <u>This nagging question, however, cannot translate to evidence needed to prove the actual allegation that these were all ghost transactions.</u><br><br>It appears that the prosecution mainly hinges its case through a showing of these violations. It prescinds from the assumption that since there were violations in the documentation and processing, the transactions were non-existent.

They were actually false claims that formed part of sinister schemes to steal government funds. This is clearly shown by the following:<br><br>First. Of the 39 vehicles in question, only one, the Mitsubishi L-200 with Plate No. SFG-361 / H1-4237, was assigned to accused Martinez. All the rest were assigned to other officials and agencies of the DPWH. There was no request from these officials and agencies for the emergency repairs that the vehicles assigned to them purportedly underwent during the period in question, which became the subject of the reimbursements claimed and paid in the name of accused Martinez.<br><br>Second. The justification given for the purchases of spare parts was emergency repairs, but they do not really qualify as such under existing DPWH regulation. They were falsely labeled as emergency repairs/purchases to avoid the requirement of public bidding.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The table below,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> prepared on the basis of evidence on record, shows that service or spare parts purchased for the emergency repairs of the DPWH vehicles, the costs of which were reimbursed to accused Martinez, do not qualify as emergency services or purchases. They are clearly not of the kind that can be considered "urgent or absolutely indispensable to prevent immediate danger to, or loss of, life and/or property, or avoid detriment to the public service."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Third. A careful scrutiny of Disbursement Vouchers and supporting documents also yields that splitting of repairs and of purchases of spare parts was resorted to in order to circumvent prescribed limitations as well as the requirement of public bidding.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In connection with the 274 transactions covering the alleged emergency repairs/purchases of spare parts of the 39 DPWH vehicles, the documents that were submitted to support the reimbursements claimed and paid in the name of accused Martinez, and attached to the Disbursement Vouchers, were the following: Certifications of Sealed Emergency Purchase/Repair; Abstracts of Canvass and corresponding written quotations; Requisitions for Supplies of Equipment (RSEs); Motor Vehicle Pre-repair Inspection Reports; Motor Vehicle Post-repair Inspection Reports and Certificates of Acceptance. These are among those referred to in paragraph D of DPWH Memorandum dated July 31, 1997 quoted above. The other documents submitted were following: Cash Invoices issued by the suppliers, Reports of Waste Material and Equipment Pre-Inspection and Job Orders.<br><br>The Court finds, and so holds, that all the aforementioned documents submitted were falsified. Except for the Cash Invoices issued by the suppliers, the documents were prepared, accomplished and/or executed and signed by public officers/employees taking advantage of their official positions in making untruthful statements in the narration of facts. <b>Through these documents, it was made to appear, albeit untrue, that the 39 vehicles subject of reimbursements claimed and paid to accused Martinez in the total sum of P5,166,539.00 underwent emergency repairs that required purchases of spare parts. The Disbursement Vouchers were also falsified to justify the release of checks for payment of the reimbursements claimed.

In other words, the crime of falsification has already existed. <b>Actually utilizing that falsified public, official, or commercial document to defraud another is estafa.</b> But the damage is caused by the commission of estafa, not by the falsification of the document.

The transactions involved only two suppliers under the name DEB owned by petitioner Dela Cruz, and J-CAP owned by Capuz. The audit team noted several violations in the transactions.

No. 236807, petitioner Dela Cruz argues there is doubt as to her actual participation in the criminal scheme because the prosecution did not present any evidence to prove she prepared or filled-up the Cash Invoices that were submitted to the DPWH. She claims it is her liaison officer that prepares the Cash Invoices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioner Dela Cruz' assertions, there is sufficient evidence to prove her participation in the criminal scheme. As she herself admitted, she was the owner of DEB when it was a sole proprietorship and before the registration of DEB Auto Repair Shop and Parts Supply Corporation (<i>DEB Corporation</i>) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (<i>SEC</i>), and the Cash Invoices being used in transacting business with the DPWH was her company's old Cash Invoices where her name was indicated as proprietress. She, however, disavows the preparation and use of these Cash Invoices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> These self-serving allegations fail in light of the evidence presented. Her defense is weakened by the testimony of the prosecution's witness Jimenez that petitioner Dela Cruz, the owner of DEB, presented a DV and other documents for him to sign, allegedly for the payment of repairs, but he did not give any advance payment for the service and repairs.

Notably, some of the checks issued pursuant to the DVs indicating DEB as "Supplier", are dated before the incorporation of DEB Corporation on May 22, 2001, or specifically from January 12, 2001 (e.g., DV Nos. 102-00-12-31221; 102-00-12-15398; 102-00-12-15401; 102-00-12-15418; 102-00-12-15397; 102-00-12-31218; 102-00-12-15612; 102-00-12-15395) to May 17, 2001 (<i>e.g.</i>, DV No. 102-01-05-03683; 102-00-05-03682).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>As an additional defense, petitioner Dela Cruz argues that the crime of falsification under Article 171 of the RPC can only be committed by a public officer or employee, and the Sandiganbayan had itself acknowledged that the falsifiers of the DVs and supporting documents, other than the Cash Invoices, were the public officers/employees, thus negating her participation. Petitioner Dela Cruz further submits that the absence of proof that she benefitted or gained from the supposed conspiracy would show, following common sense, that she did not enter into one. Furthermore, the lack of any evidence showing that petitioner Dela Cruz had knowledge of the subject transactions with the DPWH leads to the conclusion that she could not have been part of the conspiracy alleged by the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>The defenses raised by petitioners fail to absolve them from their criminal liability because the prosecution had successfully established conspiracy among the accused including petitioners Borje and Dela Cruz.<br><br>In <i>Fernan, Jr. v.

While there was no direct proof of the agreement among the accused, we found it sufficient that the prosecution therein had proven that the accused committed acts that were in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy, which ultimately was to defraud the government in releasing public funds for ghost transactions. We held:<br><blockquote>The State is not tasked to adduce direct proof of the agreement by petitioners with the other accused, for such requirement, in many cases, would border on near impossibility. The State needs to adduce proof only when the accused committed acts that constitute a <b>vital connection to the chain of conspiracy or in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy</b>. In the case at bench, the signing of the fake tally sheets and/or delivery receipts, reports of inspection, and requests for supplies and materials by petitioners on separate occasions is vital to the success of the Mangubat Group in siphoning off government funds. <b>Without such fabricated documents, the general vouchers covering the supply of materials cannot be properly accomplished and submitted to the disbursing officer for the preparation of checks.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, it is clear that without the tally sheets and delivery receipts, the general voucher cannot be prepared and completed. Without the general voucher, the check for the payment of the supply cannot be made and issued to the supplier. Without the check payment, the defraudation cannot be committed and successfully consummated. <u><b>Thus, petitioners' acts in signing the false tally sheets and/or delivery receipts are indispensable to the consummation of the crime of estafa thru falsification of public documents.</b></u> Surely, there were ghost or false deliveries of supplies and materials as convincingly shown by the testimonies of the barangay captains, officials, and residents of the areas where the materials were allegedly used.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Similarly, in the instant cases, the falsification by the accused of the DVs, supporting documents and Cash Invoices had a vital connection to the chain of conspiracy or were in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy. Without the DVs, supporting documents and Cash Invoices, the government would not have released public funds for the reimbursement of the ghost emergency repairs and/or purchase of spare parts. Without the falsified Equipment Pre-Inspection Reports and Job Orders signed and the falsified Reports of Waste Material and Abstracts of Open Canvass approved by petitioner Borje, and without the falsified Cash Invoices issued by petitioner Dela Cruz through her sole proprietorship DEB, the objective of the conspiracy would not have been attained as these falsified documents were necessary to claim reimbursement for the ghost transactions. Thus, since the actions of the accused, including petitioners Borje and Dela Cruz, manifest their concurrence in the criminal design to facilitate the disbursement of public funds for the ghost emergency repairs and/or purchase of spare parts, the Sandiganbayan correctly found that there is conspiracy.<br><br>The conspiracy in this criminal scheme was correctly appreciated by the Sandiganbayan in its Decision:<br><blockquote>Clearly, with the repeated participation of the aforementioned accused in falsifying the documents relating to 274 separate transactions, the conclusion is inevitable that they conspired with one another in deceiving the DPWH into paying the claims for the fictitious emergency repairs/purchases of spare parts in the name of accused Martinez, thereby causing damage to the government in the total amount of P5,166,539.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></blockquote>This same conspiracy was also recognized by this Court in <i>Arias</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> when we affirmed the Sandiganbayan's Decision dated 10 November 2016 and Resolution issued on 15 January 2018, which are also subject of the instant petitions. In <i>Arias</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> we quoted the said Sandiganbayan Decision which found herein petitioners Borje and Dela Cruz and the other co-accused in conspiracy with therein petitioner Arias:<br><blockquote>After a careful and meticulous scrutiny of the records, the Court finds, and so holds, that the prosecution evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that the following accused are guilty of the offense charged, namely: Arias, Borja (sic), Castillo, Favorito, Quarto, San Jose and Dela Cruz. <b>These accused conspired with one another</b>, and with accused Martinez whose criminal liability has been extinguished by death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>We find no reason to disturb the findings of the Sandiganbayan that petitioners are in conspiracy with the other co-accused. This Court is not a trier of facts and in the absence of strong and compelling reasons, we accord finality to the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>With regard to petitioner Borje's contention that it was an error on the part of the Sandiganbayan to give due course to the prosecution's exhibits despite its failure to present the original documents alleged to have been falsified, such is misplaced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> In <i>Arias</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> we found a similar contention on the Best Evidence Rule (now known as Original Document Rule under Section 3, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>) to be misplaced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>The Original Document Rule provides: "When the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, writing, recording, photograph or other record, no evidence is admissible other than the original document itself x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]<br></sup><br>This revised version of the rule is similar to the previous recital of the rule under Section 3, Rule 130 of the recently amended 1989 Rules on Evidence: "When the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>Interpreting the amended provision under the 1989 Rules, we have held that the Best Evidence Rule (now known as Original Document Rule) does not apply to proof of facts collateral to the issues or when a party uses a document to prove the existence of an independent fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>In this case, the subject of the inquiry was not the content of the documents. In <i>Arias</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> we reached a similar finding on the purpose for which the subject documents were being offered: "petitioner's objection to the prosecution's documentary evidence, as stated in his Comment/Objections to Formal Offer of Exhibits, essentially relates to the materiality, relevance or purpose for which the documents were offered which had nothing to do with the contents thereof."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> The documents were presented by the prosecution to prove the falsification thereof was a necessary means and an essential part of the criminal scheme in committing estafa. Thus, the Sandiganbayan did not commit reversible error in giving due course to the prosecution's exhibits.<br><br>As to petitioners' guilt for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, such has also been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Corrupt practices of public officers</i>. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(<i>e</i>) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br></blockquote>The elements of the above violation are:<br><blockquote>(a) the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions; (b) he must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and (c) his action caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br></blockquote>The elements are present in this case. As held by the Sandiganbayan:<br><blockquote><b>First.</b> Accused Arias, Borje, Castillo, Favorito, Quarto and San Jose are undoubtedly public officers discharging administrative or official functions.<br><br><b>Second.</b> All the aforementioned accused, in conspiracy with one another and with accused Dela Cruz, acted with evident bad faith in falsifying official documents to deceive the DPWH into paying the claims for the fictitious emergency repairs/purchases of spare parts in the name of deceased accused Martinez.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Sistoza v. Desierto</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup>, the Supreme Court explained the meaning of evident bad faith in this wise:<br><blockquote>"x x x evident bad faith x x x connotes not only bad judgment but also palpably and patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose to do moral obliquity or conscious wrongdoing for some perverse motive or ill will."<br></blockquote><b>Third.</b> The actions of the accused caused undue injury or damage to the government in the total amount of P5,166,539.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphases in the original.)<br></blockquote>Petitioner Dela Cruz argues that the elements of the above violation have not been proven in her case because she cannot be considered to have committed the crime as she is not a public officer, but a mere private individual. Moreover, she forwards that conspiracy was not proven.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br><br>The issue on liability of private individuals under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 has already been settled, as in the case of <i>Balmadrid v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> where we found the petitioners who were suppliers, to be guilty along with their co-accused public officers as they were proven to be in conspiracy, to <i>wit</i>:<br><blockquote>Since petitioners have been shown to have participated in the conspiracy, they must be held equally liable with co-accused Binos and Alcantara under section 3(e) of RA 3019. In a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all (<i>People vs. Sendaydiego</i>, 81 SCRA 120). The fact that petitioners are private persons is of no consequence, considering that the rule of collective criminal responsibility includes even private individuals who participate with public officers in the perpetration of offenses ordinarily particularly applicable only to the latter (<i>United States v. Ponte</i>, 20 Phil. 379).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br></blockquote>As discussed above, petitioner Dela Cruz is in conspiracy with the other co-accused. Without the participation of petitioner Dela Cruz in the falsification of Cash Invoices through her sole proprietorship DEB, the reimbursements amounting to P5,166,539.00 would not have been facilitated. Thus, since petitioner Dela Cruz is in conspiracy with the other co-accused, it is of no moment that she is not a public officer. She is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.<br><br>While the Court finds no reversible error in the conviction of petitioners Borje and Dela Cruz, we find it necessary to modify the penalty initially imposed upon them in Crim. Case No. 28100 for Estafa through Falsification of Documents in light of R.A. No. 10951 or "An Act Adjusting the Amount or the Value of Property and Damage on which a Penalty is Based, and the Fines Imposed under the Revised Penal Code, amending for the Purpose Act No. 3815, otherwise known as 'The Revised Penal Code,'" which adjusted the amounts of property and damage on which penalties are based.<br><br>Section 25 of R.A. No. 10951, which amended Article 171 of the RPC, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 25. Article 171 of the same Act is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br>"ART. 171. <i>Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister</i>. - The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> and a fine not to exceed One million pesos (P1,000,000) shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><blockquote><center>x x x<br></center><br>"4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;<br><br><center>x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br></center></blockquote></blockquote>Section 85 of R.A. No. 10951, which amended Article 315 of the RPC, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 85. Article 315 of the same Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, Presidential Decree No. 1689, and Presidential Decree No. 818, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><br>"ART. 315. <i>Swindling</i> (<i>estafa</i>). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:<br><br><b>"1st. The penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over Two million four hundred thousand pesos (P2,400,000) but does not exceed Four million four hundred thousand pesos (P4,400,000), and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional Two million pesos (P2,000,000); but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <i>prision mayor</i> or <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as the case may be.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>"2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br><br>"(a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Since the crime committed is a complex crime under Article 48 of the RPC the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied in its maximum period. In this case, applying R.A. No. 10951 and considering the amount defrauded is P5,166,539.00, the penalty for Estafa which is <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period is lighter than the penalty for Falsification of Public Documents which is <i>prision mayor</i>.<br><br>Hence, the penalty for Falsification of Public Documents should be imposed in the maximum period, following Article 48 of the RPC. However, the penalty of fine of not more than P5,000.00 under the RPC should be imposed because this is more favorable than the penalty of fine of not more than P1,000,000.00 under R.A. No. 10951.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup><br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the penalty should be within the range of the penalty next lower in degree or <i>prision correccional</i>, and the maximum term should be taken from the maximum period of <i>prision mayor</i> in its maximum period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Thus, an indeterminate penalty of six (6) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to ten (10) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum, is appropriate.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the consolidated petitions for review filed by petitioners Maximo A.
