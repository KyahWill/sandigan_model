Furthermore, the COA Proper is not bound by the results of the Director or LSS' review and is expected to conduct its own independent evaluation.

They were signed by NPAL personnel signifying that they had "[r]eceived the above articles in good order and condition." </p><p> The invoices are <i>actionable documents</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, BPI was required to <em>specifically deny, under oath, their genuineness and due execution</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> However, upon examination, BPI's Answer was not verified nor is there anything on record indicating that BPI made the averments therein under oath. Having failed to provide the requisite<em> specific denial</em>, BPI is deemed to have admitted the documents'<em> genuineness and due execution</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> including the authenticity of the receiving personnel's signatures. </p><p> That NPAL personnel affixed their signatures on the wholesale invoices supports Theo-Pam's claim that: (a) it delivered to NPAL various chemicals, the quantities and prices of which were detailed therein; and (b) NPAL personnel acknowledged and accepted the deliveries. They establish a <em>prima facie</em> case for Theo-Pam, shifting to BPI the burden of disputing the claim. </p><p> <em>Second</em>, even if the Court ignores its flawed manner of contesting Theo-Pam's claim, BPI's defense of non-delivery is inconsistent with the facts in the present case. It appears that BPI <em>repeatedly acknowledged</em> NPAL's receipt and consumption of these chemicals in the following documents: (a) the <em>Memorandum Order No. 34</em> dated June 21, 2010, which formed an Inspection/Verification Team to take a physical inventory "of all chemicals and their empty containers delivered to NPAL on the aforementioned POs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (b) the <em>Team Report </em>dated July 9, 2010, which stated that, based on the Inspection/Verification Team's inquiry, NPAL personnel "confirmed that the subject chemicals were delivered and the same were used and consumed for their operations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (c) the<em> Letter</em> dated July 26, 2010, where BPI sought to clarify the Theo-Pam purchases with the COA Auditor, and, in the process, categorically stated that Theo-Pam delivered the subject chemicals and, in turn, NPAL received and accepted them in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (d) the <em>Inspection Reports</em> prepared by the property officer of BPI's Internal Control Unit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> noting that the deliveries, based on the delivery receipts, were equal to the corresponding POs. </p><p> Parenthetically, it appears that the <em>POs</em> are <em>orders</em> from BPI directing/requesting Theo-Pam to deliver the chemicals enumerated and described thereon. Having been in possession of this order/instruction,<em> Theo-Pam is presumed to have delivered the items accordingly</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Furthermore, procedural rules consider<em> these purchases to have been fair, regular</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> <em>and executed observing the ordinary course of business.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The Court cannot consider BPI's bare allegations of non-delivery sufficient to have overcome these presumptions. </p><p> <em>Third</em>, the<em> NPAL personnels certifications </em>provide a <em>clear categorical admission</em> that Theo-Pam delivered the subject chemicals in accordance with the POs. The personnel acknowledged receipt of these goods, as well as subsequent use and consumption of these items in the course of their operations. </p><p> Certainly, the COA Proper gravely abused its discretion when it brushed aside the above-discussed documents and certifications' veracity on a mere technicality—a procedural lapse not even attributable to the claimant. <i>The deliveries' irregularities do not bar recovery.</i> </p><p> A careful reading of the assailed issuances reveals that while the COA Proper found that NPAL personnel (<i>i.e</i>., German T. Yatco and Noreen D. Escobar) had in fact received the subject chemicals upon delivery,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> it nonetheless invalidated Theo-Pam's Money Claim on the basis of noncompliance with "standard government procurement procedures and x x x internal control on segregation of duties and functions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p> The COA Proper found the following lapses: <em>First</em>, there were no Inspection and Acceptance Reports to support the alleged deliveries. <em>Second</em>, the inspection of the alleged deliveries was not conducted by the authorized property officer. <em>Third</em>, the NPAL personnel who received and inspected the alleged deliveries merely relied on the delivery receipts, in violation of standard government procurement procedures and internal control policies on the proper segregation of duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p><p> The lapses are not disputed. However, the primary responsibility of complying with these procedural requirements rests on BPI and NPAL because these are<em> internal</em> rules. That the BPI Process Flow were internal in nature is evident from the following: (a) it was communicated only through an office memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> addressed to <em>all BPI employees</em>, and (b) none of the steps within the process flow requires a third-party supplier's active participation. </p><p> In other words, BPI/NPAL has no one to blame other than its own personnel if the deliveries' acceptance, inspection, and supporting documentation were not performed as required by its process flow. On the other hand, a third-party supplier's right to recover cannot be conditioned upon strict compliance with these requirements inasmuch as they are <i>strangers</i> to these internal rules. </p><p> Verily, the Government Audit Code mandates complete supporting documentation for all claims against government funds. Unfortunately, the documentary/procedural deficiencies in the present case are attributable to the government's own instrumentality. Thus, the responsible personnel who are found to have been remiss in the performance of their duties must be liable for the consequences. BPI cannot conveniently hold a third party liable for the agency's own procedural oversight and continue to evade payment for goods they received and used. </p><p> To be sure, a government agency's non-compliance with its own internal control procedures does not negate actual delivery and cannot unduly deprive a supplier of its right to collect the amount corresponding to the goods it has delivered. </p><p> <i>Theo-Pam is entitled to attorney's fees.</i> </p><p> Theo-Pam claims that it is entitled to the payment of attorney's fees and litigation expenses amounting to P590,257.75 or 25% of BPI's total outstanding balance, as stipulated on the face of each wholesale invoice, including the appearance fee of P5,000.00 for every court appearance. </p><p> The Court partially agrees with Theo-Pam's contention. </p><p> In the past, the Court has upheld a party's right to recover attorney's fees stipulated in a written agreement, including those imprinted on the face of sales invoices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The wholesale invoices in the present case contain the following statement: </p><blockquote> <p> TERMS: Cash upon presentation of bills unless otherwise stipulated. Interest at 12% per annum will be charge [sic] on all law suits and an additional amount equal to 25% of the total amount due and unpaid for attorney's fee and cost of the litigation will be charged xxx<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The parties' express stipulation on attorney's fees is a <em>penal clause</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, the payment thereof is in the nature of <em>liquidated damages</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> However, the Court finds the rate of 25% excessive. Accordingly, the Court reduces the award to a more reasonable rate of 5%. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
