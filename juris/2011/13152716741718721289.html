During trial, the prosecution offered the oral testimonies of AAA and Dr. Mila Lingan-Simangan. On the other hand, the defense presented as its witnesses the accused himself and Louie Calimag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b>Version of the Prosecution</b><br><br>AAA testified that sometime in 2001, while she was sleeping with her sisters, the accused pulled and positioned her just below the feet of her siblings, and right then and there, succeeded in molesting her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> AAA was just seven (7) years old then.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On June 10, 2003, the accused sexually abused AAA again. While she was sleeping beside her younger sister in their room, accused carried her from the bed through the window and placed her on the floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Afterwards, accused removed his own shirt and used it to cover the mouth of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Accused then removed his underwear and AAA's underwear, and inserted his penis inside AAA's vagina, while telling her not to report the incident to her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> When the accused was finished in satisfying his lust, he put AAA's clothes back on, carried her back to bed, and untied the shirt covering AAA's mouth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The same incident happened on June 11, 2003, when accused carried AAA once again through the window, placed her on the floor, covered her mouth, undressed her, and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The accused also threatened to kill her if she reports the incident to her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>When AAA finally told her mother on June 13, 2003 that she was being abused by her own father, her mother whipped her for not telling her about it immediately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thereafter, they went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) office in Peñablanca, Cagayan, where AAA was interviewed by a certain Ms. Abrena, a DSWD personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Afterwards, they proceeded to the police station where AAA executed a sworn statement narrating what happened. Dr. Mila Lingan-Simangan (Dr. Simangan) also subsequently conducted a physical examination on AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, AAA explained that the reason why it was only on June 13, 2003 that she reported the incidents to her mother was because she was afraid that her father would kill them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> AAA also confirmed that her parents often quarrel and shout at each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> She even admitted that she had seen her father slap her mother and that because of this, she sympathized and took pity on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> When asked whether she would do anything that her mother would tell her to do, AAA answered in the affirmative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, on re-direct examination, AAA clarified that her mother did not teach her to claim that she was raped and that she was only telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Dr. Simangan, the prosecution's other witness, testified that on June 16, 2003, she conducted a physical examination on AAA and discovered that the latter had a healed hymen laceration at 4 and 7 o'clock positions, and that her vagina admitted the tip of the fifth finger easily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> She stated that the laceration could have been caused by a blunt object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; She also testified that after conducting the physical examination, she interviewed AAA and the latter gave her the name of the person who raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, Dr. Simangan admitted that she can no longer remember the name that was mentioned by AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Dr. Simangan also identified the Medico-Legal Report that she prepared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>Version of the Defense</b><br><br>The accused denied the accusation of rape hurled against him and claimed that his wife was the one who initiated the criminal complaint against him because she thinks that he has a mistress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The other defense witness, Louie Calimag (Calimag), testified that from June 3, 2003 until July 8, 2003, he employed the services of the accused to help him in the operation of the chainsaw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> As part of their routine, he and the accused would saw logs in the forest from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., go back to his house, and sleep there at night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Calimag further testified that when the accused was arrested by the police in the forest on July 8, 2003, he was also with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, when he found out that the accused was arrested for rape allegedly committed on June 10 and 11, 2003, Calimag claimed that he did not believe this because the accused stayed in his house on those days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Calimag likewise added that after the accused was arrested, he saw AAA, who admitted to him that she was not raped by the accused and that it was her mother who instructed her to give false information. AAA allegedly told him that her parents had a fight due to her father's illicit relationship with another woman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Calimag admitted that the house of the accused was only three (3) kilometers away from his house and that the accused's house may be reached by jeepney in an hour and by foot in four (4) hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>Between the two versions of the incident, the trial court gave credence to the version of the prosecution and rendered its Decision dated October 24, 2007, finding the accused guilty of three (3) counts of rape. The decretal portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, this Court finds accused JUANITO APATTAD GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape for three (3) counts in Criminal Cases Nos. 10172, 10174 and 10175 and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA for each case. He is further ordered to pay [AAA] the amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand (P150,000.00) Pesos as civil indemnity.<br><br>Accused is acquitted in Criminal Case No. 10173 for lack of sufficient evidence.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On December 19, 2007, accused-appellant filed his <i>Notice of Appeal</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the Decision dated October 24, 2007 rendered by the trial court. On April 15, 2008, the CA, where the case was docketed as CA-G.R. C.R.-H.C. No. 03173, issued a notice to file brief to the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On September 5, 2008, accused-appellant filed his <i>Brief for the Accused-Appellant</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> while the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed its <i>Brief for the Plaintiff-Appellee</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> on March 27, 2009.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>As stated above, the CA, in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated August 28, 2009, affirmed with modification the judgment of conviction by the trial court, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the instant appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>. The assailed Decision of Branch 4 of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City in Criminal Case Nos. 10172, 10174 and 10175 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the civil indemnity awarded should be P75,000.00 for each count of rape. In addition, moral damages and exemplary damages in the amounts of P75,000.00 and Php25,000.00 respectively, for each count of rape are hereby awarded.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On September 22, 2009, accused-appellant filed his <i>Notice of Appeal</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> from the CA Decision dated August 28, 2009.<br><br>In Our Resolution dated October 4, 2010, We notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs. Both parties manifested that they are no longer filing supplemental briefs and they are adopting their respective main briefs before the CA.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Accused-appellant contends in his <i>Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>We sustain accused-appellant's conviction.<br><br><b>Denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses</b><br><br>In his <i>Brief</i>, accused-appellant contends that while, generally, the defense of alibi is frowned upon by the court, it assumes significance when it is corroborated by credible and disinterested witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Accused-appellant claims that Calimag's testimony was categorical, concise and persistent in affirming that he was innocent of the crimes charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Accused-appellant also maintains that although he was not able to adduce any evidence to corroborate his stand that it was his wife, motivated by revenge and anger, who ultimately caused the filing of the criminal charges against him, this should not be entirely taken against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Estoya</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> this Court laid down the jurisprudential guidelines in assessing the proffered defense of alibi. Particularly:<br><br><blockquote>Jurisprudential rules and precepts guide this Court in assessing the proffered defense. <i>One</i>, alibis and denials are generally disfavored by the courts for being weak. <i>Two</i>, they cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrators of the crime. <i>Three</i>, for alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed, but also that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. <i>Fourth</i>, alibi assumes significance or strength only when it is amply corroborated by credible and disinterested witnesses. <i>Fifth</i>, alibi is an issue of fact that hinges on the credibility of witnesses, and the assessment made by the trial court -- unless patently and clearly inconsistent -- must be accepted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Measured against the foregoing yardstick, accused-appellant's defenses of alibi and denial cannot prosper. As mentioned above, alibis and denials are inherently weak defenses. This is understandably so because said defenses can be easily fabricated by an accused in order to escape criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Likewise, it was stated in <i>Estoya</i> that alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime. Notably, these defenses crumble in light of positive identification by truthful witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> An alibi is evidence negative in nature and self-serving, and, thus, cannot attain more credibility than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify on clear and positive evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, AAA positively identified accused-appellant in her testimony as the very perpetrator of the crime of rape committed against her, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0"

crime was committed as he must likewise prove that it was physically impossible for him to be present at the crime scene or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As correctly observed by the trial court, a distance of three (3) kilometers does not make it physically impossible for accused-appellant to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Calimag himself admitted during cross-examination that the house of accused-appellant may be reached by jeepney in an hour. Significantly, even if accused-appellant indeed stayed in Calimag's house on the dates that he committed rape, it was still not physically impossible for accused-appellant to go home and commit the said crime at the time it was said to have been committed.<br><br>Also, alibi assumes significance or strength only when it is amply corroborated by credible and disinterested witnesses. In this regard, it should be noted that alibi becomes unworthy of merit not only because accused-appellant was positively identified by AAA but also in cases where it is established mainly by the accused himself, his relatives, friends and comrades-in-arms,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and not by credible persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Finally, as mentioned in <i>Estoya</i>, alibi is an issue of fact that hinges on the credibility of witnesses, and that the assessment made by the trial court must be accepted unless it is patently and clearly inconsistent.<br><br>Indeed, "it is a hornbook doctrine that the findings of fact of the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed except for strong and valid reasons, because the trial court is in a better position to examine the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In <i>People v. Lusabio, Jr.</i>, this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>All in all, we find the evidence of the prosecution to be more credible than that adduced by accused-appellant. <b>When it comes to credibility, the trial court's assessment deserves great weight, and is even conclusive and binding, if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence.</b> The reason is obvious. <b>Having the full opportunity to observe directly the witnesses' deportment and manner of testifying, the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to evaluate testimonial evidence properly</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Since accused-appellant failed to show any palpable error, arbitrariness, or capriciousness on the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts, these findings deserve great weight and are deemed conclusive and binding.<br><br><b>The guilt of accused-appellant has been</b><br><b>established beyond reasonable doubt</b><br><br>After a careful examination of the records of this case, this Court is satisfied that the prosecution's evidence established the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In reviewing the evidence in rape cases, the following considerations should be made: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with facility, it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Nonetheless, it also bears stressing that rape is essentially committed in relative isolation or secrecy; thus, it is most often only the victim who can testify with regard to the fact of forced coitus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the crime of rape is committed by a man having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (1) through force, threat or intimidation; (2) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; (3) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and (4) when the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Orillosa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this Court held that in incestuous rape of a minor, actual force or intimidation need not be employed where the overpowering moral influence of the father would suffice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Thus, in order for the accused to be found guilty of the crime of statutory rape in this jurisdiction, only two (2) elements must concur: (1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) that the victim is below twelve (12) years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In the present case, it is undisputed that the victim, AAA, was below twelve (12) years old when the crime was committed. A copy of AAA's birth certificate to prove her age was duly presented in evidence by the prosecution, indicating that she was indeed born on October 14, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Concomitantly, AAA was only seven (7) years old when the crime of rape was first committed against her in 2001, and was only nine (9) years old when the accused once again succeeded in committing the same crime in 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Also, it is undisputed that accused-appellant is the father of AAA, as stipulated by the parties during the pre-trial conference and as also indicated in AAA's birth certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Thus, what only remains to be proved is the fact of carnal knowledge by the accused of the victim.<br><br>Verily, the prosecution has sufficiently established the foregoing element, thus proving that accused-appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of rape.<br><br>When AAA was called to the witness stand, she gave a detailed narration of how she was sexually molested by her father, which narration is difficult, if not improbable, for a 10-year-old girl to concoct. As aptly observed by the CA, "[AAA] was able to describe in detail how her father carried her through the window, laid her down the floor, tied her mouth, removed her clothes and inserted his penis inside her vagina. She even described that she felt pain while her father was performing the carnal act against her."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Pertinently, "it is settled jurisprudence that the testimony of a child-victim is given full weight and credence, considering that when a woman, specially a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the fact that AAA's testimony was able to withstand scrutiny during cross-examination bolsters her credibility and makes her statements more credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Further, it should be noted that the findings in the medical examination of Dr. Simangan corroborate the testimony of AAA. In this regard, while a medical examination of the victim is not indispensable in the prosecution of a rape case, and no law requires a medical examination for its successful prosecution, the medical examination conducted and the medical certificate issued are veritable corroborative evidence, which strongly bolster AAA's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In addition, this Court is not convinced that a child of a tender age would concoct a story as sordid as in the instant case due to her mother's alleged ill motive. In <i>People v. Padilla</i>, We held that accused-appellant's imputation of ill motive on the victim's mother for being jealous of another woman is clearly unmeritorious, for no mother in her right mind would possibly wish to stamp her child with the stigma that follows the crime of rape only because she is consumed with hatred and revenge. Specifically:<br><br><blockquote>Appellant, nonetheless, imputes ill-motive on Laiza and her mother Elisa in charging him with rape contending that the latter was jealous when she found that he was courting a woman in their place.<br><br>Again, appellant's excuse is simply too frail to cause resentment and ill will on the part of Laiza and her mother against him. <b>Though one may be consumed with much hatred and revenge, it takes nothing less than psychological depravity for a mother to concoct a story too damaging to the welfare and well-being of her own daughter. Certainly, no mother in her right mind would possibly wish to stamp her child with the stigma that follows a despicable crime of rape.</b> We are convinced that the victim and her mother boldly initiated the present case to seek justice for the abominable act committed by appellant. (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>All told, We accordingly sustain accused-appellant's conviction.<br><br><b>Award of Damages</b><br><br>The Decision of the CA as to the damages awarded must be modified.<br><br>In rape cases, when the victim is under 18 years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law-spouse of the parent of the victim, the imposable penalty is death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> However, with the enactment of Republic Act No. (RA) 9346 or <i>An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines</i>, the imposition of death penalty is now prohibited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> In lieu of the penalty of death, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed when the law violated makes use of the nomenclature of the penalties of the RPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Consequently, courts can no longer impose the penalty of death. Instead, they have to impose <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Nonetheless, the principal consideration for the award of damages is "the penalty provided by law or imposable for the offense because of its heinousness, not the public penalty actually imposed on the offender."<br><br>Pertinently, as early as July 9, 1998, this Court has held that when the circumstances surrounding the crime would justify the imposition of the penalty of death were it not for RA 9346, the award of civil indemnity for the crime of rape should be PhP 75,000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> racionating that "[t]his is not only a reaction to the apathetic societal perception of the penal law and the financial fluctuations over time, but also an expression of the displeasure of the Court over the incidence of heinous crimes against chastity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the award of moral damages in the amount of PhP 75,000 is warranted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> without need of pleading or proving them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In rape cases, it is recognized that the victim's injury is concomitant with and necessarily results from the odious crime of rape to warrant <i>per se</i> the award of moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court also awards exemplary damages in the amount of PhP 30,000, despite the lack of any aggravating circumstances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> to deter others from committing similar acts or for correction for the public good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
