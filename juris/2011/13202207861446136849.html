				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The present administrative matter is based on the following facts:<br><br>On 2 June 2011, Supreme Court Associate Justice and Second Division Chairperson Antonio T.

Puno (Ms. Puno), an Executive Assistant III at the OCC-SD, received the two (2) <i>Agenda</i> on behalf of the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Ms. Puno is the duly designated personnel of the OCC-SD authorized to receive and open the sealed <i>Agenda</i> coming from the Office of Justice Carpio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Promptly, Ms. Puno forwarded both <i>Agenda</i> to Atty. Ma. Luisa L. Laurea (Atty. Laurea)--the Second Division Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Atty. Laurea instructed Ms. Puno to have the <i>Agenda</i> photocopied, beginning with the one for the 30 May 2011 session.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; As is customary, the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> was ordered to be photocopied in two (2) sets: one to serve as a duplicate of Atty. Laurea, while the other as a copy of the Agenda Division of the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The original <i>Agenda</i> will be left with the Minutes Division, which will draft the minutes of the session.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Following the instructions of Atty. Laurea, Ms. Puno gave the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> to Mr. Julius Irving C. Tanael (Mr. Tanael)--a Utility Worker II at the OCC-SD--for photocopying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Mr. Tanael is one of only four personnel in the OCC-SD who are authorized to make photocopies of <i>Agenda</i> with actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Upon completing his task, Mr. Tanael reckoned that the copies of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> were too voluminous to be bound by mere staple wire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, Mr. Tanael gave the finished copies to herein respondent Eddie V. Delgado (Delgado) for stitching.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Upon finishing with the stitching, respondent Delgado returned the two (2) copies of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> to Mr. Tanael.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; In turn, Mr. Tanael gave one copy to the Agenda Division and another copy to Ms. Puno for transmittal to Atty. Laurea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Before Ms. Puno could furnish Atty. Laurea her copy of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i>, however, she caught respondent Delgado acting suspiciously while holding and reading sheets of pink-colored papers, which are similar to that used by the OCC-SD in photocopying <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; She then saw respondent Delgado keep the same sheets inside the drawer of his office desk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>It was at that point that Ms. Puno began to suspect that the sheets held, read and kept by respondent Delgado might have been taken from the copies of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, Ms. Puno at once requested Mr. Tanael to help check whether the pages of the said photocopies were complete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The inspection of the duplicates revealed that one copy of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i>--the one given to the Agenda Division--had missing pages, pages 58, 59 and 70.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Later, Ms. Puno was able to confirm her suspicion as she found two (2) of the missing pages <i>i.e.</i>, pages 58 and 59, hidden below a pile of <i>expediente</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> inside the drawer of respondent Delgado's desk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; She and Mr. Tanael then stapled back the recovered pages 58 and 59, and replaced the still unaccounted page 70 in the copy of the Agenda Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>After office hours, Ms. Puno confided what happened to Ms. Auralyn Veloso (Ms. Veloso) and Atty. Teresita A. Tuazon (Atty. Tuazon).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Ms. Veloso is an Assistant Records Officer in OCC-SD, while Atty. Tuazon is the Assistant Clerk of Court of the Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On 6 June 2011, Atty. Tuazon reported the incident involving the missing pages of a copy of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> to Atty. Laurea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Alarmed, Atty.

Tuazon and Ms. Puno, respondent Delgado candidly admitted during the initial investigation that he took pages 58, 59 and 70 from one of the copies of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; However, respondent Delgado also disclosed that he removed the pages from the subject <i>Agenda</i> only as a favor to herein respondents Joseph Lawrence Madeja (Madeja) and Wilfredo A. Florendo (Florendo).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As it turned out, after respondent Delgado received the copies of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> for stitching, he was approached by respondents Madeja and Florendo who expressed interest on certain items apparently included in the <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Respondents Madeja and Florendo then asked respondent Delgado if he could provide them with a copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent Delgado professed that out of "<i>pakikisama</i>" he removed the would-be missing pages from one of the copies entrusted to him for stitching and gave them to respondents Madeja and Florendo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents Madeja and Florendo, however, would eventually return these pages to respondent Delgado because, purportedly, none of the items about which they were interested was in them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>After hearing the confession and incriminating statements of respondent Delgado, Atty. Laurea called for respondents Madeja and Florendo to join the initial investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>For their part, respondents Madeja and Florendo admitted during the initial investigation that they asked for and, in fact, obtained the missing pages in the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Respondent Madeja even admitted giving his copy of the missing pages to a certain "<i>Dading</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Dading</i> was later identified to be Melquiades S.

Laurea and Atty. Tuazon prepared a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> summarizing the statements made by the respondents during the course of the investigation.&nbsp; This Memorandum was then submitted to Justice Carpio, as Chairman of this Court's Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><center><u>Formal Investigation</u><br></center><br>On 8 June 2011, this Court, through its Second Division, issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> treating the Memorandum submitted by Atty.

In sum, it considered respondent Delgado guilty of <b>Grave Misconduct</b> for his unauthorized removal of pages 58, 59 and 70 in a copy of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; The OAS also found respondents Madeja and Florendo guilty of <b>Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service</b>, for their participation in the unauthorized removal of the said pages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Thus, following the <i>Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the OAS made the following recommendations:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>that Eddie V.

The denial of respondents Madeja and Florendo, in a complete turnaround from an earlier admission, is unavailing as against the positive, straightforward and consistent statements of respondent Delgado.<br><br><i>First</i>. Respondent Delgado's statements, not only in the initial investigation but also in the formal investigation, were unwavering in their implication of respondents Madeja and Florendo.&nbsp; <b>Respondent Delgado categorically identified respondents Madeja and Florendo as the persons who induced him to remove several pages from a copy of the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda </i>and thereafter obtained them</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, as respondent Delgado relates during the formal investigation:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Itong nangyaring insidente noong June 2, 2011, ano ang naging&nbsp; partisipasyon mo dito?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ganito po ang pangyayari, kasi po <b>lumapit sa akin ang kasama ko</b>.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinong kasama mo?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Si <b>Florendo at si Madeja</b>.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Willie Florendo at si.....?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Madeja.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nung time pong `yun wala naman pong .....&nbsp; kasi po pinatahi lang sa akin `yun.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ang alin?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yung agenda po.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pinatahi sa `yo `yung agenda?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opo.<br><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pagkatapos?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wala po sa loob ko.&nbsp; Tinanong nila ako kung nand'yan pa ang agenda, sabi ko, "Ganun, ganun."&nbsp; Yung May 30, "Tingnan mo nga kung and'yan `yung item ganun.&nbsp; Wala naman sa akin," sabi ko, "Andito," sabi ko.&nbsp; "Bigyan mo nga ako," sabing ganun.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Paano mong ginawa `yung pagbibigay ng copy ng agenda kina Madeja?</b><br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Tiningnan ko lang po `yun kung anong item tapos inabot ko lang sa kanila</b>.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Yung items na `yun ay nakapaloob dito sa pages 58, 59 and 70 at'yun ang binigay mo sa kanila?</b><br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Opo</b>.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kung ang nawawalang pages ay tatlo, ibig mong sabihin, tatlo din ang tinanggal?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, Ma'am, `yung hiningi po ni Joseph Madeja, mali ang item na naibigay ko sa kanya.&nbsp; Hindi niya na po naibalik sa akin inilagay lang niya dun sa mga scratch ko.

It was never shown that respondent Delgado was motivated by any ill will in implicating respondents Madeja and Florendo. As a witness, the credibility of respondent Delgado remained unsullied. We find his statements worthy of belief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>.&nbsp; The unsubstantiated denial of respondents, therefore, falters in light of the direct and positive statements of respondent Delgado. The basic principle in Evidence is that denials, unless supported by clear and convincing evidence, cannot prevail over the affirmative testimony of truthful witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><u><i>Respondent's Administrative Liability</i></u><br><br>Having established the involvement of each respondent in the removal of the pages of the subject <i>Agenda</i>, We next determine their administrative culpability.<br><br>We lay first the premises:<br><br><ol><li>As stated beforehand, the 30 May 2011 <i>Agenda</i> contain an itemized list of cases taken up by the Court's Second Division during the sessions held on the concerned date and the handwritten marginal notes of Justice Carpio noting the specific actions adopted by the division on each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; Under Rule 11, Section 5 of the <i>Internal Rules of the Supreme Court</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> such a document is considered confidential.<br><br></li><li>Owing to the confidential nature of the contents of an <i>Agenda</i>, the OCC-SD follows a very strict procedure in handling them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, as can be gathered from the factual narration, only a few specified personnel within the OCC-SD are authorized to have access to an <i>Agenda</i> - <i>e.g.</i>, only Ms. Puno is authorized to receive and open; only four (4) persons are authorized to photocopy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br></li><li>None of the respondents is entitled to a copy of an <i>Agenda</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; None of them has any authority to be informed of the contents of an <i>Agenda</i>, much less to obtain a page therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><ol type="a"><li>Respondent Delgado holds a casual appointment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> as a Utility Worker II in the OCC-SD.&nbsp; His primary work in the said office is to stitch pleadings, records and other court documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br></li><li>Respondent Madeja holds a permanent appointment as Clerk IV in the OCC-SD.

As to their liability, therefore, Respondents Madeja and Floredo must stand in equal footing with respondent Delgado.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>.&nbsp; This Court had already held that the conduct and behavior of all officials and employees of an office involved in the administration of justice, from the highest judicial official to the lowest personnel, requires them to live up to the strictest standard of honesty, integrity and uprightness in order to maintain public confidence in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>&nbsp; Court employees, as the <i>Code of Conduct for Court Personnel</i> puts it, "serve as sentinels of justice" and "any act of impropriety on their part immeasurably affects the honor and dignity of the Judiciary and the people's confidence in it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the respondents palpably failed to meet the high standard expected from them as court employees.&nbsp; Their conduct is neither excusable nor tolerable.&nbsp; The respondents, through their acts, have proven themselves to be unfit for continued employment in the judiciary.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing premises, the respondents Eddie V.
