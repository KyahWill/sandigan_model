Mendoza, supra, the Supreme Court restated the doctrine that habeas corpus may not be used as a means of obtaining evidence on the whereabouts of a person, or as a means of finding out who has specifically abducted or caused the disappearance of a certain person.&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus the appellate court disposed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition for habeas corpus is hereby DISMISSED, there being no strong evidence that the missing persons are in the custody of the respondents.<br><br>The Court, however, further resolves to <u><b>refer the case</b> to the Commission on Human Rights, the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police for separate investigations and appropriate actions</u> as may be warranted by their findings and to <b><u>furnish the Court with their separate reports</u></b> on the outcome of their investigations and the actions taken thereon.<br><br>Let copies of this decision be furnished the Commission on Human Rights, the National Bureau of Investigation and the Philippine National Police for their appropriate actions.<br><br>SO ORDERED.&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioners in CA-G.R. SP No. 95303 moved for a reconsideration of the appellate court's decision.&nbsp; They also moved to present newly discovered evidence consisting of the testimonies of Adoracion Paulino, Sherlyn's mother-in-law who was allegedly threatened by soldiers; and Raymond Manalo who allegedly met Sherlyn, Karen and Merino in the course of his detention at a military camp.<br><br>During the pendency of the motion for reconsideration in CA-G.R. SP No. 95303, Erlinda Cadapan and Concepcion Empeño filed before this Court a Petition for Writ of <i>Amparo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> With Prayers for Inspection of Place and Production of Documents dated October 24, 2007, docketed as <b>G.R.

Eduardo Boyles Davalan</b>, the then chief of staff of the First Scout Ranger Regiment in Camp Tecson, testified that the camp is not a detention facility, nor does it conduct military operations as it only serves as a training facility for scout rangers.

In the absence of confirmatory proof, however, the Court will presume that he is still alive.<br><br><b><u>The testimony of Raymond Manalo can no longer be ignored and brushed aside</u></b>. His narration and those of the earlier witnesses, taken together, constitute more than substantial evidence warranting an order that the three be released from detention if they are not being held for a lawful cause.&nbsp; They may be moved from place to place but still they are considered under detention and custody of the respondents.<br><br><b><u>His testimony was clear, consistent and convincing</u></b>. x x x.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The additional testimonies of Lt.

(italic in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Meanwhile, in the <i>amparo</i> case, the appellate court deemed it a superfluity to issue any inspection order or production order in light of the release order.&nbsp; As it earlier ruled in the <i>habeas corpus</i> case, it found that the three detainees' right to life, liberty and security was being violated, hence, the need to immediately release them, or cause their release.&nbsp; The appellate court went on to direct the PNP to proceed further with its investigation since there were enough leads as indicated in the records to ascertain the truth and file the appropriate charges against those responsible for the abduction and detention of the three.<br><br>Lt.

Boac, et al. contend that the appellate court erred in giving full credence to the testimony of Manalo who could not even accurately describe the structures of Camp Tecson where he claimed to have been detained along with Sherlyn, Karen and Merino.&nbsp; They underscore that Camp Tecson is not under the jurisdiction of the 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry Batallion and that Manalo's testimony is incredible and full of inconsistencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In <i>Secretary of National Defense v.

Col. Jimenez to be the "Division Training Unit," firms up respondents' story that they were detained for some time in said military facility.&nbsp; (citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>On Manalo's having allegedly encountered Sherlyn, Karen and Merino while on detention, the Court in the immediately cited case synthesized his tale as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The next day, Raymond's chains were removed and he was ordered to clean outside the barracks.&nbsp; It was then he learned that he was in a detachment of the Rangers. There were many soldiers, hundreds of them were training.&nbsp; He was also ordered to clean inside the barracks.&nbsp; <b><u>In one of the rooms therein, he met Sherlyn Cadapan from Laguna.</u></b>&nbsp; She told him that she was a student of the University of the Philippines and was abducted in Hagonoy, Bulacan. She confided that she had been subjected to severe torture and raped.&nbsp; She was crying and longing to go home and be with her parents.&nbsp; During the day, her chains were removed and she was made to do the laundry.<br><br>After a week, Reynaldo was also brought to Camp Tecson.&nbsp; <b><u>Two days from his arrival, two other captives, Karen Empeño and Manuel Merino, arrived</u></b>.&nbsp; Karen and Manuel were put in the room with "Allan" whose name they later came to know as Donald Caigas, called "master" or "commander" by his men in the 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry Battalion.&nbsp; Raymond and Reynaldo were put in the adjoining room.&nbsp; At times, Raymond and Reynaldo were threatened, and Reynaldo was beaten up.&nbsp; In the daytime, their chains were removed, but were put back on at night.&nbsp; They were threatened that if they escaped, their families would all be killed.<br><br>On or about October 6, 2006, Hilario arrived in Camp Tecson.&nbsp; He told the detainees that they should be thankful they were still alive and should continue along their "renewed life."&nbsp; Before the hearing of November 6 or 8, 2006, respondents were brought to their parents to instruct them not to attend the hearing.&nbsp; However, their parents had already left for Manila.&nbsp; Respondents were brought back to Camp Tecson.&nbsp; They stayed in that camp from September 2006 to November 2006, and Raymond was instructed to continue using the name "Oscar" and holding himself out as a military trainee. He got acquainted with soldiers of the 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry Battalion whose names and descriptions he stated in his affidavit.<br><br><b><u>On November 22, 2006, respondents, along with Sherlyn, Karen, and Manuel, were transferred to a camp of the 24<sup>th</sup> Infantry Battalion in Limay, Bataan</u></b>.&nbsp; There were many huts in the camp.&nbsp; They stayed in that camp until May 8, 2007.&nbsp; Some soldiers of the battalion stayed with them.&nbsp; While there, battalion soldiers whom Raymond knew as "Mar" and "Billy" beat him up and hit him in the stomach with their guns.&nbsp; Sherlyn and Karen also suffered enormous torture in the camp.&nbsp; They were all made to clean, cook, and help in raising livestock.<br><br>Raymond recalled that when "Operation Lubog" was launched, Caigas and some other soldiers brought him and Manuel with them to take and kill all sympathizers of the NPA.&nbsp; They were brought to Barangay Bayan-bayanan, Bataan where he witnessed the killing of an old man doing <i>kaingin</i>.&nbsp; The soldiers said he was killed because he had a son who was a member of the NPA and he coddled NPA members in his house. Another time, in another "Operation Lubog," Raymond was brought to Barangay Orion in a house where NPA men stayed. When they arrived, only the old man of the house who was sick was there.&nbsp; They spared him and killed only his son right before Raymond's eyes.<br><br><b><u>From Limay, Raymond, Reynaldo, Sherlyn, Karen, and Manuel were transferred to Zambales, in a safehouse near the sea.</u> </b> Caigas and some of his men stayed with them.&nbsp; A retired army soldier was in charge of the house.&nbsp; Like in Limay, the five detainees were made to do errands and chores.&nbsp; They stayed in Zambales from May 8 or 9, 2007 until June 2007.<br><br><b><u>In June 2007, Caigas brought the five back to the camp in Limay.&nbsp; Raymond, Reynaldo, and Manuel were tasked to bring food to detainees brought to the camp</u></b>.&nbsp; Raymond narrated what he witnessed and experienced in the camp, <i>viz</i>:<br><br>x x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The Court takes judicial notice of its Decision in the just cited <i>Secretary of National Defense v.

Col. Boac, et al. thus crumbles.<br><br>Petitioners go on to point out that the assailed Decision of the appellate court is "vague and incongruent with [its] findings" for, so they contend, while the appellate court referred to the perpetrators as "misguided and self-righteous civilian and military elements of the 7<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division," it failed to identify who these perpetrators are.&nbsp; Moreover, petitioners assert that Donald Caigas and Arnel Enriquez are not members of the AFP.&nbsp; They furthermore point out that their co-petitioners Generals Esperon, Tolentino and Palparan have already retired from the service and thus have no more control of any military camp or base in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>There is nothing vague and/or incongruent about the categorical order of the appellate court for petitioners to release Sherlyn, Karen and Merino.&nbsp; In its discourse, the appellate court merely referred to "a few misguided self-righteous people who resort to the extrajudicial process of neutralizing those who disagree with the country's democratic system of government."&nbsp; Nowhere did it specifically refer to the members of the 7<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division as the "misguided self-righteous" ones.<br><br>Petitioners finally point out that the parents of Sherlyn and Karen do not have the requisite standing to file the <i>amparo</i> petition on behalf of Merino.&nbsp; They call attention to the fact that in the <i>amparo</i> petition, the parents of Sherlyn and Karen merely indicated that they were "concerned with Manuel Merino" as basis for filing the petition on his behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Section 2 of the <i>Rule on the Writ of Amparo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><i> </i>provides:<br><br><blockquote>The petition may be filed by the aggrieved party or by any qualified person or entity in the following order:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; Any member of the immediate family, namely: the spouse, children and parents of the aggrieved party;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; Any ascendant, descendant or collateral relative of the aggrieved party within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity, in default of those mentioned in the preceding paragraph; or<br><br>(c) <b>Any concerned citizen, organization, association or institution, <u>if there is no known member of the immediate family or relative of the aggrieved party</u></b>.</blockquote><br>Indeed, the parents of Sherlyn and Karen failed to allege that there were no known members of the immediate family or relatives of Merino.&nbsp; The exclusive and successive order mandated by the above-quoted provision must be followed.&nbsp; The order of priority is not without reason--"to prevent the indiscriminate and groundless filing of petitions for <i>amparo</i> which may even prejudice the right to life, liberty or security of the aggrieved party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court notes that the parents of Sherlyn and Karen also filed the petition for <i>habeas corpus </i>on Merino's behalf.

Furthermore, it is important that he be freed from any form of harassment, hindrance or distraction to enable him to fully attend to the performance of his official duties and functions.

Macapagal Arroyo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> expounded on the concept of command responsibility as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The evolution of the command responsibility doctrine finds its context in the development of laws of war and armed combats. According to Fr. Bernas, "<u>command responsibility," in its simplest terms, means the "responsibility of commanders for crimes committed by subordinate members of the armed forces or other persons subject to their control in international wars or domestic conflict</u>."&nbsp; In this sense, command responsibility is properly a form of criminal complicity. The Hague Conventions of 1907 adopted the doctrine of command responsibility, foreshadowing the present-day precept of holding a superior accountable for the atrocities committed by his subordinates should he be remiss in his duty of control over them. As then formulated, command responsibility is "<b>an omission mode of individual criminal liability</b>," whereby the superior is made responsible for <b>crimes committed</b> by his subordinates for failing to prevent or punish the perpetrators (as opposed to crimes he ordered). (citations omitted; emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It bears stressing that command responsibility is properly a form of criminal complicity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and thus a substantive rule that points to criminal or administrative liability.<br><br>An <i>amparo</i> proceeding is not criminal in nature nor does it ascertain the criminal liability of individuals or entities involved.&nbsp; Neither does it partake of a civil or administrative suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Rather, it is a <i>remedial </i>measure designed to direct specified courses of action to government agencies to safeguard the constitutional right to life, liberty and security of aggrieved individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Thus<i> Razon Jr. v. Tagitis </i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><i> </i>enlightens:<br><br><blockquote>[An amparo proceeding] does nor determine guilt nor pinpoint criminal culpability for the disappearance [threats thereof or extrajudicial killings]; <b><u>it determines responsibility, or at least accountability</u></b>, for the enforced disappearance...for purposes of imposing the appropriate remedies to address the disappearance...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Further, <i>Tagitis </i>defines what constitutes "responsibility" and "accountability," <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x.<b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responsibility </span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">refers to the extent the actors have been established by substantial evidence to have participated in whatever way, by action or omission, in an enforced disappearance, as a measure of the remedies this Court shall craft, among them, the directive to file the appropriate criminal and civil cases against the responsible parties in the proper courts. </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Accountability</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, on the other hand, refers to the measure of remedies that should be addressed to those who exhibited involvement in the enforced disappearance without bringing the level of their complicity to the level of responsibility defined above; or who are imputed with knowledge relating to the enforced disappearance and who carry the burden of disclosure; or those who carry, but have failed to discharge, the burden of extraordinary diligence in the investigation of the enforced disappearance</span>. In all these cases, the issuance of the Writ of <i>Amparo </i>is justified by our primary goal of addressing the disappearance, so that the life of the victim is preserved and his liberty and security are restored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br><i>Rubrico</i> categorically denies the application of command responsibility in <i>amparo</i> cases to determine <i>criminal liability</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; The Court maintains its adherence to this pronouncement as far as <i>amparo</i> cases are concerned.<br><br><i>Rubrico</i>, however, recognizes a preliminary yet limited application of command responsibility in <i>amparo</i> cases to instances of determining the <i>responsible</i> or <i>accountable </i>individuals or entities that are duty-bound to abate any transgression on the life, liberty or security of the aggrieved party.<br><br><blockquote>If command responsibility were to be invoked and applied to these proceedings, it should, at most, be only <b><u>to determine the author</u> who, at the first instance, is accountable for, and has the duty to address, the disappearance and harassments complained of, so as <u>to enable the Court to devise remedial measures that may be appropriate under the</u></b><u> <b>premises</b></u><b> to protect rights covered by the writ of amparo.</b> As intimated earlier, however, the determination should not be pursued to fix criminal liability on respondents preparatory to criminal prosecution, or as a prelude to administrative disciplinary proceedings under existing administrative issuances, if there be any.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In other words, command responsibility may be loosely applied in <i>amparo </i>cases in order <b>to identify</b> those accountable individuals that have the power to effectively implement whatever processes an <i>amparo</i> court would issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; In such application, the <i>amparo</i> court does not impute criminal responsibility but merely pinpoint the superiors it considers to be in the best position to protect the rights of the aggrieved party.<br><br>Such identification of the responsible and accountable superiors may well be a preliminary determination of criminal liability which, of course, is still subject to further investigation by the appropriate government agency.<br><br>Relatedly, the legislature came up with Republic Act No. 9851<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (RA 9851) to include command responsibility as a form of criminal complicity in crimes against international humanitarian law, genocide and other crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; RA 9851 is thus the substantive law that definitively imputes criminal liability to those superiors who, despite their position, still fail to take all necessary and reasonable measures within their power to prevent or repress the commission of illegal acts or to submit these matters to the competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.<br><br>The Court finds that the appellate court erred when it did not specifically name the respondents that it found to be responsible for the abduction and continued detention of Sherlyn, Karen and Merino. For, from the records, it appears that the responsible and accountable individuals are <u>Lt. Col. Anotado, Lt. Mirabelle, Gen. Palparan, Lt. Col. Boac, Arnel Enriquez and Donald Caigas.</u> They should thus be made to comply with the September 17, 2008 Decision of the appellate court to IMMEDIATELY RELEASE Sherlyn, Karen and Merino.<br><br>The petitions against Generals Esperon, Razon and Tolentino should be dismissed for lack of merit as there is no showing that they were even remotely accountable and responsible for the abduction and continued detention of Sherlyn, Karen and Merino.<br><br><u><b>G.R. No. 187109. </b></u><br><br>Contrary to the ruling of the appellate court, there is no need to file a motion for execution for an <i>amparo</i> or <i>habeas corpus</i> decision. Since the right to life, liberty and security of a person is at stake, the proceedings should not be delayed and execution of any decision thereon must be expedited as soon as possible since any form of delay, even for a day, may jeopardize the very rights that these writs seek to immediately protect.<br><br>The Solicitor General's argument that the Rules of Court supplement the Rule on the Writ of Amparo is misplaced.&nbsp; The Rules of Court only find suppletory application in an <i>amparo</i> proceeding if the Rules strengthen, rather than weaken, the procedural efficacy of the writ.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is, the Rule dispenses with dilatory motions in view of the urgency in securing the life, liberty or security of the aggrieved party.&nbsp; Suffice it to state that a motion for execution is inconsistent with the extraordinary and expeditious remedy being offered by an <i>amparo </i>proceeding.<br><br>In fine, the appellate court erred in ruling that its directive to <i>immediately</i> release Sherlyn, Karen and Merino was not automatically executory.&nbsp; For that would defeat the very purpose of having summary proceedings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> in <i>amparo</i> petitions.&nbsp; Summary proceedings, it bears emphasis, are immediately executory without prejudice to further appeals that may be taken therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing discussions, the Court renders the following judgment:<br><br>1.
