No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Not satisfied, Jesus is now before this Court <i>via</i> a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br><blockquote>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FINALITY OF THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION OF OCTOBER 27, 1999, AS WELL AS THE ORDERS OF SEPTEMBER 6, 2002 AND OCTOBER 2, 2003, THE LEGAL ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED IN THIS CASE IS WHETHER X X X [DESPITE] THE ABSENCE OF A SPECIFIC AMOUNT IN THE DECISION REPRESENTING RESPONDENT'S COUNTERCLAIM, THE SAME COULD BE VALIDLY [OFFSET] AGAINST THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF AWARD MENTIONED IN THE DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONER. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Jesus contends that the trial court grievously erred in ordering the implementation of the RTC's October 27, 1999 Decision considering that same does fix the amount of attorney's fees.&nbsp; According to Jesus, such disposition leaves the matter of computation of the attorney's fees uncertain and, hence, the writ of execution cannot be implemented.&nbsp; In this regard, Jesus points out that not even the Sheriff who will implement said Decision can compute the judgment awards.&nbsp; Besides, a sheriff is not clothed with the authority to render judicial functions such as the computation of specific amounts of judgment awards.<br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Vicente counter-argues that the October 27, 1999 RTC Decision can no longer be made subject of review, either by way of an appeal or by way of a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>because it had already attained finality when after its promulgation, Jesus did not even file a motion for reconsideration thereof or interpose an appeal thereto.&nbsp; In fact, it was Vicente who actually filed a motion for reconsideration and a notice of appeal, which was eventually denied and disapproved by the trial court.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>The October 27, 1999 Decision of the RTC<br>is already final and executory, hence, immutable.</i><br><br>At the outset, it should be stressed that the October 27, 1999 Decision of the RTC is already final and executory. Hence, it can no longer be the subject of an appeal.&nbsp; Consequently, Jesus is bound by the decision and can no longer impugn the same. Indeed, well-settled is the rule that a decision that has attained finality can no longer be modified even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law. The doctrine of finality of judgment is explained in <i>Gallardo-Corro v. Gallardo</i>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Nothing is more settled in law than that once a judgment attains finality it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable. It may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land. Just as the losing party has the right to file an appeal within the prescribed period, the winning party also has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the resolution of his case. The doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice, and that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments or orders of courts must become final at some definite time fixed by law; otherwise, there would be no end to litigations, thus setting to naught the main role of courts of justice which is to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the maintenance of peace and order by settling justiciable controversies with finality. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To stress, the October 27, 1999 Decision of the RTC has already attained finality. "Such definitive judgment is no longer subject to change, revision, amendment or reversal.&nbsp; Upon finality of the judgment, the Court loses its jurisdiction to amend, modify or alter the same.&nbsp; Except for correction of clerical errors or the making of <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, or where the judgment is void, the judgment can neither be amended nor altered after it has become final and executory. This is the principle of immutability of final judgment." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><i>The amount of attorney's fees is <br>ascertainable from the RTC Decision. <br>Thus, compensation is possible.</i><br><br>Jesus contends that offsetting cannot be made because the October 27, 1999 judgment of the RTC failed to specify the amount of attorney's fees. He maintains that for offsetting to apply, the two debts must be liquidated or ascertainable.&nbsp; However, the trial court merely awarded to Vicente attorney's fees based on <i>quantum</i> <i>meruit</i> without specifying the exact amount thereof.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>For legal compensation to take place, the requirements set forth in Articles 1278 and 1279 of the Civil Code, quoted below, must be present.<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1278.&nbsp; Compensation shall take place when two persons, in their own right, are creditors and debtors of each other.<br><br>ARTICLE 1279.&nbsp; In order that compensation may be proper, it is necessary:<br><br>(1) That each one of the obligors be bound principally, and that he be at the same time a principal creditor of the other;<br><br>(2) That both debts consist in a sum of money, or if the things due are consumable, they be of the same kind, and also of the same quality if the latter has been stated;<br><br>(3) That the two debts be due;<br><br>(4) That they be liquidated and demandable;<br><br>(5) That over neither of them there be any retention or controversy, commenced by third persons and communicated in due time to the debtor.<br></blockquote><br>"A debt is liquidated when its existence and amount are determined.&nbsp; It is not necessary that it be admitted by the debtor.&nbsp; Nor is it necessary that the credit appear in a final judgment in order that it can be considered as liquidated; it is enough that its exact amount is known.&nbsp; And a debt is considered liquidated, not only when it is expressed already in definite figures which do not require verification, but also when the determination of the exact amount depends only on a simple arithmetical operation x x x." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In <i>Lao v. Special Plans, Inc.,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>When the defendant, who has an unliquidated claim, sets it up by way of counterclaim, and a judgment is rendered liquidating such claim, it can be compensated against the plaintiff's claim from the moment it is liquidated by judgment. We have restated this in <i>Solinap v. Hon. Del Rosario</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> where we held that compensation takes place only if both obligations are liquidated.</blockquote><br>In the instant case, both obligations are liquidated. Vicente has the obligation to pay his debt due to Jesus in the amount of P300,000.00 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum counted from the filing of the instant complaint on August 17, 1993 until fully paid.&nbsp; Jesus, on the other hand, has the obligation to pay attorney's fees which the RTC had already determined to be equivalent to whatever amount recoverable from Vicente. The said attorney's fees were awarded by the RTC on the counterclaim of Vicente on the basis of "<i>quantum meruit</i>" for the legal services he previously rendered to Jesus.<br><br>In its Decision, the trial court elucidated on how Vicente had established his entitlement for attorney's fees based on his counterclaim in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>Defendant, on his counterclaim, has established the existence of a lawyer-client relationship between him and plaintiff and this was admitted by the latter. Defendant had represented plaintiff in several court cases which include the Laguna property case, the various cases filed by Atty. Romulo Reyes against plaintiff such as the falsification and libel cases and the disbarment case filed by plaintiff against Atty. Romulo Reyes before the Commission on Bar Integration. Aside from these cases, plaintiff had made defendant his consultant on almost everything that involved legal opinions.<br><br>More particularly in the Calamba, Laguna land case alone, plaintiff had agreed to pay defendant a contingent fee of 25% of the value of the property for the latter's legal services as embodied in the Amended Complaint signed and verified by plaintiff (Exh. 5). Aside from this contingent fee, defendant had likewise told plaintiff that his usual acceptance fee for a case like the Laguna land case is P200,000.00 and his appearance fee at that time was x x x P2,000.00 per appearance but still plaintiff paid nothing.<br><br>The lawyer-client relationship between the parties was severed because of the instant case. The court is however fully aware of defendant's stature in life - a UP law graduate, Bar topnotcher in 1957 bar examination, former Senior Provincial Board Member, Vice-Governor and Governor of the province of Pangasinan, later as Assemblyman of the Batasang Pambansa and is considered a prominent trial lawyer since 1958. For all his legal services rendered to plaintiff, defendant deserves to be compensated at least on a "quantum meruit" basis. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>The above discussion in the RTC Decision was then immediately followed by the dispositive portion, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises above-considered, JUDGMENT is hereby rendered ordering defendant Vicente D. Millora to pay plaintiff Jesus M. Montemayor the sum of P300.000.00 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum counted from the filing of the instant complaint on August 17, 1993 until fully paid and <b>whatever amount recoverable from defendant shall be set off by an equivalent amount awarded by the court on the counterclaim representing attorney's fees of defendant</b> on the basis of "quantum meruit" for legal services previously rendered to plaintiff.<br><br>No pronouncement as to attorney's fees and costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>It is therefore clear that in the execution of the RTC Decision, there are two parts to be executed. The first part is the computation of the amount due to Jesus. This is achieved by doing a simple arithmetical operation at the time of execution. The principal amount of P300,000.00 is to be multiplied by the interest rate of 12%.&nbsp; The product is then multiplied by the number of years that had lapsed from the filing of the complaint on August 17, 1993 up to the date when the judgment is to be executed.&nbsp; The result thereof plus the principal of P300,000.00 is the total amount that Vicente must pay Jesus.<br><br>The second part is the payment of attorney's fees to Vicente. This is achieved by following the clear wordings of the above <i>fallo </i>of the RTC Decision which provides that Vicente is entitled to attorney's fees which is equivalent to whatever amount recoverable from him by Jesus. Therefore, whatever amount due to Jesus as payment of Vicente's debt is equivalent to the amount awarded to the latter as his attorney's fees. Legal compensation or set-off then takes place between Jesus and Vicente and both parties are on even terms such that there is actually nothing left to execute and satisfy in favor of either party.<br><br>In fact, the RTC, in addressing Jesus' Motion for Reconsideration and Clarification dated July 12, 2000 had already succinctly explained this matter in its Order dated September 6, 2002, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Notwithstanding the tenor of the said portion of the judgment, still, there is nothing to execute and satisfy in favor of either of the herein protagonists because the said decision also states clearly that "<b>whatever amount recoverable from defendant shall be SET-OFF by an equivalent amount awarded by the Court on the counterclaim representing attorney's fees of defendant on the basis of "<i>quantum meruit</i>" for legal services previously rendered to plaintiff" </b>x x x.<br><br>Said dispositive portion of the decision is free from any ambiguity. It unequivocably ordered that any amount due in favor of plaintiff and against defendant is set off by an equivalent amount awarded to defendant in the form of counterclaims representing attorney's fees for past legal services he rendered to plaintiff.<br><br>It will be an exercise in futility and a waste of so precious time and unnecessary effort to enforce satisfaction of the plaintiff's claims against defendant, and vice versa because there is in fact a setting off of each other's claims and liabilities under the said judgment which has long become final. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote><br>A reading of the dispositive portion of the RTC Decision would clearly show that no ambiguity of any kind exists. Furthermore, if indeed there is any ambiguity in the dispositive portion as claimed by Jesus, the RTC had already clarified it through its Order dated September 6, 2002 by categorically stating that the attorney's fees awarded in the counterclaim of Vicente is of an amount equivalent to whatever amount recoverable from him by Jesus.&nbsp; This clarification is not an amendment, modification, correction or alteration to an already final decision as it is conceded that such cannot be done anymore.&nbsp; What the RTC simply did was to state in categorical terms what it obviously meant in its decision.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that the dispositive portion of the decision is clear and unequivocal such that a reading of it can lead to no other conclusion, that is, any amount due in favor of Jesus and against Vicente is set off by an equivalent amount in the form of Vicente's attorney's fees for past legal services he rendered for Jesus.<br><br><b>&nbsp; WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 19, 2005 in CA-G.R.
