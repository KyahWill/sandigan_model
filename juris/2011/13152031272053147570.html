				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Compliance with the mandatory reporting requirements for the claim of disability benefits and sickness allowance under the <i>Philippine Overseas Employment Administration</i> <i>Standard Employment Contract Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Vessels </i>(POEA-SEC) is central to this Rule 45 petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, primarily assailing the 29 August 2008 Decision rendered by the then Seventh Division of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 90298,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted.&nbsp; The Resolutions dated June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004 of public respondent NLRC are set aside.&nbsp; Accordingly, private respondents [Coastal Safeway Marine Services, Inc., Benedicto C. Morcilla and Canada and Middle East General Trading] are ordered to pay petitioner [Elmer T. Esguerra], jointly and solidarily, his sickness allowance of US$3,200.00 and disability benefits of US$20,900.00 which may be paid in Philippine Currency equivalent to the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Facts</i></b><br></center><br>A seafarer since 1991, respondent Elmer T. Esguerra (Esguerra) applied for placement with petitioner Coastal Safeway Marine Services, Inc. (CSMSI) sometime in 2003.&nbsp; Found fit for work during the pre-employment medical examination conducted by the company-designated physician,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Esguerra was hired by the CSMSI as Third Mate for the M/V Mr. Nelson, an ocean-going vessel under the flag of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) owned by its foreign principal, Canada &amp; Middle East General Trading (CMEGT).&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of the POEA-SEC, the contract of employment executed by the parties on 9 May 2003 provided a term of one (1) year and a basic monthly salary of US$800.00 for a 48-hour work-week, with provisions for overtime pay and vacation leave with pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Rather than the aforesaid vessel, however, it appears that, on 13 May 2003, Esguerra, as Second Officer, eventually boarded the vessel M/V Gondwana which was likewise manned by CSMSI on behalf of Nabeel Shipmanagement Ltd. Fze. (NSLF).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On 28 June 2003 or after forty six (46) days of shipboard employment, Esguerra requested medical attention for back and chest pains while M/V Gondwana was docked at Port Jebel Ali, UAE.&nbsp; Examined on 5 July 2003 at the Jebel Ali Medical Centre, Esguerra was declared "not fit for work until complete cardiac evaluation is done" and "advised to rest until then" by Dr. Zarga S. Tulmar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Despite the normal results of the serology, hematology, biochemistry and x-ray tests administered upon him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> however, Esguerra insisted on going home on the ground that he had been rendered unfit for work.&nbsp; Alleging that he had yet to receive his salary for June 2003 and that his employer was making him shoulder his repatriation expenses as a consequence of his failure to finish his contract, Esguerra also sought assistance from the Jebel Ali police/coastguard regarding his predicament.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Subsequent to his arrival in the Philippines on 7 July 2003, Esguerra went to the Philippine Heart Center (PHC), the Philippine Orthopedic Hospital (POH) and the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) for medical evaluation and treatment.<br><br>Having consulted with Dr. Efren R. Vicaldo, a Doctor of Internal Medicine and Cardiology at the PHC as well as Dr. Rimando C. Saguin, an Orthopedic Surgeon at the POH, Esguerra further underwent diagnostic tests and was prescribed various medications at the PGH for "chronic stable angina."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; On 16 July 2003, Esguerra filed against CSMSI, its president, Benedicto C. Morcilla (Morcilla), and CMEGT, the complaint for medical reimbursement, sickness allowance, permanent disability benefits, damages and attorney's fees which was docketed as NLRC-OFW Case No. (M) 03-07-1784-00 before the arbitral level of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Subsequent to the filing of said complaint, Dr. Vicaldo issued a medical certificate dated 18 July 2003, diagnosing Esguerra to be afflicted with "Coronary Artery Disease, Stable angina pectoris" and declaring him unfit for work, with an "Impediment Grade VII (41.8%)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; On 29 July 2003, Dr. Saguin also issued a medical certification stating that, as a consequence of his "moderate rigidity with 2/3 loss of motion and loss of lifting power of the trunk," Esguerra was then "unfit to work" with an Impediment Grade VIII.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In support of his complaint, Esguerra alleged, among other, matters, that he was repatriated for medical reasons on account of his work-related/aggravated ailment; that despite being apprised of his intention to submit himself for medical examination, CSMSI failed to refer him to a company-designated physician, and insisted that he was fit for work; and, that left with no choice but to seek medical attention on his own at the PGH, PHC and POH, he was constrained to file his complaint for disability benefits, sickness allowance, damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In refutation, CSMSI, Morcilla and CMEGT averred that the tests administered on Esguerra at the Jebel Ali Medical Centre revealed that he was in good health; and, that disregarding the finding that he continued to be fit for work, Esguerra insisted on his repatriation and filed his complaint without submitting himself to a post-employment medical examination within three (3) working days upon his return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Finding in favor CSMSI, Morcilla and CMEGT, Labor Arbiter Florentino R. Darlucio went on to render the 29 January 2004 Decision, dismissing the complaint on the ground that Esguerra failed to prove his disability and to submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician, pursuant to Section 20-B of the POEA SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>With the affirmance of the Labor Arbiter's decision in the 30 June 2003 Resolution issued by the NLRC's First Division in NLRC NCR CA No. 039292-04,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Esguerra filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> docketed before the CA as CA-G.R. SP No. 90298. On 29 August 2008, the CA's Seventh Division rendered the herein assailed decision reversing the NLRC's 30 June 2003 resolution, upon the following findings and conclusions, <i>viz.</i>: (a) the medical certifications issued by Drs. Vicaldo and Saguin indicate that respondent is entitled to temporary disability benefits corresponding to Impediment Grade VII (41.8%) which was assessed as a consequence of the illness he suffered during the period of his employment; (b) the post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician under POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055-96 (<i>Revised Standard Employment Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels</i>) is not absolute and admits of exceptions; (c) petitioner's failure to refer him to a company-designated physician justified respondent's resort to the physicians who declared him "unfit for work" and assessed his Impediment Grade as aforesaid; and, (d) respondent is entitled to a sickness allowance equivalent to four months' salary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>CSMSI's motion for reconsideration of the foregoing decision was denied for lack of merit in the CA's second assailed Resolution dated 11 November 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b><br></center><br>CSMSI seeks the reversal of the CA's assailed resolutions on the following grounds, to wit:<br><br><blockquote> <ol><li><b>The ruling of the Court of the Court of Appeals reversing and setting aside the findings of fact and conclusions of law of Labor Arbiter Florentino R. Darlucio, which was affirmed <i>in toto </i>by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), First Division, is contrary to the evidence on record and runs afoul with prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br></b></li><li><b>The Court of Appeals misappreciated the evidence and applied the POEA Standard Employment Contract of 1996 instead of the Revised Terms and Conditions for Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going vessels, which is part and parcel of the Contract of Employment entered into between Esguerra and the petitioner on May 9, 2003.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>We find the petition impressed with merit.<br><br>Viewed in light of the fact that Esguerra's contract of employment was executed on 9 May 2003, CSMSI correctly faults the CA for applying POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055-96 instead of the 2000 POEA-SEC which took effect on 25 June 2000.&nbsp; Deemed written in the seafarer's contract of employment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the 2000 POEA-SEC - like its predecessor - was designed primarily for the protection and benefit of Filipino seamen in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Anent a seafarer's entitlement to compensation and benefits for injury and illness, Section 20-B (3) thereof provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote> "Section 20-B.Compensation and Benefits for Injury and Illness. --<br><br>xxxx<br><br>3. Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician, but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.E<br><br><i>For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits</i>.<br><br>If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>The foregoing provision has been interpreted to mean that it is the company-designated physician who is entrusted with the task of assessing the seaman's disability,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; whether total or partial, due to either injury or illness, during the term of the latter's employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Concededly, this does not mean that the assessment of said physician is final, binding or conclusive on the claimant, the labor tribunal or the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Should he be so minded, the seafarer has the prerogative to request a second opinion and to consult a physician of his choice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> regarding his ailment or injury, in which case the medical report issued by the latter shall be evaluated by the labor tribunal and the court, based on its inherent merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; For the seaman's claim to prosper, however, it is mandatory that he should be examined by a company-designated physician within three days from his repatriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Failure to comply with this mandatory reporting requirement without justifiable cause shall result in forfeiture of the right to claim the compensation and disability benefits provided under the POEA-SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>There is no dispute regarding the fact that Esguerra had altogether failed to comply with the above-discussed mandatory reporting requirement. Beyond his bare assertion, however, that CSMSI "never gave him referrals to continue his medications as recommended by the foreign doctor" despite his call on 8 July 2003 "to inform them that he will report the next day in order to submit his medical evaluation abroad," Esguerra did not present any evidence to prove justification for his inability to submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician.&nbsp; If a written notice is required of a seafarer who is physically incapacitated for purposes of compliance with said requirement, we fail to see why a more tangible proof should not likewise be expected of Esguerra who, after his arrival on 7 July 2003, appears to have been well enough to consult with Dr. Vicaldo and Dr. Saguin on 9 July 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, self-serving and unsubstantiated declarations are insufficient to establish a case before quasi-judicial bodies where the quantum of evidence required to establish a fact is substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Often described as more than a mere scintilla,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other equally reasonable minds might conceivably opine otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>To our mind, Esguerra's compliance with the mandatory reporting requirement under the POEA-SEC was made even more imperative by the fact that his repatriation for medical reasons was categorically disputed by CSMSI.&nbsp; Consistent with the 5 July 2003 diagnosis made by Dr. Tulmar at the Jebel Ali Medical Centre declaring him "not fit for work until complete cardiac evaluation is done" and advising him "to rest until then,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it appears that Esguerra underwent serology, hematology, biochemistry and x-ray diagnostic tests which yielded no significant findings relative to the back and chest pains he claims to have suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Although the 5 July 2003 notation made on the M/V Gondwana Chief Officer's Logbook states that he was "advised to be repatriated" on the same day and "to continue his medication in the Philippines," no less than Esguerra himself confirmed in his 6 July 2003 letter to the Jebel Ali police/coastguard that he had yet to undergo a compete cardiac evaluation and that CSMSI's foreign principal, NSLF, had refused to shoulder his repatriation expenses on the ground that he was unable to finish his contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Quite significantly, Esguerra also filed his complaint on 16 July 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or even before his impediment rating was definitively assessed by either Dr. Vicaldo or Dr. Saguin.&nbsp; Our perusal of the record further shows that, by and of themselves, the medical certifications upon which Esguerra anchored his claims for disability benefits and sickness allowance were not supported by such diagnostic tests and/or procedures as would adequately refute the normal results of those administered to him at the Jebel Ali Medical Centre.&nbsp; Working on a vague diagnosis of "lower back problem," Dr. Saguin appears to have caused Esguerra to undergo physical therapy and prescribed him pain medications<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> similar to those he was already given abroad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> While Dr. Vicaldo also issued the 18 July 2003 medical certification, diagnosing Esguerra to be suffering from "Coronary Artery Disease, Stable Angina Pectoris,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> his justification for the assessment of an "Impediment Grade VII (41.8%)" was merely anchored on the following general impressions, to wit:<br><br><blockquote> - This patient/seaman presented with a history of shortness of breath, easy fatigue and chest pain [i]n June, 2003;<br><br>- He was seen in Dubai UAE where his ECG showed right bundle branch block.<br><br>- He was also seen at the PGH where he was treated [for] chronic stable angina.<br><br>- At present, he still complains of easy fatigue and chest pain.<br><br>- He is now unfit to resume work as seaman in any capacity.<br><br>- His illness is considered work aggravated.<br><br>- He would require antianginal medic[ine] to relieve his recurrent chest pain.<br><br>- He is at risk for developing full blown coronary artery disease in the future which may present as acute myocardial infarction.<br><br>- Having recurrent chest pain obviously impairs his quality of life.<br><br>- He needs lifestyle [modification] to improve his prognosis.&nbsp; This includes nicotine abstinence, dietary adjustments and physical exercise."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>Granted that strict rules of evidence are not applicable in claims for compensation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and mere probability and not the ultimate degree of certainty is regarded as the touchstone or test of proof in compensation proceedings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> it cannot be gainsaid that awards of compensation cannot rest in speculations or presumptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In the absence of showing of adequate tests and reasonable findings to support the same, the divergent Impediment Grades assessed by Dr. Vicaldo and Dr. Saguin cannot be expediently taken at face value.&nbsp; In <i>Magsaysay Maritime Corporation vs. Velasquez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> this Court significantly brushed aside the evidentiary value of a recommendation made by Dr. Vicaldo which was likewise "based on a single medical report which outlined the alleged findings and medical history" of the claimant-seafarer.&nbsp; In <i>Montoya vs. Transmed Manila Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> a similar fate was dealt the same doctor's plain statement of the supposed work-relation/work-aggravation of a seafarer's ailment which was "not supported by any reason or proof submitted together with the assessment or in the course of the arbitration."<br><br>We are well aware of the principle that, consistent with the purposes underlying the formulation of the POEA-SEC, its provisions must be applied fairly, reasonably and liberally in favor of the seafarers, for it is only then that its beneficent provisions can be fully carried into effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; This exhortation cannot, however, be taken to sanction the award of disability benefits and sickness allowance based on flimsy evidence and/or even in the face of an unjustified non-compliance with the mandatory reporting requirement under the POEA-SEC.&nbsp; When the language of the contract is explicit and leaves no doubt as to the intention of its drafters, the rule is settled that courts may not read into it any other intention that would contradict its plain import.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> While we sympathize with Esguerra's plight, we are, therefore, constrained to deny his claims for disability benefits and sickness allowance absent proof of compliance with the requirements set forth in Section 20 (B), paragraph (3) of the POEA-SEC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED </b>and the assailed Decision dated 29 August 2008 is, accordingly, <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE.&nbsp;
