L-0043 and L-0044, wherein Ogarte was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of Rape, qualified by relationship and age, as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of death and the payment of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity, and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages, for each count of rape.<br><br>On May 2, 1997, two separate Informations were filed before the RTC, charging Ogarte with two separate counts of Rape.&nbsp; The accusatory portions of the respective Informations read:<br><br><blockquote>Criminal Case No. L-0043<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>:<br><br>That, in the evening, on or about the 1<sup>st</sup> day of November, 1996, in the municipality of xxx, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, moved by lewd and unchaste desire and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having sexual intercourse with one [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> his 16[-]year[-]old daughter, against her will and without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Criminal Case No. L-0044<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>:<br><br>That, in the morning, on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of November, 1996, in the municipality of xxx, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, moved by lewd and unchaste desire and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously succeed in having sexual intercourse with one [AAA], his 16[-]year[-]old daughter, against her will and without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 15, 1997, Ogarte was arraigned and he pleaded not guilty to the two charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Joint trial on the merits ensued after the termination of the pre-trial conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The prosecution's first witness was the private complainant herself, AAA.&nbsp; She confirmed that it was she who had filed the two complaints for rape against her own father Ogarte, whom she identified in open court.&nbsp; According to AAA, the first instance of rape happened at around ten o'clock in the evening of November 1, 1996, in their home in xxx.&nbsp; AAA claimed that while she was sleeping beside her four younger sisters, Ogarte woke her up, held her hands, grabbed her head, and brought her to the kitchen wherein she was forced to lie down on the floor.&nbsp; AAA said that her struggles were no match for Ogarte's strength<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> who proceeded to take off her pants and underwear, climb on top of her, and insert his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; AAA averred that she cried in pain and pleaded with her father "not to do it"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> but Ogarte told her "to be silent because he will do it slowly"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and "not to worry because nothing will happen to [her]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; AAA said that after Ogarte ejaculated - which she knew because of the white fluid she saw on his penis after he removed it from her vagina - he threatened to kill her if she told her mother, who was at that time in Guinabucan, Zamboanga del Sur,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> or anybody else of what had happened. For fear that Ogarte is capable of carrying out his threats, AAA kept her silence even when her mother arrived the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>At around nine o'clock in the morning of November 3, 1996, AAA alleged that she was again raped by Ogarte.&nbsp; This occurred when, upon her mother's order, she reluctantly obeyed to help Ogarte gather some firewood in the wooded area near their house. AAA narrated that upon carrying some of the wood pieces Ogarte had cut, Ogarte, still carrying the <i>bolo</i> he used to cut the wood, pulled her shoulders and told her not to make any noise as he missed her very much.&nbsp; AAA recounted how Ogarte then went on to remove her undergarments, and ignoring her cries, once again placed himself on top of her and with a "push and pull motion,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> consummated his sexual desires.&nbsp; After Ogarte was done, he again warned and threatened AAA against breaking her silence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>AAA described how in the following days and weeks she was able to foil Ogarte's attempts, by avoiding him and by pinching and waking up her sleeping sisters whenever Ogarte tried to make advances.&nbsp; She had managed to keep the incidents to herself up until December 5, 1996, when her mother again asked her to help her father Ogarte gather some wood.&nbsp; AAA, believing that she would again be violated by Ogarte in the woods, mustered the courage to reveal to her mother the events that transpired on November 1 and 3, 1996.&nbsp; Upon learning about this, Ogarte, in his anger, pulled AAA and was about to stab her when he was stopped by AAA's mother who arrived just in time.&nbsp; Thereafter, AAA's mother told her to keep quiet about what her father did to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On March 20, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> AAA told her grandmother BBB her ordeal in the hands of her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; On April 2, 1997, AAA and BBB went to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Dipolog City where they executed the sworn affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that were used as bases for the charges against Ogarte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>BBB, AAA's grandmother, was presented next.&nbsp; BBB identified Ogarte in open court and said she knew Ogarte because he is her son-in-law, being the husband of her daughter, AAA's mother.&nbsp; BBB confirmed that AAA was her granddaughter, that she was only 16 years old when the rapes happened, and that AAA told her about the rapes on March 20, 1997, when AAA went to see her in Zamboanga del Sur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Before resting their case, the prosecution also submitted the following Medico-Legal Findings made on April 2, 1997 by Dr. Milagros M. Cavan, whose testimony was deemed no longer necessary by the RTC, in view of the fact that the medical certificate she submitted was admitted by the defense, subject to rebuttal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><blockquote>DIAGNOSIS/FINDINGS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">- Examined conscious, coherent, ambulatory:<br></div><br>Weight:&nbsp; 49.6 kgs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Height: 162 C.M.<br>Pertinent PE Findings:<br>Breast:&nbsp; Conical in shape; areola pinkish<br>Chest and Lungs:&nbsp; Clear breath sounds<br>CVS - Regular rate and rhythm<br>Abdomen - Flat, soft, no masses, no normoactive bowel sounds<br>Genitalia:<br>Introitus:&nbsp; Admits two examining fingers with ease.<br>Hymen - With old healed lacerations, at 5 0'clock and 7 0'clock positions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></div></blockquote><br>Ogarte, addressing the first charge against him, vehemently denied that he had raped his own daughter on the night of November 1, 1996.&nbsp; He said that although it was true that he was at their residence that evening, his wife, AAA's mother, was also there that night, contrary to AAA's allegations. Ogarte described the layout of their house and argued that because AAA slept at the other end of the room, beside the wall, thus, at the farthest side to the kitchen where the rape allegedly took place, it would have been impossible to pull her and bring her to the kitchen without stepping on or awakening his other children who were sleeping right beside AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Ogarte likewise claimed innocence on the second charge of rape and averred that he was not in the wooded area with AAA on November 3, 1996 as he was plowing his farm that day.&nbsp; Ogarte contended that AAA filed these charges against him as an act of revenge because he and his wife slapped her sometime in February 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> when she adamantly denied having sexual intercourse with three men at her school, as reported by Ogarte's cousin who worked as a teacher in AAA's school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Ogarte, invoking his love for AAA, his eldest child,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> whom he admitted to being 16 years old at the time the alleged incidents happened,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> asserted that for the very reason that AAA is his child, he could not commit these crimes as charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Ogarte's close friend Modesto Capalac, who was also their <i>Barangay </i>Captain at that time, attested to Ogarte's well-being and good moral character.&nbsp; He said that he knew Ogarte because they have been neighbors for a long time, even before they became neighbors in San Roque.&nbsp; He said that Ogarte had no criminal record in their <i>Barangay</i> and that since Ogarte was a cooperative man, nobody had ever filed a complaint against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On March 9, 2000, the RTC found Ogarte guilty as charged in both criminal cases and imposed on him the supreme penalty of death for each count of rape:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused Edgaro Ogarte Y Ocob guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of the crime of Rape as defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as charged, aggravated by relationship and age, in relation to Art. 47 of the same Code, this Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH for each count and orders him to pay the private offended party the sums of P75,000.00 as indemnity for each count and P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count, or a total of P250,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The RTC said that the constitutional presumption of innocence that Ogarte originally enjoyed was sufficiently overcome by AAA's clear, straightforward, credible, and truthful declaration that on two separate occasions, he succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, without her consent and against her will, in violation of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The RTC also debunked Ogarte's imputation of ill motive on AAA, stating that while the supposed "whipping and slapping" happened only in February 1997, AAA had exposed Ogarte's appalling acts as early as December 5, 1996.&nbsp; Citing <i>People v. Victor</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the RTC held that denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses that cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witnesses that the accused committed the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, Ogarte, in interposing the defense of denial and alibi, "failed to demonstrate and show that `he was somewhere else at the time of the commission of the crime and that is why it is physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission and commit the crime.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC also held that AAA's delay in filing a case against Ogarte is not uncommon and is justified in light of the threats made against her life if she told anyone about the rapes, on top of the fact that her own mother told her to keep quiet about it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On intermediate appellate review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court of Appeals "synthesized for coherence"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the errors assigned by Ogarte as follows: "(1) credibility of the victim-witness, (2) appellant's defense of denial, and (3) aggravating circumstance of minority."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Ogarte argued AAA's testimony was replete with inconsistencies, her minority was never duly established, and his credible alibi should have been believed in view of the weakness of the prosecution's evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals gave full weight to the RTC's determination that AAA's testimony was "credible, worthy of full faith and credit," since there was nothing in the records, which showed that the RTC misappreciated the facts or was arbitrary in giving probative value on AAA's testimony. The Court of Appeals also held that the "allegation of inconsistency does not detract AAA's credibility"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> as sworn statements, not being conclusive proofs, cannot prevail over AAA's testimonies given in open court.&nbsp; On the issue of delay in filing this case, the Court of Appeals said it was justified "considering the intimidation, threat, and force employed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> by Ogarte against AAA.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also agreed with the RTC that Ogarte's defense of denial, being an inherently weak and unreliable defense, could not prevail over AAA's positive and categorical statements.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's appreciation of the aggravating circumstances of minority and relationship, as they were alleged in the information and duly proven during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On November 20, 2007, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision, modifying the RTC's decision in so far as the current law and jurisprudence are concerned, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the assailed Decision is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with <b>MODIFICATION</b>.&nbsp; Appellant is found guilty, beyond reasonable doubt, of the crime of rape in Crim.

When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:</b><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>1.&nbsp; By using force or intimidation;</b><br>2.

Pruna</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> wherein we established certain guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance.&nbsp; We have reiterated these guidelines in the more recent case of <i>People v.

The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>The qualifying circumstances of age and relationship were not only properly alleged in the information but were also duly established by the prosecution during the trial of the cases against Ogarte.&nbsp; Records show that AAA submitted a certification from the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of Labason, Zamboanga del Norte that her birth records appear in its Register of Births and that her date of birth is listed as "June 24, 1980."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Under the above guidelines in establishing the victim's age, this certification qualifies as an authentic document.&nbsp; Moreover, Ogarte himself admitted, not only on cross examination, but also to his own counsel during his direct examination, that AAA is his eldest child and was 16 years old on November 1, 1996:<br><br>On direct examination:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">How old was [AAA] on November 1, 1996?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Sixteen.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">[AAA] according to you was sixteen years old at that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;

However, he only gave a general statement and failed to specifically identify the alleged inconsistencies in AAA's testimony. Nevertheless, this Court has declared that inconsistencies in a victim's testimony will not weaken her credibility because we cannot expect a rape victim to remember every ugly detail of her appalling experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Del Rosario</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we said:<br><br><blockquote>Etched in our jurisprudence is the doctrine that a victim of a savage crime cannot be expected to mechanically retain and then give an accurate account of every lurid detail of a frightening experience - a verity born out of human nature and experience.&nbsp; This is especially true with a rape victim who is required to utilize every fiber of her body and mind to repel an attack from a stronger aggressor. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>Again, this Court is compelled to repeat the well-entrenched rule that the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses is entitled to the highest respect absent a showing that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; This is because the trial court is deemed to be in a better position to decide the question of credibility, since it had the opportunity to observe the witnesses' manner of testifying, their furtive glances, calmness, sighs and the scant or full realization of their oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The RTC was "convinced, without reservation"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> in AAA's credibility especially since her testimony was "clear, straightforward, credible and truthful."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; We also agree with the RTC's assessment that the ill motive Ogarte imputed on his daughter is baseless and concocted only to escape liability, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Although this Court noted that the accused, in an attempt to exculpate himself from any liability brought about by the couple of charges leveled against him, imputed ill-motive on the part of the private complainant in indicting him of the crimes as charged, <b>the same deserves scant consideration</b> in view of the fact that the <b>accused had whipped or slapped the herein private complainant only sometime in February 1997 as testified to by the accused </b>(p-10, TSN, April 22, 1999) <b>which incident was considered by the defense as the source of the ill-motive of the prosecution witness [AAA], while the private complainant had reported the rapes to her mother on December 5 yet </b>(p-10, TSN, March 3, 1998).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote><br>AAA's delay in reporting the incident to the proper authorities is also insignificant and does not negate the veracity of her charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; It should be remembered that Ogarte threatened to kill her if she revealed the rapes to anyone.&nbsp; Moreover, her own mother told her to keep her silence when AAA told her about the rapes a month after their occurrence.&nbsp; This Court reiterates that:<br><br><blockquote>The failure of complainant to disclose her defilement without loss of time to persons close to her or to report the matter to the authorities does not perforce warrant the conclusion that she was not sexually molested and that her charges against the accused are all baseless, untrue and fabricated.&nbsp; Delay in prosecuting the offense is not an indication of a fabricated charge.&nbsp; Many victims of rape never complain or file criminal charges against the rapists. They prefer to bear the ignominy and pain, rather than reveal their shame to the world or risk the offenders' making good their threats to kill or hurt their victims."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>Since there are usually only two witnesses in rape cases, it is also a settled rule that rape may be proven by the lone uncorroborated testimony of the offended victim, as long as her testimony is clear, positive, and probable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>As we have established that AAA was a credible witness, her clear, positive, and probable, uncorroborated testimony is enough to convict Ogarte of the crime of rape.&nbsp; As the Court held in <i>People v. Tayaban</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>[I]t is settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child-victims are given full weight and credit, since when a woman or a girl-child says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>Ogarte is trying to persuade this Court to believe that he could not have committed the crimes on the bases of his denial and alibi.<br><br>The RTC and the Court of Appeals were correct in disregarding Ogarte's defenses.&nbsp; This Court has uniformly held, time and again, that both "denial and alibi are among the weakest, if not the weakest, defenses in criminal prosecution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; It is well-settled that denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Palomar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> we explained why alibi is a weak and unreliable defense:<br><br><blockquote>Alibi is one of the weakest defenses not only because it is inherently frail and unreliable, but also because it is easy to fabricate and difficult to check or rebut.&nbsp; It cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by eyewitnesses who had no improper motive to testify falsely. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote><br>We have also declared that in case of alibi, the accused must show that he had strictly complied with the requirements of time and place:<br><br><blockquote>In the case of alibi, it is elementary case law that the requirements of time and place be strictly complied with by the defense, meaning that the accused must not only show that he was somewhere else but that it was also physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br>This Ogarte utterly failed to do.&nbsp; While he merely denied the rape on November 1, 1996, his alibi for the November 3, 1996 rape failed to show that it was impossible for him to have committed the crime.&nbsp; Ogarte testified that he was at his farm, plowing the field instead of at the wooded area with AAA on November 3, 1996.&nbsp; He further stated that his farm was just a kilometer away from their house and would not even take half an hour to traverse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; Clearly, the proximity of the farm to the wooded area and to their house refutes the defense of alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Aside from his testimony, Ogarte never presented any other evidence to prove that he could not have committed the rapes.&nbsp; He did not present any other witness, let alone his wife, whom he claimed was with him on November 1, 1996 and whom AAA claimed to have ordered her to go with Ogarte to gather wood on November 3, 1996. This Court cannot over-emphasize the repeatedly quoted doctrine that positive identification prevails over denial and alibi. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The RTC was correct in imposing upon Ogarte the penalty of death as it found Ogarte guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of <b>qualified rape</b>, AAA being Ogarte's 16-year-old daughter when the rapes were committed.&nbsp; However, although under the Death Penalty Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> the crime of qualified rape is punishable by death, Republic Act No. 9346,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> which took effect on June 24, 2006, prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.&nbsp; Under this Act, the proper penalty to be imposed upon Ogarte in lieu of the death penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> without eligibility for parole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> is mandatory upon a finding of the fact of rape.&nbsp; Moral damages are automatically awarded without need of further proof, because it is assumed that a rape victim has actually suffered moral injuries entitling the victim to such award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
