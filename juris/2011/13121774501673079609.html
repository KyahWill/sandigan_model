				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>This is an appeal from the August 20, 2009 Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 03300, which affirmed the April 16, 2008 Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 04-231073 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 2 in Manila. The RTC found accused Darius O. Bautista (Bautista) guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165 or the <i>Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002</i>.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The charge against the accused stemmed from the following Information dated October 18, 2004:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>Criminal Case No. 04-231073</b><br></center><br>That on or about October 15, 2004, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, trade, deliver or give away any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly sell zero point zero three four (0.034) gram of white crystalline substance containing methamphetamine hydrochloride, known as "shabu" a dangerous drug.<br><br>Contrary to law. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>The case was originally tried jointly with Criminal Case No. 04-231074 against Armando Marcos y Balderama @ Onyo (Marcos), Bautista's brother-in-law, for violation of Sec. 11(3), Art. II of RA 9165. The instant appeal, however, relates only to accused Bautista in Criminal Case No. 04-231073, as Marcos, the accused in Criminal Case No. 04-231074, was acquitted by the RTC.&nbsp; Both cases arose out of the same facts and circumstances. Accordingly, common evidence was then presented during the trial.<br><br>At the arraignment, the accused, who was assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.&nbsp; Trial proceeded after the pre-trial.<br><br>During the trial, the prosecution offered the testimonies of Police Officer 2 Jonathan Ruiz (PO2 Ruiz) and PO2 Crispino Ocampo (PO2 Ocampo) both of the Western Police District's (WPD's) District Anti-Illegal Drugs-Special Operations Task Group (DAID-SOTG) on United Nations Avenue, Ermita, Manila. On the other hand, the defense presented, as its witnesses, the accused; co-accused Marcos; Irene Manabat (Manabat), a <i>kakanin</i> (native delicacy) vendor; and Anna Marie Ignacio (Ignacio), accused's neighbor and operator of a video <i>karera</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; At the pre-trial, the parties likewise stipulated the qualifications of Forensic Chemist Elisa G.

De Leon) of the WPD.&nbsp; The buy-bust team was composed of PO2 Ruiz, PO2 Ocampo, PO2 Rhumjalie Salazar, PO2 Dranred Cipriano, and PO1 Erwin Castro. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; For this purpose, PO2 Ruiz was designated as the poseur-buyer and a one hundred-peso bill, which was to serve as the buy-bust money, was marked with "JR," representing the initials of PO2 Ruiz. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>He narrated that on the same day, at about 11:30 in the evening, the buy-bust team organized by the WPD went to Mata Street in Tondo, Manila, the site pointed out by the confidential informant, in order to execute the buy-bust operation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; The team first went around the area, then met with the confidential informant for the operation. The team saw "Dada" standing along Mata Street.&nbsp; While PO2 Ruiz and the confidential informant proceeded to approach "Dada," the rest of the buy-bust team hid themselves in a place where they could have a good view of the buy-bust operation that was to transpire, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which was about five to seven meters away. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; During the operation, the informant introduced PO2 Ruiz as a buyer of <i>shabu</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Ruiz then handed the marked money to "Dada" in exchange for a plastic sachet, which "Dada" took out from his right front pocket. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; At this instance, PO2 Ruiz identified himself to "Dada" as a police officer and then made the pre-arranged signal to his colleagues by removing his ball cap. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Accused was arrested and brought to the DAID-SOTG. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Ruiz ordered accused to empty his pocket and recovered the marked money. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Marcos, who was within the vicinity accompanying "Dada," was likewise arrested. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Ruiz marked the plastic sachet with "DBO," the initials of accused, and thereafter turned it over to the investigator. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; The investigator then turned the plastic sachet over to the WPD's Crime Laboratory for examination. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>PO2 Ocampo was presented by the prosecution as the second witness. He testified that on October 15, 2004, P/Insp. De Leon directed a number of police officers to conduct a buy-bust operation against a certain "Dada."&nbsp; Since PO2 Ocampo was very familiar with the target area for being a nearby resident, he volunteered to be part of the buy-bust team.&nbsp; He confirmed that PO2 Ruiz was designated as the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; When PO2 Ruiz and the informant went to the target area to conduct the buy-bust operation, PO2 Ocampo went to his residence, which was two blocks away from the target area, for approximately 30 minutes.&nbsp; Upon his return to the target area, PO2 Ruiz informed him that the operation had been consummated and two persons were arrested.&nbsp; The buy-bust team then brought the arrested persons to the police station for investigation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Ocampo stated that he and PO2 Ruiz were also present when the accused and Marcos were turned over to the investigator. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Ocampo properly identified accused Bautista ("Dada") and Marcos in the RTC. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Defense's Version of Facts</b><br></center><br>The accused was presented as the first witness for the defense.&nbsp; He stated that on October 15, 2004 between 9 o'clock to 9:30 in the evening, he was inside his neighbor's house playing video <i>karera </i>with Marcos and five other people. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; While they were playing video <i>karera</i>, about eight police officers suddenly arrived and announced, "<i>Huwag kayong tatakbo mga pulis kami</i>." (Do not run. We are police officers.)&nbsp; The accused testified that right after the verbal warning, the police officers frisked them.&nbsp; Thereafter, the five other persons in the house were released, and only the two of them, the accused and Marcos, were arrested. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; They were then brought to the DAID-SOTG office on United Nations Avenue in Manila for investigation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The defense presented Manabat as its second witness.&nbsp; She testified that on October 15, 2004, she was at the video <i>karera</i> on 348 Mata Street, Tondo, Manila, when the arrest happened. She was there to have her money changed into coins.&nbsp; At the time, Ignacio, the owner and operator of the video <i>karera</i>, and some children were also present. She said that two persons in civilian clothes suddenly appeared and asked who the owner of the video <i>karera</i> was.&nbsp; Marcos answered that he did not know.&nbsp; Thereafter, accused and Marcos were frisked and then arrested. She further testified that accused and Marcos resisted by holding on to a steel bar such that Marcos' hand had to be burned by a cigarette in order for him to let go of it. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The defense then presented Marcos as the third witness.&nbsp; Marcos, a pedicab driver, testified that on October 15, 2004 at 10 o'clock in the evening, while he was at the video <i>karera</i>, two persons arrived asking him who the owner of the video <i>karera</i> was. He replied that he did not know. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He and accused were then frisked and forced to go with the said persons to the DAID-SOTG office.<br><br>The defense also presented Ignacio, the owner and operator of the video <i>karera</i>, as its witness.&nbsp; Ignacio testified that on October 15, 2004, she was at her house on 348 Mata St., Tondo, Manila, which was also where people played the video <i>karera</i>.&nbsp; She stated that at about 10 o'clock in the evening, three persons went inside her house and introduced themselves as police officers, while about three others waited outside. The police officers arrested two persons playing video <i>karera</i> in her house, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> but the two resisted the arrest. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; She said that she only knew one of the two arrested, Marcos, as he was her neighbor.&nbsp; She said further that besides the two persons arrested, three others were also playing video <i>karera </i>at the time of the arrest. One of them was a woman, which she identified to be her neighbor, Manabat. Finally, Ignacio stated that she was not arrested, notwithstanding the fact that she was operating a video <i>karera</i>,<i> </i>which was<i> </i>illegal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted the accused. The dispositive portion of its April 16, 2008 Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows, to wit:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. 04-231073 finding accused, Darius Bautista y Orsino @ Dada, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, he is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs;<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. 04-231074, for failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, we hereby ACQUIT, accused, Armando Marcos y Balderama @ Onyo, for the crime charged.&nbsp; Costs de officio.</li></ol><br>The specimens are forfeited in favor of the government and the Branch Clerk of Court, accompanied by the Branch Sheriff, is directed to turn over with dispatch and upon proper receipt the said specimen to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) for proper disposal in accordance with the law and rules.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In finding for the prosecution and convicting the accused of the crime charged, the RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution.&nbsp; The RTC held that the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, who are police officers, should be given full faith and credit, absent any clear and convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired by any improper motive or were not properly performing their duties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Accused failed to show any ill motive on the part of the police officers to testify falsely against him.<br><br>The RTC further held that the accused's claim of alibi is not substantiated and therefore not believable.&nbsp; The RTC likewise did not give credence to the testimonies of Manabat and Ignacio, whose testimonies showed several inconsistencies and discrepancies that raised doubt as to their credibility. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the RTC acquitted Marcos of the crime charged, because the testimonies of the police officers led to the conclusion that only accused Bautista could be held guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime.&nbsp; As seen in the testimony of PO2 Ruiz, the confidential informant pointed out accused Bautista only as the seller of prohibited drugs and the buy-bust operation was, thus, conducted against him.&nbsp; The RTC held that PO2 Ruiz had no personal knowledge of the arrest of Marcos, as he was apprehended by a companion of PO2 Ruiz while PO2 Ruiz himself was busy arresting the accused, Bautista. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Cruz, the officer who arrested Marcos, failed to testify in court.&nbsp; Marcos could, therefore, not be convicted of the crime charged.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On August 20, 2009, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the instant appeal is <b>DISMISSED </b>and the assailed Decision dated April 16, 2008 is <b>AFFIRMED</b><i>.&nbsp; </i><br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA held that the factual findings of the trial court should be given great weight, considering that they have been fully substantiated by the evidence on record. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The CA held that there was in fact no break in the custody of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, i.e.,<i> </i>the confiscated dangerous drug, which in this case is methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, the CA ruled that the alleged non-compliance with the provision of Sec. 21 of the <i>Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002</i> is not fatal, considering that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized dangerous drug were properly preserved as can be gleaned from the facts of the case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Hence, this appeal is before Us, with accused-appellant maintaining that the trial court erred in convicting him of the crime charged, despite the fact that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; He alleges that reasonable doubt exists because there is a break in the chain of custody of the seized dangerous drug.&nbsp; He further alleges that there was a serious deviation from the requirements of Sec. 21 of the <i>Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002</i> on the custody and disposition of the said seized dangerous drug.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b>&nbsp; </center><br><br>We sustain the conviction of accused-appellant.<br><br><b>Factual findings of the RTC should be given full faith and credit unless there is<br> a showing of a misinterpretation of material facts or grave abuse of discretion</b><br><br>In the present case, the prosecution and the defense presented very different facts of the case.&nbsp; It was, therefore, obligatory upon the RTC to determine which of these facts should be given great weight and credence. As We held in <i>People v. Gabrino</i>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We have held time and again that <b>"the trial court's assessment of the credibility of a witness is entitled to great weight, sometimes even with finality."<i> </i></b> As We have reiterated in the very recent case of <i>People v. Jose Pepito Combate</i>, <b>where there is no showing that the trial court overlooked or misinterpreted some material facts or that it gravely abused its discretion, then We do not disturb and interfere with its assessment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses. This is clearly because the judge in the trial court was the one who personally heard the accused and the witnesses, and observed their demeanor as well as the manner in which they testified during trial.<i> </i></b> Accordingly, the trial court, or more particularly, the RTC in this case, is in a better position to assess and weigh the evidence presented during trial.<br><br>In the present case, in giving weight to the prosecution's testimonies, there is not a slight indication that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion, or that it overlooked any material fact. In fact, no allegation to that effect ever came from the defense.&nbsp; There is therefore no reason to disturb the findings of fact made by the RTC and its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.&nbsp; To reiterate this time-honored doctrine and well-entrenched principle, We quote from <i>People v. Robert Dinglasan</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In the matter of credibility of witnesses, we reiterate the familiar and well-entrenched rule that the factual findings of the trial court should be respected. <b>The judge a quo was in a better position to pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses, having personally heard them when they testified and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.<i> </i></b>It is doctrinally settled that the evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect, <b>because it had the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and detect if they were telling the truth. This assessment is binding upon the appellate court in the absence of a clear showing that it was reached arbitrarily or that the trial court had plainly overlooked certain facts of substance or value that if considered might affect the result of the case</b>. (Emphasis Ours.)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>In appreciating the facts of the present case, the RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, which the CA found to be without grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; The CA likewise did not make any finding that the RTC overlooked or misinterpreted a material fact.&nbsp; In fact, the CA affirmed the factual determination made by the RTC.&nbsp; As We have previously explained and discussed in <i>Gabrino </i>and in a multitude of cases, the trial court judge is in the best position to make this determination as the judge was the one who personally heard the accused and the witnesses, as well as observed their demeanor and the manner in which they testified during trial. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Accordingly, We do not disturb or interfere with the trial court's finding of facts and its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.<br><br>Furthermore, the RTC made a very important observation that explains why it found the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses more credible, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Witness Anna Marie Ignacio when asked by us if she was also operating pedicabs aside from illegal video karera she answered no but when pressed if accused Armando [Marcos] was one of her drivers of pedicab, she reneged and admitted that indeed she was also operating pedicabs and Armando was one of the drivers.&nbsp; In her examination-in-chief, she claimed knowing Armando only because he is a neighbor. She is therefore lying and was also trying to save the hide of accused Armando and Darius.&nbsp; Had it not for the failure of PO Cruz, one who allegedly arrested and recovered the evidence from accused Armando, to testify in Court the prosecution could have proved beyond reasonable doubt his guilt. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In appreciating the evidence for the prosecution, the CA ratiocinated, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The accused-appellant was caught by the police <i>in flagrante </i>in a buy-bust operation. The delivery of the contraband to the poseur buyer and the receipt of the marked money by the accused consummated the buy-bust transaction between the entrapping officer and the accused.<br><br>Accused-appellant's challenge against the legality of the buy-bust operation is a closed issue.&nbsp; A buy-bust operation is a common form of entrapment that is resorted to for trapping and capturing felons in the execution of their criminal plan.&nbsp; The operation is sanctioned by law and has consistently proved to be an effective method of apprehending drug sellers.&nbsp; As for the convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust team were inspired by improper motives or were not performing their duty, their testimonies on the operation deserve full faith and credit.

Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <b>Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</b>.
