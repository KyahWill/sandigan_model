SP Nos. 89052 and 89443. The CA dismissed the separate appeals filed by herein petitioners Estate of Pastor M. Samson, represented by Rolando B. Samson, and Julian C. Chan from the November 7, 2003 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and December 29, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), Central Office.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>Pastor M. Samson (Pastor) owned a 1.0138-hectare parcel of land known as Lot 1108 of the Tala Estate Subdivision located in Bagumbong, Caloocan City and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 65174. In 1959, Pastor was approached by his friend Macario Susano (Macario) who asked for permission to occupy a portion of Lot 1108 to build a house for his family. Since Pastor was godfather to one of Macario's children, Pastor acceded to Macario's request. Macario and his family occupied 620 square meters of Lot 1108 and devoted the rest of the land to palay cultivation. Herein respondents, Macario's wife Mercedes R. Susano and their son Norberto R. Susano, insist that while no agricultural leasehold contract was executed by Pastor and Macario, Macario religiously paid 15 cavans of palay per agricultural year to Pastor, which rent was reduced by Pastor in 1986 to 8 cavans of palay per agricultural year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In 1973, Pastor subdivided Lot 1108 into three portions, to wit: Lot 1108-A having an area of 3,172 square meters and covered by TCT No. 52637; Lot 1108-B having an area of 270 square meters and covered by TCT No. 52635; and Lot 1108-C having an area of 6,696 square meters and covered by TCT No. 52638. The first and last parcels, namely Lots 1108-A and 1108-C, remained registered in Pastor's name while Lot 1108-B was sold to Jimena Novera in 1973 without Macario's knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In 1979, Pastor sold 2,552 square meters of Lot 1108-A to spouses Felix Pacheco and Juanita Clamor, allegedly also without Macario's knowledge and consent. As a result of the sale, Lot 1108-A was further subdivided into three portions: (1) Lot 1108-A-1 measuring 620 square meters and covered by TCT No. 137744 in Pastor's name; (2) Lot 1108-A-2 measuring 2,361 square meters and covered by TCT No. 137745; and (3) Lot 1108-A-3 measuring 191 square meters and covered by TCT No. 137746. The last two parcels are registered in the name of spouses Felix Pacheco and Juanita Clamor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>Lots 1108-A-1 and 1108-C comprising a total area of 7,316 square meters remained occupied and cultivated by Macario and his family.<br><br>On February 28, 1989, Pastor sold Lot 1108-C to petitioner Julian Chan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Consequently, TCT No. 52638 was cancelled and TCT No. 176758 was issued in Chan's name.<br><br>According to respondents, no written notice was sent by Pastor to Macario prior to the sale to Chan of Lot 1108-C comprising an area of 6,696 square meters. They aver that Macario came to know of the transaction only after Chan visited the property sometime in October 1990 accompanied by an employee from the city government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>Chan, on the other hand, claims that prior to buying Lot 1108-C from Pastor, he ascertained the location and condition of the property. He maintains that he knew the property to be a residential lot as indicated in Tax Declaration No. B-026-09768 issued over the said property by the Caloocan City Assessor's Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On November 1990, Macario received a letter from Pastor's lawyer demanding that he vacate the property within twenty (20) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Aggrieved, Macario filed a complaint against Pastor before the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO) of Valenzuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, it appears that Chan and Macario tried to settle amicably the dispute as between them. On September 26, 1991, Macario and his wife Mercedes executed a notarized document entitled, "<i>Kusang-Loob na Pagtatalaga</i>" (Deed of Undertaking)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> wherein Macario, recognizing that Chan is a buyer in good faith, acknowledged the latter's ownership over the said landholding. The said document provides, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KUSANG-LOOB NA PAGTATALAGA (DEED OF UNDERTAKING)</span><br><br>ALAMIN NG LAHAT:<br><br>Kami na sina MACARIO SUSANO at MERCEDES SUSANO, mag-asawa, Pilipino at naninirahan sa Bagumbong, Kalookan City, ay nagsaysay ng mga sumusunod:<br><br>1.

Specifically, the complaint prayed for the inclusion of the 7,316-square meter portion of said landholding, or Lots 1108-A-1 and 1108-C, within the Coverage of the Operation Land Transfer (OLT) Program under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> or The <u>Tenant Emancipation Decree</u>. They also asked that an emancipation patent be issued in their favor.&nbsp; They tendered P12,052.80 in cash representing the reasonable redemption price over the subject landholding based on the highest land valuation prescribed by the DAR on unirrigated rice land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Said amount was accepted by the DAR Regional Cashier per Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of DARAB Regional Adjudicator Fe Arche-Manalang.<br><br>In his Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Chan maintained that he is a buyer in good faith and that he relied on the tax declaration which stated that the subject property is residential in character.

Pastor also argued that the land involved, Lot 1108-A-1 covered by TCT No. 137744, is only 620 square meters, too small to be considered a viable family-size farm or economic family-size farm under Republic Act (R.A.)

Pastor filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> reiterating his arguments in his motion to dismiss, and claiming that respondents are not entitled to the benefits of the agrarian reform program because they are not landless peasants.

No. 6657 or by P.D. No. 27 as the land is not agricultural land and no tenancy relationship existed between him and herein respondents, who occupied his land by mere tolerance.&nbsp; He also reiterated that even assuming that the land is agricultural land, respondents are not entitled to the benefits of said land reform laws as they are not landless tenants to begin with and the subject land is too small to be a viable family-size farm.<br><br>Chan for his part argued in his Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that the subject parcel of land cannot be considered as agricultural land due to the enactment in 1981 of <u>Metro Manila Zoning Ordinance No. 81-01</u> classifying the lands within the Metropolitan Manila area as residential and/or commercial. Chan pointed that the said zoning ordinance preceded R.A. No. 6657, which became effective only on June 15, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, herein respondents maintained in their Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that their predecessor-in-interest, Macario, was a bona fide agricultural tenant; hence, they are entitled to the rights of pre-emption and redemption.&nbsp; And having validly exercised their right of redemption through the deposit of the redemption price with the DAR, they are allegedly now the owners of the subject land.&nbsp; That they have such right of redemption is likewise due to the fact that the subject land is covered by the OLT Program, respondents added.<br><br>Up to now, the disputed portion of the subject landholding is still utilized as a rice field by the respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RARAD's Ruling</b><br></center><br>On December 26, 1994, the RARAD issued a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> declaring that the late Macario validly acquired the status of a bona fide and de jure tenant over the subject land due to Pastor's implied acquiescence in allowing Macario to discharge the duties of a tenant for a considerable length of time until the latter's death in 1993. This notwithstanding, respondents' complaint was dismissed. The RARAD ruled:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Under the given factual milieu, there can be no question that the Plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest[,] the late Macario Susano[,] validly acquired the status of a <u>bona fide</u> and <u>de jure</u> tenant over the subject landholding by reason of Defendant Pastor Samson's implied acquiescence over the years from the time he discharged the duties of such tenant until his demise in 1993. Estoppel by acquiescence has definitely set in and Petitioner can no longer impugn at this late stage the validity of the said decedent's acquired tenancy status which is entitled to full judicial protection under the well-recognized principle of security of tenure guaranteed under existing agrarian laws which were established in the light of the social justice precept of the Constitution and in the exercise of the police power of the State to promote the common weal. The expiration of the period of the contract as fixed by the parties, or the sale, alienation or transfer of legal possession of the land does not[,] of itself[,] extinguish the relationship. In the latter case, the purchaser or transferee is simply subrogated to the rights and substituted to the obligations of the agricultural lessor. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>However, herein lies the quandary.<br><br>As early as 1981 with the passage of Metro Manila Zoning Ordinance [No.] 81-01, the land in question has ceased to be agricultural. Judicial notice is taken of the fact that Caloocan City where the subject landholding is located is part of Metro Manila whose updated Comprehensive Development Plan and Accompanying Zoning Ordinance 81-01 was found to be in conformity with the requirements of Presidential Decree No. 922, Letter of Instructions (sic) No. 729 and Execut[i]ve Order No. 648 as specifically set out in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) executed on January 11, 1981 between the Metro Manila Commission (now Metro Manila Authority) and the HSRC (Human Settlements Regulatory Commission[,] now HLURB or the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board). In a clarifying Memorandum dated February 14, 1990, Secretary of Justice Franklin M. Drilon opined that prior to June 15, 1988 which is the date of effectivity of RA 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, the powers of the HLURB and the Department of Finance to recategorize lands for land use and taxation purposes, respectively, were exclusive. <b>The point in this entire discourse is that at the time of Macario Susano's death in 1993, there was no longer any tenurial relationship to speak of[,] which could devolve upon the [p]laintiffs by right of succession[,] by virtue of the land's automatic recategorization as non-agricultural [land] in 1981.</b> This does not mean[,] however, that any existing legal rights created prior to the said reclassification may just be automatically shunted aside. On the contrary[,] while [p]laintiffs can no longer insist on physically holding on to the land in question[,] they may still rightfully claim payment of <b>disturbance compensation</b> for and in behalf of the late Macario Susano, their predecessor-in-interest in an amount equivalent to five times the average of the gross harvest on (sic) their landholding during the last five preceding calendar years x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>1.

Without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>Unsatisfied, all of the parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration. Pastor assailed the Regional Adjudicator's finding that Macario was a bona fide and de jure tenant in the said landholding, as well as the order directing him to pay respondents disturbance compensation. Chan, for his part, sought reconsideration with respect to the pronouncement allowing respondents to maintain their peaceful possession of the 7,316-square meter property until they have been paid the computed disturbance compensation.<br><br>Meanwhile, respondents argued that there is no law authorizing the conversion of agricultural lands by the mere passage of a zoning ordinance. To support their contention, respondents cited the Court's pronouncement in <i>Co v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> to the effect that the passage of <u>Metro Manila Zoning Ordinance No. 81-01</u> does not serve to convert existing agricultural lands in the covered area into residential lands or light industrial use lands nor does it have any retroactive effect as to discontinue all previously acquired rights on said lands. They also posit that the said zoning ordinance did not ipso facto convert agricultural lands into non-agricultural lands but merely provided for a guideline for future land use of affected areas.<br><br>On May 18, 1995, the Regional Adjudicator issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> modifying her decision as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the dispositive portion of the questioned decision of December 26, 1994 is PARTIALLY MODIFIED to read as follows:<br><br>1.

The CA reasoned:<br><br><blockquote>x x x As borne by the records, Macario's cultivation of the property as well as [Pastor's] receipt of a portion of the produce therein lasted for a considerable length of time or more than thirty (30) years with nary a protest on the latter's part. To our mind, although petitioner [Pastor] did not expressly give his consent to a tenancy relation with Macario, we find that [Pastor's] acts are indicative of his implied consent to such relationship. Otherwise stated, by allowing Macario Susano to cultivate the subject landholding for a considerable length of time and by receiving a portion of the harvest therein, petitioner is deemed to have impliedly consented to a tenancy relationship with Macario. After all, it is well-settled in law that a tenancy relationship may be established either verbally or in writing, expressly or impliedly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA also held that Pastor and Macario's tenancy relationship was not extinguished despite the reclassification of the subject land into non-agricultural land in 1981 citing our ruling in <i>Alarcon v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The CA concluded that since the subject landholding was sold to Chan who, in turn, failed to notify Macario as required by law, the latter had the right to redeem the said property in accordance with Section 12<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of R.A. No. 3844, as amended, or the <u>Code of Agrarian Reforms of the Philippines</u>.<br><br>On July 27, 2007, the CA denied petitioners' motions for reconsideration.&nbsp; Hence, these consolidated petitions.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>In G.R. No. 179024, the estate of Pastor Samson argues that<br><br><blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals gravely erred in rendering its subject Decision affirming the findings of the RARAD a quo and DARAB that a tenancy relationship existed between the late Pastor M. Samson and the late Macario Susano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner Julian Chan, on the other hand, argues in G.R. No. 179086 that<br><br><blockquote>[I.] The Honorable Court of Appeals grievously erred in recognizing the residential status of the property in question and yet upholding the tenancy relation between Pastor Samson and Macario Susano and in binding herein petitioner thereto[;]<br><br>[II.] The Honorable Court of Appeals grievously erred in misapplying the ruling of this Honorable Court in <i>Alarcon v. Court of Appeals</i>[; and]<br><br>[III.] The Honorable Court of Appeals grievously erred in finding that respondents were entitled to the right of redemption and that the same may still be exercised by respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In sum, at the core of this case is the issue of whether respondents are entitled to the benefits of the OLT Program under P.D. No. 27.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Respondents contend that the sale of Lot 1108-C to Chan is null and void for being contrary to the provisions of P.D. No. 27 and because at the time of the sale, ownership over the said property was already vested in Macario by virtue of the provisions of P.D. No. 27 on the OLT program.<br><br>Chan, for his part, maintained that Macario himself had recognized the validity of the sale of Lot 1108-C to him as shown in the <i>Kusang Loob na Pagtatalaga</i> (Deed of Undertaking), signed by Macario and witnessed by his family members in 1991, and the Joint Motion and Manifestation filed with the MARO of Valenzuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Chan also asserts that when he bought the land from Pastor, it was already classified as residential land following the passage of <u>Metro Manila Zoning Ordinance No. 81-01</u> on March 18, 1981.<br><br>Meanwhile, the estate of Pastor Samson, by way of avoidance, insists that Macario was not Pastor's tenant, reiterating the earlier claim that Macario's occupancy on the said land was by mere tolerance. The estate also argues that if Macario was a tenant, he should have reacted and asserted his alleged rights under agrarian laws when the land he was cultivating was significantly reduced after portions thereof were sold in 1977 and 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>We find in favor of petitioners. Applying our pronouncement in <i>Levardo v. Yatco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we rule that the subject land cannot be subject to the OLT program of P.D. No. 27 for two reasons: first, the subject land is less than seven hectares; and second, respondents failed to show that Pastor owned other agricultural lands in excess of seven hectares or urban land from which he derived adequate income, as required by Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 474.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the DAR Memorandum on the "Interim Guidelines on Retention by Small Landowners" dated July 10, 1975 is explicit:<br><br><blockquote>5.

The relation of the land owner and tenant-farmers in these areas shall be <b>leasehold</b> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote><br>However, while the disputed landholding which had an original aggregate area of only 1.0138 hectares is not covered by the OLT program, the same may still be covered by P.D. No. 27, albeit under its Operation Land Leasehold (OLL) program. The OLL program placed landowners and tenants of agricultural land devoted to rice and corn into a leasehold relationship as of October 21, 1972.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> But the fact that Macario, respondents' predecessor-in-interest, was a de jure tenant must be established.<br><br>Chan maintains that the tenancy relationship between Pastor and Macario, if there was any, ceased following the reclassification of the subject land as belonging to the low intensity residential zone (I-1) as of March 18, 1981. His contention, however, lacks merit in light of our ruling in <i>Co v.

Contrary to what is required by law, however, no independent and concrete evidence were adduced by respondents to prove that there was indeed consent and sharing of harvests between Pastor and Macario.<br><br>It has been repeatedly held that occupancy and cultivation of an agricultural land will not ipso facto make one a de jure tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Independent and concrete evidence is necessary to prove personal cultivation, sharing of harvest, or consent of the landowner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Substantial evidence necessary to establish the fact of sharing cannot be satisfied by a mere scintilla of evidence; there must be concrete evidence on record adequate to prove the element of sharing.
