				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>This is an appeal from the March 31, 2010 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 03732 entitled <i>People of the Philippines v.

While AAA and her brothers were sleeping, Banan poked a knife at the neck of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; He then removed the pants and underwear of AAA and kissed her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Afterwards, he went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; She was not able to shout because Banan covered her mouth with his hand, but she was able to kick him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; She felt pain in her vagina thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On July 12, 2005, Banan again decided to go to the house where AAA and her brothers were staying.&nbsp; However, Florentina cautioned him from doing so, telling him not to disturb them anymore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; As a result, Banan got angry and pushed Florentina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Still, he proceeded to the other house and went up the stairs where AAA and her brother, DDD, were resting.&nbsp; Again, he poked a knife at AAA but it was parried by DDD, who got hit with the knife below the eye.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Because of this commotion, Banan was not able to push through with his intent to molest the complainant for the second time.<br><br>On July 18, 2005, at around 1:00 p.m., AAA was about to go to school with her friends when Florentina's mother, Ining Calagui, called her and told her that Banan was going to give her allowance in his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; At first, AAA was reluctant to go to Banan but upon the advice of one of her friends, she went to his house.&nbsp; When AAA got there, Banan pulled her into the room of the house he shared with Florentina and suddenly kissed her lips and held her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; He was armed with a long bolo tucked in his waist. However, nothing happened because AAA's friends barged in and were able to help her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>AAA did not report these incidents immediately because she was afraid that Banan would kill her entire family.<br><br>Nevertheless, AAA later related the events to her aunt, FFF, who brought her to the police station.&nbsp; On August 1, 2005, she gave her statement before Police Officer Jane Dalumay of the PPP Police Station.&nbsp; Likewise, she was examined by Dr. Mila Lingan-Simangan, Municipal Health Officer of PPP, Cagayan. Her findings are as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>Pelvic Examination:</b><br>Normal looking external genitalia<br>Healed hymenal laceration at 6 &amp; 7 o'clock position<br>Vagina admits tip of index finger easily<br>Adnexae unremarkable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Subsequently, the testimony of Dr. Lingan-Simangan was dispensed with upon agreement by both parties.&nbsp; A similar stipulation was likewise made with respect to the testimonies of AAA's mother and brother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Banan interposed the lone defense of alibi.&nbsp; He alleged that he was employed as a caretaker of fighting cocks by a certain Ric Gammad in Tuguegarao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; He testified that he did not go home from July 9, 2005 to July 19, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; On cross-examination, he revealed that the travel time from his place of work to his house is only 15 minutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Florentina, Banan's wife, corroborated his alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; But upon cross-examination, she testified that Banan came home on July 12, 2005 to commemorate the death of her father and that they also quarreled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC found Banan guilty. The dispositive portion of its Judgment reads:<br><br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, this Court finds accused DOMINGO BANAN y LUMIDO, GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of Rape in Criminal Case No. 10980 defined and penalized under Article 266-A, No. 1 in relation to Article 266 B No. 1 of Republic Act No. 8353 amending Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and imposes upon him the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA. He is likewise liable to pay AAA, the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as indemnity and Fifty Thousand (50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages. Accused is equally found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. 10995 and he shall suffer the indeterminate penalty of&nbsp; x x x ONE (1) MONTH and ONE (1) DAY OF ARRESTO MAYOR as minimum to SIX (6) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of PRISION CORRECCIONAL as maximum.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On March 31, 2010, the CA affirmed the Judgment of the trial court. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tuguegarao City, Branch 4, dated 24 November, 2008, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that, in Criminal Case No. 10995, appellant is sentenced to one (1) month and one (1) day of arresto mayor to two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i> medium and is ORDERED to pay AAA Twenty Thousand (P20,000) as civil indemnity and Thirty Thousand (P30,000) as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>Banan alleges the following lone issue in his <i>Brief</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The court a quo gravely erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape and acts of lasciviousness.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>In his <i>Brief</i>, accused-appellant argues that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; First, he contends that there were inconsistencies in the testimony of the complainant, particularly the date of the incident, that affected its veracity and credibility.&nbsp; Second, he maintains that there was no credible and admissible evidence that he had sexual congress with the private complainant, because the physician who conducted the medical examination did not testify in court. And lastly, he disputes private complainant's identification of him as her rapist considering the circumstances at the time of the incident.&nbsp; He points to her testimony where she stated that the room was very dark and that she could not see anything, nor could she recognize any person who would go upstairs to their room.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>It is a time-honored doctrine that the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses is "entitled to great weight and is even conclusive and binding, if it is not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the reason being the trial judge enjoys the peculiar advantage of observing firsthand the deportment of the witnesses while testifying, and is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In this case, the testimony of the private complainant was very clear on the events that transpired and the person who raped her.

circumstances:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c) By means

Such has been proved in the instant case.<br><br>Contrary to accused-appellant's contentions, the date of the rape is not important.&nbsp; It is not even an element of the crime of rape.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Bunagan</i>, We held that "the exact date of the sexual assault is not an essential element of the crime of rape; what should control is the fact of the commission of the rape or that there is proof of the penetration of the female organ."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In fact, if a minor inconsistency existed, such as the date, it "strengthens rather than diminishes the credibility of complainant as it erases suspicion of a contrived testimony."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Again, the date of the crime is not an essential element of the crime of rape; it is merely a minor inconsistency which cannot affect the credibility of the testimony of the victim.<br><br>What is more, the trial court even noted that the victim was crying while answering questions about the details of her rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We find it proper to reiterate that "when a woman, especially a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that the crime was committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the non-presentation of the doctor who conducted the medical examination is of no concern.&nbsp; The records readily reveal that the testimony of Dr. Lingan-Simangan was dispensed with upon agreement by both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It is well-settled in rape cases that "the lone testimony of the victim, if credible, is sufficient to sustain the verdict of conviction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This is especially true in rape cases where, oftentimes, only two (2) persons are involved¾the offender and the offended party.<br><br>In the instant case, the records clearly show AAA's candor and spontaneity in testifying on the events that transpired.&nbsp; As We held in <i>People v. Caratay</i>, when a witness' testimony is straightforward, candid, and "unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points, the same must be given full faith and credit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> More importantly, no woman, especially one who is young and immature, "would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and thereafter allow herself to be perverted in a public trial if she was not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Blazo</i>, this Court held that "[l]acerations of the hymen, while considered as the most telling and irrefutable physical evidence of the penile invasion, are not always necessary to establish the commission of rape, where other evidence is available to show its consummation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, a medical examination or medical certification is only corroborative and not indispensable to the prosecution of a rape case.<br><br>Also, the crime of acts of lasciviousness has been proved by the prosecution.&nbsp; The elements of this crime under Article 336 of the RPC are: (1) the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) it is done under any of the following circumstances: (a) by using force or intimidation or (b) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious or (c) when the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (3) the offended party is another person of either sex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> All elements are present in this case as testified to by the private complainant, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Now, how about July 18, 2005.
