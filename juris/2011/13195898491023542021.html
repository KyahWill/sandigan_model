In his testimony, FUCC's sole witness, Engr. Dumaliang, explained that many Abstracts for Physical Accomplishments were caused to be prepared by NHA with different reduced amounts reflected thereon, which explains the apparently oscillating figures for Progress Billing No. 6. Engr. Dumaliang admitted that FUCC might have indeed also signed Exhibit "15."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup>&nbsp; In short, FUCC does not disown Exhibit "15." It is FUCC's stance that both Exhibit "IIII" and Exhibit "15" are duly executed documents but Exhibit "IIII," which it alleges was submitted later, supersedes Exhibit "15" and contains the correct amount of FUCC's accomplished works under Progress Billing No. 6.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>These conflicting claims between the parties - as to the correct amount that petitioner is legally liable to pay respondent for Progress Billing No. 6 - was resolved by the CIAC in favor of FUCC.&nbsp; The CIAC found that "the amount of P7,384,534.22 governs over the claim of NHA in its Exhibit "15" for the amount of P6,496,926.29."&nbsp; According to the CIAC, both Exhibit "IIII" and Exhibit "15" were signed by the representatives of FUCC and NHA.&nbsp; However, below the signatures in Exhibit "15" are handwritten notations saying that "such document is not final but conditional."&nbsp; The pertinent portion of the CIAC Decision reads thus:<br><br><blockquote>The Arbitral Tribunal finds the abstract of Physical Accomplishment for Progress Billing No. 6 in Exhibit "IIII" submitted by FUCC in the amount of P7,384,534.22 governs over the claim of NHA in its Exhibit "15" for the amount of P6,496,926.29 (see Stipulated Facts No. 25.1.2).<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal's finding is based on the signature by a representative of FUCC in Exhibit "IIII" together with that of NHA representative (Mr. Borlagdan, Head Tech.

Petitioner's own Exh.`19' shows that it determined the minimum equipment and key staff to be mobilized for the project x x x.&nbsp; It is implicit in these requirements that the infrastructure to house such equipment and personnel (including NHA personnel) and facilitate their mobilization within the project site were also expected to be provided by respondent.&nbsp; Hence, when respondent invested into such infrastructure, it did so with the expectation to recover such costs at the end of the project. As the project was pre-terminated, respondent is justified in seeking recovery of a portion of the costs already incurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup></blockquote><br>The appellate court thus affirmed the award made by the CIAC to FUCC in the amount of P4,545,182.82 representing the pro-rated cost of the facilities constructed by FUCC to support its field operations for the FVR Project (i.e.; the second component under the award for Cost of Materials, Equipment and Facilities, and for Disengagement Costs).&nbsp; The appellate court also affirmed the award in the amount of P132,470.00 representing cost of materials delivered by FUCC to the project site but were not utilized due to the termination of the Contract (i.e.; the first component under the award for Cost of Materials, Equipment and Facilities, and for Disengagement Costs), upon the finding that NHA was solely to be blamed for the lack of inventory of the unutilized materials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>Petitioner disputes the holding of the Court of Appeals and maintains in the instant petition that it is not legally liable to pay FUCC for Cost of Materials, Equipment and Facilities, and for Disengagement Costs because NHA could not have dictated upon FUCC what equipment and key staff to mobilize in the FVR Project, as it was FUCC, logically being the contractor, which determined the kind and number of equipment that should be deployed for the Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup>&nbsp; According to petitioner, Exhibit "19" was transmitted by the Manager of the SLB Region to the PBAC Chairman in preparation for the public bidding of the FVR Project.&nbsp; The SLB Manager listed "the minimum required equipment and key staff that a participating contractor should own (as contradistinguished from `mobilize')" to insure that no "fly-by-night" or puny contractor would participate in the bidding, as "(t)he capability of the contractor to build the Project is known by the equipment he owns."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>In short, it is petitioner's submission that Exhibit "19" was not meant to dictate - and could not have dictated - the kind and number of equipment and key staff that FUCC should mobilize and/or actually mobilized for the FVR Project.&nbsp; It was issued by the Manager of the SLB Region to the PBAC Chairman merely to serve as a checklist on the minimum required number of equipment and key staff that a would-be contractor for the Project should own. Petitioner claims that there is a "whale of difference" between "owning" and "mobilizing," and that this difference "completely escaped" the Court of Appeals when it scrutinized Exhibit "19."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup>&nbsp; Since NHA had allegedly nothing to do with the deployment of FUCC's equipment and machineries for the FVR Project, it should not be made accountable for the dire consequences, if any, of FUCC's business decision or judgment in procuring, maintaining, constructing or dismantling these equipment and facilities, etc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's arguments fail to persuade.&nbsp; The Court subscribes to the view expressed by private respondent that in a government infrastructure project, the department or agency that owns the project dictates not only what facilities, equipment and key technical staff the contractor should mobilize, it dictates as well the financial resources the contractor should muster for the project, the bonds, guarantees and sureties it should put up, the plans, specifications, schedule, and the manner by which it should prosecute the contract works, how it should bill for completed works, how it should document and claim variation orders, etc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup><br><br>Indeed, this appears to be so in the case of the FVR Project.&nbsp; The very Contract entered into by the parties (which appears to be a standard form contract with the blank spaces appropriately filled up) specifies the duration of the contract works and the bonds, guarantees and sureties to be put up by FUCC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> and expressly states that, among other documents, the following shall form part of the Contract, to wit:&nbsp; plans, specifications, certificate of availability of funds, concurrence of lending institutions, duly approved program of work and cost estimates, PERT/CPM or equivalent schedule of work, etc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> all of which demonstrate that NHA, as the owner of&nbsp; the FVR Project, had full control over its implementation.&nbsp; This would certainly have included dictating or imposing, as it were, the minimum equipment and key staff that had to be mobilized by FUCC to undertake the contract works.&nbsp; Otherwise, NHA would have been remiss in its duty to ensure that the Project would be implemented properly and the people's money spent wisely. Indeed, there are rules and guidelines for the implementation of government contracts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> that procuring entities must follow to promote transparency and ensure that all contracts are performed strictly according to specifications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>Be that as it may, even if Exhibit "19" was indeed issued merely to serve as a checklist on the minimum required number of equipment and key staff that a would-be contractor for the FVR Project should own, the document indubitably establishes that FUCC - which was awarded the Contract for the Project - could not have but assembled and mobilized a huge complement of men, materials and equipment to be able to undertake the FVR Project consisting, at the very least, of the equipment and key staff listed in said Exhibit "19," which were the "minimum required" by NHA.&nbsp; Whether FUCC owned the equipment or merely rented them does not alter the fact that it had to provide the infrastructure to house such equipment and key personnel within the project site to support its field operations. FUCC undoubtedly poured in money to put up such infrastructure, with the expectation that it would be able to recover the costs thereof at the end of the Project.&nbsp; Thus, when the FVR Project was terminated due to no fault of FUCC, respondent was eminently "justified in seeking recovery of a portion of the costs already incurred"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> for such infrastructure, as correctly held by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court notes that in ruling as it did, the Court of Appeals merely affirmed the finding of the CIAC that "(w)hen the whole amount of the contract for facilities is not paid due to the termination of said contract which is caused not at contractor's fault, the Contractor should be paid the pro-rated balance having prepared the facilities for the whole project."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup>&nbsp; The Court further notes that the amount of this award for the pro-rated cost of the facilities constructed by FUCC to support its field operations for the FVR Project - P4,545,182.82; as well as the amount of the award for the cost of the unutilized materials delivered by FUCC to the project site - P132,470.00, were not plucked out of thin of air.

The Compliance is not an award, let alone the "Final award" spoken of in Section 16.2 of the Revised CIAC Rules. The CIAC Arbitral Tribunal already rendered a "Final award" in the Decision dated 7 January 2004.&nbsp; The Compliance merely clarifies and presents a re-computation of some items of the "Final award." It does not alter or supersede the "Final award" nor purport to be a new award.&nbsp; Further, Section 10.4 of the Revised CIAC Rules states that in case any Arbitrator should resign, etc., the "CIAC may, within five days from the occurrence of a vacancy x x x, appoint a substitute(s) to be chosen." The use of the permissive "may," rather than the mandatory "shall" indicates that the appointment of a third member of the CIAC Arbitral Tribunal is not indispensable for the tribunal to discharge its functions. The records show that a vacancy in the Arbitral Tribunal occurred with the demise of Lauro M. Cruz. Nothing in the Revised CIAC Rules prevents the remaining two members - who constitute a majority - from complying with the remand orders of the Court of Appeals. The Court thus gives <i>imprimatur</i> and deems as approved the Compliance submitted by the CIAC. We find that it sufficiently complies with the remand orders contained in the CA Decision dated 1 August 2006 and presents a correct method of computation of the arbitral award.<br><br>In the present petition, the sole issue presented by petitioner against the award for Disengagement Costs is that Disengagement Costs, like the Cost of Materials, Equipment and Facilities, and Idle Equipment are business losses which were non-arbitrable under the <i>CIAC Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration</i>, which was in place at the time FUCC filed its Complaint on 17 July 2003.&nbsp; According to petitioner, the Court of Appeals gravely erred when it sustained the CIAC (which ruled that there is no basis to exclude claims for business losses), and held in the Decision dated 1 August 2006 as follows:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with CIAC.&nbsp; In fact, we need not indulge in hair-splitting anymore.&nbsp; In Gammon Philippines, Inc. versus Metro Rail Transit (G.R. No. 144792, January 31, 2006), the Supreme Court held that there is no basis for the exclusion of claims for business losses from the jurisdiction of CIAC. It explained:<br><br><blockquote>Relevantly, while the above-quoted provision of the Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration lists as non-arbitrable issues claims for opportunity/business losses and attorney's fees, this provision was not carried over to the Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration which was approved on November 19, 2005.&nbsp; <u>Such omission is not without good reason. EO 1008 itself excludes from the coverage of the law only those disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which are covered by the Labor Code, conveying an intention to encompass a broad range of arbitrable issues within the jurisdiction of CIAC</u>. (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>Moreover, as pointed out by respondent, the second paragraph of Sec. 2 allows claims for unrealized expected profits and those arising from the rescission or termination of a contract. x x x (pp. 1576-1577, Rollo) Certainly, the claims sought to be satisfied in this case arose from the early termination of the Contract which deprived respondent of the prospect to make profit out of the investment it had already poured into the venture.&nbsp; It makes sense that respondent should be allowed to recover what opportunity it may have lost, especially when it was not to blame for the aborted contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup></blockquote><br>We need not belabor this issue any further.&nbsp; As the appellate court correctly points out, we have already categorically ruled in <b><i>Gammon Philippines, Inc. vs. Metro Rail Transit</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup> that there is no basis for the exclusion of claims for business losses from the jurisdiction of CIAC because Executive Order No. 1008 (EO 1008), the law that created the CIAC, "excludes from the coverage of the law only those disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which are covered by the Labor Code, conveying an intention to encompass a broad range of arbitrable issues within the jurisdiction of CIAC."<br><br>The nature and bases of the awards for Disengagement Costs consisting of three components, namely: Foregone Equipment Rental, Extended Overhead Costs and Foregone Income; and the awards for Cost of Materials, Equipment and Facilities, and Idle Equipment have been discussed at length.&nbsp; They are either business or opportunity losses or foregone profits that resulted from, or are the necessary consequences of, the termination of the Contract.&nbsp; They arose from and are inextricably linked to the construction dispute between NHA and FUCC that was the subject of arbitration proceedings before the CIAC. We find and so hold that they are arbitrable claims within the ambit of Section 4 of EO 1008, which defines the jurisdiction of the CIAC. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 4. <i>Jurisdiction</i>.--The CIAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the disputes arises [sic] before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. These disputes may involve government or private contracts. For the Board to acquire jurisdiction, the parties to a dispute must agree to submit the same to voluntary arbitration.<br><br>The jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to violation of specifications for materials and workmanship; violation of the terms of agreement; interpretation and/or application of contractual provisions; amount of damages and penalties; commencement time and delays; maintenance and defects; payment default of employer or contractor and changes in contract cost.<br><br>Excluded from the coverage of this law are disputes arising from employer-employee relationships which shall continue to be covered by the Labor Code of the Philippines.</blockquote><br>Section 4 provides that "(t)he jurisdiction of the CIAC may include but is not limited to&nbsp; x x&nbsp; x," underscoring the expansive character of the CIAC's jurisdiction. Very clearly, the CIAC has jurisdiction over a broad range of issues and claims arising from construction disputes, including but not limited to claims for unrealized profits and opportunity or business losses.&nbsp; What EO 1008 emphatically excludes is only disputes arising from employer-employee relationships.<br><br>Section 2, Article IV of the previous <i>CIAC Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration</i> cited by petitioner, which purports to exclude claims for business losses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup> contravenes EO 1008 and is a patent nullity; it is void <i>ab initio.&nbsp; </i>In legal contemplation, that section of the previous CIAC Rules never acquired force and effect and cannot be applied to this case. What applies is Section 2.1 of the <i>Revised Rules of Procedures Governing Construction Arbitration</i> that was promulgated on 19 November 2005. Indeed, and as pointed out by the Court of Appeals in the Resolution dated 31 January 2007, CIAC Resolution No. 02-2006 ("Defining the Coverage of the Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration") states that "the Revised Rules shall be applicable to all pending cases upon its effectivity on 15 December 2005 and all cases which are to be filed thereafter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup>&nbsp; This case was filed on 17 July 2003 and was pending as of 15 December 2005.<br><br>But even granting for the moment that Section 2, Article IV of the previous CIAC Rules is a valid provision that may be applied to the case at bar, still the CIAC was eminently correct in ruling that under the first paragraph of Section 2, Article IV, only "opportunity/business losses in addition to liquidated damages" are not arbitrable.&nbsp; When the opportunity/ business losses are sought independently of liquidated damages, as in the instant case, they are perforce arbitrable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup>&nbsp; This ruling of the CIAC was upheld by the Court of Appeals in the Decision dated 1 August 2006.

There is no showing - and petitioner does not allege - that FUCC's consent was sought by the Board of Directors directly or indirectly, through responsible officers of NHA, before Resolution No. 4450<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> was passed.&nbsp; Neither is there any showing - and petitioner does not allege - that NHA made formal representations with FUCC to negotiate the termination of the Contract for the FVR Project.<br><br>What the records reveal, according to the CIAC, is that "(i)n a letter dated 16 October 2001, a Memorandum by the OIC of the FVR Project, recommended for the termination of the Contract.&nbsp; The approval of this Memorandum was recommended by Neofito A. Hernandez, NHA Manager for Southern Luzon/Bicol, and was approved by Edgardo D. Pamintuan, NHA General Manager (Exhibit "1").&nbsp; The following day, 17 October 2001, the NHA General Manager advised FUCC of the termination of the Contract, citing among others that FUCC should `x x x immediately stop the ongoing works and avoid further expenses including the provision of vehicles and other services for the NHA Project Team'."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup><br><br>The foregoing findings of the CIAC support the stance of respondent that NHA unilaterally terminated the Contract; that FUCC was presented with a <i>fait accompli</i>, and there was nothing more that it could do to stop the unilateral termination of the Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as aptly held by the Court of Appeals, the termination was "due to factors well within the control of petitioner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, NHA cannot invoke Clause 3.04.06 of the General Conditions of the Contract, which provides that "(t)he Authority may terminate the Contract upon (10) days written notice to the Contractor, if it is found that reasons beyond the control of either the Authority or Contractor make it impossible or against the Authority's interest to complete the work."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues in the instant petition that "(t)he geological or geographical make up of the Project site is one reason that made it physically difficult - if not impossible - to pursue the FVR Project," and that "(i)t was precisely for this reason that the Project was re-classified from a resettlement to a mixed-used [sic] project."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup><br><br>But as correctly observed by respondent, NHA, as Project owner, was supposed to have known the geological or geographical make-up and the potential hazards of the project site, and should have taken these into account in the original development plan for the FVR Project.&nbsp; It appears that NHA failed to conduct a complete feasibility study and comprehensive technical evaluation of the FVR Project before embarking thereon. Thus, it had to suspend the project and revise the development plans in the middle of the contract works to avert a tragedy, in light of the findings of the MGB, and eventually had to abandon the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup><br><br>Further, while petitioner now claims that the geological or geographical make up of the Project site made it physically difficult - if not impossible - to pursue the FVR Project, which reason is allegedly beyond its control, this reason was never articulated in the letter dated 17 October 2001.&nbsp; In that letter, the NHA General Manager simply advised FUCC of the termination of the Contract and directed that FUCC should immediately stop the ongoing works and avoid further expenses.<br><br>It would appear to the Court that this pretended reason was belatedly and purposely foisted to place the termination within the ambit of the cited Clause 3.04.06. But not only is the reason unavailing, it is utterly misplaced because the letter dated 17 October 2001 does not comply with the 10 day written notice to the contractor required by the very Clause 3.04.06 that petitioner invokes.&nbsp; This letter-notice of NHA imposes an immediate termination with its stern admonition that FUCC should "immediately stop the ongoing works and avoid further expenses including the provision of vehicles and other services for the NHA Project Team."<br><br>In <strong><i>Home Development Mutual Fund vs. Court of Appeals</i></strong><strong>, G.R. No. 118972, 3 April 1998,<i> </i>the Court held that </strong>requirements of contracts as to <b><i>notice </i></b>- as to the <i>time of giving, form</i>, and <i>manner of service </i>thereof - must be strictly observed because in an obligation where a period is designated, it is presumed to have been established for the benefit of both the contracting parties<b>. </b>Thus: <b> </b><br><br><blockquote>The law mandates that Obligations arising from contracts have the force of <b><i>law </i></b>between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith.<br><br>Did petitioners comply with their contractual obligation in good faith, when they served the requisite written notice to private respondents nine (9)<i> </i>days after the expiration of the Agreement? The answer to this crucial question is in the negative.<br><br>The second clause of the contractual provision in dispute is to the effect that written notice of termination should be served at least thirty (30) days in advance. As a rule, the <i>method </i>of terminating a contract is primarily determined by the stipulation of the parties. Thus, the requirements of contracts as to <b><i>notice </i></b>- as to the <i>time of giving, form</i>, and <i>manner of service </i>thereof - must be strictly observed because in an obligation where a period is designated, it is presumed to have been established for the benefit of both the contracting parties. Thus, the unilateral termination of the contract in question by the herein petitioners is violative of the <b><i>principle of mutuality of contracts </i></b>ordained in Art. 1308 of the New Civil Code. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Indeed, even if NHA is permitted to invoke Clause 3.04.06 of the General Conditions of the Contract, its own failure to comply with the notice requirement thereof - being violative of the principle of mutuality of contracts - resulted in the unilateral termination of the Contract.<br><br>In any case, and quite importantly, NHA failed to present evidence to buttress its stance that the termination of the Contract was due to factors beyond its control as to justify the application of Clause 3.04.06. On the contrary, the fact that the NHA Board resolved to redraft the FVR Project as a mixed-use development under a joint venture scheme with interested parties shows that NHA had other options at hand and could have chosen to negotiate with FUCC to amend the Contract instead of deciding to terminate the same.&nbsp; The conclusion is ineluctable: the termination of the Contract was well within the control of NHA, as correctly held by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Petitioner posits that the letter of FUCC to NHA dated 27 August 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> reveals that FUCC explicitly, if not expressly, welcomed or accepted the termination of the FVR Project with alacrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> The letter reads thus:<br><br><blockquote>May we formally inform you that <u>we have refrained from implementing the works under our FVR contract pursuant to your instructions</u> that our contract will be terminated and that project costs should now be contained.<br><br>We were advised that NHA has found FVR to be unsuitable for squatter settlement owing to its unfavorable geology and terrain.

The bond was a condition for the release of the advance payment to FUCC.&nbsp; As agreed upon between the parties, the advance payment was to be recouped by taking partial amounts from the progress payments to FUCC.&nbsp; But nowhere in the contract documents does it state that the Payment Guarantee Bond is a requirement for the processing or release of FUCC's Progress Billings, id. at 1208.<br><br>The following allegation appears in page 33-34 of NHA's Petition; id. at 48-49: "x x x As earlier stated, the procurement or posting of a Payment Guarantee (or Performance) Bond is both a legal and contractual requirement that cannot be excused nor waived, least of all by an entity - like petitioner NHA - performing a vital governmental mandate or function and publicly accountable for every single cent spent in its operations.&nbsp; Such bond, to put it curtly, is a safety net mechanism to ensure recovery of NHA's P38 Million claim for recoupment, which represents the remaining portion of the P85.2 Million (equivalent to 15% of the contract cost) advance payment for mobilization that it still had to recover from or apply to the project billings (See Par. 54 of Affidavit dated 2 December 2003 of Engr.
