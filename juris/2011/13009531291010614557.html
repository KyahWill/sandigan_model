NO. 148287, NOVEMBER 23, 2004, FOR RESPONDENT PDIC'S APPEAL IS FLIMSY AND FRIVOLOUS, POINTLESS AND PURELY DILATORY, GROSSLY PREJUDICIAL TO PETITIONERS<b>.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>The petition has no merit. At the crux of the controversy is the determination of the propriety of the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> in order to assail the denial of a motion to dismiss.<br><br>The denial of a motion to dismiss or to quash, being interlocutory, cannot be questioned by <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; It cannot be the subject of appeal, until a final judgment or order is rendered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; An interlocutory order may be assailed by <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition only when it is shown that the court acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. However, this Court generally frowns upon this remedial measure as regards interlocutory orders. To tolerate the practice of allowing interlocutory orders to be the subject of review by <i>certiorari</i> will not only delay the administration of justice, but will also unduly burden the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>By grave abuse of discretion is meant capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Petitioners argue that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion when it did not dismiss the appeal of the PDIC when the latter failed to file seven copies of the approved record on appeal. Petitioners contend that such omission violated Section 4, Rule 44 of the Rules of Court which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <i>Docketing of case</i> - Upon receiving the original record or the record on appeal and the accompanying documents and exhibits transmitted by the lower court, as well as the proof of payment of the docket and other lawful fees, the clerk of court of the Court of Appeals shall docket the case and notify the parties thereof.<br><br>Within ten (10) days from receipt of said notice, the appellant, in appeals by record on appeal, shall file with the clerk of court seven (7) clearly legible copies of the approved record on appeal, together with the proof of service of two (2) copies thereof upon the appellee.<br><br>Any unauthorized alteration, omission or addition in the approved record on appeal shall be a ground for dismissal of the appeal.</blockquote><br>Petitioners argue that since Section 4, Rule 44 provides for the dismissal of an appeal in case of "any unauthorized alterations, omissions and additions in the approved record on appeal," with more reason that an appeal should be dismissed in case of failure of an appellant to file the requisite copies of the approved record thereof.<br><br>Petitioners' argument is bereft of merit.<br><br>Contrary to petitioners' assertion, a plain reading of Section 4, Rule 44 does not provide that non-submission of copies of the approved record on appeal is a ground to dismiss an appeal. Quite plainly, the rule only reads that should there be "any unauthorized alteration, omission or addition in the approved record of appeal," the same should be considered as a ground for dismissal. Petitioners' construction of the rules would unduly extend its meaning and application as there is no mention therein that non-submission of the required copies is a ground to dismiss an appeal. Moreover, Section 6, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court provides that rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding. Indeed, rules of procedure should be used to promote, not frustrate justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This Court cannot attribute to the CA grave abuse of discretion when simply put, the rules does not provide that non-submission of the copies of the approved record on appeal is a mandatory ground for the dismissal of an appeal.<br><br>Moroever, this Court observes that the PDIC filed on July 15, 2005 its record on appeal and that the same was approved by the RTC in an Order dated May 25, 2006. The CA did not find the non-submission of the copies fatal to PDIC's appeal. In the same vein, this Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA for choosing not to dismiss the appeal as it could just simply ask the PDIC to submit the required copies of the approved record on appeal. In any case, it bears to stress that <i>certiorari</i> will not issue to correct errors of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Anent the second issue raised by petitioners, the same is without merit.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the PDIC's notice of appeal failed to comply with the formal requirements provided for in Section 5, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. Petitioners thus argue that the PDIC's notice of appeal should be considered a mere scrap of paper and treated as if no notice of appeal was filed within the period prescribed under Section 1 (b), Rule 50 the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Section 5, Rule 41 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. <i>Notice</i><i> of appeal</i>. - The notice of appeal shall indicate the parties to the appeal, specify the judgment or final order or part thereof appealed from, specify the court to which the appeal is being taken, and state the material dates showing the timeliness of the appeal.<br></blockquote><br>On the other hand, Section 1(b), Rule 50 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. <i>Grounds for dismissal of appeal.</i> - An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) Failure to file the notice of appeal or the record on appeal within the period prescribed by these Rules;<br></blockquote><br>Specifically, petitioners point out that a perusal of the PDIC's notice of appeal would readily show that said notice failed to state:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>the timely filing of the notice of appeal;<br></li><li>the timely payment of the appeal bond/fees;<br></li><li>the timely filing of the record of appeal;<br></li><li>the appellees; and<br></li><li>the appellate court of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></li></ol><br>The validity of the PDIC's notice of appeal has already been passed upon by the CA in its July 6, 2007 Resolution, which affirmed the findings of the RTC.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of said Resolution is hereunder reproduced, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The timeliness of the filing of petitioner-appellant's Notice of Appeal and Record of Appeal has already been resolved by the court <i>a quo</i> in an Order dated 25 May 2006, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><u>Petitioner Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) filed a Notice of Appeal and Record on Appeal within the reglementary period provided for by law,</u> and taking into consideration the Comment/Opposition, Amended Comment, Supplemental to Amended Comment/Opposition to Petitioner's Notice of Appeal and Record on Appeal filed by Plaintiff-Claimant, thereto, and the Reply and Rejoinder to Petitioner's Reply, <u>the Court hereby resolves to approve the said Record on Appeal</u>.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br>WHEREFORE, let the Record on Appeal, together with the transcript of stenographic notes of the proceedings in this case, be forwarded to the Honorable Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>The Record on Appeal, consisting of seven (7) thick voluminous folders and totaling One Thousand Eight Hundred Forty-Three (1843) pages, was forwarded to this Court on 28 June 2006. <u>A scrutiny thereof shows that the material(s) dates have been cited therein. The Record on Appeal also contains a copy of the assailed Resolution of the <i>court a quo</i> and a copy of the Notice of Appeal found on pages 1782 and 1795 thereof, respectively. Also, per Judicial Records Division (JRD) Report dated 25 June 2007, petitioner-appellant has fully paid its legal fees.</u><br><br>As such and also taking into consideration the Comment/Opposition filed by petitioner-appellant on 22 May 2007 and the Reply to Comment/Opposition filed by claimants-appellants on 4 June 2007, this Court deems petitioner-appellant to have substantially complied with the requirements for the perfection of its appeal.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Again, this Court finds that the CA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the PDIC had substantially complied with the requirements for the perfection of its appeal. While it may be true that the PDIC's notice of appeal did not state on its face the appellate court to which the appeal was being taken, the same is merely a formal error. Moreover, while it is also true that on the face of the notice of appeal the timely filing thereof, the timely filing of the appeal bond/fees, and the timely filing of the record on appeal are all not stated, the same has already been resolved by the CA when it declared that, "<i>The Record on Appeal, consisting of seven (7) thick voluminous folders and totaling One Thousand Eight Hundred Forty-Three (1843) pages, was forwarded to this Court on 28 June 2006. A scrutiny thereof shows that the material(s) dates have been cited therein. The Record on Appeal also contains a copy of the assailed Resolution of the court a quo and a copy of the Notice of Appeal found on pages 1782 and 1795 thereof, respectively. Also, per Judicial Records Division (JRD) Report dated 25 June 2007, petitioner-appellant has fully paid its legal fees</i>." Moreover, the timely filing of the notice of appeal and the record on appeal was resolved by the RTC when it declared that "<i>Petitioner Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) filed a Notice of Appeal and Record on Appeal within the reglementary period provided for by law</i>."<br><br>In addition, petitioners' argument that PDIC should have furnished the notice of appeal not just to the claimants-stockholders but also to the employees of MSLA, Gonzales, BIR, SSS, PAG-IBIG and NHMFC is not meritorious. As correctly observed by PDIC, the claim of the employees of MSLA is a labor claim and was not originally filed with the liquidation court. Moreover, the claim of Gonzales is already final and was earlier approved by the RTC in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> dated May 29, 1998. Lastly, the unremitted taxes due the BIR, unremitted premiums and salary loan payments due SSS, unremitted premiums and salary loan payments due PAG-IBIG, and unremitted loan amortizations due NHMFC fall under the category of trust. Said amounts were already set aside by PDIC for payment as seen in its July 1, 2003 Motion for Approval of Partial Project of Distribution. Assets held in trust do not form part of the assets of MSLA which are to be distributed to its general creditors. Such being the case, since the BIR, SSS, PAG-IBIG and NHMFC are not considered creditors of MSLA, they need not be furnished copies of the notice of appeal. The same, however, does not follow for petitioners-claimants-stockholders, who, being creditors of the MSLA, were correctly served with copies of the notice of appeal. Moreover, it bears to point out that if there is any party who should object to their non-inclusion to the PDIC's notice of appeal, such cause of action belongs to the parties who were allegedly omitted. However, a perusal of the records would show that the parties concerned interposed no objection to their non-inclusion. Consequently, this Court finds that the CA did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it ruled not to dismiss the PDIC's appeal based on the said ground.<br><br>Anent the third error raised by petitioners, the same is again without merit. Petitioners argue that the PDIC's record of appeal is defective for failure to state (1) when the notice of appeal was filed; (2) when the appellate court and docket fees were paid; and (3) when the record on appeal was filed.&nbsp; Moreover, petitioners argue that the PDIC did not include a copy of the May 25, 2006 RTC Order approving the Record of Appeal. Petitioners thus theorize that the PDIC violated Section 6,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Rule 41 of the Rules of Court and that the same warrants dismissal under Section 1 (a) of Rule 50.<br><br>Section 1 (a) reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1<b>. </b><i>Grounds for dismissal of appeal.</i> - An appeal <u>may</u> be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Failure of the record on appeal to show on its face that the appeal was taken within the period fixed by these Rules;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br>To stress, the CA ruled that "<i>the Record on Appeal, consisting of seven (7) thick voluminous folders and totaling One Thousand Eight Hundred Forty-Three (1843) pages, was forwarded to this Court on 28 June 2006. A scrutiny thereof shows that the material(s) dates have been cited therein. The Record on Appeal also contains a copy of the assailed Resolution of the court a quo and a copy of the Notice of Appeal found on pages 1782 and 1795 thereof, respectively. Also, per Judicial Records Division (JRD) Report dated 25 June 2007, petitioner-appellant has fully paid its legal fees</i>." Moreover, the RTC found that both the notice of appeal and record on appeal were filed within the reglementary period provided by law.<br><br>The findings of the CA that the PDIC substantially complied with the requirements for an appeal must be respected. There can be no grave abuse of discretion attributed to it more so since the grounds for dismissing an appeal under Section 1 of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court are discretionary upon the CA. This can be gleaned from the very language of the Rules which uses the word <i>may</i> instead of <i>shall</i>. In <i>De Leon v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we held that Section 1, Rule 50, which provides specific grounds for dismissal of appeal, manifestly "confers a power and does not impose a duty. Moreover, it is directory, not mandatory." With the exception of Section 1(b), the grounds for the dismissal of an appeal are directory and not mandatory, and it is not the ministerial duty of the court to dismiss the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Based on the RTC's findings as well as its own independent assessment of the PDIC's appeal, it was discretionary on the CA whether or not to dismiss the appeal. In ruling to accept the PDIC's appeal, such action does not constitute capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>Lastly, petitioners would have this Court apply the jurisprudence enunciated in <i>Lamzon v. NLRC (Lamzon),</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> <i>Antonio v. Comelec (Antonio)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and <i>Pet Plans, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (Pet Plans),</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> however, a perusal of the said decisions would show that the same are not at fours with herein petition. In <i>Lamzon</i>, the appeal filed was not perfected within the reglementary period because the appeal bond was filed out of time. In <i>Antonio</i>, the appeal was dismissed for having been filed out of time under Comelec rules. In <i>Pet Plans</i>, the appeal was dismissed for failure to comply with the rules on verification and certificate of non-forum shopping. The present petition, on the other hand, involves substantial compliance to the form and contents of the notice of appeal and record on appeal. The decisions relied upon by petitioners, therefore, have no application to herein petition. <sup></sup><br><br>In sum, this Court finds that the CA did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it denied petitioners motion to dismiss. In the absence of abuse of discretion, interlocutory orders such as a motion to dismiss are not the proper subject of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>. Time and again, this Court has ruled that dismissal of appeals on purely technical grounds is not encouraged. The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid and technical sense, for they have been adopted to help secure, not override, substantial justice. Judicial action must be guided by the principle that a party-litigant should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on technicalities. When a rigid application of the rules tends to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, this Court is empowered to suspend their operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The July 6, 2007 Resolution and October 24, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R.
