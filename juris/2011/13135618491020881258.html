Virgilio Calaro, P/Supt. Manuel Roxas and Dr. Wilson Tan, yielded the following version of the facts:<br><br>In the afternoon of April 5, 2001, the drug enforcement unit of the La Loma Police Station 1 received a request for assistance from the sister of accused Milan regarding a drug deal that would allegedly take place in her house at Calavite St., Brgy. Salvacion, Quezon City.&nbsp; The station commander called SPO2 Wilfredo Pilar Red and instructed him to talk to Milan's sister, who was in their office.&nbsp; SPO2 Red, accompanied by Police Officer (PO) 2 Dionisio Alonzo, SPO1 Estores and SPO1 Montecalvo, talked to Milan's sister. Thereafter, SPO2 Red formed a team composed of the officers who accompanied him during the interrogation, with him as team leader.&nbsp; The team received further instructions from the station commander then proceeded to Calavite Street aboard two vehicles, a mobile patrol car and an unmarked car. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>When the team reached the place at around 4:00 p.m., <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> they alighted from their vehicles and surrounded Milan's house.&nbsp; SPO1 Montecalvo's group went to the left side of the house, while SPO2 Red's group proceeded to the right.&nbsp; The two groups eventually met at the back of the house near Milan's room.&nbsp; The door to Milan's room was open, enabling the police officers to see Carandang, Milan and Chua inside.&nbsp; SPO2 Red told the group that the persons inside the room would not put up a fight, making them confident that nothing violent would erupt. However, when the group introduced themselves as police officers, Milan immediately shut the door. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>PO2 Alonzo and SPO2 Red pushed the door open, causing it to fall and propelling them inside the room.&nbsp; PO2 Alonzo shouted "<i>Walang gagalaw!</i>"&nbsp; Suddenly, gunshots rang, hitting PO2 Alonzo and SPO2 Red who dropped to the floor one after the other.&nbsp; Due to the suddenness of the attack, PO2 Alonzo and SPO2 Red were not able to return fire and were instantly killed by the barrage of gunshots.&nbsp; SPO1 Montecalvo, who was right behind SPO2 Red, was still aiming his firearm at the assailants when Carandang shot and hit him.&nbsp; SPO1 Montecalvo fell to the ground.&nbsp; SPO1 Estores heard Chua say to Milan, "<i>Sugurin mo na!</i>"&nbsp; Milan lunged towards SPO1 Montecalvo, but the latter was able to fire his gun and hit Milan. SPO1 Estores went inside the house and pulled SPO1 Montecalvo out. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Reinforcements came at around 4:30 p.m. upon the arrival of P/Sr.&nbsp; Insp. Calaro, Chief Operations Officer of the La Loma Police Station 1, and P/Supt. Roxas, the Deputy Station Commander of Police Station 1 at the time of the incident. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; SPO1 Montecalvo was brought to the Chinese General Hospital.&nbsp; Milan stepped out of the house and was also brought to a hospital, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> but Carandang and Chua remained holed up inside the house for several hours.&nbsp; There was a lengthy negotiation for the surrender of Carandang and Chua, during which they requested for the presence of a certain Colonel Reyes and media man Ramon Tulfo. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; It was around 11:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight when Carandang and Chua surrendered. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; SPO2 Red and PO2 Alonzo were found dead inside the house, their bodies slumped on the floor with broken legs and gunshot and grenade shrapnel wounds. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Winston Tan, Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, conducted the post-mortem examination of the bodies of SPO2 Red and PO2 Alonzo.&nbsp; He found that the gunshot wounds of Red and Alonzo were the cause of their deaths. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>According to SPO1 Montecalvo's account, Dr. Bu Castro of the Chinese General Hospital operated on him, removing a bullet from the right portion of his nape.&nbsp; SPO1 Montecalvo's hospitalization expenses amounted to P14,324.48.&nbsp; He testified that it was a nightmarish experience for him as he feared that he might be paralyzed later on. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The defense presented the three accused as witnesses, testifying as follows:<br><br>Carandang claims that he had no firearm during the incident, and that it was the police officers who fired all the shots.&nbsp; He was in Milan's house during the incident in order to ask Milan to accompany him to convert his cellular phone's SIM card. When he arrived at Milan's place, he found Milan and Chua playing a card game.&nbsp; A short time later, there was banging on the door.&nbsp; The door of the house was destroyed and gunfire suddenly erupted, prompting him to take cover under a bed.&nbsp; Chua cried out to him that he was hit and that he might lose blood. Milan ran outside and sustained injuries as well.&nbsp; There was an explosion near the door, causing burns on Carandang's left arm.&nbsp; Gunfire continued coming from different directions for two to three minutes.&nbsp; Suddenly, the place became dark as the lights went out. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Since gunshots were still heard every now and then, Carandang stayed in the house and did not come out.&nbsp; Col. Tor, the new Chief of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Sikatuna, negotiated for Carandang to come out.&nbsp; Carandang requested for the presence of his wife, Col. Doroteo Reyes and media man Ramon Tulfo.&nbsp; He went out of the house at around midnight when the three arrived. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Milan testified that he was at home in Calavite St. at the time of the incident.&nbsp; He knew Carandang for seven months.&nbsp; Chua was their neighbor.&nbsp; While playing a card game inside his room, they heard someone pounding at the door. He stood and approached the door to check.&nbsp; The door was destroyed, and two unidentified men barged in.&nbsp; Gunshots erupted.&nbsp; He was hit on the left side of his body.&nbsp; He ran out of the room, leaving Chua and Carandang behind.&nbsp; As he was doing so, he saw his mother lying down and shouting "<i>Itigil niyo ang putukan; maraming matatanda dito!</i>" Milan was then hit on his left leg by another gunshot. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Chua testified that he went to the house of Milan at around noontime of April 4, 2001 to play a card game.&nbsp; They played inside Milan's ground floor room.&nbsp; Five to ten minutes later, Carandang arrived and laid down on the bed.&nbsp; Chua did not pay much attention as Milan and Carandang discussed about cellular phones.&nbsp; Later, they heard a loud banging in the door as if it was being forced open. Milan stood up to see what was happening.&nbsp; Chua remained seated and Carandang was still on the bed.&nbsp; The door was forcibly opened.&nbsp; Chua heard successive gunshots and was hit on his left big toe.&nbsp; He ducked on the floor near the bed to avoid being hit further.&nbsp; He remained in that position for several hours until he lost consciousness.&nbsp; He was already being treated at the Chinese General Hospital when he regained consciousness.&nbsp; In said hospital, a paraffin test was conducted upon him. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>P/Sr. Insp. Grace Eustaquio, Forensic Chemist of the PNP Crime Laboratory, later testified that the paraffin test on Chua yielded a negative result for gunpowder nitrates, but that performed on Carandang produced a positive result.&nbsp; She was not able to conduct a paraffin test on Milan, who just came from the operating room when she saw him.&nbsp; Milan seemed to be in pain and refused to be examined. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On April 22, 2003, the trial court rendered its Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> finding Carandang, Milan and Chua guilty of two counts of murder and one count of frustrated murder:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused RESTITUTO CARANDANG, HENRY MILAN AND JACKMAN CHUA <i>guilty</i> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder described and penalized under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Article 63 of the same Code, for the killing&nbsp; of SPO2 Wilfredo Pilar Red and PO2 Dionisio Alonzo qualified by treachery and acting in conspiracy with each other, they are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of murder and to indemnify the heirs of the victims, jointly and severally, as follows:<br><blockquote>To the heirs of SPO2 Wilfredo Red:<br><ol><li>P50,000.00 as civil indemnity;<br></li><li>P50,000.00 as moral damages;<br></li><li>P149,734.00 as actual damages; and<br></li><li>P752,580.00 as compensatory damages<br></li></ol><br>To the heirs of PO2 Dionisio Alonzo:<br><ol><li>P50,000.00 as civil indemnity;<br></li><li>P50,000.00 as moral damages;<br></li><li>P139,910.00 as actual damages; and<br></li><li>P522,960.00 as compensatory damages.</li></ol></blockquote><br>Likewise, finding the accused Restituto Carandang, Henry Milan and Jackman Chua guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated murder, described and penalized under Article 249 in relation to Article 6, paragraph 2, having acted in conspiracy with each other and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, they are hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of six (6) years of <i>prision mayor</i> to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, and to indemnify the victim Wilfredo Montecalvo as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>P14,000.00 as actual damages;<br></li><li> P20,000.00 as moral damages;<br></li><li>P20,000.00 as reasonable attorney's fees; and<br></li><li>To pay the costs. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><br>Carandang, Milan and Chua appealed to this Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The appeals were separately docketed as G.R.

Mateo</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the appeals were transferred <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> to the Court of Appeals, where they were assigned a single docket number, CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 01934.<br><br>On May 10, 2006, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision modifying the Decision of the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 76, in Criminal Case Nos. Q-01-100061-63 finding accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Murder and one (1) count of Frustrated Murder is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS as follows:<br><br>1) In Criminal Case Nos. Q-01-100061 and Q-01-100062, accused-appellants are hereby ordered to pay the heirs of PO2 Dionisio S. Alonzo and SPO2 Wilfredo P. Red an indemnity for loss of earning capacity in the amount of P2,140,980.69 and P2,269,243.62, respectively; and<br><br>2) In Criminal Case No. Q-01-100063, accused-appellants are hereby instead sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor, </i>as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum.<br><br>With costs against the accused-appellants. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>Milan and Chua appealed to this Court anew. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Carandang did not appeal, and instead presented a letter informing this Court that he is no longer interested in pursuing an appeal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; On April 9, 2008, Milan and Chua filed a Supplemental Appellant's Brief to further discuss the Assignment of Errors they presented in their September 28, 2004 Appellant's Brief:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>The court <i>a quo</i> erred in holding that there was conspiracy among the appellants in the case at bar.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>Assuming arguendo that conspiracy exists, the court <i>a quo</i> gravely erred in convicting them of the crime of murder and frustrated murder instead of homicide and frustrated homicide only, the qualifying circumstance of treachery not having been duly proven to have attended the commission of the crimes charged. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court had ruled that Carandang, Milan and Chua acted in conspiracy in the commission of the crimes charged.&nbsp; Thus, despite the established fact that it was Carandang who fired the gun which hit SPO2 Red, PO2 Alonzo and SPO1 Montecalvo, all three accused were held equally criminally responsible therefor.&nbsp; The trial court explained that Carandang, Milan and Chua's actuations showed that they acted in concert against the police officers.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of the RTC Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Milan, Carandang and Chua were all inside the room of Milan.&nbsp; Upon arrival of police officers Red, Alonzo and the others and having identified themselves as police officers, the door was closed and after Alonzo and Red pushed it open and as Alonzo shouted, "<i>walang gagalaw</i>," immediately shots rang out from inside the room, felling Alonzo, then Red, then Montecalvo.&nbsp; Chua was heard by Estores to shout to Milan: "Sugurin mo na" (tsn, October 16, 2001, page 8).&nbsp; And as Milan lunged at Montecalvo, the latter shot him.<br><br>That the three acted in concert can be gleaned from their actuations.&nbsp; First, when they learned of the presence of the police officers, they closed the door. Not one of them came out to talk peacefully with the police officers.&nbsp; Instead, Carandang opened fire, Alonzo and Red did not even have the chance to touch their firearms at that instant. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>In affirming this ruling, the Court of Appeals further expounded on the acts of Milan and Chua showing that they acted in concert with Carandang, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In the present case, when appellants were alerted of the presence of the police officers, Milan immediately closed the door. Thereafter, when the police officers were finally able to break open said door, Carandang peppered them with bullets.&nbsp; PO2 Alonzo and SPO2 Red died instantly as a result while SPO1 Montecalvo was mortally wounded.&nbsp; Then, upon seeing their victims helplessly lying on the floor and seriously wounded, Chua ordered Milan to attack the police officers.&nbsp; Following the order, Milan rushed towards Montecalvo but the latter, however, was able to shoot him.<br><br>At first glance, Milan's act of closing the door may seem a trivial contribution in the furtherance of the crime.&nbsp; On second look, however, that act actually facilitated the commission of the crime.&nbsp; The brief moment during which the police officers were trying to open the door paved the way for the appellants to take strategic positions which gave them a vantage point in staging their assault.&nbsp; Thus, when SPO2 Red and PO2 Alonzo were finally able to get inside, they were instantly killed by the sudden barrage of gunfire.&nbsp; In fact, because of the suddenness of the attack, said police officers were not able to return fire.<br><br>Insofar as Chua is concerned, his participation in the conspiracy consisted of lending encouragement and moral ascendancy to his co-conspirators as evidenced by the fact that he ordered Milan to attack the already fallen police officers with the obvious intention to finish them off. Moreover, he did not immediately surrender even when he had the opportunity to do so but instead chose to stay with Carandang inside the room until their arrest. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>Milan and Chua object to the conclusion that they were in conspiracy with Carandang due to their acts of closing the door and not peaceably talking to the police officers.&nbsp; According to them, those acts were caused by their being frightened by the police officers who were allegedly in full battle gear. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Milan and Chua further assert that the fortuitous and unexpected character of the encounter and the rapid turn of events should have ruled out a finding of conspiracy. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; They claim that the incident happened so fast, giving them no opportunity to stop Carandang. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Appellants contest the factual finding that Chua directed Milan to go after SPO1 Montecalvo, alleging that they were both unarmed and that there was no way for Milan to attack an armed person.&nbsp; What really happened, according to them, was that Milan ran out of the room for safety and not to attack SPO1 Montecalvo. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Milan claims that he was already injured in the stomach when he ran out, and it was natural for him to seek safety.<br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Chua uttered "<i>Sugurin mo na</i>!" to Milan, appellants argue that no crime was committed due to the same as all the victims had already been shot when said words were shouted. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, it appears to have been uttered as a result of indiscretion or lack of reflection and did not inherently carry with it inducement or temptation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the Supplemental Brief, Milan and Chua point out that the assault on the victims was the result of the impulsive act of Carandang and was not a result of any agreement or a concerted action of all the accused. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; They claim that when the shootout ensued, Chua immediately dove down near the bed while Milan ran out of the room out of fear. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; It is allegedly hard to imagine that SPO1 Montecalvo with certainty heard Chua utter the phrase <i>"Sugurin mo na,"</i> considering that the incident happened so fast, there were lots of gunshots. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>To summarize, Milan's and Chua's arguments focus on the lack of direct evidence showing that they conspired with Carandang during the latter's act of shooting the three victims.&nbsp; However, as we have held in <i>People v.
