ours.)</blockquote><br>During the arraignment of the accused-appellant on November 28, 2000, he entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; On March 13, 2001, the pre-trial conference of the cases was conducted and the parties stipulated on the identity of the accused-appellant in all the cases, the minority of the victim and the fact that the accused appellant is the uncle of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The pre-trial order containing the foregoing stipulations was signed by the accused and his counsel.&nbsp; The cases were then heard on consolidated trial.<br><br>The prosecution presented the lone testimony of AAA to prove the charges against the accused-appellant.&nbsp; AAA testified that she was born on November 1, 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; In one afternoon when she was only eight years old, she stated that the accused-appellant raped her inside their house.&nbsp; She could not remember, though, the exact month and date of the incident. The accused-appellant stripped off her shorts, panties and shirt and went on top of her.&nbsp; He had his clothes on and only pulled down his zipper.&nbsp; He then pulled out his organ, put it in her vagina and did the pumping motion.&nbsp; AAA felt pain but she did not know if his organ penetrated her vagina. When he pulled out his organ, she did not see any blood.&nbsp; She did so only when she urinated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>AAA also testified that the accused-appellant raped her again in July 1999 for five times on different nights.&nbsp; The accused-appellant was then drinking alcohol with BBB, the stepfather of AAA, in the house of AAA's neighbor.&nbsp; He came to AAA's house, took off her panty and went on top of her. She could not see what he was wearing as it was nighttime.&nbsp; He made her hold his penis then he left.&nbsp; When asked again how the accused-appellant raped her for five nights in July of the said year, AAA narrated that he pulled down her panty, went on top of her and pumped. She felt pain as he put his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; Every time she urinated, thereafter, she felt pain.&nbsp; AAA said that she recognized the accused-appellant as her assailant since it was a moonlit night and their window was only covered by cloth.&nbsp; He entered through the kitchen as the door therein was detached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>AAA further related that the accused-appellant raped her again twice in August 1999 at nighttime.&nbsp; He kissed her and then he took off his shirt, went on top of her and pumped.&nbsp; She felt pain in her vagina and in her chest because he was heavy.&nbsp; She did not know if his penis penetrated her vagina.&nbsp; She related that the accused-appellant was her uncle as he was the brother of her mother.&nbsp; AAA said that she did not tell anybody about the rapes because the accused-appellant threatened to kill her mother if she did.&nbsp; She only filed a complaint when he proceeded to also rape her younger sister, DDD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After the testimony of AAA, the prosecution formally offered its documentary evidence, consisting of: (1) Exhibit A - the Medico-Legal Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which contained the results of the medical examination conducted on AAA by Dr. Rommel Capungcol and Dr. Melissa Adel Gagala on October 26, 1999; and (2) Exhibit B - the Social Case Study Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> pertaining to AAA's case, which was issued by the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office of the Province of Leyte.<br><br>The Medico-Legal Report stated the following findings:<br><br><blockquote>P.

He did not go to the house of AAA as the latter's parents were his enemies.&nbsp; He said that he had a quarrel with AAA's parents because he did not work with them in the ricefields.&nbsp; He further recounted that in July 1999, he was also living in Tacloban City and worked there as a dishwasher at a restaurant.&nbsp; He worked there from 1998 up to September 1999. The accused-appellant likewise stated that in August 1999, he was still working at the same restaurant in Tacloban City.&nbsp; While working there, he did not go home to XXX as he was busy with work.&nbsp; He denied that he would have drinking sprees with AAA's stepfather, BBB, because they were enemies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, the accused-appellant admitted that the mother of AAA was his sister and they were close to each other.&nbsp; He said that his parents were still alive in 1995 up to October 1999 and the latter then resided at Calaasan, Alangalang, Leyte.&nbsp; He indicated that his parents' house was about two kilometers away from the house of AAA.&nbsp; While he was working at the restaurant in Tacloban City, he would visit his parents once every month, mainly on Sundays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>The Judgment of the RTC</u></i></b><br><br>On September 9, 2002, the RTC of Tacloban City, Branch 7, rendered a Decision convicting the accused-appellant as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, pursuant to Art. 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended, and further amended by R.A. 8353 (Rape Law of 1997) and R.A. 7659 (Death Penalty Law) the Court found accused <b>HENRY ARPON</b>, <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of <b>ONE COUNT OF STATUTORY RAPE</b> and <b>SEVEN COUNTS OF RAPE</b> charged under the informations and sentenced to suffer the maximum penalty of <b>DEATH</b>, and to indemnify the victim, [AAA] the amount of <b>Fifty</b> Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos for each count of Rape and pay moral damages in the amount of <b>Fifty</b> Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos and <b>pay the cost</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphases in the original.)</blockquote><br>The court <i>a quo</i> found more credible the testimony of AAA.&nbsp; The fact that AAA was in tears when she testified convinced the trial court of the truthfulness of her rape charges against the accused-appellant.&nbsp; If there were inconsistencies in AAA's testimony, the trial court deemed the same understandable considering that AAA was pitted against a learned opposing counsel. The delay in the reporting of the rape incidents was not also an indication that the charges were fabricated. Moreover, the trial court ruled that the findings of the medico-legal officer confirmed that she was indeed raped. The accused-appellant's defense of alibi was likewise disregarded by the trial court, declaring that it was not physically impossible for him to be present in XXX at any time of the day after working hours while he was working in Tacloban City.&nbsp; The trial court stated that the accused-appellant was positively identified by AAA as the person who sexually abused her and she held no grudge against him.&nbsp; The trial court imposed the penalty of death as it found that AAA was less than 18 years old at the time of the commission of the rape incidents and the accused-appellant was her uncle, a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree. The trial court also appreciated against the accused-appellant the aggravating circumstances of abuse of confidence and nighttime.<br><br>The accused-appellant filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the RTC Decision, asserting that the trial court failed to consider his minority as a privileged mitigating circumstance.&nbsp; As stated in his direct examination, the accused-appellant claimed that he was born on February 23, 1982, such that he was only 13 and 17 years old when the incidents of rape allegedly occurred in 1995 and 1999, respectively.&nbsp; In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated November 6, 2002, the trial court denied the accused-appellant's motion, holding that the latter failed to substantiate with clear and convincing evidence his allegation of minority.<br><br>The cases were elevated to the Court on automatic review and were docketed as G.R. Nos. 165201-08.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; The parties then filed their respective briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; On February 7, 2006, we resolved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to transfer the cases to the Court of Appeals pursuant to our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The cases were docketed in the appellate court as CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 00560.<br><br><b><i><u>The Decision of the Court of Appeals</u></i></b><br><br>On February 8, 2008, the Court of Appeals promulgated its assailed decision, decreeing thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated September 9, 2002 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 7, Tacloban City in Criminal Case Nos. 2001-01-46 to 2001-01-53 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with modification awarding exemplary damages to [AAA] in the amount of Twenty[-]Five Thousand (P25,000.00) Pesos for each count of rape and clarification that the separate award of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages likewise pertains to each count of rape.&nbsp; The death penalty imposed is reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in accord with Rep. Act No. 9346.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals adjudged that the inconsistencies pointed out by the accused-appellant in the testimony of AAA were not sufficient to discredit her. The appellate court held that the exact age of AAA when the incidents of rape occurred no longer mattered, as she was still a minor at the time.&nbsp; More significant was her "straightforward, categorical and candid testimony" that she was raped eight times by the accused-appellant.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals also agreed with the ruling of the RTC that AAA's charges of rape conformed with the physical evidence and the accused-appellant's uncorroborated defense of alibi could not stand against the positive identification made by AAA.<br><br>As regards the attendant circumstances, the Court of Appeals ruled that the relationship of the accused-appellant to AAA was both alleged in the informations and admitted by the accused-appellant.&nbsp; The appellate court, however, differed in appreciating against the accused-appellant the qualifying circumstance of AAA's minority. The lone testimony of AAA on the said circumstance was held to be an insufficient proof therefor.&nbsp; The aggravating circumstance of nighttime was also ruled to be inapplicable as it was not shown that the same was purposely sought by the accused-appellant or that it facilitated the commission of the crimes of rape.&nbsp; In view of the presence of the qualifying circumstance of relationship, the Court of Appeals awarded exemplary damages in favor of AAA.<br><br>The accused-appellant filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of the above decision and the same was given due course by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated May 27, 2008.<br><br>On November 17, 2008, the Court resolved to accept the appeal and required the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desire, within 30 days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, in a Manifestation and Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> filed on December 24, 2008, the plaintiff-appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General, prayed that it be excused from filing a supplemental brief.&nbsp; On February 3, 2009, the accused-appellant submitted a Supplemental Brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>The Issues</u></i></b><br><br>In the accused-appellant's brief, the following issues were invoked:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIMES CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE AND INCONSISTENT TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<br><br><center>III</center><br><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>The accused-appellant insists that it was error on the part of the RTC to give weight to the incredible testimony of AAA.&nbsp; He alleges that AAA could not state with consistency the exact date when she was first supposedly raped, as well as her age at that time.&nbsp; The accused-appellant also avers that AAA could not remember the dates of the other incidents of rape charged, all of which were allegedly described in a uniform manner.&nbsp; Contrary to the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the accused-appellant posits that the above inconsistencies cannot merely be discounted as insignificant. He further insists that the qualifying circumstances of AAA's minority and her relationship to the accused-appellant were not duly proven by the prosecution.&nbsp; The accused-appellant, thus, prays for a judgment of acquittal.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>The Ruling of the Court</i></b><br><br>After a careful examination of the records of this case, the Court resolves to deny the appeal, but with a modification of the penalties and the amount of indemnities awarded.<br><br>To recall, the RTC and the Court of Appeals found the accused-appellant guilty of one (1) count of statutory rape and seven (7) counts of qualified rape.<br><br>Under the information in Criminal Case No. 2000-01-46, the first incident of rape was alleged to have occurred in 1995 when AAA was only eight years old. However, the accused-appellant points out that the prosecution failed to substantiate the said fact as AAA's testimony thereon was too inconsistent and incredible to be worthy of any belief. He explains that AAA initially claimed that she was raped for the first time when she was eight years old. Nonetheless, during her testimony regarding the incidents of rape that occurred in July 1999, she said that the accused did the same thing that he did to her when she was only seven years old. On her redirect examination, AAA then stated that she was first raped in 1998 when she was eleven (11) years old.<br><br>Presently, Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code defines the crime of rape by sexual intercourse as follows:<br><br><blockquote>ART.&nbsp; 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed</i>.&nbsp; - Rape is committed -<br><br>1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a. Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br><br>d. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</blockquote><br>In particular, "Article 266-A(1)(d) spells out the definition of the crime of statutory rape, the elements of which are: (1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) that such a woman is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The above provision came into existence by virtue of Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> or the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, which took effect on October 22, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Prior to this date, the crime of rape was penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> which provides:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 335.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>When and how rape is committed</i>. -- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><ol><li>By using force or intimidation;<br></li><li>When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br></li><li>When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.</li></ol></blockquote><br>In <i>People v. Macafe</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> we explained the concept of statutory rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>Rape under paragraph 3 of [Article 335] is termed statutory rape as it departs from the usual modes of committing rape.&nbsp; <b>What the law punishes in statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below twelve years old.&nbsp; Hence, force and intimidation are immaterial; the only subject of inquiry is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge took place</b>.&nbsp; The law presumes that the victim does not and cannot have a will of her own on account of her tender years; the child's consent is immaterial because of her presumed incapacity to discern evil from good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Manifestly, the elements of statutory rape in the above-mentioned provisions of law are essentially the same.&nbsp; Thus, whether the first incident of rape charged in this case did occur in 1995, <i>i.e.</i>, before the amendment of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, or in 1998, after the effectivity of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, the prosecution has the burden to establish the fact of carnal knowledge and the age of AAA at the time of the commission of the rape.<br><br>Contrary to the posturing of the accused-appellant, "the date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime of rape, for the gravamen of the offense is carnal knowledge of a woman."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; "Inconsistencies and discrepancies in details which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime are not grounds for acquittal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As regards the first incident of rape, the RTC credited with veracity the substance of AAA's testimony.&nbsp; On this matter, we reiterate our ruling in <i>People v. Condes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>Time and again, the Court has held that when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are often accorded finality. The trial judge has the advantage of observing the witness' deportment and manner of testifying. Her "furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath" are all useful aids for an accurate determination of a witness' honesty and sincerity. The trial judge, therefore, can better determine if witnesses are telling the truth, being in the ideal position to weigh conflicting testimonies. Unless certain facts of substance and value were overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case, its assessment must be respected for it had the opportunity to observe the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying and detect if they were lying.

However, the records of this case show neither any objection to the said testimony on the part of the prosecution, nor any contrary evidence to dispute the same.&nbsp; Thus, the RTC and the Court of Appeals should have appreciated the accused-appellant's minority in ascertaining the appropriate penalty.<br><br>Although the acts of rape in this case were committed before Republic Act No. 9344 took effect on May 20, 2006, the said law is still applicable given that Section 68 thereof expressly states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 68. <i>Children Who Have Been Convicted and are Serving Sentences</i>. -- Persons who have been convicted and are serving sentence at the time of the effectivity of this Act, and who were below the age of eighteen (18) years at the time of the commission of the offense for which they were convicted and are serving sentence, shall likewise benefit from the retroactive application of this Act.&nbsp; They shall be entitled to appropriate dispositions provided under this Act and their sentences shall be adjusted accordingly.&nbsp; They shall be immediately released if they are so qualified under this Act or other applicable law.</blockquote><br><i>People v.

We likewise find that in the said instances, the accused-appellant acted with discernment.&nbsp; In <i>Madali v.

In this case, the fact that the accused-appellant acted with discernment was satisfactorily established by the testimony of AAA, which we had already found to be credible.&nbsp; Verily, AAA testified that she at first did not tell anybody about the sexual assault she suffered at the hands of the accused-appellant because the latter told her that he would kill her mother if she did so. That the accused-appellant had to threaten AAA in an effort to conceal his dastardly acts only proved that he knew full well that what he did was wrong and that he was aware of the consequences thereof.<br><br>Accordant with the second paragraph of Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and in conformity with our ruling in <i>Sarcia</i>, when the offender is a minor under eighteen (18) years of age, "the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall be imposed, but always in the proper period.&nbsp; However, for purposes of determining the proper penalty because of the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority, the penalty of death is still the penalty to be reckoned with."&nbsp; Thus, for the second and third counts of rape, the proper penalty imposable upon the accused-appellant is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count.<br><br>Had the trial court correctly appreciated in favor of the accused-appellant the circumstance of his minority, the latter would have been entitled to a suspension of sentence for the second and third counts of rape under Section 38 of Republic Act No. 9344, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 38.&nbsp; <i>Automatic Suspension of Sentence</i>. -- Once the child who is under eighteen (18) years of age at the time of the commission of the offense is found guilty of the offense charged, the court shall determine and ascertain any civil liability which may have resulted from the offense committed.&nbsp; However, instead of pronouncing the judgment of conviction, the court shall place the child in conflict with the law under suspended sentence, without need of application. <i>Provided, however</i>, That suspension of sentence shall still be supplied even if the juvenile is already eighteen years (18) of age or more at the time of the pronouncement of his/her guilt.<br><br>Upon suspension of sentence and after considering the various circumstances of the child, the court shall impose the appropriate disposition measures as provided in the Supreme Court Rule on Juvenile in Conflict with the Law.</blockquote><br>Be that as it may, the suspension of sentence may no longer be applied in the instant case given that the accused-appellant is now about 29 years of age and Section 40 of Republic Act No. 9344 puts a limit to the application of a suspended sentence, namely, when the child reaches a maximum age of 21.&nbsp; The said provision states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 40.&nbsp; <i>Return of the Child in Conflict with the Law to Court</i>. -- If the court finds that the objective of the disposition measures imposed upon the child in conflict with the law have not been fulfilled, or if the child in conflict with the law has willfully failed to comply with the conditions of his/her disposition or rehabilitation program, the child in conflict with the law shall be brought before the court for execution of judgment.<br><br>If said child in conflict with the law has reached eighteen (18) years of age while under suspended sentence, the court shall determine whether to discharge the child in accordance with this Act, to order execution of sentence, <b>or to extend the suspended sentence for a certain specified period or until the child reaches the maximum age of twenty-one (21) years</b>. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Nonetheless, the disposition set forth under Section 51 of Republic Act No. 9344 is warranted in the instant case, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 51.&nbsp; <i>Confinement of Convicted Children in Agricultural Camps and Other Training Facilities</i>. -- A child in conflict with the law may after conviction and upon order of the court, be made to serve his/her sentence, in lieu of confinement in a regular penal institution, in an agricultural camp and other training facilities that may be established, maintained, supervised and controlled by the [Bureau of Corrections], in coordination with the [Department of Social Welfare and Development].</blockquote><br>Additionally, the civil liability of the accused-appellant for the second and third incidents of rape shall not be affected by the above disposition and the same shall be enforced in accordance with law and the pronouncements in the prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br><b><i><u>Civil Liability</u></i></b><br><br>The Court recently ruled in <i>People v.
