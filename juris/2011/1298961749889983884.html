The informant disclosed that she was asked by "Myrna" to look for a buyer of her stuff and to meet her at the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant located in Welcome Rotonda, Galas, Quezon City (KFC Welcome Rotonda) in case she already found one.<br><br>Acting on the information given by the informant, DAID Chief Colonel Gerardo B. Ratuita immediately formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation composed of Police Chief Inspector Arnold Abad as team leader, with PO3 Hernandez, PO3 Magcalayo, PO2 Emeterio Mendoza, PO3 Villamor, PO1 Michael Collado, and PO2 Edmond Paculdar as members.<br><br>PO3 Villamor was designated as the poseur-buyer, while the other members served as back-up.&nbsp; PO3 Villamor was furnished a 500-peso bill with Serial No. XD338194, which he marked with his initials "JV" on the upper portion.<br><br>After a short briefing and preparation, the buy-bust team, along with the informant, proceeded to KFC Welcome Rotonda.&nbsp; PO3 Villamor and the informant waited for "Myrna" in front of said establishment, while the rest of the team positioned themselves within viewing distance to allow them to covertly monitor the operation.<br><br>After waiting for about an hour, "Myrna" arrived with a female companion. The informant waved at "Myrna."&nbsp; When the latter approached them, the informant introduced PO3 Villamor to her as "Kuya Jerry," a prospective buyer of <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>Thereafter, PO3 Villamor asked "Myrna" whether she had an "item" with her at that time.&nbsp; In response, "Myrna" went to the side of the fastfood chain, took out one (1) small heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from her pocket and showed it to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; But as she did so, two (2) other sachets fell out from the pocket of her pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; When "Myrna" handed the sachet containing a white crystalline substance to PO3 Villamor, the latter, in turn, handed her the 500-peso buy-bust money.<br><br>Afterwards, PO3 Villamor removed his earring to signal to his team members that the transaction was already consummated.&nbsp; PO3 Magcalayo and the other members of the team immediately rushed to the scene and introduced themselves as police officers. PO3 Magcalayo recovered the buy-bust money from "Myrna," while PO3 Villamor recovered the other two (2) plastic sachets also from her.&nbsp; They then arrested both "Myrna" and her companion, later identified as Saguera Samula y Dalunan (Samula), after informing them of the nature of their offense and their constitutional rights. "Myrna," who was later identified as Nene Quiamanlon, and Samula, as well as the recovered articles, were brought to the station for proper investigation and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>PO3 Villamor, who maintained custody over the seized sachets, marked the said items in his possession, recorded them in an inventory, and handed them over to the Duty Desk Officer, PO3 Hernandez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; PO3 Magcalayo likewise turned over the buy-bust money to PO3 Hernandez, who prepared a Request for Laboratory Examination.&nbsp; Said request, with the seized sachets, were brought by PO3 Magcalayo to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, where they were received by PO2 Golpo and examined by Engr. Leonard M. Jabonillo, Chemist/Forensic Analyst for the PNP Crime Laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The examinations conducted on the plastic sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i> yielded positive results for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, as indicated in Chemistry Report No. D-507-2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></div><br>Quiamanlon interposed the defense of denial. She testified that at 7:00 p.m. on June 15, 2005, she was eating at Jollibee, Welcome Rotonda with Samula and the sister of her husband when, suddenly, four men, who identified themselves as policemen, approached and poked their gun at her and told her not to make any move.&nbsp; She was then brought to Camp Karingal aboard a black FX vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>According to Quiamanlon, the men were supposedly looking for <i>shabu</i> from her.&nbsp; When they arrived in Camp Karingal, PO3 Villamor and PO3 Magcalayo punched her on the thigh and on the arm while forcing her to produce the said <i>shabu</i>. They also forced her to remove her clothes to ensure that she was not hiding it in her underwear.&nbsp; They also kept on asking her to point to the person who is the alleged source of <i>shabu</i>,<i> </i>but she insisted that she could not name any because she is innocent of the accusations against her. Thereafter, she was brought to the fiscal (prosecutor).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, her companion, Samula, was released since the latter was able to give the policemen money in the amount of PhP 25,000.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC, on July 10, 2008, convicted Quiamanlon. The dispositive portion of its Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>(1) In Criminal Case No. Q-05-135151:<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court finds accused NENE QUIMANLON [sic] Y MALOG <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of SECTION 5, ARTICLE II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. She is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and is ordered to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00), Philippine Currency plus the costs of the suit.<br><br>(2) In Criminal Case No. Q-05-135152<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court finds accused NENE QUIMANLON [sic] Y MALOG <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of SECTION 11, ARTICLE II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. She is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum to fourteen (14) years and nine (9) months of reclusion temporal as maximum and to pay the fine of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P300,000.00), Philippine Currency plus the costs of the suit.<br><br>Considering that the accused is a detention prisoner, her period of detention shall be properly credited in the service of her sentence in strict conformity with the provisions of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The dangerous drugs submitted as evidence in these cases is hereby ordered to be transmitted to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), for destruction and/or disposition in strict conformity with the provisions of our laws, rules and regulations on the matter.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On appeal to the CA, Quiamanlon questioned the trial court's decision in convicting her despite the prosecution's alleged failure to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, as well as its purported failure to establish the chain of custody of the alleged <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On November 25, 2009, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC.&nbsp; It ruled that the sale and possession of illegal drugs were adequately established by the prosecution, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, the sale of the illegal substance was adequately established by the testimony of PO3 Villamor who acted as the poseur buyer during the buy-bust operation. Relative to PO3 Villamor's testimony as to his own personal knowledge of the sale that took place was his positive identification of the appellant as the offender. He likewise testified on the other items (<i>shabu</i>) which appellant had in her possession. PO3 Villamor's testimony was corroborated by PO3 Magcalayo who testified that after he saw PO3 Villamayor [execute] the pre-arranged signal, they rushed to the scene and arrested the appellant; that right after appellant's arrest, he recovered the buy-bust money from her and brought appellant to the police station for investigation. Thus, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses established that appellant was caught in the act of selling a sachet containing substances which turned out to be positive for <i>shabu</i>, the arrest, being a result of an entrapment operation conducted by the police operatives on the basis of information received from a confidential informant regarding appellant's illegal trade. On the other hand, the confiscated <i>shabu</i> found in her possession, being a result of a search incident to her lawful warrantless arrest [is] therefore, admissible in evidence against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><br>The CA held that in the absence of proof to suggest that the arresting officers were moved by improper motives, their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Moreover, the appellate court ruled that the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drugs was shown not to have been broken and that the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> had been properly preserved and established by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, We hereby <b>AFFIRM</b> the same and <b>DISMISS</b> the instant appeal.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On December 14, 2009, Quiamanlon filed her Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In Our Resolution dated March 17, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> We notified the parties that they may file their respective supplemental briefs if they so desired.&nbsp; Both parties manifested that they were no longer filing a supplemental brief, because their respective briefs before the CA had already taken up all the matters relevant to the case.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Accused-appellant Quiamanlon contends in her <i>Brief </i>that:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN RENDERING A VERDICT OF CONVICTION DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE THE PROSECUTION'S FAILURE TO ESTABLISH THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF THE ALLEGED <i>SHABU</i>.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>We sustain Quiamanlon's conviction.<br><br><b>Proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt adequately established by the prosecution</b><br><br>We have carefully examined the records of this case and We are satisfied that the prosecution's evidence established the guilt of Quiamanlon beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Time and again, this Court has held that factual findings of the appellate court affirming those of the trial court are binding on this Court, unless there is a clear showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness, or palpable error.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Lusabio, Jr.</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>All in all, we find the evidence of the prosecution to be more credible than that adduced by accused-appellant. <b>When it comes to credibility, the trial court's assessment deserves great weight, and is even conclusive and binding, if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence.</b> The reason is obvious. <b>Having the full opportunity to observe directly the witnesses' deportment and manner of testifying, the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to evaluate testimonial evidence properly.&nbsp; </b>(Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><br>Since Quiamanlon failed to show any palpable error, arbitrariness, or capriciousness on the findings of fact of the trial and appellate courts, these findings deserve great weight and are deemed conclusive and binding.<br><br>Significantly, in the prosecution for the crime of illegal sale of prohibited drugs under Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165, the following elements must concur: (1) the identities of the buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for it.&nbsp; It is worth noting that what is material to the prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually occurred, coupled with the presentation in court of the substance seized as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The foregoing elements were sufficiently established by the prosecution.&nbsp; PO3 Villamor, the poseur-buyer, testified on the first element, thus:<br><br><blockquote>QUESTION -<br><br>Mr. Witness, do you know the accused in these cases, Nene Quiamanlon y Malog?<br><br>ANSWER-<br><br>After the apprehension, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, will you please look around and tell us if she is inside the Court Room?<br><br>A- (After looking around inside the Court Room) Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will you point to the accused you apprehended?<br><br>INTERPRETER:<br><br>Witness pointing to a woman seated inside the Court Room, who, when asked her name, answered "Nene Quiamanlon".<br><br>ACP DELA CRUZ: (on direct examination)<br><br>QUESTION-<br><br>When did you arrest the accused?<br><br>ANSWER-<br><br>June 15, 2005, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did you arrest the accused?<br><br>A- In front of KFC Food Chain located at Welcome Rotonda, Galas, Quezon City, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what was her specific violation or offense for which reason you arrested her?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For violation of Section 5 of RA 9165, for selling dangerous drug, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom did this accused sell this dangerous drug?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the undersigned PO3 Villamor, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did it happen that she sold to you this particular drug?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the help of our Confidential Informant, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you say "through the help of our confidential informant", how did it start?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The confidential informant came to the Office and informed us about the drug activities of a certain Alias Myrna, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that information received by your office, what was the initial reaction of your Office?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, our Chief, DAID, Colonel Ratuita, formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation, Sir.<br><br>ACP DELA CRUZ: (on direct examination)<br><br>QUESTION-<br><br>Who were the members of the team?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Led by Police Chief Inspector Arnold Abad, the members were PO3 Hernandez, PO3 Noel Magcalayo, PO2 Emeterio Mendoza, PO3 Villamor, PO1 Michael Collado and PO2 Paculdar, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that particular operation, did you have all these persons you mentioned as your companions in the buy-bust operation?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Sir, together with the informant.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many all in all proceeded to the place?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine (9), Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about what time did you proceed to the place?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six (6:00) P.M. we were dispatched, Sir.<br><br>Q-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what is this area called, if you know?<br><br>A-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KFC Food Chain, Welcome Rotonda, Galas, Quezon City, Sir.<br><br>ACP DELA CRUZ: (on direct examination)<br><br>QUESTION-<br><br>So you proceeded to that area which was at KFC Food Chain, Welcome Rotonda, Galas, Quezon City.

Further, aside from substantially corroborating PO3 Villamor's testimony, the testimony of PO3 Magcalayo has shown that a subsequent laboratory examination on the contents of the confiscated plastic sachets confirmed that they are indeed methylamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>With respect to the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Sec. 11, Art. II of RA 9165, the evidence of the prosecution has sufficiently established the elements of the violation, to wit: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Possession of dangerous drugs constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i> sufficient to convict an accused in the absence of a satisfactory explanation of such possession.&nbsp; Thus, the burden of evidence is shifted to the accused to explain the absence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; In the instant case, Quiamanlon failed to discharge such burden.<br><br>When Quiamanlon took a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from her pocket in order to show it to PO3 Villamor, two (2) other sachets containing white crystalline substance fell out of her pocket. Considerably, the owner-possessor of said sachets can be no other than Quiamanlon, who has neither shown any proof of the absence of <i>animus possidendi</i> nor presented any evidence that would show that she was duly authorized by law to possess them during the buy-bust operation.<br><br><b>Chain of Custody Established</b><br><br>Quiamanlon claims that the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation failed to observe the existing rules in the proper custody of the seized items, thereby casting doubt as to the identity and integrity of the sachets allegedly containing <i>shabu</i> presented as evidence by the prosecution.<br><br>Relying on <i>People v. Lim</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>Quiamanlon insists that "any apprehending team having initial control of said drugs and/or paraphernalia, should immediately after seizure or confiscation, have the same physically inventoried and photographed in the presence of the accused, if there be any, and or his representative, who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>She asserts further that the dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense, and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction, adding that it is, therefore, essential in these cases that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Indeed, in every prosecution for illegal sale of prohibited drugs, the presentation in evidence of the seized drug, as an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, is most material.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, it is vital that the identity of the prohibited drug be proved with moral certainty.&nbsp; The fact that the substance bought or seized during the buy-bust operation is the same item offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same degree of certitude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; It is in this respect that the chain of custody requirement performs its function.&nbsp; It ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Contrary to Quiamanlon's assertion, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drugs was adequately established in the instant case. As determined by the CA:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Going by the records, after the seizure of the drugs from appellant's possession, PO3 Villamor marked them with initials "JV", "JV1" and "JV2", then turned them over to PO3 Hernandez, the Duty Desk Officer assigned on that day at Camp Karingal. An Inventory Report was immediately prepared and subsequently, a laboratory examination of the seized items were conducted upon the request made by PS Gerardo Ratuita. The plastic sachets with the markings of "JV", "JV1" and "JV2", containing white crystalline substance when subjected to a qualitative examination by Forensic Analyst in the person of Engr. Leonard M. Jabonillo, yielded positive results, and turned out to be methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>Undeniably, a testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard as it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items. The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 on the handling and disposition of seized dangerous drugs is clear on this matter, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 21. <b><i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.--</i></b>The PDEA shall take<b> </b>charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <b><i>Provided</i>, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted</b> <b>at the place where the search warrant is served; or</b> <b>at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures</b>; <u><b><i>Provided, further,</i> that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</b></u><b></b> x x x.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>An astute perusal of the above-quoted provision of the IRR of RA 9165 readily reveals that the custodial chain rule is not to be rigorously applied, provided "the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team."&nbsp; Thus, the supposed procedural infirmities alleged by Quiamanlon with regard to the custody, photographing, inventory, and marking of the seized items do not, in any manner, affect the prosecution of the instant case and do not render her arrest illegal or the items seized from her inadmissible.<br><br>Moreover, the integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved, unless there is a showing of bad faith, ill will, or proof that the evidence has been tampered with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In this case, Quiamanlon bears the burden to show that the evidence was tampered or meddled with to overcome a presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits by public officers and a presumption that they properly discharged their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Failing to discharge such burden, there can be no doubt that the drugs seized from Quiamanlon were the same ones examined in the crime laboratory.&nbsp; Evidently, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized drugs.<br><br><b>Denial as an Inherently Weak Defense</b><br><br>This Court has held consistently that "denials unsubstantiated by convincing evidence are not enough to engender reasonable doubt particularly where the prosecution presents sufficiently telling proof of guilt,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as in the instant case.<br><br>The sachet containing the dangerous drug was positively identified by PO3 Villamor during trial as the very sachet containing the white crystalline substance sold and delivered to him by Quiamanlon. Thus, Quiamanlon's denial is self-serving and has little weight in law.<br><br>A bare denial is an inherently weak defense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and has been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor, for it can be easily concocted but difficult to prove, and is a common standard line of defense in most prosecutions arising from violations of RA 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> And in the absence of any intent on the part of the police authorities to falsely impute such crime against the accused, the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty stands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>All told, We uphold the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and find that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proving the guilt of Quiamanlon beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The CA Decision in CA-G.R.
