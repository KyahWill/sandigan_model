The security guard had a clear and unobstructed view of the Jeepney Shopping Center as Chang Juat Ltd. Company was just adjacent to it and the Jeepney Shopping Center was brightly lighted. Joel Adol recognized appellant because he used to see him cleaning the premises of the Jeepney Shopping Center and directing traffic in the area. Joel Adol observed that appellant and his companion were looking at his post and were peeping inside the Jeepney Shopping Center.&nbsp; When Joel Adol went inside the building of Chang Juat Ltd.

Eduardo was the second cousin of the mother of Richlie and Ricky. Ricky looked very nervous and his eyes were reddish, while appellant was very quiet. Ricky told Eduardo that they were in trouble and asked him to accompany appellant to the house of Panfilo dela Cruz, Eduardo's first cousin, in Sitio Tibol, Barangay Salasa, Palauig, Iba, Zambales. Ricky told Eduardo that appellant will be staying in Zambales for two to three days. Eduardo acceded to such request.<br><br>Eduardo and appellant proceeded to the bus terminal of Victory Liner in Cubao, Quezon City. When they arrived in Cubao around 11:30 that same evening, the last trip for Zambales had already left. Appellant told Eduardo that they will just get a taxi in going to Olongapo City. They were able to hire a taxi for P1,500.00. They arrived in Olongapo City around 1:00 o'clock in the morning of the following day, June 30, 2001. While waiting for a bus going to Zambales, they drank coffee in a nearby store. During their conversation, Eduardo asked appellant what happened. Appellant confessed to Eduardo that he and Ricky entered a place in Pasay City and they killed two persons and seriously wounded another whom they left fighting for his life. Appellant also told Eduardo about the vault which contained money and that if "he can open the vault, and even if they die their family will live comfortably." Further, appellant told Eduardo that nothing will be traced to him because his hands were wrapped such that no fingerprints would be recovered from the crime scene. They arrived at the house of Panfilo dela Cruz around 6:00 o'clock in the morning. Eduardo introduced appellant to Panfilo dela Cruz and told the latter that appellant will be staying there for about two (2) days. At noontime, Eduardo went back to Manila.<br><br>After a week, Eduardo went to SPO3 Rodrigo Urbina of the PNP Regional Mobile Patrol Group. Eduardo told SPO3 Urbina what was confessed to him by appellant and that he brought appellant to Zambales. SPO3 Urbano coordinated with the Pasay City Police Station, Crime Investigation Division, for appellant's arrest.<br><br>Around 5:00 o'clock in the morning of July 12, 2001, the joint team of the Regional Mobile Patrol Group, the Pasay City Police Station and the Palauig Police Station arrested appellant in the house of Panfilo dela Cruz. Appellant was frisked and a cross pendant was recovered from his pocket.<br><br>The inventory conducted by Cresilda Tigolo, the accounting clerk of Jeepney Shopping Center, revealed that 191 pieces of jewelry in the amount of P304,140.00 and 2 imported bags worth P23,250.00 were stolen.

He was there from 8:30 p.m. until the following morning.&nbsp; At noontime of June 27, 2001, Richlie, his girlfriend and Ricky's sister, called him up asking for money to pay for her tuition fee.

Ricky then put his arms around him saying "<i>huwag ka na lang maingay.</i>"&nbsp; He then told Ricky that he could not keep quiet because he was afraid that he might be implicated since he knew that Ricky and his companions were the ones responsible for the incident.

Before he left for Zambales, he gave the pieces of jewelry which Ricky gave him to Richlie.

They reached the house of Panfilo dela Cruz, Eduardo's cousin, in Palauig, Zambales around 4 a.m. the following day,&nbsp; Eduardo introduced him to Panfilo as Richlie's fiancÃ©.&nbsp; After breakfast, Eduardo told him that he was going back to Manila and would just fetch him after two or three days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On July 12, 2001, three policemen entered his room and arrested him.

To sustain a conviction for robbery with homicide, the prosecution must prove the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property is committed with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property belongs to another; (3) the taking is <i>animo lucrandi</i> or with intent to gain; and (4) on the occasion or by reason of the robbery, the crime of homicide, as used in the generic sense, was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> A conviction needs certainty that the robbery is the central purpose and objective of the malefactor and the killing is merely incidental to the robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The intent to rob must precede the taking of human life, but the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In this case, we find that the evidence presented by the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that the crime of robbery with homicide was indeed committed. As the CA correctly observed:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The removal of the jalousies in the restroom of the Jeepney Shopping Center to gain entrance, the destruction of the display cabinet where the items were kept, the destruction of the lock leading to the cashier's office on the third floor of the building; and the inventory of missing items makes the situation possess the first essential element as stated above. In robbery by the taking of the property through intimidation or violence, it is not necessary that the person unlawfully divested of the personal property be the owner&nbsp; thereof, robbery may be committed against&nbsp; a bailee or a person who himself stole it. As long as the taker of the personal property is not the owner, the second element exists. The third element is <i>animus lucrandi</i> or intent to gain which is defined by the Supreme Court as "an internal act which can be established through the overt acts of the offender, and it may be presumed from the furtive taking of useful property pertaining to another, unless special circumstance reveal a different intent on the part of&nbsp; the perpetrator." We agree with the finding of the trial court that: "the intent to steal was likewise proven from accused's statement to Eduardo dela Cruz to the effect that if they were able to open the vault, their families would have lived a good life even if they die in the process." On the other hand, the accused was proven to be a friend of, and was with, Ricky Ladiana right after the commission of the crime as testified to by Richlie Ladiana, his lover. Being so when the firearm of the fallen guard was found from the abandoned house of Ricky, the conclusion is that Ricky and Antonio Uy have been together at the shopping center and presumed the taker of a thing taken or doer in the doing of a recent wrongful act. In the instant case, no special circumstance was present to belie the presumption of the intent to gain of the accused-appellant. The existence of the fourth element is incontestable. The homicide preceded the robbery but committed on the occasion thereof, the purpose is to eliminate an obstacle to the commission of robbery. The grudge of the appellant against his former co-workers Felix Aranez and Delfin Biniahan is not sufficient to overcome the presumption and evidence of intent to gain, it is clear that the victims were killed on the occasion of robbery and to commit robbery. Essential in robbery with homicide is that there is a nexus, an intimate connection between the robbery and the killing, whether the latter be prior or subsequent to the former or whether both crimes are committed at the same time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br>While there was no direct evidence to establish appellant's participation in the commission of the crime, direct evidence is not the only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its conclusion and finding of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The rules of evidence allow a trial court to rely on circumstantial evidence to support its conclusion of guilt. Circumstantial evidence is that evidence which proves a fact or series of facts from which the facts in issue may be established by inference. At times, resort to circumstantial evidence is imperative since to insist on direct testimony would, in many cases, result in setting felons free and deny proper protection to the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, Section 4, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court on circumstantial evidence requires the concurrence of the following: (1) there must be more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (3) the combination of all circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. A judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence can be sustained when the circumstances proved form an unbroken chain that results to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We have carefully gone over the records of the case and we find that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt that appellant and his co-accused Ricky conspired to commit the crime of robbery with homicide. We find apropos the CA's ratiocination in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x We&nbsp; concord with the trial court that the success of the prosecution in discharging its duty to prove the guilt of the accused is anchored in the circumstantial evidence present and proven in this case, to wit:<br><br><ol><li>Possession of the stolen goods by the accused and his girlfriend was not satisfactorily explained;<br></li><li>Intent to steal was evident in his confession to Eduardo dela Cruz who had no reason to lie as he even helped him to escape;<br></li><li>Participation in the commission of the crime was proven by the tracing of the possession of the deceased's firearm at Ricky Ladiana's house, accused Antonio's friend and companion right after the killing;<br></li><li>Antonio Manuel Uy was seen in person by a guard at the scene of the crime on the night of the robbery and killing;<br></li><li>Suspicious presence at the place of robbery immediately before the incident;<br></li><li>Antonio Manuel Uy's cellphone was established as the sender of text messages to at least two co-employees of his; [and]<br></li><li>Confession/testimony of Richlie Ladiana, acknowledged sweetheart of accused Uy that the latter gave her the jewelries, part of the stolen jewelries from the shopping center.</li></ol><br>Another circumstance is the unexplained impromptu vacation of Antonio Manuel Uy. It has been ruled that flight <i>per se</i> cannot prove the guilt of an accused. But if the same is considered in the light of other circumstances, it may be deemed a strong indication of guilt. Considering the surrounding circumstances when he left with Eduardo dela Cruz for Palauig, Zambales, We could draw a conclusion that he is trying to evade something in his work place. Settled is the rule that flight of an accused, when unexplained, is a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be drawn. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In his appeal with the CA and with Us, appellant contends that contrary to the RTC findings, he was able to satisfactorily explain the circumstance of his possession of the stolen pieces of jewelry.&nbsp; He claims that Ricky, Richlie's brother, insisted on giving him those pieces of jewelry, but since he was afraid he might be implicated in the commission of the crime which Ricky and his companion had committed, he decided to leave the pieces of jewelry to Richlie.&nbsp; As to the cross pendant which was also part of the stolen items allegedly recovered from him, appellant claims that the same was merely planted on him by PO3 Michael Manarang.&nbsp; He further contends that assuming there is truth to Richlie's allegation that the pieces of jewelry which she pawned came from him, the stolen items did not prove his culpability for robbery with homicide.<br><br>Appellant's explanations do not inspire belief.<br><br>Appellant testified that when Ricky gave him the valuable pieces of jewelry, he declined to receive them saying that he already had many jewelry,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> yet he was still in possession of these items and he even admitted giving them to Richlie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, Richlie categorically declared that before they parted ways at around 7 p.m. of June 29, 2001, appellant gave her something wrapped in a newspaper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Upon reaching her house, she opened the wrapped newspaper which contained 4 pairs of diamond earrings,&nbsp; a pairless diamond earring and 5 pieces of diamond rings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Richlie testified that appellant called her up and instructed her to pawn the items as he needed money,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> thus, Richlie asked her friend Wilfredo Mazo to pawn the diamond ring and a pair of earrings to Villarica pawnshop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Later, Mazo, together with Richlie and SPO3 Rodrigo Urbina, went to the pawnshop and redeemed the items<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which were proved to be part of the stolen items.<br><br>Appellant's claim that the cross pendant found on him at the time of his arrest was merely planted by PO3 Manarang was not proven at all.

Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, states that when the law prescribes a penalty consisting of two (2) indivisible penalties, and the crime is neither attended by mitigating nor aggravating circumstances, the lesser penalty shall be imposed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>Considering that there was no modifying circumstance which attended the commission of the crime, the CA correctly modified the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>In robbery with homicide, civil indemnity and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each is granted automatically in the absence of any qualifying aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> These awards are mandatory without need of allegation and evidence other than the death of the victim owing to the fact of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In this case, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, properly awarded the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.<br><br>The heirs of the victims are also entitled to the award of moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each.&nbsp; As borne out by human nature and experience, a violent death invariably and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish on the part of the victim's family. It is inherently human to suffer sorrow, torment, pain and anger when a loved one becomes the victim of a violent or brutal killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>We likewise affirm the RTC's Order for appellant to indemnify the Jeepney Shopping Center the sum of P311,840.00 as reparation and the Energetic Security Agency the sum of P49,784.75 for the funeral expenses of security guard Esmaquilan.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00110 is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> that petitioner is also <b>ORDERED</b> to pay the heirs of the victims the amount of P50,000.00 each as moral damages.<br><br>The police and other law enforcement agencies of the government are <b>ORDERED</b> to immediately implement the warrant of arrest issued against Ricky Ladiana <i>y</i> Davao, for him to stand trial.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Abad</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated as an additional member in lieu of Associate Justice Antonio Eduardo B.
