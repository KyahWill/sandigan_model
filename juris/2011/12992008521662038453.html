Similarly, in this case, petitioner asserts that it may still recover unutilized tax credits <i>via</i> a claim for refund. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>And while petitioner admits that it has committed a "blatant transgression" of the "succeeding taxable year limit" when it carried over its 1997 excess income tax payments beyond the taxable year 1998, petitioner believes that this should not result in the denial of its claim for refund but should only invalidate the application of its 1997 unutilized excess income tax payments to its 1999 income tax liabilities. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hence, petitioner postulates that a claim for refund of its unutilized tax credits for the taxable year 1997 may still be made because the carry-over thereof to the taxable year 1999 produced no legal effect, and is, therefore, immaterial to the resolution of its claim for refund. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that the cases of <i>BPI-Family Savings Bank</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and <i>AB Leasing</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> are inapplicable as the facts obtaining therein are different from those of the present case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; What is controlling, therefore, is the ruling in <i>Philippine Bank of Communications,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that tax refund and tax credit are alternative remedies; thus, "the choice of one precludes the other." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent, therefore, submits that since petitioner has already applied its 1997 excess income tax payments to its liabilities for taxable year 1998, it is precluded from carrying over the same to taxable year 1999, or from filing a claim for refund. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>Both the CTA and the CA erred in applying Section 69 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the old NIRC.&nbsp; The law applicable is Section 76 of the NIRC.<br><br><b><i>Unutilized excess income tax payments<br>may be refunded within two years from the date <br>of payment under Section 69 of the old NIRC</i></b><br><br>Under Section 69 of the old NIRC, in case of overpayment of income taxes, a corporation may either file a claim for refund or carry-over the excess payments to the succeeding taxable year.&nbsp; Availment of one remedy, however, precludes the other. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Although these remedies are mutually exclusive, we have in several cases allowed corporations, which have previously availed of the tax credit option, to file a claim for refund of their unutilized excess income tax payments.<br><br>In <i>BPI-Family Savings Bank,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the bank availed of the tax credit option but since it suffered a net loss the succeeding year, the tax credit could not be applied; thus, the bank filed a claim for refund to recover its excess creditable taxes.&nbsp; Brushing aside technicalities, we granted the claim for refund.<br><br>Likewise, in <i>Calamba Steel Center, Inc.,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we allowed the refund of excess income taxes paid in 1995 since these could not be credited to taxable year 1996 due to business losses.&nbsp; In that case, we declared that "a tax refund may be claimed even beyond the taxable year following that in which the tax credit arises x x x provided that the claim for such a refund is made within two years after payment of said tax." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In <i>State Land Investment Corporation,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we reiterated that "if the excess income taxes paid in a given taxable year have not been entirely used by a x x x corporation against its quarterly income tax liabilities for the next taxable year, the unused amount of the excess may still be refunded, provided that the claim for such a refund is made within two years after payment of the tax." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Thus, under Section 69 of the old NIRC, unutilized tax credits may be refunded as long as the claim is filed within the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br><b><i>The option to carry over excess income<br>tax payments is irrevocable under <br>Section 76 of the 1997 NIRC</i></b><br><br>This rule, however, no longer applies as Section 76 of the 1997 NIRC now reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 76.&nbsp; <i>Final Adjustment Return</i>. - Every corporation liable to tax under Section 24 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total net income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable net income of that year the corporation shall either:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a)&nbsp; Pay the excess tax still due; or<br><br>(b)&nbsp; Be refunded the excess amount paid, as the case may be.<br></div><br>In case the corporation is entitled to a refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the refundable amount shown on its final adjustment return may be credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the <b>taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Under the new law, in case of overpayment of income taxes, the remedies are still the same; and the availment of one remedy still precludes the other.&nbsp; But unlike Section 69 of the old NIRC, the carry-over of excess income tax payments is no longer limited to the succeeding taxable year. Unutilized excess income tax payments may now be carried over to the succeeding taxable years until fully utilized.&nbsp; In addition, the option to carry-over excess income tax payments is now irrevocable. Hence, unutilized excess income tax payments may no longer be refunded.<br><br>In the instant case, both the CTA and the CA applied Section 69 of the old NIRC in denying the claim for refund. We find, however, that the applicable provision should be Section 76 of the 1997 NIRC because at the time petitioner filed its 1997 final ITR, the old NIRC was no longer in force.&nbsp; In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McGeorge Food Industries, Inc.,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><i> </i>we explained that:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 76</b> and its companion provisions in Title II, Chapter XII <b>should be applied following the general rule on the prospective application of laws such that they operate to govern the conduct of corporate taxpayers the moment the 1997 NIRC took effect on 1 January 1998</b>. There is no quarrel <b>that at the time respondent filed its final adjustment return for 1997 on 15 April 1998, the deadline under Section 77 (B) of the 1997 NIRC (formerly Section 70(b) of the 1977 NIRC), the 1997 NIRC was already in force, having gone into effect a few months earlier on 1 January 1998. Accordingly, Section 76 is controlling.</b><br><br>The lower courts grounded their contrary conclusion on the fact that respondent's overpayment in 1997 was based on transactions occurring before 1 January 1998. This analysis suffers from the twin defects of missing the gist of the present controversy and misconceiving the nature and purpose of Section 76. None of respondent's corporate transactions in 1997 is disputed here. Nor can it be argued that Section 76 determines the taxability of corporate <i>transactions</i>.&nbsp; To sustain the rulings below is to subscribe to the untenable proposition that, had Congress in the 1997 NIRC moved the deadline for the filing of final adjustment returns from 15 April to 15 March of each year, taxpayers filing returns after 15 March 1998 can excuse their tardiness by invoking the 1977 NIRC because the transactions subject of the returns took place before 1 January 1998. A keener appreciation of the nature and purpose of the varied provisions of the 1997 NIRC cautions against sanctioning this reasoning. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>Accordingly, since petitioner already carried over its 1997 excess income tax payments to the succeeding taxable year 1998, it may no longer file a claim for refund of unutilized tax credits for taxable year 1997.<br><br>To repeat, under the new law, once the option to carry-over excess income tax payments to the succeeding years has been made, it becomes irrevocable.&nbsp; Thus, applications for refund of the unutilized excess income tax payments may no longer be allowed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
