The CA said that Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court provides that the principal party shall sign the certification against forum shopping, as the attestation requires personal knowledge by the party who executed the same, otherwise, it would cause the dismissal of the petition.&nbsp; Considering that Quintin, one of the parties to the petition, died on July 29, 1996, it could have been impossible for him to sign the Petition dated March 18, 2003.<br><br>A Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; was filed by Atty. Renante dela Cerna as counsel for petitioners, contending that there was substantial compliance with the rule on certification against forum shopping when majority of the principal parties were able to sign the verification and certification against forum shopping.&nbsp; Attached in the motion for reconsideration was the affidavit of the Heirs of Quintin acknowledging said mistake and submitted a verification and certification duly signed by the heirs.<br><br>On March 3, 2004, the CA issued a Resolution denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; In so ruling, the CA said:<br><br><blockquote>While it may be true that when majority of the parties have signed the certification against non-forum shopping would constitute "substantial compliance," this Court cannot apply the same rule to petitioners. First, petitioners' counsel failed to explain why a dead person/party was able to sign the certification against non-forum shopping. The issue is not the parties' substantial compliance, but the dishonesty committed by the parties and/or their counsel when they made it appear that one of the listed parties signed the certification when in fact he died long before the petition was filed. Under Circular No. 28-91 of the Supreme Court and Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, the attestation contained in the certification on non-forum shopping requires personal knowledge by the party who executed the same.&nbsp; The liberal interpretation of the rules cannot be accorded to parties who commit dishonesty and falsehood in court.<br><br>Second, records reveal that this Motion for reconsideration was signed by a certain Atty. Renante A. Dela Cerna as counsel for the petitioners without the counsel of record, Atty. Norberto A. Luna's formal withdrawal. No notice of substitution of counsel was filed by the petitioners and Atty. Dela Cerna never entered his appearance as counsel for petitioner.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>There being no formal withdrawal or substitution of counsel made, Atty. Norberto A. Luna remains the counsel of record for petitioners. Atty. Luna may not be presumed substituted by Atty. Renante Dela Cerna merely by the latter's filing or signing of the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; In the absence of compliance with the essential requirements for valid substitution of counsel of record, the court can presume that Atty. Luna continuously represents the petitioners. Hence, Atty. Renante Dela Cerna has no right to represent the petitioners in this case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this petition wherein petitioners raise the sole ground that:<br><br><blockquote>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN DISMISSING THE PETITIONERS' PETITION BY RULING AGAINST THE PETITIONERS' SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE TO THE CERTIFICATION AGAINST NON-FORUM SHOPPING FOR THE ALLEGED DISHONESTY COMMITTED BY THE PARTIES AND/OR THEIR COUNSEL WHEN THEY MADE IT APPEAR THAT ONE OF THE LISTED PARTIES SIGNED THE CERTIFICATION, WHEN IN FACT HE DIED BEFORE THE PETITION WAS FILED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The CA dismissed the Petition for Annulment of Judgment after it found that Quintin, one of the parties to the petition, had already died on July 29, 1996, thus, it was impossible for him to have signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to the petition filed on March 18, 2003. The CA found petitioners to have committed dishonesty and falsehood to the court, thus, it could not apply the liberal interpretation of the rule on certification against forum shopping.<br><br>We found no reversible error committed by the CA.<br><br>As correctly observed by the CA, while we have in a number of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> applied the substantial compliance rule on the filing of the certification of non-forum shopping, specially when majority of the principal parties had signed the same and who shared a common interest, We agree with the CA that such leniency finds no applicability in this case because of petitioners' dishonesty committed against the appellate court.&nbsp; A perusal of the verification and certification against forum shopping attached to the petition for annulment of judgment filed in the CA would show that there was a signature above the typewritten name of Quintin.&nbsp; In fact, written below the signature of Quintin was Community Tax Certificate (CTC) No. 06570132, issued on January 8, 2003 in Mandaue City. Thus, it would appear that Quintin, who was already dead at the time the petition was filed, had signed the verification and certification of non-forum shopping and he was even in possession of a CTC.&nbsp; Petitioners' actuation showed their lack of forthrightness to the CA which the latter correctly found to be a dishonest act committed against it.<br><br>Petitioners allege that the explanation of their former counsel on record,&nbsp; Atty. Luna, to the show cause order issued by the CA to him that: (1) he had no intention to make it appear that a dead man in the person of Quintin was able to sign the verification and certification against forum shopping; (2) when he entered his appearance as counsel for petitioners before the RTC, he, the RTC, the co-petitioners and the other respondents, as well as their counsel, knew of the fact of Quintin's death and the status of Felimon Retuya who immediately substituted his father, and in behalf of his siblings; (3) that in his entry of appearance filed before the RTC, it was Felimon, one of&nbsp; Quintin's heirs, who signed in the above typewritten name of Quintin, were found by the CA to be meritorious and noted the same. Thus, petitioners claim that they also have no intention of deceiving respondents, since as explained by Atty. Luna, all the parties and counsels knew of the death of Quintin.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Notwithstanding that the CA had found the explanation of Atty. Luna to be meritorious, the CA did not err when it dismissed the petition. Notably, there was a signature above the typewritten name of Quintin without any showing that it was signed by another person for or in behalf of Quintin.&nbsp; In the absence of such qualification, it appeared before the CA that Quintin was the one who signed the same, especially since the CA did not know of the fact of Quintin's death. There was nothing in the petition for annulment of judgment which alleged such information.&nbsp; In fact, we do not find any sufficient explanation given by petitioners as to why there was a signature of Quintin appearing in the verification and certification against forum shopping.<br><br>We also find that the CA correctly denied the motion for reconsideration on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; Atty. Renante dela Cerna,&nbsp; the lawyer who filed the motion for reconsideration, had no right to represent petitioners.<br><br>Under Section 26, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and established jurisprudence, a valid substitution of counsel has the following requirements: (1) the filing of a written application for substitution; (2) the client's written consent; (3) the consent of the substituted lawyer if such consent can be obtained; and, in case such written consent cannot be procured, (4) a proof of service of notice of such motion on the attorney to be substituted in the manner required by the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, petitioners failed to comply with the above requirements.<br><br>Atty. Dela Cerna, as counsel for petitioners, filed the motion for reconsideration on December 22, 2003.&nbsp; However, he is not the counsel on record of petitioners, but Atty. Luna.&nbsp; Petitioners did not file a motion for substitution of counsel on record before the filing of the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; It is worthy to mention that Atty. Dela Cerna did not even file a notice of appearance.&nbsp; If it has been held that courts may not presume that the counsel of record has been substituted by a second counsel merely from the filing of a formal appearance by the latter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> then with more reason that Atty. Dela Cerna could not be considered to have substituted Atty. Luna as there was no notice of his entry of appearance at all.<br><br>The fact that Atty. Luna was still the counsel on record at the time Atty. Dela Cerna filed his motion for reconsideration was established in Atty. Luna's Explanation dated March 19, 2004 to the CA's Show Cause Order to him wherein he prayed therein that an Order be issued relieving him of his legal obligations to petitioners. Moreover, on April 30, 2004, petitioners through their counsel on record, Atty. Luna, filed a motion for substitution of counsels wherein they alleged that they engaged the services of Atty. Jorge Esparagosa as their new counsel and relieved Atty. Luna of all his legal obligations to them.&nbsp; Notably, there was no mention at all of Atty. Dela Cerna.&nbsp; Indeed, there was no showing of the authority of Atty. Dela Cerna to file the motion for reconsideration for petitioners.&nbsp; Thus, the CA correctly found that Atty. Dela Cerna has no personality to represent petitioners and file the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
