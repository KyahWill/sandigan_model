Thus, they appeal to the Court, posing the following issues, namely:<br><br><ol><li>Can the validity of&nbsp; Resolution No. 552 be assailed even before its implementation?</li><li>Must a citizen await the takeover and possession of his property by the local government before he can go to court to nullify an unjust expropriation?</li></ol><br>Before resolving these issues, however, the Court considers it necessary to first determine whether or not the action for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition commenced by the petitioners in the RTC was a proper recourse of the petitioners.<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b><br></center><br>We deny the petition for review, and find that <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition were not available to the petitioners under the circumstances. Thus, we sustain, albeit upon different grounds, the result announced by the CA, and declare that the RTC gravely erred in giving due course to the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.<br><br><center><b>1.</b><br><b><i>Certiorari</i></b><b> does not lie to assail the issuance of </b><br><b>a resolution by the Sanggunian Panglungsod</b><br></center><br>The special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is governed by Rule 65 of the <i>1997</i> <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, whose Section 1 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. Petition for <i>certiorari</i>. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center></blockquote><br>For <i>certiorari</i> to prosper, therefore, the petitioner must allege and establish the concurrence of the following requisites, namely:<br><br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) The writ is directed against a tribunal, board, or officer <i>exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions</i>;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) Such tribunal, board, or officer has acted <i>without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion</i> <i>amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</i>; and<br><br>(<i>c</i>) There is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It is further emphasized that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeks solely to correct defects in jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and does not correct just any error or mistake committed by a court, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions unless such court, board, or officer thereby acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The first requisite is that the respondent tribunal, board, or officer must be exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. Judicial function, according to Bouvier,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> is the exercise of the judicial faculty or office; it also means the capacity to act in a specific way which appertains to the judicial power, as one of the powers of government. "The term," Bouvier continues,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> "is used to describe generally those modes of action which appertain to the judiciary as a department of organized government, and through and by means of which it accomplishes its purpose and exercises its peculiar powers."<br><br>Based on the foregoing, <i>certiorari</i> did not lie against the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i>, which was not a part of the Judiciary settling an actual controversy involving legally demandable and enforceable rights when it adopted Resolution No. 552, but a legislative and policy-making body declaring its sentiment or opinion.<br><br>Nor did the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i> abuse its discretion in adopting Resolution No. 552. To demonstrate the absence of abuse of discretion, it is well to differentiate between a resolution and an ordinance. The first is upon a specific matter of a temporary nature while the latter is a law that is permanent in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> No rights can be conferred by and be inferred from a resolution, which is nothing but an embodiment of what the lawmaking body has to say in the light of attendant circumstances. In simply expressing its sentiment or opinion through the resolution, therefore, the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i> in no way abused its discretion, least of all gravely, for its expression of sentiment or opinion was a constitutionally protected right.<br><br>Moreover, Republic Act No. 7160 (<i>The Local Government Code</i>) required the City to pass an ordinance, not adopt a resolution, for the purpose of initiating an expropriation proceeding. In this regard, Section 19 of <i>The Local Government Code</i> clearly provides, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 19. <i>Eminent Domain</i>. - A local government unit may, through its chief executive and <b>acting pursuant to an ordinance</b>, exercise the power of eminent domain for public use, or purpose, or welfare for the benefit of the poor and the landless, upon payment of just compensation, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and pertinent laws:&nbsp; Provided, however, That the power of eminent domain may not be exercised unless a valid and definite offer has been previously made to the owner, and such offer was not accepted:&nbsp; Provided, further, That the local government unit may immediately take possession of the property upon the filing of the expropriation proceedings and upon making a deposit with the proper court of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of the property based on the current tax declaration of the property to be expropriated: Provided, finally, That, the amount to be paid for the expropriated property shall be determined by the proper court, based on the fair market value at the time of the taking of the property.<br></blockquote><br>A resolution like Resolution No. 552 that merely expresses the sentiment of the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod </i>is not sufficient for the purpose of initiating an expropriation proceeding. Indeed, in <i>Municipality of Parañaque v. V.M. Realty Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> a case in which the Municipality of Parañaque based its complaint for expropriation on a resolution, not an ordinance, the Court ruled so:<br><br><blockquote>The power of eminent domain is lodged in the legislative branch of government, which may delegate the exercise thereof to LGUs, other public entities and public utilities. An LGU may therefore exercise the power to expropriate private property only when authorized by Congress and subject to the latter's control and restraints, imposed "through the law conferring the power or in other legislations." In this case, Section 19 of RA 7160, which delegates to LGUs the power of eminent domain, also lays down the parameters for its exercise.&nbsp; It provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 19. Eminent Domain. A local government unit may, through its chief executive and acting <b>pursuant to an ordinance</b>, exercise the power of eminent domain for public use, or purpose, or welfare for the benefit of the poor and the landless, upon payment of just compensation, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and pertinent laws:&nbsp; Provided, however, That the power of eminent domain may not be exercised unless a valid and definite offer has been previously made to the owner, and such offer was not accepted:&nbsp; Provided, further, That the local government unit may immediately take possession of the property upon the filing of the expropriation proceedings and upon making a deposit with the proper court of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of the property based on the current tax declaration of the property to be expropriated:&nbsp; Provided, finally, That, the amount to be paid for the expropriated property shall be determined by the proper court, based on the fair market value at the time of the taking of the property."&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the following essential requisites must concur before an LGU can exercise the power of eminent domain:<br><br>1.&nbsp; <b>An ordinance is enacted by the local legislative council</b> authorizing the local chief executive, in behalf of the LGU, to exercise the power of eminent domain or pursue expropriation proceedings over a particular private property.<br><br>2.&nbsp; The power of eminent domain is exercised for public use, purpose or welfare, or for the benefit of the poor and the landless.<br><br>3.&nbsp; There is payment of just compensation, as required under Section 9 Article III of the Constitution and other pertinent laws.<br><br>4.&nbsp; A valid and definite offer has been previously made to the owner of the property sought to be expropriated, but said offer was not accepted.<br><br>In the case at bar, the local chief executive sought to exercise the power of eminent domain pursuant to a resolution of the municipal council.&nbsp; Thus, there was no compliance with the first requisite that the mayor be authorized through an ordinance.&nbsp; Petitioner cites <i>Camarines Sur vs. Court of Appeals</i> to show that a resolution may suffice to support the exercise of eminent domain by an LGU. This case, however, is not in point because the applicable law at that time was BP 337, the previous Local Government Code, which had provided that a mere resolution would enable an LGU to exercise eminent domain. In contrast, <b>RA 7160, the present Local Government Code which was already in force when the Complaint for expropriation was filed, explicitly required an ordinance for this purpose.</b><br><br>We are not convinced by petitioner's insistence that the terms "resolution" and "ordinance" are synonymous.&nbsp; <b>A municipal ordinance is different from a resolution.&nbsp; An ordinance is a law, but a resolution is merely a declaration of the sentiment or opinion of a lawmaking body on a specific matter. An ordinance possesses a general and permanent character, but a resolution is temporary in nature. Additionally, the two are enacted differently -- a third reading is necessary for an ordinance, but not for a resolution, unless decided otherwise by a majority of all the Sanggunian members.</b><br><br>If Congress intended to allow LGUs to exercise eminent domain through a mere resolution, it would have simply adopted the language of the previous Local Government Code. But Congress did not. In a clear divergence from the previous Local Government Code, Section 19 of RA 7160 categorically requires that the local chief executive act pursuant to an ordinance.&nbsp; Indeed, "[l]egislative intent is determined principally from the language of a statute. Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the law is applied according to its express terms, and interpretation would be resorted to only where a literal interpretation would be either impossible or absurd or would lead to an injustice." In the instant case, there is no reason to depart from this rule, since the law requiring an ordinance is not at all impossible, absurd, or unjust.<br><br>Moreover, the power of eminent domain necessarily involves a derogation of a fundamental or private right of the people. Accordingly, the manifest change in the legislative language - from "resolution" under BP 337 to "ordinance" under RA 7160 - demands a strict construction. "No species of property is held by individuals with greater tenacity, and is guarded by the Constitution and laws more sedulously, than the right to the freehold of inhabitants. When the legislature interferes with that right and, for greater public purposes, appropriates the land of an individual without his consent, the plain meaning of the law should not be enlarged by doubtful interpretation."<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>In its Brief filed before Respondent Court, petitioner argues that its Sangguniang Bayan passed an ordinance on October 11, 1994 which reiterated its Resolution No. 93-35, Series of 1993, and ratified all the acts of its mayor regarding the subject expropriation.<br><br>This argument is bereft of merit.&nbsp; In the first place, petitioner merely alleged the existence of such an ordinance, but it did not present any certified true copy thereof.&nbsp; In the second place, petitioner did not raise this point before this Court.&nbsp; In fact, it was mentioned by private respondent, and only in passing. In any event, this allegation does not cure the inherent defect of petitioner's Complaint for expropriation filed on September 23, 1993.&nbsp; It is hornbook doctrine that:<br><br><blockquote>" x x x in a motion to dismiss based on the ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, the question submitted before the court for determination is the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint itself.&nbsp; Whether those allegations are true or not is beside the point, for their truth is hypothetically admitted by the motion.&nbsp; The issue rather is: admitting them to be true, may the court render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer of the complaint?"<br></blockquote><br><b>The fact that there is no cause of action is evident from the face of the Complaint for expropriation which was based on a mere resolution. The absence of an ordinance authorizing the same is equivalent to lack of cause of action.</b> Consequently, the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in affirming the trial court's Decision which dismissed the expropriation suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In view of the absence of the proper expropriation ordinance authorizing and providing for the expropriation, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed in the RTC was dismissible for lack of cause of action.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>2.</b><br><b>Prohibition does not lie against expropriation</b><br></div><br>The special civil action for prohibition is governed also by Section 2 of Rule 65 of the 1997 <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Petition for prohibition</i>. -- When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to desist from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein, or otherwise granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div></blockquote><br></div>The function of prohibition is to prevent the unlawful and oppressive exercise of legal authority and to provide for a fair and orderly administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The writ of prohibition is directed against proceedings that are done without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, there being no appeal or other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> For grave abuse of discretion to be a ground for prohibition, the petitioner must first demonstrate that the tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person, whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, has exercised its or his power in an arbitrary or despotic manner, by reason of passion or personal hostility, which must be so patent and gross as would amount to an evasion, or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> On the other hand, the term <i>excess of jurisdiction</i> signifies that the court, board, or officer has jurisdiction over a case but has transcended such jurisdiction or acted without any authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The petitioner must further allege in the petition and establish facts to show that any other existing remedy is not speedy or adequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> A remedy is plain, speedy and adequate if it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of that judgment and the acts of the tribunal or inferior court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The rule and relevant jurisprudence indicate that prohibition was not available to the petitioners as a remedy against the adoption of Resolution No. 552, for the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i>, by such adoption, was not exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, but only expressing its collective sentiment or opinion.<br><br>Verily, there can be no prohibition against a procedure whereby the immediate possession of the land under expropriation proceedings may be taken, provided always that due provision is made to secure the prompt adjudication and payment of just compensation to the owner. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This bar against prohibition comes from the nature of the power of eminent domain as necessitating the taking of private land intended for public use,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and the interest of the affected landowner is thus made subordinate to the power of the State.&nbsp; Once the State decides to exercise its power of eminent domain, the power of judicial review becomes limited in scope, and the courts will be left to determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be paid to the affected landowners. Only when the landowners are not given their just compensation for the taking of their property or when there has been no agreement on the amount of just compensation may the remedy of prohibition become available.<br><br>Here, however, the remedy of prohibition was not called for, considering that only a resolution expressing the desire of the <i>Sangguniang Panglungsod</i> to expropriate the petitioners' property was issued. As of then, it was premature for the petitioners to mount <i>any</i> judicial challenge, for the power of eminent domain could be exercised by the City only through the filing of a verified complaint in the proper court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Before the City as the expropriating authority filed such verified complaint, no expropriation proceeding could be said to exist.
