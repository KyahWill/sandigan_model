</b>Without waiting for the CIR's action on its claim, Fortune Tobacco filed with the CTA a judicial claim for tax refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In its decision dated May 26, 2006, the CTA First Division ruled in favor of Fortune Tobacco and granted its claim for refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The CTA First Division's ruling was upheld on appeal by the CTA <i>en banc</i> in its decision dated July 12, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; The CIR's motion for reconsideration of the CTA <i>en banc's</i> decision was denied in a resolution dated October 4, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>THE ISSUE</b></u><br></center><br><b>Fortune Tobacco's claim for refund of overpaid excise taxes is based primarily on what it considers as an "unauthorized administrative legislation" on the part of the CIR.</b>&nbsp; Specifically, <b>it assails the proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99</b> that requires the payment of the "excise tax actually being paid prior to January 1, 2000" if this amount is higher than the <b>new specific tax rate</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, the rates of specific taxes imposed in 1997 for each category of cigarette, plus 12%.&nbsp; It claimed that by including the proviso, the CIR went beyond the language of the law and usurped Congress' power.&nbsp; As mentioned, the CTA sided with Fortune Tobacco and allowed the latter to claim the refund.<br><br>The CIR disagrees with the CTA's ruling and assails it before this Court through the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; <b>The CIR posits that the inclusion of the proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99 was made to carry into effect the law's intent and is well within the scope of his delegated legislative authority</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He claims that the CTA's strict interpretation of the law ignored Congress' intent "to increase the collection of excise taxes by increasing specific tax rates on `sin' products."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; He cites portions of the Senate's deliberation on House Bill No. 7198 (the precursor of RA 8240) that conveyed the legislative intent to increase the excise taxes being paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The CIR points out that Section 145(c) of the 1997 Tax Code categorically declares that "[t]he excise tax from any brand of cigarettes within the [three-year transition period from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999] shall not be lower than the tax, which is due from each brand on October 1, 1996."&nbsp; He posits that there is no plausible reason why the new specific tax rates due beginning January 1, 2000 should not be subject to the same rule as those due during the transition period.&nbsp; To the CIR, the adoption of the "higher tax rule" during the transition period unmistakably shows the intent of Congress not to lessen the excise tax collection.&nbsp; Thus, the CTA should have construed the ambiguity or omission in Section 145(c) in a manner that would uphold the law's policy and intent.<br><br>Fortune Tobacco argues otherwise.&nbsp; To it, Section 145(c) of the 1997 Tax Code read and interpreted as it is written; it imposes a 12% increase on the rates of excise taxes provided under sub-paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) only; it does not say that the tax due during the transition period shall continue to be collected if the amount is higher than the new specific tax rates.&nbsp; It contends that the "higher tax rule" applies only to the three-year transition period to offset the burden caused by the shift from <i>ad valorem</i> to specific taxes.<br><br><center><u><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b></u><br></center><br>Except for the tax period and the amounts involved,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the case at bar presents the same issue that the Court already resolved in 2008 in <i>CIR v. Fortune Tobacco Corporation</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; In the 2008 <i>Fortune Tobacco</i> case, the Court upheld the tax refund claims of Fortune Tobacco after finding invalid the proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99.&nbsp; We ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Section 145 states that during the transition period, <i>i.e.</i>, within the next three (3) years from the effectivity of the Tax Code, the excise tax from any brand of cigarettes shall not be lower than the tax due from each brand on 1 October 1996. This qualification, however, is conspicuously absent as regards the 12% increase which is to be applied on cigars and cigarettes packed by machine, among others, effective on 1 January 2000. Clearly and unmistakably, Section 145 mandates a new rate of excise tax for cigarettes packed by machine due to the 12% increase effective on 1 January 2000 without regard to whether the revenue collection starting from this period may turn out to be lower than that collected prior to this date.<br><br>By adding the qualification that the tax due after the 12% increase becomes effective shall not be lower than the tax actually paid prior to 1 January 2000, Revenue Regulation No. 17-99 effectively imposes a tax which is the higher amount between the <i>ad valorem</i> tax being paid at the end of the three (3)-year transition period and the specific tax under paragraph C, sub-paragraph (1)-(4), as increased by 12% - a situation not supported by the plain wording of Section 145 of the Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>Following the principle of <i>stare decisis</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> our ruling in the present case should no longer come as a surprise.&nbsp; The proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99 clearly went beyond the terms of the law it was supposed to implement, and therefore entitles Fortune Tobacco to claim a refund of the overpaid excise taxes collected pursuant to this provision.<br><br>The amount involved in the present case and the CIR's firm insistence of its arguments nonetheless compel us to take a second look at the issue, but our findings ultimately lead us to the same conclusion.&nbsp; Indeed, we find more reasons to disagree with the CIR's construction of the law than those stated in our 2008 <i>Fortune Tobacco</i> ruling, which was largely based on the application of the rules of statutory construction.<br><br><b><i>Raising government revenue is not the<br> sole objective of RA 8240</i></b><br><br>That RA 8240 (incorporated as Section 145 of the 1997 Tax Code) was enacted to raise government revenues is a given fact, but this is not the sole and only objective of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Congressional deliberations show that the shift from <i>ad valorem</i> to specific taxes introduced by the law was also intended to curb the corruption that became endemic to the imposition of <i>ad valorem</i> taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Since <i>ad valorem</i> taxes were based on the value of the goods, the prices of the goods were often manipulated to yield lesser taxes. The imposition of specific taxes, which are based on the volume of goods produced, would prevent price manipulation and also cure the unequal tax treatment created by the skewed valuation of similar goods.<br><br><b><i>Rule of uniformity of taxation violated by <br>the proviso in Section 1, RR 17-99</i></b><br><br>The Constitution requires that taxation should be uniform and equitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Uniformity in taxation requires that all subjects or objects of taxation, similarly situated, are to be treated alike both in privileges and liabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; This requirement, however, is unwittingly violated when the proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99 is applied in certain cases.&nbsp; To illustrate this point, we consider three brands of cigarettes, all classified as lower-priced cigarettes under Section 145(c)(4) of the 1997 Tax Code, since their net retail price is below P5.00 per pack:<br><br><blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="MIDDLE"> <td width="15%"> <div align="CENTER">Brand<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </div></td> <td width="10%"> <div align="CENTER">Net Retail Price per pack </div></td> <td width="15%"><div align="CENTER">(A)<br> <br> <i>Ad Valorem</i> Tax Due prior to Jan 1997 </div></td> <td width="15%"> <div align="CENTER">(B)<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific Tax under Section 145(C)(4)</div></td> <td width="15%"><div align="CENTER"> <p>(C) <br> <br> Specific Tax Due Jan 1997 to Dec 1999 </p> </div></td><td width="15%"><div style="text-align: center;"> </div><div align="CENTER"><div style="text-align: center;">(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div> <br> New Specific Tax&nbsp; imposing 12% increase by Jan 2000 </div></td> <td width="15%"> <div align="CENTER"> <p><b>(E</b><b>)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>New Specific Tax Due by Jan 2000 per RR 17-99</b> </p> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Camel KS </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">4.71 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">5.50 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">1.00/pack </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">5.50 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">1.12/pack </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>5.50</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Champion M 100 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">4.56 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">3.30 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">1.00/pack </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">3.30 </div></td><td> <div align="JUSTIFY">1.12/pack </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>3.30</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Union American Blend </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">4.64 </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1.09 </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1.00/pack </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1.09 </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">1.12/pack </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>1.12</b> </div></td> </tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br>Although the brands all belong to the same category, the proviso in Section 1, RR 17-99 authorized the imposition of different (and grossly disproportionate) tax rates (see column [D]).&nbsp; It effectively extended the qualification stated in the <b>third paragraph of Section 145(c)</b> <b>of the 1997 Tax Code</b> that was supposed to apply only during the transition period:<br><br><blockquote>The excise tax from any brand of cigarettes within the next three (3) years from the effectivity of R.A. No. 8240 shall not be lower than the tax, which is due from each brand on October 1, 1996[.]</blockquote><br>In the process, the CIR also perpetuated the unequal tax treatment of similar goods that was supposed to be cured by the shift from <i>ad valorem</i> to specific taxes.<br><br><b><i>The omission in the law in fact reveals the legislative<br> intent not to adopt the "higher tax rule"</i></b><br><br>The CIR claims that the <b>proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99</b> was patterned after the third paragraph of Section 145(c) of the 1997 Tax Code.&nbsp; Since the law's intent was to increase revenue, it found no reason not to apply the same "higher tax rule" to excise taxes due <i>after</i> the transition period despite the absence of a similar text in the wording of Section 145(c).&nbsp; What the CIR misses in his argument is that he applied the rule not only for cigarettes, but also for cigars, distilled spirits, wines and fermented liquors:<br><br><blockquote>Provided, however, that the new specific tax rate for any existing brand of cigars [and] cigarettes packed by machine, distilled spirits, wines and fermented liquors shall not be lower than the excise tax that is actually being paid prior to January 1, 2000.</blockquote><br>When the pertinent provisions of the 1997 Tax Code imposing excise taxes on these products are read, however, there is nothing similar to the third paragraph of Section 145(c) that can be found in the provisions imposing excise taxes on distilled spirits (Section 141<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>) and wines (Section 142<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>).&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the rule will also not apply to cigars as these products fall under Section 145(a).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Evidently, the 1997 Tax Code's provisions on excise taxes have omitted the adoption of certain tax measures.&nbsp; To our mind, these omissions are telling indications of the intent of Congress <b>not </b>to adopt the omitted tax measures; they are not simply unintended lapses in the law's wording that, as the CIR claims, are nevertheless covered by the spirit of the law.&nbsp; Had the intention of Congress been solely to increase revenue collection, a provision similar to the third paragraph of Section 145(c) would have been incorporated in Sections 141 and 142 of the 1997 Tax Code.&nbsp; This, however, is not the case.<br><br>We note that Congress was not unaware that the "higher tax rule" is a proviso that should ideally apply to the increase after the transition period (as the CIR embodied in the proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99).&nbsp; During the deliberations for the law amending Section 145 of the 1997 Tax Code (RA 9334), Rep. Jesli Lapuz adverted to the "higher tax rule" <i>after December 31, 1999 </i>when he stated:<br><br><blockquote>This bill serves as a catch-up measure as government attempts to collect additional revenues due it since 2001. Modifications are necessary indeed to capture the loss proceeds and prevent further erosion in revenue base. x x x.&nbsp; As it is, it plugs a major loophole in the ambiguity of the law as evidenced by recent disputes resulting in the government being ordered by the courts to refund taxpayers.&nbsp; This bill clarifies that the excise tax due on the products shall not be lower than the tax due as of the date immediately prior to the effectivity of the act or the excise tax due as of December 31, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>This remark notwithstanding, the final version of the bill that became RA 9334 contained no provision similar to the proviso in Section 1 of RR 17-99 that imposed the tax due as of December 31, 1999 if this tax is higher than the new specific tax rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it appears that despite its awareness of the need to protect the increase of excise taxes to increase government revenue, Congress ultimately decided against adopting the "higher tax rule.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The decision dated July 12, 2007 and the resolution dated October 4, 2007 of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA E.B.
