CV No. 65559 </b>and the<b> Resolution</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 17, 2003, both of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>The <i>Sangguniang Barangay </i>of <i>Barangay</i> Sun Valley (the "BSV <i>Sangguniang Barangay</i>") issued <b>BSV Resolution No. 98-096</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on October 13, 1998, entitled "Directing the New Sun Valley Homeowners Association to Open Rosemallow and Aster Streets to Vehicular and Pedestrian Traffic," the pertinent portions of which read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved as it is hereby resolved by the Sangguniang Barangay in session assembled that -<br><br>1. Pursuant to its power and authority under the Local Government Code of 1991 (Rep. Act No. 7160), the New Sun Valley Homeowners Association (NSVHA) is hereby directed to open Rosemallow and Aster Sts. to vehicular (private cars only) and pedestrian traffic at all hours daily except from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. at which time the said streets may be closed for the sake of the security of the residents therein.<br><br>2. The Barangay government take steps to address the security concerns of the residents of the area concerned, including the possible assignment of a barangay tanod or traffic enforcer therein, within the limits of the authority and financial capability of the Barangay.<br><br>3. This Resolution shall become executory within 72 hours upon receipt hereof by the Association or any of its members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>The New Sun Valley Homeowners Association, Inc. (NSVHAI), represented by its President, Marita Cortez, filed a <b>Petition</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for a "Writ of Preliminary Injunction/Permanent Injunction with prayer for issuance of TRO" with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Parañaque City.&nbsp; This was docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 98-0420</b>. NSVHAI claimed therein that the implementation of BSV Resolution No. 98-096 would "cause grave injustice and irreparable injury" as "[the] affected homeowners acquired their properties for strictly residential purposes";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> that the subdivision is a place that the homeowners envisioned would provide them privacy and "a peaceful neighborhood, free from the hassles of public places";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and that the passage of the Resolution would destroy the character of the subdivision. NSVHAI averred that contrary to what was stated in the BSV Resolution, the opening of the gates of the subdivision would not in any manner ease the traffic congestion in the area, and that there were alternative routes available. According to NSVHAI, the opening of the proposed route to all kinds of vehicles would result in contributing to the traffic build-up on Doña Soledad Avenue, and that instead of easing the traffic flow, it would generate a heavier volume of vehicles in an already congested choke point.&nbsp; NSVHAI went on to state that a deterioration of the peace and order condition inside the subdivision would be inevitable; that the maintenance of peace and order in the residential area was one of the reasons why entry and exit to the subdivision was regulated by the Association and why the passing through of vehicles was controlled and limited; and that criminal elements would take advantage of the opening to public use of the roads in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>NSVHAI further contested the BSV Resolution by submitting the following arguments to the RTC:<br><br><blockquote>12. The road network inside the subdivision and drainage system is not designed to withstand the entry of a heavy volume of vehicles especially delivery vans and trucks. Thus, destruction of the roads and drainage system will result. The safety, health and well-being of the residents will face continuous danger to their detriment and prejudice;<br><br>13. When the residents bought their residential properties, they also paid proportionately for the roads and the park in then subdivision.&nbsp; They have therefore an existing equity on these roads. To open the roads to public use is a violation of the rights and interests to a secure, peaceful and healthful environment;<br><br>14. Aside from the availability of a better route to be opened, there are other ways to ease traffic flow. The continuous presence of traffic enforcers on all identified traffic choke points will prevent snarls which impede smooth travel. The strict enforcement of traffic rules and regulations should be done;<br><br>15.&nbsp; There are a lot of undisciplined drivers of tricycles, jeepneys, trucks and delivery [vans], which contribute to the traffic congestion. The barangay should require these drivers to observe road courtesy and obedience to traffic rules[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Executive Judge Helen Bautista-Ricafort of the RTC issued a <b>Temporary Restraining Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><b> (TRO) </b>in Civil Case No. 98-0420 on October 30, 1998.&nbsp; Said Order provides:<br><br><blockquote>Acting on the Application for Writ of Preliminary Injunction/ Permanent Injunction with Prayer for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order, filed by plaintiff and considering that there is extreme urgency, such that unless the same is issued, plaintiff would suffer grave injustice and/or irreparable injury, let a Temporary Restraining Order issue directing the Sangguniang Barangay as represented by Punong Barangay Roberto Guevarra to cease and desist from the implementation of Resolution No. 98-096 or otherwise maintain the status quo until further Orders of this Court.<br><br>This Temporary Restraining Order shall be effective for seventy two (72) hours from issuance hereof, unless extended by another Order of this Court.<br><br>Let this case be set for special raffle and conference on November 3, 1998 at 10:30 in the morning.<br></blockquote><br>On November 3, 1998, the RTC issued another <b>Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> stating that, by agreement of the parties, the <i>status quo</i> shall be maintained for seventeen (17) more days, and that the case was set for hearing on the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction on November 20, 1998 at 8:30 a.m.<br><br>NSVHAI submitted an <b>Amended Petition</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> on November 13, 1998, at about 11:10 a.m., wherein it claimed that the BSV <i>Sangguniang Barangay </i> had no jurisdiction over the opening of Rosemallow and Aster Streets (the "subject roads").&nbsp; NSVHAI likewise attached to its Amended Petition its Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated July 21, 1998, which set forth its objection to the opening of the subject roads for public use and argued that a <b><i>Barangay</i> Resolution</b> cannot validly cause the opening of the subject roads because under the law, an <b>ordinance</b> is required to effect such an act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The BSV <i>Sangguniang</i> <i>Barangay</i> filed its <b>Motion to Dismiss</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> likewise on November 13, 1998.&nbsp; The copy provided by petitioner to the Court indicates the time of receipt by NSVHAI as 11:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The RTC heard the case on November 20, 1998, as scheduled, and thereafter submitted the matter for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; On the same date, the RTC issued the following <b>Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>Acting on the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction filed by petitioner, it appearing that petitioner may suffer grave injustice or irreparable injury, let a writ of preliminary injunction issue prohibiting the Sangguniang Barangay represented by Punong Barangay Roberto Guevarra from implementing Resolution no. 98-096 until further orders from this Court.<br><br>Petitioner is directed to file a bond in the amount of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P100,000.00) PESOS (<i>sic</i>) to answer for damages to defendants in the event the Court finds petitioner is not entitled to said injunction.</blockquote><br>The BSV <i>Sangguniang</i> <i>Barangay</i> filed on December 4, 1998 a <b>Motion for Reconsideration and to Dissolve Preliminary Injunction (with Memorandum of Authorities)</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>NSVHAI then filed an <b>Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Expunge</b> on December 10, 1998, moving to declare the above motion of the BSV <i>Sangguniang</i> <i>Barangay</i> as a mere scrap of paper for being filed out of time and for failure to serve a copy thereof to the counsel of petitioner.<br><br>The RTC subsequently dismissed the case in an <b>Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated August 17, 1999, stating as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Defendant Barangay Sun Valley moves to dismiss the instant case on the grounds that the complaint states no cause of action and the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter. In summary, defendant alleges that the subject streets Aster and Rosemallow inside Sun Valley Subdivision are owned by the local government.&nbsp; Such streets have long been part of the public domain and beyond the commerce of man. In support of this, defendant cited the case of White Plains Association, Inc. vs. Legaspi, 193 SCRA 765 wherein it was held that road lots of subdivisions constitute a part of the mandatory open space reserved for public use; ownership of which is automatically vested in the Republic of the Philippines although it is still registered in the name of the developer/owner, its donation to the government is a mere formality." The power or authority to close or open the said streets is vested in the local government units and not on homeowner's associations, pursuant to Section 21 of the local Government Code (RA 7160) quoted as follows: "Section 21. Closure and Opening of Roads. (a) A local government unit may, pursuant to an ordinance, permanently or temporarily close or open any local road, alley, park, or square falling within its jurisdiction x x x." In view thereof, Resolution No. 98-096 was passed by the Sangguniang Barangay. Hence there is no right whatsoever on the part of Plaintiff NSVHA entitled to the protection of the law. Further, defendant contends that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies as ordained in Sections 32 and 57 of the Local Government Code giving the city mayor the supervisory power, and the power of review by the Sangguniang Panlungsod, respectively.<br><br>No opposition to the motion to dismiss was filed by the Plaintiff.<br><br>Same defendant seeks to reconsider the order granting the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction alleging that there is a pending motion to dismiss and Plaintiff has not been able to establish an actually existing right.<br><br>Plaintiff has not filed an opposition thereto, instead it filed an urgent ex-parte motion to expunge the motion for reconsideration on the ground that its counsel has not been furnished with a copy of the motion for reconsideration, but the record shows that Maria Cortez (plaintiff's representative) has received a copy of said motion.<br><br>After considering the arguments of the parties in their respective pleadings, this court hereby resolves as follows:<br><ol><li>The "Motion for Reconsideration" and the "Urgent Ex-parte Motion to Expunge (motion for reconsideration)" are Denied being devoid of merit; and<br><br></li><li>The "Motion to Dismiss" is hereby Granted for failure of the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies under Sections 32&nbsp; and 57 of the Local Government Code.</li></ol><br>WHEREFORE, let this case be as it is hereby ordered Dismissed. The writ of preliminary injunction is hereby lifted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>NSVHAI filed a <b>Motion for Reconsideration</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the above-quoted Order but this was denied by the RTC for lack of merit in an <b>Order</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated September 21, 1999.<br><br>NSVHAI raised the matter to the Court of Appeals and the case was docketed as <b>CA-G.R.

Respondents likewise claimed that the<i> </i>BSV's action could be considered a political question, which should be essentially withdrawn from judicial cognizance, and constitutional law doctrine provides that the courts would not interfere with political issues unless grave abuse of discretion is shown, of which there was none on the part of the <i>Barangay</i>.&nbsp; Respondents argued that petitioner did not have any actual legal right entitled to the protection of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Respondents attached to their Appellees' Brief six documents, labeled as Annexes "2" to "7," all stamped "Certified True Copy" by a certain Roman E.

Petitioner insists that the supposed titles to the subject roads were never submitted to the RTC, and the respondents merely attached certifications that the ownership of the subject roads was already vested in the City Government of Parañaque City as Annexes to their Appellees' Brief before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Those annexes, according to petitioner, were not formally offered as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that the records of Civil Case No. 98-0420 clearly show that there was no proof or evidence on record to support the findings of the Court of Appeals.

As such, the residents of Sun Valley Subdivision have all the right to regulate the roads and open spaces within their territorial jurisdiction.<br><br>This Honorable Supreme Court can take judicial knowledge that criminal activities such as robbery and kidnappings are becoming daily fares in Philippine society. Residents have invested their lifetime's savings in private subdivision since subdivision living afford them privacy, exclusivity and foremost of all, safety. Living in a subdivision has a premium and such premium translates into a comparatively more expensive lot because of the safety, among others, that subdivision lifestyle offers.<br><br>But, with the enactment and intended implementation of Sangguniang Barangay Resolution No. 98-096 to open Rosemallow and Aster Streets for public use, it is indubitable that, instead of promoting the safety of resident of Sun Valley Subdivision, respondents are endangering the life and property of the residents of the said subdivision as they will now be exposed to criminal and lawless elements.<br><br>It is respectfully submitted that Sangguniang Barangay Resolution No. 98-096 has a place only in an authoritarian government where proprietary rights and privacy are alien concepts.

Respondents further claim that by the end of the hearing, after Atty. Florencio R. Herrera's manifestation on the donated public roads, counsels for both parties were asked by the court if they were submitting, and both of them answered in the affirmative. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents aver that petitioner's reply to its charge of misleading the Court was an admission that counsel had tampered without authority with the TSN, and that the phrase "referring to the scheduled hearing of the prayer for the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> was said counsel's own mere footnote.<br><br>Respondents allege that the issuance of the titles in favor of Parañaque over all the roads in Sun Valley Subdivision was an official act by the land registration office of the City of Parañaque, and was perfectly within the judicial notice of the Courts, pursuant to Rule 129, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents likewise allege that the gates were earlier built illegally on the roads by the Association, and while petitioner may lend a helping hand to the <i>barangay</i>, it cannot control the latter's discretion as to the wisdom of its traffic policies within the <i>barangay</i>.&nbsp; They maintain that petitioner had no business putting up road blocks in the first place; that this matter is purely a local government determination; and that it is even doubtful if courts would encroach upon this autonomous determination for local constituents of the <i>Barangay</i> in deference to the doctrine of separation of powers.<br><br>Respondents claim that since the subject matter of the case is a directive of the <i>Barangay</i> to the petitioner, the requirement for an ordinance would not be necessary, as there was no legislative determination in the <i>Barangay</i> resolution regarding what class of roads to open or what to close by way of general policy. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Respondents contend that the <i>Barangay</i> Resolution was internal and temporary, passed to solve a traffic problem.&nbsp; They propose a reason why petitioner allegedly wants to control the subject roads, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The directive of the Barangay is certainly a declaration of an intention expressed by resolution on complaints of residents for a convenient outlet of cars and pedestrians during certain hours of the [day] or night. This need not be the subject of an ordinance. It is addressed to a special group of residents, and not to the general community. It refers to particular roads and at certain hours only, not to all the roads and at all hours.<br><br>Hence, the Barangay Resolutions (<i>sic</i>) is but temporary in character, being a solution to a momentary traffic problem then visualized by the Barangay and encouraged by the MMDA. There is no legal question involved that is of any concern to the NSVHA. The prevailing reason why the NSVHA desires to control the roads is the monetary consideration it gains by its unilateral requirement of car stickers and of substantial fees exacted from delivery vans and trucks for bringing in cargo into the subdivision. And yet, the residents who, never gave their consent to this activities (<i>sic</i>), are busy people and have merely tolerated this for a long time now. This tolerance did not of course give legality to the illegal act. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br>As regards petitioner's argument that the BSV <i>Sangguniang Barangay</i> should have passed an ordinance instead of a resolution, respondents present their counter-argument as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Hence, even assuming for the sake of argument that a legal question exists on whether it be a resolution or ordinance that should contain the Barangay directive, such an issue is of no moment as plaintiff-appellant <u>failed to exhaust the necessary administrative remedies</u> before resorting to court action, as found by the trial court and the Court of Appeals. Section 32, R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991) provides for a remedy from Barangay actions to the Mayor under the latter's power of general supervision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br>With regard to the Mayor's involvement in this case, respondents have this to say:<br><br><blockquote>The Mayor's act of interfering in Barangay Sun Valley affairs stemmed out of a long-standing political feud of the Mayor with the Punong Barangay. Its general supervision did not extend to pure Barangay matters, which the Barangay would be x x x in a better position to determine.<br><br>Furthermore, the general supervision of the Mayor is limited to the overseeing authority that the Barangays act within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions. Sadly, there is nothing in this Mayor's letter x x x that would as much as show a deviation by the Barangay Sun Valley from any prescribed powers or function. The Mayor's directive to the Barangay is of doubtful legality.<br><br>It was mainly the mounting traffic problem progressively experienced through the years that prompted the Barangay to resolve to open Rosemallow and Aster Streets in accordance with its power under Section 21 of R.A. 7160 to "temporarily open or close any local road falling within its jurisdiction". This Resolution x x x was decided upon after the Barangay Council made the necessary investigation and conducted hearings in consultation with affected residents. In order to maintain some kind of cordial relationship with the NSVHA, the Barangay by its resolution, opted to give the NSVHA the chance to open the roads, which it earlier closed by means of arbitrarily putting up steel gates without any apparent authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>Furthermore, respondents aver that the trial court and the appellate court have ruled that only a local government unit (LGU), in this case the <i>Barangay</i>, can open or close roads, whether they be public or private, in accordance with Section 21 of the Local Government Code. Respondents contend that <i>Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc.</i>,<i><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></b></i> wherein the Court discussed the power of LGUs to open and close roads, is substantially in point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>After the submission of the parties' respective memoranda,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this case was submitted for decision.<br><br>The issues before us are:<br><br><ol><li>Whether or not petitioner has a right to the protection of the law that would entitle it to injunctive relief against the implementation of BSV Resolution No. 98-096; and<br><br></li><li>Whether or not petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</li></ol><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</center><br>The Court of Appeals passed upon petitioner's claims as to the validity of the dismissal in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>We do not agree. Although the Motion to Dismiss was filed on the same day, but after, the Amended Petition was filed, the same cannot be considered as directed merely against the original petition which Appellant already considers as non-existing. The records will show that Appellant's Amended Petition contained no material amendments to the original petition. Both allege the same factual circumstances or events that constitute the Appellant's cause of action anent the Appellee's alleged violation of Appellant's propriety rights over the subdivision roads in question. Corollarily, the allegations in Appellees' Motion to Dismiss, as well as the grounds therefore predicated on lack of cause of action and jurisdiction, could very well be considered as likewise addressed to Appellant's Amended Petition.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>It bears stressing that due process simply means giving every contending party the opportunity to be heard and the court to consider every piece of evidence presented in their favor (Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company versus Benjamin Bitanga, G.R. Nos. 137934 &amp; 137936[)]. In the instant case, Appellant cannot be said to have been denied of due process. As borne by the records, while Appellees' Motion to Dismiss did not set the time for the hearing of the motion, the day set therefore was the same date set for the hearing of Appellant's prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction - that is, November 20, 1998, with the precise purpose of presenting evidence in support of the motion to dismiss on the same said scheduled hearing date and time when Appellant and its counsel would be present. Moreover, Appellant's predication of lack of due hearing is belied by the fact that the hearing held on November 20, 1999 took up not only the matter of whether or not to grant the injunction, but also tackled the jurisdictional issue raised in Appellees' Motion to Dismiss, which issues were intertwined in both incidents. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><br>We see no reason to depart from these findings by the Court of Appeals. Petitioner's recourse in questioning BSV Resolution No. 98-096 should have been with the Mayor of Parañaque City, as clearly stated in Section 32 of the Local Government Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 32. <i>City and Municipal Supervision over Their Respective Barangays</i>. -</b> The city or municipality, through the city or municipal mayor concerned, shall exercise general supervision over component barangays to ensure that said barangays act within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions.</blockquote><br>We do not see how petitioner's act could qualify as an exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.&nbsp; We have emphasized the importance of applying this doctrine in a recent case, wherein we held:<br><br><blockquote>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is a cornerstone of our judicial system.&nbsp; The thrust of the rule is that courts must allow administrative agencies to carry out their functions and discharge their responsibilities within the specialized areas of their respective competence. The rationale for this doctrine is obvious.&nbsp; It entails lesser expenses and provides for the speedier resolution of controversies.&nbsp; Comity and convenience also impel courts of justice to shy away from a dispute until the system of administrative redress has been completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>It is the Mayor who can best review the <i>Sangguniang Barangay</i>'s actions to see if it acted within the scope of its prescribed powers and functions.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a local problem to be resolved within the local government. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly found that the trial court committed no reversible error in dismissing the case for petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, as the requirement under the Local Government Code that the closure and opening of roads be made pursuant to an ordinance, instead of a resolution, is not applicable in this case because the subject roads belong to the City Government of Parañaque.<br><br>Moreover, being the party asking for injunctive relief, the burden of proof was on petitioner to show ownership over the subject roads.&nbsp; This, petitioner failed to do.<br><br>In civil cases, it is a basic rule that the party making allegations has the burden of proving them by a preponderance of evidence.&nbsp; Parties must rely on the strength of their own evidence and not upon the weakness of the defense offered by their opponent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Petitioner dared to question the <i>barangay</i>'s ownership over the subject roads when it should have been the one to adduce evidence to support its broad claims of exclusivity and privacy.&nbsp; Petitioner did not submit an iota of proof to support its acts of ownership, which, as pointed out by respondents, consisted of closing the subject roads that belonged to the then Municipality of Parañaque and were already being used by the public, limiting their use exclusively to the subdivision's homeowners, and collecting fees from delivery vans that would pass through the gates that they themselves had built.&nbsp; It is petitioner's authority to put up the road blocks in the first place that becomes highly questionable absent any proof of ownership.<br><br>On the other hand, the local government unit's power to close and open roads within its jurisdiction is clear under the Local Government Code, Section 21 of which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 21. Closure and Opening of Roads. <b>- </b>(a) A local government unit may, <u>pursuant to an ordinance</u>, permanently<b> </b>or<b> </b>temporarily close or open any local road, alley, park, or square falling within its jurisdiction<b>:</b> <i>Provided, however</i>, That in case of permanent closure, such ordinance must be approved by at least two-thirds (2/3) of all the members of the sanggunian, and when necessary, an adequate substitute for the public facility that is subject to closure is provided.</blockquote><br>We quote with approval the ruling of the Court of Appeals in this regard, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Contrary, however, to Appellant's position, the above-quoted provision, which requires the passage of an ordinance by a local government unit to effect the opening of a local road, can have no applicability to the instant case since the subdivision road lots sought to be opened to decongest traffic in the area - namely Rosemallow and Aster Streets - have already been donated by the Sun Valley Subdivision to, and the titles thereto already issued in the name of, the City Government of Parañaque since the year 1964 (Annexes "2" to "7" of Appellees' Brief). This fact has not even been denied by the Appellant in the proceedings below nor in the present recourse. Having been already donated or turned over to the City Government of Parañaque, the road lots in question have since then taken the nature of public roads which are withdrawn from the commerce of man, and hence placed beyond the private rights or claims of herein Appellant. Accordingly, the Appellant was not in the lawful exercise of its predicated rights when it built obstructing structures closing the road lots in question to vehicular traffic for the use of the general Public. Consequently, Appellees' act of passing the disputed barangay resolution, the implementation of which is sought to be restrained by Appellant, had for its purpose not the opening of a private road but may be considered merely as a directive or reminder to the Appellant to cause the opening of a public road which should rightfully be open for use to the general public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner wants this Court to recognize the rights and interests of the residents of Sun Valley Subdivision but it miserably failed to establish the legal basis, such as its ownership of the subject roads, which entitles petitioner to the remedy prayed for.&nbsp; It even wants this Court to take "judicial knowledge that criminal activities such as robbery and kidnappings are becoming daily fares in Philippine society."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; This is absurd.
