				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Two vehicles, a tractor-trailer and a jitney,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> figured in a vehicular mishap along Maharlika Highway in <i>Barangay</i> Agos, Polangui, Albay last 12 August 1994.&nbsp; Laarni Pomasin (Laarni) was driving the jitney towards the direction of Legaspi City while the tractor-trailer, driven by Claudio Jabon (Jabon), was traversing the opposite lane going towards Naga City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The opposing parties gave two different versions of the incident.<br><br>Gregorio Pomasin (Gregorio), Laarni's father, was on board the jitney and seated on the passenger's side.&nbsp; He testified that while the jitney was passing through a curve going downward, he saw a tractor-trailer coming from the opposite direction and encroaching on the jitney's lane.&nbsp; The jitney was hit by the tractor-trailer and it was dragged further causing death and injuries to its passengers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Jabon recounted that while he was driving the tractor-trailer, he noticed a jitney on the opposite lane falling off the shoulder of the road. Thereafter, it began running in a zigzag manner and heading towards the direction of the truck.&nbsp; To avoid collision, Jabon immediately swerved the tractor-trailer to the right where it hit a tree and sacks of <i>palay</i>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the jitney still hit the left fender of the tractor-trailer before it was thrown a few meters away.&nbsp; The tractor-trailer was likewise damaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Multiple death and injuries to those in the jitney resulted.<br><br>Gregorio was injured and brought to the Albay Provincial Hospital in Legaspi City.&nbsp; His daughter, Andrea Pomasin Pagunsan, sister Narcisa Pomasin Roncales and Abraham Dionisio Perol died on the spot.&nbsp; His other daughter Laarni, the jitney driver, and granddaughter Annie Jane Pomasin Pagunsan expired at the hospital.&nbsp; His wife, Consorcia Pomasin, another granddaughter Dianne Pomasin Pagunsan, Ricky Ponce, Vicente Pomasin, Gina Sesista, Reynaldo Sesista, Antonio Sesista and Sonia Perol sustained injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On the other hand, Jabon and one of the passengers in the tractor-trailer were injured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Albert Tison (Tison), the owner of the truck, extended financial assistance to respondents by giving them P1,000.00 each immediately after the accident and P200,000.00 to Cynthia Pomasin (Cynthia), one of Gregorio's daughters. Cynthia, in turn, executed an Affidavit of Desistance.<br><br>On 14 November 1994, respondents filed a complaint for damages against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Antipolo.&nbsp; They alleged that the proximate cause of the accident was the negligence, imprudence and carelessness of petitioners.&nbsp; Respondents prayed for indemnification for the heirs of those who perished in the accident at P50,000.00 each; P500,000.00 for hospitalization, medical and burial expenses; P350,000.00 for continuous hospitalization and medical expenses of Spouses Pomasin; P1,000,000.00 as moral damages; P250,000.00 as exemplary damages; P30,000.00 for loss of income of Cynthia; P100,000.00 as attorney's fees plus P1,000.00 per court appearance; P50,000.00 for litigation expenses; and cost of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In their Answer, petitioners countered that it was Laarni's negligence which proximately caused the accident.&nbsp; They further claimed that Cynthia was authorized by Spouses Pomasin to enter into an amicable settlement by executing an Affidavit of Desistance. Notwithstanding the affidavit, petitioners complained that respondents filed the instant complaint to harass them and profit from the recklessness of Laarni. Petitioners counterclaimed for damages.<br><br>Petitioners subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in view of the Affidavit of Desistance executed by Cynthia.&nbsp; The motion was denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 7 February 2000, the Regional Trial Court rendered judgment in favor of petitioners dismissing the complaint for damages, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants and against plaintiffs hereby DISMISSING the instant complaint considering that plaintiffs have authorized Cynthia Pomasin to settle the case amicably for P200,000.00; and that the proximate cause of the accident did not arise from the fault or negligence of defendants' driver/employee but from plaintiff's driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court considered the testimony of Jabon regarding the incident more convincing and reliable than that of Gregorio's, a mere passenger, whose observation and attention to the road is not as focused as that of the driver.&nbsp; The trial court concluded that Laarni caused the collision of the jitney and the tractor-trailer.&nbsp; The trial court likewise upheld the Affidavit of Desistance as having been executed with the tacit consent of respondents.<br><br>The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court and ruled that the reckless driving of Jabon caused the vehicular collision.&nbsp; In support of such finding, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on Gregorio's testimony that Jabon was driving the tractor-trailer downward too fast and it encroached the lane of the jitney. Based on the gravity of the impact and the damage caused to the jitney resulting in the death of some passengers, the Court of Appeals inferred that Jabon must be speeding.&nbsp; The appellate court noted that the restriction in Jabon's driver's license was violated, thus, giving rise to the presumption that he was negligent at the time of the accident.&nbsp; Tison was likewise held liable for damages for his failure to prove due diligence in supervising Jabon after he was hired as driver of the truck.&nbsp; Finally, the appellate court disregarded the Affidavit of Desistance executed by Cynthia because the latter had no written power of attorney from respondents and that she was so confused at the time when she signed the affidavit that she did not read its content.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the present appeal is granted, and the trial court's Decision dated February 7, 2003 is set aside.&nbsp; Defendants-appellees are ordered to pay plaintiffs-appellants or their heirs the following:<br><br>a) Actual damages of P136,000.00 as above computed, to be offset with the P200,000.00 received by plaintiff-appellant Cynthia Pomasin;<br><br>b) Civil indemnity of P50,000.00 for the death of each victim, to be offset with the balance of P64,000.00 from the aforementioned P200,000.00 of civil indemnity received by plaintiff-appellant Cynthia Pomasin.&nbsp; Hence, the net amount is computed at P37,200.00 each, as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Narcisa Pomasin</div></td> <td width="50%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">P37,200.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Laarni Pomasin </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">P37,200.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Andrea P.

This most particularly holds true in vehicular collision or accident cases which oftentimes happen merely momentarily or in the split of a second.&nbsp; In the case of a running or travelling vehicle, especially in highway travel which doubtless involves faster speed than in ordinary roads, the driver is concentrated on his driving continuously from moment to moment even in long trips.&nbsp; While in the case of a mere passenger, he does not have to direct his attention to the safe conduct of the travelling vehicle, as in fact he may converse with other passengers and pay no attention to the driving or safe conduct of the travelling vehicle, as he may even doze off to sleep if he wants to, rendering his opportunity for observation on the precise cause of the accident or collision or immediately preceding thereto not as much as that of the driver whose attention is continuously focused on his driving.&nbsp; So that as between the respective versions of the plaintiffs thru their passenger and that of the defendants thru their driver as to the cause or antecedent causes that led to the vehicular collision in this case, the version of the driver of defendant should ordinarily be more reliable than the version of a mere passenger of Plaintiffs' vehicle, simply because the attention of the passenger is not as much concentrated on the driving as that of the driver, consequently the capacity for observation of the latter of the latter on the matter testified to which is the precise point of inquiry --- the proximate cause of the accident --- is more reasonably reliable. Moreover, the passenger's vision is not as good as that of the driver from the vantage point of the driver's seat especially in nighttime, thus rendering a passenger's opportunity for observation on the antecedent causes of the collision lesser than that of the driver. This being so, this Court is more inclined to believe the story of defendant's driver Claudio Jabon that the jitney driven by Laarni Pomasin fell off the shoulder of the curved road causing it to run thereafter in a zigzag manner and in the process the two vehicles approaching each other from opposite directions at highway speed came in contact with each other, the zigzagging jeep hitting the left fender of the truck all the way to the fuel tank, the violent impact resulting in the lighter vehicle, the jitney, being thrown away due to the disparate size of the truck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>The appellate court labelled the trial court's rationalization as a "sweeping conjecture"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and countered that Gregorio was actually occupying the front seat of the jitney and had actually a clear view of the incident despite the fact that he was not driving.<br><br>While it is logical that a driver's attention to the road travelled is keener than that of a mere passenger, it should also be considered that the logic will hold only if the two are similarly circumstanced, and only as a general rule, so that, it does not necessarily follow that between the opposing testimonies of a driver and a passenger, the former is more credible. The factual setting of the event testified on must certainly be considered.<br><br>The trial court did just that in the instant case.&nbsp; Contrary to the observation of the Court of Appeals, the relative positions of a driver and a passenger in a vehicle was not the only basis of analysis of the trial court.&nbsp; Notably, aside from Jabon's alleged vantage point to clearly observe the incident, the trial court also took into consideration Gregorio's admission that prior to the accident, the jitney was running on the "curving and downward" portion of the highway.&nbsp; The appellate court, however, took into account the other and opposite testimony of Gregorio that it was their jitney that was going uphill and when it was about to reach a curve, he saw the incoming truck running very fast and encroaching the jitney's lane.<br><br>We perused the transcript of stenographic notes and found that the truck was actually ascending the highway when it collided with the descending jitney.<br><br>During the direct examination, Jabon narrated that the tractor-trailer was ascending at a speed of 35 to 40 kilometers per hour when he saw the jitney on the opposite lane running in a zigzag manner, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Now, when you passed by the municipality of Polangui, Albay at about 5:00 of August 12, 1994, could you tell the Court if there was any untoward incident that happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">There was sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Could you please tell the Court?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">While on my way to Liboro coming from Sorsogon, I met on my way a vehicle going on a zigzag direction and it even fell on the shoulder and proceeded going on its way on a zigzag direction.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Could you describe to the Court what was the kind of vehicle you saw running in zigzag direction?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A Toyota-jitney loaded with passengers with top-load.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">You said that the top[-]load of the jeep is loaded?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Could you please tell the Court what was your speed at the time when you saw that jeepney with top[-]load running on a zigzag manner?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I was running 35 to 40 kilometers per hour because I was <b>ascending plain</b>.

(Emphasis supplied).</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The declaration of Jabon with respect to the road condition was straightforward and consistent. The recollection of Gregorio veered from "curving and downward" to uphill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; On this point, Jabon and his testimony is more credible.<br><br>The fact that the jitney easily fell into the road shoulder, an undebated fact, supports the trial court's conclusion that the jitney was indeed going downhill which, it may be repeated, was the original testimony of Gregorio that the road was "curving and downward."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It is this conclusion, prodded by the inconsistency of Gregorio's testimony, that gives credence to the further testimony of Jabon that the herein respondent's jitney, "loaded with passengers with top-load" "was running in a zigzag manner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Going downward, the jitney had the tendency to accelerate.&nbsp; The fall into the shoulder of the road can result in the loss of control of the jitney, which explains why it was running in a zigzag manner before it hit the tractor-trailer.<br><br>There was no showing that the tractor-trailer was speeding.&nbsp; There is a preponderance of evidence that the tractor-trailer was in fact ascending.&nbsp; Considering its size and the weight of the tractor-trailer, its speed could not be more than that of a fully loaded jitney which was running downhill in a zigzagging manner.<br><br>Neither can it be inferred that Jabon was negligent.&nbsp; In hindsight, it can be argued that Jabon should have swerved to the right upon seeing the jitney zigzagging before it collided with the tractor-trailer. Accidents, though, happen in an instant, and, understandably in this case, leaving the driver without sufficient time and space to maneuver a vehicle the size of a tractor-trailer uphill and away from collision with the jitney oncoming downhill.<br><br>Clearly, the negligence of Gregorio's daughter, Laarni was the proximate cause of the accident.<br><br>We did not lose sight of the fact that at the time of the incident, Jabon was prohibited from driving the truck due to the restriction imposed on his driver's license, <i>i.e.,</i> restriction code 2 and 3.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, Jabon even asked the Land Transportation Office to reinstate his articulated license containing restriction code 8 which would allow him to drive a tractor-trailer.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals concluded therefrom that Jabon was violating a traffic regulation at the time of the collision.<br><br>Driving without a proper license is a violation of traffic regulation.&nbsp; Under Article 2185 of the Civil Code, the legal presumption of negligence arises if at the time of the mishap, a person was violating any traffic regulation.&nbsp; However, in <i>Sanitary Steam Laundry, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> we held that a causal connection must exist between the injury received and the violation of the traffic regulation.&nbsp; It must be proven that the violation of the traffic regulation was the proximate or legal cause of the injury or that it substantially contributed thereto.&nbsp; Negligence, consisting in whole or in part, of violation of law, like any other negligence, is without legal consequence unless it is a contributing cause of the injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise controlling is our ruling in <i>Añonuevo v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> where we reiterated that negligence <i>per se</i>, arising from the mere violation of a traffic statute, need not be sufficient in itself in establishing liability for damages.&nbsp; In said case, <i>Añonuevo</i>, who was driving a car, did not attempt "to establish a causal connection between the safety violations imputed to the injured cyclist, and the accident itself. Instead, he relied on a putative presumption that these violations in themselves sufficiently established negligence appreciable against the cyclist. Since the onus on <i>Añonuevo</i> is to conclusively prove the link between the violations and the accident, we can deem him as having failed to discharge his necessary burden of proving the cyclist's own liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; We took the occasion to state that:<br><br><blockquote>The rule on negligence <i>per se</i> must admit qualifications that may arise from the logical consequences of the facts leading to the mishap. The doctrine (and Article 2185, for that matter) is undeniably useful as a judicial guide in adjudging liability, for it seeks to impute culpability arising from the failure of the actor to perform up to a standard established by a legal fiat. But the doctrine should not be rendered inflexible so as to deny relief when in fact there is no causal relation between the statutory violation and the injury sustained. Presumptions in law, while convenient, are not intractable so as to forbid rebuttal rooted in fact.
