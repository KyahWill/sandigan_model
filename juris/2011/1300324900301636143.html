Galeos"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>As lone witness for the prosecution, Esperidion R. Canoneo testified that he has been a resident of Pangdan, Naga, Cebu since 1930 and claimed to be friends with Ong, Galeos and Rivera. He knows the mother of Galeos, Pining Suarez or Peñaranda Suarez. But when the prosecutor mentioned "Bining Suarez," Canoneo stated that Bining Suarez is the mother of Galeos and that Bining Suarez is the same person as "Bernardita Suarez."&nbsp; Ong is related to Galeos because Ong's mother, Conchita Suarez, and Galeos' mother, Bernardita Suarez, are sisters. As to Rivera, his wife Kensiana,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> is the daughter of Mercedes Suarez who is also a sister of Conchita Suarez. He knew the Suarez sisters because they were the neighbors of his grandmother whom he frequently visited when he was still studying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Both Galeos and Rivera testified that they only provided the entries in their SALN but did not personally fill up the forms as these were already filled up by "people in the municipal hall" when they signed them.<br><br>Galeos, when shown his 1993 SALN,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> confirmed his signature thereon. When he was asked if he understood the question&nbsp; "To the best of your knowledge, are you related within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity to anyone working in the government?" he answered in the negative. He claimed that the "X" mark corresponding to the answer "No" to said question, as well as the other entries in his SALN, were already filled up when he signed it. When shown his SALN for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, Galeos reiterated that they were already filled up and he was only made to sign them by an employee of the municipal hall whom he only remembers by face. He also admitted that he carefully read the documents and all the entries therein were explained to him before he affixed his signature on the document. However, when asked whether he understands the term "fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity" stated in the SALNs, he answered in the negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Rivera testified that he was not aware that his wife was a close relative of the Municipal Mayor because when he asked her, the latter told him that Ong was a distant relative of hers.&nbsp; Rivera added that it was not Ong who first appointed him as a casual employee but Ong's predecessor, Mayor Vicente Mendiola.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the part of Ong, he testified that at the time he was serving as Municipal Mayor of Naga, he did not know that he and Galeos are relatives, as in fact there are several persons with the surname "Galeos" in the municipality.&nbsp; He signed Galeos' 1993 SALN when it was presented to him by Galeos at his office.&nbsp; There were many of them who brought such documents and he would administer their oaths on what were written on their SALN, among them were Galeos and Rivera.&nbsp; He came to know of the defect in the employment of Galeos when the case was filed by his "political enemy" in the Ombudsman just after he was elected Vice-Mayor in 1998.&nbsp; As to Rivera, Ong claimed that he knows him as a casual employee of the previous administration.&nbsp; As successor of the former mayor, he had to re-appoint these casual employees and he delegated this matter to his subordinates.&nbsp;&nbsp; He maintained that his family was not very close to their other relatives because when he was not yet Mayor, he was doing business in Cebu and Manila. When queried by the court if he had known his relatives while he was campaigning considering that in the provinces even relatives within the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> degree are still regarded as close relatives especially among politicians, Ong insisted that his style of campaigning was based only on his performance of duties and that he did not go from house to house.&nbsp; Ong admitted that he had been a resident of Naga, Cebu since birth.&nbsp; He could no longer recall those SALN of most of the employees whose oaths he had administered.&nbsp; He admitted that he was the one who appointed Galeos and Rivera to their permanent positions and signed their official appointment (Civil Service Form No. 33) but he was not aware at that time that he was related to them.&nbsp; It was only after the filing of the case that he came to know the wife of Rivera. As to the qualifications of these appointees, he no longer inquired about it and their appointments were no longer submitted to the Selection Board. When the appointment forms for Galeos and Rivera were brought to his office, the accompanying documents were attached thereto. Ong, however, admitted that before the permanent appointment is approved by the CSC, he issues a certification to the effect that all requirements of law and the CSC have been complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On August 18, 2005, the Sandiganbayan promulgated the assailed Decision convicting Ong, Galeos and Rivera, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered on the following:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 26181, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Paulino S.

Nos. 174730-37, Galeos contends that the Sandiganbayan erred when:<br><br><blockquote>1) . . . IT HELD THAT THE SUBJECT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE CONTAINED UNTRUTHFUL STATEMENTS IN A NARRATION OF FACTS.<br><br>2) . . . IT DID NOT CONSIDER PETITIONER'S VALID DEFENSE OF GOOD FAITH AND LACK OF INTENT TO COMMIT THE CRIMES IMPUTED.<br><br>3) . . . IT GAVE FULL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE SOLE WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>In support of his assigned errors, Galeos argues that he did not make untruthful or false statements in his SALN since a "statement" requires a positive averment and thus silence or non-disclosure cannot be considered one. And even if they are considered statements, Galeos contends that they were not made in a "narration of facts" and the least they could be considered are "conclusions of law." He also argues that the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to support the finding that he was aware of their relationship at the time of the execution of the SALN. With the presence of good faith, Galeos avers that the fourth element of the crime - the perversion of truth in the narration of facts was made with the wrongful intent of injuring a third person - is missing. He also faults the Sandiganbayan for its heavy reliance on the uncorroborated testimony of the prosecution's sole witness despite the fact that there are aspects in his testimony that do not inspire belief.<br><br>On the other hand, in G.R. Nos. 174845-52, Ong argues that the Sandiganbayan erred when:<br><br><blockquote><center>(a)<br></center><br>. . . IT HELD THAT THE SUBJECT DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE CONTAINED UNTRUTHFUL STATEMENTS IN A NARRATION OF FACTS.<br><br><center>(b)<br></center><br>IN CRIMINAL CASES NOS. 26181-26187, [IT HELD] THAT A PERSON MERELY ADMINISTERING THE OATH IN A DOCUMENT IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF FALSIFICATION BY MAKING UNTRUTHFUL STATEMENTS IN A NARRATION OF FACTS.<br><br><center>(c)<br></center><br>. . .

RIVERA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Ong similarly argues that the subject SALN do not contain any untruthful statements containing a narration of facts and that there was no wrongful intent of injuring a third person at the time of the execution of the documents. He contends that he cannot be held liable for falsification for merely administering the oath in a document since it is not among the legal obligations of an officer administering the oath to certify the truthfulness and/or veracity of the contents of the document. Neither can he be made liable for falsification regarding the letter-certification he issued since there was no evidence adduced that it was made to support Rivera's appointment.<br><br>In the Joint Memorandum filed by the Ombudsman through the Office of the Special Prosecutor of the Sandiganbayan, it was pointed out that Galeos categorically admitted during his testimony that before affixing his signature on the subject SALN, he carefully read its contents and the entries therein have been explained to him.&nbsp; Moreover, the admission made by Ong during the pre-trial under the joint stipulation of facts indicated no qualification at all that he became aware of his relationship with Galeos and Rivera only after the execution of the subject documents. The defense of lack of knowledge of a particular fact in issue, being a state of mind and therefore self-serving, it can be legally assumed that the admission of that particular fact without qualification reckons from the time the imputed act, to which the particular fact relates, was committed.&nbsp; As to mistaken reliance on the testimony of prosecution witness, the analysis and findings in the assailed decision do not show that such testimony was even taken into consideration in arriving at the conviction of petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>With respect to Ong's liability as conspirator in the execution of the SALN containing untruthful statements, the Special Prosecutor argues that as a general rule, it is not the duty of the administering officer to ascertain the truth of the statements found in a document.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the administering officer has no way of knowing if the facts stated therein are indeed truthful.&nbsp; However, when the facts laid out in the document <i>directly involves the administering officer</i>, then he has an opportunity to know of their truth or falsity.&nbsp; When an administering officer nevertheless administers the oath despite the false contents of the document, which are <i>known to him</i> to be false, he is liable, not because he violated his duty as an administering officer, but because he participated in the falsification of a document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>After a thorough review, we find the petitions unmeritorious.<br><br>Petitioners were charged with falsification of public document under Article 171, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, which states:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 171. <i>Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or ecclesiastic minister. </i>-- The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> and a fine not to exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public officer, employee, or notary who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by committing any of the following acts:<br><br><blockquote>1. Counterfeiting or imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;<br><br>2. Causing it to appear that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate;<br><br>3.

Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts;</i></b><b><i> </i></b><br><br>x x x x (Emphasis and italics supplied.)</blockquote></blockquote><br>The elements of falsification in the above provision are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; the offender makes in a public document untruthful statements in a narration of facts;<br>(b) he has a legal obligation to disclose the truth of the facts narrated by him; and<br>(c)&nbsp; the facts narrated by him are absolutely false.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In addition to the afore-cited elements, it must also be proven that the public officer or employee had taken advantage of his official position in making the falsification. In falsification of public document, the offender is considered to have taken advantage of his official position when (1) he has the duty to make or prepare or otherwise to intervene in the preparation of a document; or (2) he has the official custody of the document which he falsifies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, in falsification of public or official documents, it is not necessary that there be present the idea of gain or the intent to injure a third person because in the falsification of a public document, what is punished is the violation of the public faith and the destruction of the truth as therein solemnly proclaimed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b><i>Falsification of Public Document</i></b><br><b><i>by making untruthful statements</i></b><br><b><i>concerning relatives in the </i></b><br><b><i>government service</i></b><br><br>All the elements of falsification of public documents by making untruthful statements have been established by the prosecution.<br><br>Petitioners argue that the statements "they are not related within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity" and "that Section 79 of the <u>Local Government Code</u> has been complied with in the issuance of the appointments" are not <i>a narration of facts</i> but a conclusion of law, as both require the application of the rules on relationship under the law of succession.&nbsp; Thus, they cite <i>People v. Tugbang</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> where it was held that "a statement expressing an erroneous conclusion of law cannot be considered a falsification." Likewise, in <i>People v.

Contrary to petitioners' assertion, statements concerning relationship may be proved as to its truth or falsity, and thus do not amount to expression of opinion.&nbsp; When a government employee is required to disclose his relatives in the government service, such information elicited therefore qualifies as a narration of facts contemplated under Article 171 (4) of the <u>Revised Penal Code</u>, as amended.&nbsp; Further, it bears to stress that the untruthful statements on relationship have no relevance to the employee's <i>eligibility</i> for the position but pertains rather to <i>prohibition</i> or restriction<b> imposed by law </b>on the appointing power.<br><br>Since petitioner Galeos answered "No" to the question in his 1993 SALN if he has relatives in the government service within the fourth degree of consanguinity, he made an untruthful statement therein as in fact he was related to Ong, who was then the municipal mayor, within the fourth degree of consanguinity, he and Ong being first cousins (their mothers are sisters).&nbsp;&nbsp; As to his 1994, 1995 and 1996 SALN, Galeos left in blank the boxes for the answer to the similar query.&nbsp; In <i>Dela Cruz v. Mudlong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><i> </i>it was held that one is guilty of falsification in the accomplishment of his information and personal data sheet if he withholds material facts which would have affected the approval of his appointment and/or promotion to a government position.&nbsp;&nbsp; By withholding information on his relative/s in the government service as required in the SALN, Galeos was guilty of falsification considering that the disclosure of such relationship with then Municipal Mayor Ong would have resulted in the disapproval of his permanent appointment pursuant to Article 168 (j) (Appointments), Rule XXII of the <i>Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991</i> (R.A. No. 7160), which provides:<br><br><blockquote>No person shall be appointed in the local government career service if he is related within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity to the appointing power or recommending authority.</blockquote><br>Section 7 (e), Rule V of the Implementing Rules of Book V, Executive Order No. 292&nbsp; otherwise known as the Administrative Code of 1987, provides that the CSC shall disapprove the appointment of a person who "has been issued such appointment in violation of existing Civil Service Law, rules and regulations." Among the prohibited appointments enumerated in CSC Memorandum Circular No. 38, series of 1993 are appointments in the LGUs of persons who are related to the appointing or recommending authority within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions (CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series of 1998 dated December 14, 1998) contain a similar prohibition under Rule XIII, Section 9:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 9.

It was simply unthinkable that as a resident of Naga, Cebu since birth and a politician at that, he was all the time unaware that he himself appointed to permanent positions the son of his mother's sister (Galeos) and the husband of his first cousin (Rivera).&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the reality of local politics and Filipino culture renders his defense of good faith (lack of knowledge of their relationship) unavailing.&nbsp; Despite his knowledge of the falsity of the statement in the subject SALN, Ong still administered the oath to Galeos and Rivera who made the false statement under oath.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan thus did not err in finding that Ong connived with Galeos and Rivera in making it appear in their SALN that they have no relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity/affinity in the government service.<br><br>Conspiracy need not be shown by direct proof of an agreement of the parties to commit the crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as it can be inferred from the acts of the accused which clearly manifest a concurrence of wills, a common intent or design to commit a crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In this case, Ong administered the oaths to Galeos and Rivera in the subject SALN not just once, but three times, a clear manifestation that he concurred with the making of the untruthful statement therein concerning relatives in the government service.<br><br><b><i>Falsification by making</i></b><br><b><i>untruthful statements</i></b><br><b><i>in the Certification re:</i></b><br><b><i>compliance with the</i></b><br><b><i>prohibition on nepotism</i></b><br><br>As chief executive and the proper appointing authority, Ong is deemed to have issued the certification recommending to the CSC approval of Galeos' appointment although he admitted only the authenticity and due execution of Exhibit "I".&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Ong was duty bound to observe the prohibition on nepotistic appointments, his certification stating compliance with Section 79<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of R.A. No. 7160 constitutes a solemn affirmation of the fact that <i>the appointee is not related to <b>him</b> within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity</i>.&nbsp; Having executed the certification despite his knowledge that he and Rivera were related to each other within the fourth degree of affinity, as in fact Rivera was his cousin-in-law because the mother of Rivera's wife is the sister of Ong's mother, Ong was guilty of falsification of public document by making untruthful statement in a narration of facts. He also took advantage of his official position as the appointing authority who, under the Civil Service rules, is required to issue such certification.<br><br>The importance of the certification submitted to the CSC by the proper appointing authority in the local government unit, regarding compliance with the prohibition against nepotism under R.A. No. 7160 cannot be overemphasized.&nbsp; Under Section 67, Book V, Chapter 10 of the <u>Administrative Code of 1987</u>, a head of office or appointing official who issues an appointment or employs any person in violation of Civil Service Law and Rules or who commits fraud, deceit or intentional misrepresentation of material facts concerning other civil service matters, or anyone who violates, refuses or neglects to comply with any of such provisions or rules, may be held criminally liable.&nbsp; In <i>Civil Service Commission v.
