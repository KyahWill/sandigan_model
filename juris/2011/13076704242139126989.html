 Cruz (petitioner), together with Rolando Pineda y Robledo (Pineda), 
Cynthia Coderes y Habla (Coderes), guilty beyond reasonable doubt for 
violation of Section 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>

<center><b><i>The Facts </i></b></center>

<p>Petitioner, together with Pineda and Coderes (accused), was charged 
with the crime of Transporting Illegal Drugs in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  dated December 16, 2003, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 15th day of December 2003, in 
Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of 
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and 
confederating together and mutually helping one another, without 
authority of law, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously transport a total of 978.7 grams of Methylamphetamine 
Hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>) a dangerous drug[s].

<p>Contrary to law.</p></blockquote>

<p>When arraigned on February 17, 2004, the three accused entered separate pleas of not guilty to the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  During the pre-trial stage, the three accused did not enter into any stipulation or admission of facts with the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued. In the course of the trial, two varying versions arose.</p>


<center><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b></center>

<p>On December 15, 2003, at about 10:00 a.m., elements of the 
Intelligence Unit of the Pasay City Police, namely: Police Inspector 
Grant Golod (P/Insp. Golod), Police Officer (PO)3 Zoilo Manalo (PO3 
Manalo), and PO2 Roberto Jovenir (PO2 Jovenir), together with Senior 
Police Officer (SPO)2 Soriño Aure (SPO2 Aure), PO2 Froilan Dayawon (PO2 
Dayawon), PO2 Carlito Bintulan, and PO1 Angel dela Cruz, who were all in
 civilian attire, conducted surveillance, monitoring, and intelligence 
gathering to arrest violators of the law along Senator Gil Puyat 
(formerly Buendia) Avenue in Pasay City due to numerous reports of 
rampant snatching, robbery, and holdup in the area. P/Insp. Golod and 
PO3 Manalo boarded a vehicle driven by PO2 Jovenir, while SPO2 Aure and 
the rest of the officers occupied another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p>

<p>While cruising along Senator Gil Puyat Avenue, the police officers 
noticed a blue Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan car (car), which had no 
license plate at its rear, parked in front of a liquor store. Thus, 
P/Insp. Golod called the other group using his cellphone, and informed 
them that they should check the said car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p>

<p>SPO2 Aure and PO2 Dayawon approached the driver side of the car, 
whereas PO3 Manalo and PO2 Jovenir approached the passenger side<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 thereof. SPO2 Aure knocked on the car’s window. When the driver, later 
identified as petitioner, opened the car’s windows, SPO2 Aure asked for 
the Official Receipt (OR) and the Certificate of Registration (CR) of 
the car but none was produced. SPO2 Aure was about to accost petitioner,
 when a commotion ensued at the passenger side  of the car because PO2 
Jovenir noticed that the passenger, later identified as Pineda, was 
trying to hide a plastic bag under his seat, the contents of which 
accidentally came out (<i>lumawit</i>). PO2 Jovenir opened the door, held Pineda's right hand and asked him, “<i>Ano yan</i>?”
 The contents were discovered to be plastic containers containing white 
crystalline substance which the police officers suspected to be shabu<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  so much so that PO2 Jovenir uttered, “<i>Pare, may dala to, shabu, positive.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>   At this juncture, Pineda said, “<i>Sir, baka pwede nating ayusin ito.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>

<p>SPO2 Aure instructed petitioner to alight. When he was frisked, SPO2 
Aure recovered two small plastic sachets containing white crystalline 
substance. SPO2 Aure turned over these sachets to PO2 Jovenir. At the 
back seat of the car was another passenger who was later identified as 
Coderes. Upon questioning, Coderes replied that the owner of the shabu 
was a certain Mike who was waiting for the accused at her condominium 
unit at Unit 1225, 12th Floor of the Cityland Condominium on Dela Rosa 
Street, Makati City (Cityland Condominium).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p>

<p>Immediately thereafter, the police officers, with them the car, the 
accused, and the illegal drugs, went to Cityland Condominium for a 
follow-up operation. Upon arrival, P/Insp. Golod coordinated with the 
Security Officer of the said condominium, while SPO2 Aure, PO3 Manalo, 
and PO2 Jovenir were led by Coderes to Unit 1225. SPO2 Aure, PO3 Manalo,
 PO2 Jovenir allowed Coderes to walk ahead of them. Upon reaching Unit 
1225, Coderes pretended to knock on the door but the police officers did
 not notice that she had a key with her. Coderes immediately opened the 
door, went inside the unit and locked herself in. The police officers 
forcibly opened the door by kicking it and rearrested Coderes. They then
 searched the unit for “Mike,” but they discovered that Coderes was the 
only one inside. From Cityland Condominium, the police officers brought 
all the accused to the Pasay City Police Headquarters for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>

<p>Subsequently, upon examination, the two plastic containers and the 
two plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance were 
positively identified as shabu,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
   but the supposed testimony of Engineer Richard Allan B. Mangalip, 
Forensic Chemical Officer before the RTC, was the subject of stipulation
 by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>

<center><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></center>

<p>Pineda and Coderes denied that they were arrested while on board the 
car and that they possessed the illegal drugs. They claimed that, on 
December 15, 2003, between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., they were inside Unit 
1225 and were preparing to go out shopping; that somebody knocked on the
 door; and Pineda asked who that person was, but there was no reply; 
that the door was forcibly opened and armed men gained entry and ordered
 them to lie down on the bed face down; that she said men searched the 
unit and took their personal belongings and money; that they later 
recognized the said armed men as Pasay City police officers;  that they 
presented no warrant of arrest and/or search warrant; that they were 
brought to separate rooms in Sinta Court Motel (Sinta Motel) at the 
corner of F.B. Harrison and EDSA Extension in Pasay City; that the 
police officers demanded money from them in the amount of P500,000.00 in
 exchange for their release; and  that they were brought to the Criminal
 Investigation Division (CID) of the Pasay City Police Headquarters at 
around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>   On that day, Coderes only saw petitioner at the CID.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p>

<p>On June 2, 2004, petitioner testified that: he knew Pineda because he
 is the godfather of one of Pineda's children; that he also knew Coderes
 because she is the live-in partner of Pineda; that around 10:00 a.m. on
 December 15, 2003, he was at the lobby of the Cityland Condominium and 
was waiting for an elevator ride in order to see Pineda and Coderes for 
the purpose of offering them the car; that upon riding the elevator, 
three (3) male persons joined him who were all in civilian attire and 
whom he later came to know to be Pasay City police officers, namely: PO2
 Jovenir and P/Insp. Golod and another one whom he failed to identify; 
that one of them pressed the number four (4) button of the elevator; and
 that at the time, petitioner was calling Pineda through his cellular 
phone, but, there was no signal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p>

<p>Petitioner asseverated that P/Insp. Golod suddenly held petitioner's 
hand which was holding the cellular phone, and PO2 Jovenir punched him 
on the stomach and was told to peacefully go with them so that he would 
not be hurt; that they did not introduce themselves to him; that the 
elevator opened on the fourth floor, and the person who pressed the 
number four (4) button went out and the elevator went down; that when 
the elevator reached the ground floor, P/Insp. Golod pulled him towards 
the lobby, while PO2 Jovenir remained by the door of the elevator; that 
there was another man who held him and he was pulled out of the Cityland
 Condominium; that he was brought to a parked white car, handcuffed at 
his back, and made to board at the backseat of the said white car with 
his face down, and thereafter the car left; that he was not able to know
 what kind of white car it was because he was ordered to bow down and 
not to look out, and they were always holding his head; that he was with
 P/Insp. Golod and the other policemen inside the white car; that he was
 also brought to Sinta Motel; that he was brought inside a room, and 
frisked, and the police officers took from him his watch, his wallet and
 the money inside his wallet, the car key, and the parking ticket; that 
he was asked if he knew Pineda and Coderes to which he affirmed; that 
when he was asked who was the owner of the car key, he said that the car
 did not belong to him as it was just being offered for sale; that in 
going to the Cityland Condominium, he used the car; that when he was 
brought out of the Cityland Condominium, the car was left at the parking
 area of the Cityland Condominium; that, as a car sales agent, he made 
sure that the OR, CR, and plate number of the car were complete; that 
the car had a rear plate number; that P/Insp. Golod demanded that 
petitioner pay P200,000.00 in exchange for his release; that he stayed 
at the Sinta Motel for five (5) hours before he was brought to the CID; 
that he stayed at the CID for two (2) hours and he was made to sit on a 
chair; that after two (2) hours he was brought inside a room of the same
 building where he stayed until the following day; that on the following
 day, the accused were brought to Fort Bonifacio for drug testing; and 
that they were brought back to the CID and, in the afternoon, petitioner
 was brought to the Pasay City Jail. While inside the CID, petitioner 
saw the car parked at the back of the Pasay City Hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p>

<center><b><i>The RTC's Ruling</i></b></center>
<p>The RTC gave greater weight to the evidence presented by the 
prosecution, and found the testimonies of the arresting officers more 
credible and worthy of belief. Thus, in its decision dated July 8, 2004,
 the RTC convicted petitioner, Pineda, and Coderes of the crime charged,
 the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing premises and
 considerations, this Court hereby renders judgment finding the three 
accused Rolando Pineda y Robledo, Cynthia Coderes y Habla and Michael 
San Juan y Cruz all GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
Violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 and they are hereby 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine 
of Php 500,000.00 each, plus costs.
The 978.7 grams of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu) involved in 
this case is hereby declared forfeited in favor of the Government and 
ordered to be turned-over to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for 
its appropriate disposition in accordance with the provisions of the 
Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Law.

<p>SO ORDERED.</p></blockquote>

<p>Aggrieved, the accused, through their respective counsels, appealed their case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p>

<center><b><i>The CA's Ruling</i></b></center>

<p>On December 21, 2006, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC. The CA 
opined that the inconsistencies pointed out by the defense were  
unimportant matters which do not delve into the material elements of the
 crime. The CA also relied on the presumption that the aforementioned 
police officers regularly performed their official functions. Thus, the 
CA disposed of the case in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated 
July 8, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 116 of Pasay City 
convicting accused-appellants Rolando R. Pineda, Cynthia H. Coderes and 
Michael C. San Juan of violation of Section 5, Rule II of Republic Act 
No. 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 in Criminal Case No. 
03-2804CFM is hereby AFFIRMED.

<p>SO ORDERED. </p></blockquote>

<p>Undaunted, petitioner alone filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  which the CA, however, denied in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  dated March 21, 2007.</p>

<blockquote>Hence, this Petition based on the following grounds:

<ol><li>	THE HONORABLE APPELLATE COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN 
ADMITTING AND CONSIDERING THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE DESPITE THE GLARING
 VIOLATIONS OF PETITIONER'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND R.A. 9165 MAKING 
SUCH EVIDENCE INADMISSIBLE.

</li><li>	THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN 
AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF CONVICTION OF THE TRIAL COURT DESPITE THE 
ADMITTED CONFLICTING AND INCONSISTENT TESTIMONIES OF ALL THE PROSECUTION
 WITNESSES WHICH CLEARLY PUTS THE CONVICTION IN DOUBT.

</li><li>	THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN 
AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT DESPITE THE LATTER'S CLEAR 
VIOLATION OF ESTABLISHED PROCEDURAL RULES AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ON 
DUE PROCESS BY NOT ALLOWING PETITIONER TO PRESENT A MATERIAL WITNESS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </li></ol></blockquote>

<p>Petitioner avers that the police officers initially apprehended the 
accused for a mere traffic violation; hence, there was no justifiable 
reason for them to search the car in the absence of any search warrant 
and/or the fact that the accused were not caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i>.
 The police officers also failed to apprise the accused of their rights.
 Petitioner points out that the follow-up operation conducted in Unit 
1225 was unlawful as the police officers were not armed with any search 
warrant, and they simply relied on the alleged information given by 
Coderes. In view of the numerous, conflicting, and material 
inconsistencies in the respective testimonies of PO2 Jovenir, SPO2 Aure 
and P/Insp. Golod, petitioner submits that such would lend credence to 
the unanimous claim of all the accused that they were arrested in 
Cityland Condominium in Makati City and not on board the car parked in 
Pasay City. Moreover, petitioner, invoking R.A. No. 9165, asseverates 
that the police officers did not follow the procedure prescribed by law.
 He questions the identity of the illegal drugs alleged to have been 
seized from the accused from those presented before the RTC because 
instead of proceeding immediately to the Pasay City Police Headquarters,
 the police officers went to the Cityland Condominium, making planting 
of evidence highly probable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  The police officers also failed to make any inventory in clear violation of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p>

<p>On the other hand, respondent People of the Philippines, through the 
Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), argues that only questions of law
 may be entertained by this Court. The issue of whether petitioner was 
apprehended in the act of violating R.A. No. 9165 is factual in nature. 
The OSG claims that petitioner was lawfully caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i>,
 thus, any evidence seized from him may be used against him as evidence.
 Citing the CA's ruling, the OSG avers that the police officers were 
clear, positive, and categorical in their testimonies against the 
accused. Lastly, the OSG invokes the rule that findings of fact of the 
trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are accorded not only respect, but
 also finality by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p>

<center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b></center>

<p>The instant Petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p>It is the unique nature of an appeal in a criminal case that the 
appeal throws the whole case open for review and it is the duty of the 
appellate court to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed 
judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>   We find the Petition meritorious on the basis of such review.</p>

<p>Well-settled is the rule that findings of fact of the trial court are
 given great respect. But when there is a misappreciation of facts as to
 compel a contrary conclusion, the Court will not hesitate to reverse 
the factual findings of the trial court. In such a case, the scales of 
justice must tilt in favor of an accused, considering that he stands to 
lose his liberty by virtue of his conviction. The Court must be 
satisfied that the factual findings and conclusions of the trial court 
leading to an accused's conviction must satisfy the standard of proof 
beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p>

<blockquote>Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 charts the procedure on 
the custody and disposition of confiscated, seized, and/or surrendered 
dangerous drugs, given the severity of the penalties imposed for 
violations of said law, viz.:

<blockquote>Section 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, 
Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous 
Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, 
Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall 
take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of 
dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well 
as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated,
 seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following 
manner:

<p>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs <b>shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused</b> or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, <b>or
 his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and 
the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who 
shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a 
copy thereof</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p></blockquote> </blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165 provides:</p>

<blockquote>SECTION 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, 
Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous 
Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, 
Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. — The PDEA shall 
take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of 
dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well 
as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated,
 seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following 
manner:

<blockquote>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial 
custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and 
confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the 
presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were 
confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a 
representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and 
any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of 
the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical 
inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the 
search warrant is served; <b>or at the nearest police station or at the 
nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is 
practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that 
non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as 
long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are 
properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render 
void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></b></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The Court finds that the apprehending police officers failed to 
comply with the guidelines set forth in R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR which 
are designed to clearly identify the existence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>
 – the seized illegal drugs – the integrity of which the prosecution 
must show to have been preserved, considering that the same is not 
readily identifiable by sight or touch and can easily be tampered with 
or substituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p>

<p>The answers elicited from PO2 Jovenir raise numerous questions and 
ultimately cast doubts on the identity, integrity, and evidentiary value
 of the seized illegal drugs. Obviously, the drugs were not 
photographed. It is also not clear if PO2 Jovenir immediately marked and
 inventoried these items in the presence of the accused or their 
representatives or counsel, a representative from the media and the DOJ,
 and any elected public official. Surely, the persons required by law to
 sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof were not 
given any inventory for the obvious reason that no written inventory was
 prepared.</p>

<p>While it is true that non-compliance with the inventory, not to 
mention the photograph requirement of R.A. No. 9165, does not 
necessarily render void and invalid the seizure of the dangerous drugs, 
there must, however, be justifiable grounds to warrant an exception 
therefrom, provided that the integrity and evidentiary value of the 
seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  No justifiable ground, however, was advanced by the police officers.</p>

<p>In this case, even if the requirement to conduct an inventory were to
 be excused, the prosecution still failed to discharge its burden. 
Although PO2 Jovenir identified Exhibits “A-1” “A-2” “A-3” and “A-4” as 
the drugs seized from accused, he did not disclose the name of the 
investigator to whom he turned them over, other than saying that he 
turned them over to the  Station Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations 
Task Force (SAID/SOFT).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  
And there is no showing if that same investigator was the one who turned
 the drugs over to the forensic chemist, or if the forensic chemist 
whose name appears in the physical science report was the one who 
received them from that investigator, or where the drugs were kept for 
safekeeping after the chemical test was conducted up to the time they 
were presented in court. The prosecution failed to provide the details 
of these essential matters. Thus, this Court in People of the <i>Philippines v. Elmer Peralta y de Guzman alias “Memeng,”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
  for the guidance of our public prosecutors, recommended questions that
 would aid the court in determining the innocence or guilt of the 
accused.</p>

<p>Most importantly, this Court cannot close its eyes to the fact that 
instead of bringing the accused immediately to the Pasay City Police 
Headquarters, as required by law, the police officers opted to go to the
 Cityland Condominium in Makati City, bringing with them the car, all of
 the accused, and the illegal drugs seized. Even the prosecution 
considered such act of the police officers as dangerous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>   In <i>People of the Philippines v. Ronaldo de Guzman y Danzil</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
  we held that the length of time that lapsed from the seizure of the 
items from the accused until the delivery thereof to the investigating 
officer for marking is too long to be inconsequential. This considered 
such length of time an important factor in acquitting the accused 
therein. In this case, a similar vacuum in the chain of custody of the 
seized items was likewise created which this Court cannot simply brush 
aside.</p>

<p>In sum, there is a serious doubt whether the illegal drugs presented 
before the RTC were the same drugs recovered from petitioner and 
accused. Consequently, the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable
 doubt the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.</p>

<p>Finally, the evidence presented by the prosecution failed to reveal 
the identity of the person who had custody and safekeeping of the drugs 
after their examination and pending presentation in court. Thus, the 
prosecution likewise failed to establish the chain of custody required 
by law, the absence of which is fatal to its cause. In fine, the 
identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> in this case was not proven beyond
 reasonable doubt. There was an unexplained break in the chain of 
custody, fatal to the prosecution's case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p>
