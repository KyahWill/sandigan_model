We shall first tackle the factual matters involved in this case, then proceed with the jurisdictional issues raised.<br><br><i>Petitioners raised factual matters which <br>are not the proper subject of this appeal.</i><br><br>Petitioners contend that the lower courts grievously erred in granting the complaint because, even if they were declared in default, the respondent still has the burden of proving the material allegations in the complaint by preponderance of evidence.&nbsp; Petitioners further argue that respondent miserably failed to discharge this burden because it failed to present sufficient proof that it is a domestic corporation.&nbsp; Hence, respondent could not possibly maintain the present action because only natural or juridical persons or entities authorized by law can be parties to a civil action.&nbsp; Petitioners also claim that respondent failed to present competent proof that Cheng Lie is a foreign shipping company doing business in the Philippines thru its duly authorized shipagent Atiko. Lastly, petitioners assert that respondent failed to prove that Cheng Lie is a common carrier which owned, operated and/or chartered M/S Katjana thru its duly authorized shipagent Atiko. Petitioners emphasize that there is no proof, testimonial or otherwise, which would support the material allegations of the complaint.&nbsp; They also insist that respondent's witnesses do not have personal knowledge of the facts on which they were examined.<br><br>Respondent, for its part, assails the propriety of the remedy taken by the petitioners.&nbsp; It posits that petitioners advanced factual matters which are not the proper subject of a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; Besides, the lower courts consistently held that the allegations in respondent's complaint are supported by sufficient evidence.<br><br>We agree with respondent.<br><br>A cursory reading of the issues raised readily reveals that they involve factual matters which are not within the province of this Court to look into. Well-settled is the rule that in petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45, only questions of law can be raised.&nbsp; While there are recognized exceptions to this rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; none is present in this case.&nbsp; "[A]s a matter of x x x procedure, [this] Court defers and accords finality to the factual findings of trial courts, [especially] when such findings were [affirmed by the RTC and the CA. These] factual determination[s], as a matter of long and sound appellate practice, deserve great weight and shall not be disturbed on appeal x x x.&nbsp; [I]t is not the function of the Court to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence or premises supportive of the factual holding of the lower courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><i>MeTC properly acquired jurisdiction<br> over the person of Atiko.</i><br><br>Petitioners also argue that the MeTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the person of Atiko as the summons was received by its cashier, Cristina Figueroa.&nbsp; They maintain that under Section 11, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, when the defendant is a domestic corporation like Atiko, summons may be served only upon its president, general manager, corporate secretary, treasurer or in-house counsel.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; True, when the defendant is a domestic corporation, service of summons may be made only upon the persons enumerated in Section 11, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; However, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant can be acquired not only by proper service of summons but also by defendant's voluntary appearance without expressly objecting to the court's jurisdiction, as embodied in Section 20, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 20. <i>Voluntary appearance. - </i>The defendant's voluntary appearance in the action shall be equivalent to service of summons.&nbsp; The inclusion in a motion to dismiss of other grounds aside from lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant shall not be deemed a voluntary appearance.</blockquote><br>In the case at bench, when Atiko filed its Notice of Appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Memorandum of Appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the April 8, 2003 Decision of the RTC, and Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> it never questioned the jurisdiction of the MeTC over its person.&nbsp; The filing of these pleadings seeking affirmative relief amounted to voluntary appearance and, hence, rendered the alleged lack of jurisdiction moot.&nbsp; In <i>Palma v. Galvez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court reiterated the oft-repeated rule that "the filing of motions seeking affirmative relief, such as, to admit answer, for additional time to file answer, for reconsideration of a default judgment, and to lift order of default with motion for reconsideration, are considered voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the court."<br><br>Moreover, petitioners' contention is a mere afterthought. It was only in their Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> filed with this Court where they claimed, for the first time, that Atiko was not properly served with summons.&nbsp; In <i>La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> it was held that the issue of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant must be seasonably raised.&nbsp; Failing to do so, a party who invoked the jurisdiction of a court to secure an affirmative relief cannot be allowed to disavow such jurisdiction after unsuccessfully trying to obtain such relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>It may not be amiss to state too that in our February 13, 2006 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> we reminded the parties that they are not allowed to interject new issues in their memorandum.<br><br><i>MeTC did not acquire jurisdiction over <br>the person of Cheng Lie.</i><br><br>Petitioners likewise challenge the validity of the service of summons upon Cheng Lie, thru Atiko.&nbsp; They claim that when the defendant is a foreign private juridical entity which has transacted business in the Philippines, service of summons may be made, among others, upon its resident agent.&nbsp; In this case, however, there is no proof that Atiko is the local agent of Cheng Lie.<br><br>On this score, we find for the petitioners.&nbsp; Before it was amended by A.M. No. 11-3-6-SC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Section 12 of Rule 14 of the Rules of Court reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 12. <i>Service upon foreign private juridical entity.&nbsp; - </i>When the defendant is a foreign private juridical entity which has transacted business in the Philippines, service may be made on its resident agent designated in accordance with law for that purpose, or, if there be no such agent, on the government official designated by law to that effect, or on any of its officers or agents within the Philippines.</blockquote><br>Elucidating on the above provision of the Rules of Court, this Court declared in <i>Pioneer International, Ltd. v. Guadiz, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that when the defendant is a foreign juridical entity, <i>service of summons</i> may be made upon:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Its resident agent designated in accordance with law for that purpose;<br><br></li><li>The government official designated by law to receive summons if the corporation does not have a resident agent; or,<br><br></li><li>Any of the corporation's officers or agents within the Philippines.</li></ol></blockquote><br>In the case at bench, no summons was served upon Cheng Lie in any manner prescribed above.&nbsp; It should be recalled that Atiko was not properly served with summons as the person who received it on behalf of Atiko, cashier Cristina Figueroa, is not one of the corporate officers enumerated in Section 11 of Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The MeTC acquired jurisdiction over the person of Atiko not thru valid service of summons but by the latter's voluntary appearance.&nbsp; Thus, there being no proper service of summons upon Atiko to speak of, it follows that the MeTC never acquired jurisdiction over the person of Cheng Lie.&nbsp; To rule otherwise would create an absurd situation where service of summons is valid upon the purported principal but not on the latter's co-defendant <i>cum </i>putative agent despite the fact that service was coursed thru said agent.&nbsp; Indeed, in order for the court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of a defendant foreign private juridical entity under Section 12, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, there must be prior valid service of summons upon the agent of such defendant.<br><br>Also, the records of this case is bereft of any showing that cashier Cristina Figueroa is a government official designated by law to receive summons on behalf of Cheng Lie or that she is an officer or agent of Cheng Lie within the Philippines.&nbsp; Hence, her receipt of summons bears no significance insofar as Cheng Lie is concerned.&nbsp; At this point, we emphasize that the requirements of the rule on summons must be strictly followed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> lest we ride roughshod on defendant's right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>With regard to Cheng Lie's filing of numerous pleadings, the same cannot be considered as voluntary appearance. Unlike Atiko, Cheng Lie never sought affirmative relief other than the dismissal of the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over its person.&nbsp; From the very beginning, it has consistently questioned the validity of the service of summons and the jurisdiction of the MeTC over its person.<br><br>It does not escape our attention though that Cheng Lie's pleadings do not indicate that the same were filed by way of special appearance.&nbsp; But these, to our mind, are mere inaccuracies in the title of the pleadings.&nbsp; What is important are the allegations contained therein which consistently resisted the jurisdiction of the trial court.&nbsp; Thus, Cheng Lie cannot be considered to have submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In fine, since the MeTC never acquired jurisdiction over the person of Cheng Lie, its decision insofar as Cheng Lie is concerned is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><i>Cheng Lie was improperly declared in default.</i><br><br>Applying the above disquisition, the MeTC likewise erred in declaring Cheng Lie in default. Settled is the rule that a defendant cannot be declared in default unless such declaration is preceded by a valid service of summons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>PARTIALLY</b> <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed December 10, 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
