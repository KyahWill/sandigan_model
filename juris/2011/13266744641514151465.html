He testified that on June 15, 2003, he was in his residence when two police officers, whom he later came to know as Mabutol and a certain PO1 Lozada, entered his room and thoroughly searched it.&nbsp; He was then brought to the precinct where he was instructed to call somebody who could help him settle his case.&nbsp; As he knew no one who could help him, Mabutol asked him to give a name of a big-time drug seller/pusher who could take his place, or “<i>pamalit-ulo</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Since Amansec did not know any big-time drug pusher, reasoning that he had been in his residence for only six months then, the police officers proceeded with the case and he was brought to the Inquest Prosecutor.&nbsp; Amansec averred that he did not file a case against the police officers because he did not know how to go about it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; On cross-examination, he said that he was denying the allegations as the police officers had “no proof [of] what they [were] saying.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Amansec also stated that the first time he saw Mabutol and Pascua was when he was arrested, and he did not know of any grudge or ill motive that they might have against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On August 30, 2006, the RTC rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused BENJAMIN AMANSEC Y DONA <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt as charged in Criminal Case No. Q-03-118187 for violation of Section 5 of Article II of R.A. 9165, (selling of dangerous drugs) and he is hereby sentenced him (sic) to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand (Php500,000.00) pesos.<br><br>However, in Criminal Case No. Q-03-118186 for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (illegal possession of dangerous drugs), the Court finds the accused NOT GUILTY because the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The pieces of evidence [that is the] subject matter of these cases are hereby forfeited in favor of the government and to be disposed of as provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>In convicting Amansec of violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, the RTC held that the prosecution was able to establish and satisfy the elements in the sale of illegal drugs.&nbsp; The RTC averred that Amansec failed to prove any ill motive on the part of the police officers whom he admitted to have met only after his arrest.&nbsp; Moreover, the RTC found the testimonies of Mabutol and Pascua to be consistent, clear, direct, positive, and corroborative of the material and significant aspects of what actually transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>However, the RTC acquitted Amansec of the illegal possession of dangerous drugs charge, ratiocinating in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>Anent the second offense, the public prosecutor was able to prove that indeed the accused was caught in possession of illegal drugs known as “shabu” after the entrapment.&nbsp; After the arrest of the accused for selling illegal drugs, PO2 Ronald Pascua was able to recover another plastic sachet containing shabu from the accused.&nbsp; However, the Court is convinced that the second plastic sachet containing shabu (Exhibit “E-2”) was intended by the accused to be sold to the buyer at the time of the buy-bust operation.&nbsp; In People vs. Hindoy [357 SCRA 692], <i>possession of marijuana is absorbed in the sale thereof, except where the seller is further apprehended in possession of another quantity of the prohibited drugs not covered by or included in the sale and which are probably intended for some future dealings or use by the seller.</i>&nbsp; In the case at bar, it is clear from the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that the second plastic sachet of shabu was shown and offered by the accused during the transaction in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>On September 11, 2006, Amansec filed his Notice of Appeal with the RTC.&nbsp; In his Brief, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Amansec cited irregularities, which allegedly create a reasonable doubt that a buy-bust operation was conducted.&nbsp; He also questioned the admissibility of the evidence against him.<br><br>However, the Court of Appeals was not convinced by Amansec’s arguments.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals found the prosecution’s evidence to be sufficient to uphold the conviction of Amansec.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals held that “[n]on-compliance by the apprehending officer with Section 21 of [Republic Act] No. 9165 is not fatal as long as there is justifiable ground therefor, and as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated items, are properly preserved by the apprehending officers. x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On April 15, 2008, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision, with the following fallo:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the assailed decision dated August 30, 2006 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 95, in Criminal Case No. Q-03-118187 convicting accused-appellant BENJAMIN AMANSEC Y DONA for violation of Section 5, Article II of&nbsp;

shabu, in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, which provides:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section

imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the

violator of the provisions under this Section.</blockquote><br><center><b><i>Credibility of the Prosecution Witnesses<br>and conduct of the buy-bust operation</i></b><br></center><br>Amansec argues that the trial court erred in giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as they failed to pass the test in determining the value of a witness’s testimony that such must be “in conformity with knowledge and consistent with the experience of mankind.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Amasec claims that the charges against him were merely planted and enumerates the following as evidence, which supposedly “creates reasonable doubt as to the allegation of the prosecution that a buy-bust operation was conducted”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>:<br><br><ol><li> Only Amansec was charged with violating Republic Act No. 9165, and not Pintis, whom the police officers alleged to have bought shabu from him, while the buy-bust operation was being conducted.<br></li><li>The prosecution failed to produce and present in court the ?100.00 bill Pintis allegedly used to buy shabu from Amansec.<br></li><li>The informant was not presented in court, and no explanation was given by the prosecution for their failure to do so.<br></li><li>There was no surveillance prior to the buy-bust operation conducted by the police officers.<br></li><li>The buy-bust money used by Mabutol was not dusted with ultraviolet powder.</li></ol><br>Amansec’s arguments are untenable.&nbsp; As we have held before, “[i]t is for the party to plan its own strategy and to choose which witnesses to call and what evidence to submit to support its own cause.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b><i>Non-inclusion of Pintis in this case and<br>Non-presentation of Pintis’ P100.00 bill<br>Recovered from Amansec</i></b><br><br>It is not within the province of this Court to speculate or make presumptions as to what happened to Pintis after he was arrested.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that he was apprehended for not only a different, but also, a separate illegal act.&nbsp; He was caught in <i>flagrante delicto </i>of purchasing <i>shabu</i> from Amansec, and when he was caught, a plastic sachet, similar to the ones sold to Mabutol and recovered from Amansec, was found in his possession.&nbsp; Since this had nothing to do with Amansec’s own acts, this Court sees no reason why they should have been tried jointly.<br><br>Anent the P100.00 bill Pintis used to buy <i>shabu</i> from Amansec, this Court also sees no need for its presentation before the RTC because Amansec was charged with violation of Section 5, or the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, for selling <i>shabu</i> to Mabutol, and not to Pintis.&nbsp; Thus, even if Pintis’ P100.00 peso bill were presented in court, it would serve very little purpose for the prosecution, and even for the RTC, as, to reiterate, Amansec was on trial for his act of selling dangerous drugs to Mabutol, who was then a poseur-buyer, and not to Pintis, who just happened to buy from him while the buy-bust operation was being conducted.<br><br><b><i>Non-Presentation of Informant&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>This point need not be belabored as this Court, has time and again, held that “the presentation of an informant in an illegal drugs case is not essential for the conviction nor is it indispensable for a successful prosecution because his testimony would be merely corroborative and cumulative.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; If Amansec felt that the prosecution did not present the informant because he would testify against it, then Amansec himself should have called him to the stand to testify for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The informant’s testimony is not needed if the sale of the illegal drug has been adequately proven by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Ho Chua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we said:<br><br><blockquote>The presentation of an informant is not a requisite in the prosecution of drug cases.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Nicolas</span>, the Court ruled that “[p]olice authorities rarely, if ever, remove the cloak of confidentiality with which they surround their poseur-buyers and informers since their usefulness will be over the moment they are presented in court.&nbsp; Moreover, drug dealers do not look kindly upon squealers and informants.&nbsp; It is understandable why, as much as permitted, their identities are kept secret.”&nbsp; In any event, the testimony of the informant would be merely corroborative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>No prior surveillance conducted</i></b><br><br>This issue in the prosecution of illegal drugs cases, again, has long been settled by this Court.&nbsp; We have been consistent in our ruling that prior surveillance is not required for a valid buy-bust operation, especially if the buy-bust team is accompanied to the target area by their informant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Eugenio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we held:<br><br><blockquote>There is no requirement that prior surveillance should be conducted before a buy-bust operation can be undertaken especially when, as in this case, the policemen are accompanied to the scene by their civilian informant.&nbsp; Prior surveillance is not a prerequisite for the validity of an entrapment or a buy-bust operation, there being no fixed or textbook method for conducting one.&nbsp; We have held that when time is of [the] essence, the police may dispense with the need for prior surveillance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Buy-bust money was not<br>dusted with ultraviolet powder</i></b><br><br>The failure of the police officers to use ultraviolet powder on the buy-bust money is not an indication that the buy-bust operation was a sham.&nbsp; “The use of initials to mark the money used in [a] buy-bust operation has been accepted by this Court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Rivera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we declared:<br><br><blockquote>It was x x x the prerogative of the prosecution to choose the manner of marking the money to be used in the buy-bust operation, and the fact that it was not dusted with fluorescent powder did not render the exhibit inadmissible.&nbsp; Indeed, the use of initials to mark the money used in the buy-bust operation has been accepted by this Court in numerous cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b><i>Inventory and Chain of Custody of Evidence</i></b><br></center><br>Amansec asserts that his conviction was incorrect because the evidence against him was obtained in violation of the procedure outlined in Republic Act No. 9165.&nbsp; He claims that Section 21 of the aforesaid act was violated when the police officers who arrested him did not take his picture with the <i>shabu</i> they confiscated from him, and when they made no physical inventory of the <i>shabu</i> in his presence, or in the presence of his representative, the media, the department of justice, or any elected public official.&nbsp; Amansec avers that his presumption of innocence prevails over the presumption that the police officers performed their duty in a regular manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>He also avers that the prosecution failed to prove the chain of custody of the evidence obtained from him as the station investigator, to whom the specimens were turned over, was not presented in court.&nbsp; Moreover, Amansec claims, there was no evidence to show that the forensic chemist examined the same articles allegedly confiscated from him.&nbsp; Amansec says that the stipulations made as regards the testimony of the forensic chemist mentioned nothing about the chemist’s actual receipt of the specimens from the Investigator or from any other person.&nbsp;

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Ideally, the procedure on the chain of custody should be perfect and unbroken.&nbsp; However “a testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard as it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, even though the prosecution failed to submit in evidence the physical inventory and photograph of the seized drugs as required under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, this will not render Amansec’s arrest illegal or the items seized from him as inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; This Court has consistently held that “what is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, because the same will be utilized in ascertaining the guilt or innocence of the accused.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The prosecution was able to demonstrate that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized had been preserved.&nbsp; Both the prosecution witnesses were categorical and consistent that Amansec offered three plastic sachets containing shabu to Mabutol and Pintis.&nbsp; These were later recovered from Amansec, Pintis, and Mabutol himself.&nbsp; As soon as the police officers, together with Amansec and Pintis, reached the La Loma Police Station, the seized sachets were marked with the initials of the police officers, with each officer marking the sachet he personally retrieved from the suspects.&nbsp; This was done <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> the specimens were turned over to the station investigator for the preparation of the request for laboratory examination.&nbsp; Thereafter, the specimens were forwarded to the crime lab by the police officers themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The Chemistry Report prepared by the forensic chemist listed the same specimens, which bore the initials of the police officers, and which were later identified by Mabutol and Pascua in open court as the plastic sachets they marked with their initials.<br><br>Besides, the presumption that the integrity of the evidence has been preserved will remain unless it can be shown that there was bad faith, ill will, or tampering of the evidence.&nbsp; Amansec bears the burden of showing the foregoing to overcome the presumption that the police officers handled the seized drugs with regularity, and that they properly discharged their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; This, Amansec failed to do.<br><br>Furthermore, there is nothing in Republic Act No. 9165 or in its implementing rules, which requires each and everyone who came into contact with the seized drugs to testify in court.&nbsp; “As long as the chain of custody of the seized drug was clearly established to have not been broken and the prosecution did not fail to identify properly the drugs seized, it is not indispensable that each and every person who came into possession of the drugs should take the witness stand.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; This Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Hernandez</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> citing <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Zeng Hua Dian</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> ruled:<br><br><blockquote>After a thorough review of the records of this case we find that the chain of custody of the seized substance was not broken and that the prosecution did not fail to identify properly the drugs seized in this case. The non-presentation as witnesses of other persons such as SPO1 Grafia, the evidence custodian, and PO3 Alamia, the officer on duty, is not a crucial point against the prosecution. The matter of presentation of witnesses by the prosecution is not for the court to decide. The prosecution has the discretion as to how to present its case and it has the right to choose whom it wishes to present as witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote><br>It is worthy to note, and we agree with the Court of Appeals’ observation, that Amansec questioned the chain of custody of the evidence only when he appealed his conviction.&nbsp; Not once did he raise this defense or mention these procedural gaps before the trial court.&nbsp; Thus, whatever justifiable ground the prosecution has will remain a mystery in light of Amansec’s failure to raise this issue before the trial court, viz:<br><br><blockquote>The law excuses non-compliance under justifiable grounds. However, whatever justifiable grounds may excuse the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation in this case from complying with Section 21 will remain unknown, because appellant did not question during trial the safekeeping of the items seized from him. Indeed, the police officers’ alleged violations of Sections 21 and 86 of Republic Act No. 9165 were not raised before the trial court but were instead raised for the first time on appeal. In no instance did appellant least intimate at the trial court that there were lapses in the safekeeping of seized items that affected their integrity and evidentiary value. Objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; when a party desires the court to reject the evidence offered, he must so state in the form of objection. Without such objection he cannot raise the question for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>Amansec’s theory, from the very beginning, were that he did not do it, and that he was being framed for his failure to give the police officers either money or some big-time pusher to take his place.&nbsp; In other words, his defense tactic was one of denial and frame-up.&nbsp; However, those defenses have always been frowned upon by the Court, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violation of Dangerous Drugs Act.&nbsp; In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence.&nbsp; In the cases before us, appellant failed to present sufficient evidence in support of his claims. Aside from his self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster his allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Equally important is the fact that Amansec has not ascribed any improper motive on the part of the police officers as to why they would hand-pick him, and falsely incriminate him in such a serious crime.&nbsp; No evidence has been offered to show that Mabutol and Pascua, were motivated by reasons other than their duty to curb the sale of prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Amansec himself admitted that he only came to know his arresting officers after his arrest.&nbsp; He also testified that he knew of no grudge that they might have against him.&nbsp; Hence, until Amansec can show clear and convincing evidence that the members of the entrapment operation team were stirred by illicit motive or failed to properly perform their duties, their testimonies deserve full faith and credit. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Elements of illegal sale of<br>dangerous drugs established</i></b></center><br>The successful prosecution of the sale of dangerous drugs case depends on the satisfaction of the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and<br>(2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To elucidate on the foregoing elements, this Court has said that “[i]n prosecutions for illegal sale of shabu, what is material is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> as evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It is evident in the case at bar that the prosecution was able to establish the said elements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Amansec was positively identified by the prosecution witnesses, as the person who sold to the poseur-buyer a heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance.&nbsp; He had been caught red-handed in the entrapment operation conducted by the SDEU of the La Loma Police.&nbsp; Such positive identification must prevail over Amansec’s uncorroborated and weak defense of denial, and unsubstantiated defense of frame-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime was also established with certainty and conclusiveness.&nbsp; Amansec gave one of the two remaining plastic sachets to Mabutol after receiving the P100.00 buy-bust money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.
