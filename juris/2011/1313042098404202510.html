Petitioner calls attention to the testimony of Credit Investigator Carlos S. Mañosca, who admitted that when he inspected the mortgaged property, he only checked the finishing of the house and the number of rooms. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, he failed to see petitioner's apartment at the back portion of the property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Moreover, the fact that there was an adverse claim annotated on the previous title of the property should have alerted Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. to conduct further investigation to verify the ownership of the mortgaged property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> All these prove that Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. was not a mortgagee in good faith.&nbsp; Corollarily, pursuant to Articles 2085 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and 493 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the Civil Code, the real estate mortgage executed by Lydia is void insofar as petitioner's share in the mortgaged property is concerned. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent contends that the issue of whether Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. is a mortgagee in good faith is a question of fact, which is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> As to petitioner's allegation that there was a separate apartment at the back portion of the property, respondent claims that this was never raised during the trial or on appeal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Hence, it is barred by estoppel. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Respondent further claims that Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. has no obligation to look beyond the title considering that there was no adverse claim annotated on TCT No. 90388 covering the mortgaged property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; And since the mortgaged property was occupied by the mortgagor Lydia, there was also no need for Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. to verify the extent of her possessory rights. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition has merit.<br><br><b><i>The instant case is an exception to the<br>rule that factual issues may not be raised in a <br>petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>The rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is not without exception.&nbsp; A review of factual issues is allowed when there is a misapprehension of facts or when the inference drawn from the facts is manifestly mistaken. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This case falls under exception.<br><br><b><i>Maunlad Savings and Loan Association,<br> Inc. is not a mortgagee in good faith.</i></b><br><br>The general rule that a mortgagee need not look beyond the title does not apply to banks and other financial institutions as greater care and due diligence is required of them. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Imbued with public interest, they "are expected to be more cautious than ordinary individuals." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, before approving a loan, the standard practice for banks and other financial institutions is to conduct an ocular inspection of the property offered to be mortgaged and verify the genuineness of the title to determine the real owner or owners thereof. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Failure to do so makes them mortgagees in bad faith.<br><br>In this case, petitioner contends that Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. failed to exercise due diligence in inspecting and ascertaining the status of the mortgaged property because during the ocular inspection, the credit investigator failed to ascertain the actual occupants of the subject property and to discover petitioner's apartment at the back portion of the subject property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the existence of petitioner's apartment at the back portion of the subject property was never brought up before the trial court and the appellate court.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we find petitioner's allegation of negligence substantiated by the testimony of the credit investigator, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td width="90%">&nbsp; <div align="JUSTIFY">You said also that you inspected the property that was offered as collateral which is a house and lot located at Encarnacion Street, BF Homes.

Since Maunlad Savings and Loan Association, Inc. was remiss in its duty in ascertaining the status of the property to be mortgaged and verifying the ownership thereof, it is deemed a mortgagee in bad faith.&nbsp; Consequently, the real estate mortgage executed in its favor is valid only insofar as the share of the mortgagor Lydia in the subject property.&nbsp; We need not belabor that under Article 493 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of the Civil Code, a co-owner can alienate only his <i>pro indiviso</i> share in the co-owned property, and not the share of his co-owners.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED. </b> The assailed June 9, 2005 Decision and the February 21, 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R.
