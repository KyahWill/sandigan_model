Oraya (P/Chief Insp. Oraya), Chief of DAID-SOT.&nbsp; P/Chief Insp. Oraya then directed PO2 Gallano, one of the police operatives of DAID-SOT, to verify the said information.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano acceded by making telephone calls to the people he knew in Sitio de Asis, <i>Barangay</i> San Martin de Porres, Parañaque City. PO2 Gallano asked each of them if they knew a certain <i>alias</i> Maning to which all positively responded and disclosed that <i>alias</i> Maning was, indeed, involved in the illegal sale of drugs in their place. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, PO2 Gallano told P/Chief Insp. Oraya that the information relayed to them by the male informant was true and accurate. Accordingly, a buy-bust operation against <i>alias</i> Maning was planned and a team was formed composed of: PO2 Gallano, who was designated as the <i>poseur-</i>buyer; PO2 Boiser, who was to serve as PO2 Gallano's immediate back-up; SPO2 Millari, Police Officer 3 Sergio Delima (PO3 Delima), PO2 Gerald Marion Lagos (PO2 Lagos), PO2 Cerilo Zamora (PO2 Zamora) and the other police operatives of DAID-SOT, all of whom were assigned as perimeter back-up.&nbsp; P/Chief Insp. Oraya then gave four (4) pieces of P500.00 peso bills amounting to P2,000.00 to PO2 Gallano as buy-bust money, which the latter marked with "JG," representing the initials of Jose Gentiles, Chief of the District Intelligence and Investigation Branch.&nbsp; During the briefing, the male informant was also present.&nbsp; The pre-arranged signal of the buy-bust team was a missed call from PO2 Gallano to PO2 Boiser. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>At around 5:00 p.m., the buy-bust team, together with the male informant, proceeded to the target area on board two vehicles.&nbsp; Upon arrival thereat at around 5:45 p.m., the buy-bust team parked their vehicles along Tanyag Street.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano and the male informant alighted from their vehicle and walked towards the house of <i>alias</i> Maning while the rest of the buy-bust team followed them discreetly. Upon reaching the house of <i>alias</i> Maning, who at that time was standing on a street in front of his house, the male informant, who personally knew <i>alias</i> Maning, approached the latter and introduced PO2 Gallano as a security guard in need of <i>shabu</i> for his personal use.&nbsp; At this juncture, PO2 Boiser and the rest of the buy-bust team, who were all in civilian clothes, were already strategically deployed at the target area at a distance of about 10 to 15 meters away from <i>alias</i> Maning, PO2 Gallano and the male informant.&nbsp; The male informant likewise told <i>alias</i> Maning that PO2 Gallano is his friend.&nbsp; <i>Alias</i> Maning then asked PO2 Gallano how much <i>shabu</i> he would buy and where he used to buy such stuff.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano told <i>alias</i> Maning that he used to get it in Ususan, Taguig.&nbsp; <i>Alias</i> Maning then asked for PO2 Gallano's money and the latter handed to the former the marked money consisting of four (4) pieces of P500.00 peso bills amounting to P2,000.00.&nbsp; In exchange thereto, <i>alias</i> Maning gave PO2 Gallano one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance equivalent to the money the latter gave to the former. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Immediately thereafter, PO2 Gallano gave a missed call to PO2 Boiser as their pre-arranged signal signifying that the sale transaction has already been consummated.&nbsp; PO2 Boiser and the rest of the buy-bust team, who were just within the vicinity of the target area, proceeded, at once, to the place where PO2 Gallano, <i>alias</i> Maning and the male informant were.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano and the other members of the buy-bust team then introduced themselves to <i>alias</i> Maning as police officers.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano with the help of PO2 Boiser effected the arrest of <i>alias</i> Maning.&nbsp; In the course thereof, another plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance was recovered by PO2 Gallano in the possession of <i>alias</i> Maning.&nbsp; The marked money consisting of four (4) pieces of P500 peso bills amounting to P2,000.00 was also recovered from<i> alias </i>Maning.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano then marked the one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance subject of the sale with "NG-1-230205" while the other plastic sachet also containing white crystalline substance found in the possession of <i>alias</i> Maning on the occasion of his arrest was marked with "NG-2-230205." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, appellant was brought to the office of DAID-SOT, Southern Police District, Fort Bonifacio, Taguig, Metro Manila, for investigation and proper documentation.&nbsp; In the course thereof, <i>alias</i> Maning was later on identified to be Manuel Cruz <i>y</i> Cruz, the herein appellant.&nbsp; A request for the drug testing of the appellant and for the laboratory examination of the two (2) plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance seized from him were likewise made.&nbsp; The said two (2) plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance were subsequently brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Camp Crame, Quezon City, for examination.&nbsp; The examination conducted thereon yielded positive result to the tests for the presence of methylamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> as evidenced by Chemistry Report No. D-143-05. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The defense, on the other hand, presented the lone testimony of herein appellant, who denied all the accusations against him.<br><br>Appellant claimed that, on 23 February 2005, he was working as a dispatcher of passenger jeepneys in Tanyag Street, <i>Sitio</i> de Asis, <i>Barangay</i> San Martin de Porres, Parañaque City.&nbsp; At around 3:00 p.m., he went home to answer the call of nature and to take a bath.&nbsp; From his workplace to his house, there is a distance of about 100 meters.&nbsp; Upon arrival thereat, he found out that somebody was still using the comfort room so he opted to stay in the garage and watched the children playing video games. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>After a while, four to five male persons in civilian clothes, who introduced themselves to be policemen, entered the gate of his house and immediately arrested and handcuffed him for his alleged refusal to cooperate and to give them "<i>tong</i>."&nbsp; He was then pulled outside and was forcefully boarded inside a vehicle.&nbsp; He was, thereafter, brought to Fort Bonifacio, Taguig, Metro Manila, and was detained thereat for the alleged recovery of <i>shabu</i> in his possession.&nbsp; The following day, he was brought to the Parañaque City Hall for inquest.&nbsp; The fiscal informed him that he was charged with the illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; He was later on detained at the Parañaque City Jail. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The trial court, convinced on the merits of the prosecution's case, rendered a Decision dated 22 September 2006 finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 05-0254 for the crime of illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug, in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.&nbsp; The trial court, however, ordered the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 05-0255 for the crime of illegal possession of <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug, in violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, elucidating that appellant's possession of small quantity of <i>shabu</i> can be considered as part and parcel of his nefarious trade.&nbsp; The trial court, thus, decreed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, finding <b>MANUEL CRUZ [y] CRUZ GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt for <b>Violation of Section 5, Art. II, [Republic Act No.] 9165</b>, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<b> Criminal Case No. 05-0255 </b>against Manuel Cruz Cruz for alleged<b> violation of Section 11, Art.

The <i>rationale</i> behind this rule is that the trial court is in a better position to decide the credibility of witnesses, having heard their testimonies and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during trial.&nbsp; This rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In the case under consideration, this Court finds no cogent reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court, which were affirmed by the appellate court.<br><br>Jurisprudence clearly set the essential elements to be established in the prosecution for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, <i>viz</i>: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and payment therefor.&nbsp; Succinctly, the delivery of the illicit drug to the <i>poseur</i>-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money successfully consummates the buy-bust transaction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; What is material, therefore, is the proof that the transaction or sale transpired, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the prosecution successfully established the aforesaid elements beyond moral certainty.<br><br>To note, appellant was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> delivering one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance weighing 1.53 grams to PO2 Gallano, the <i>poseur</i>-buyer, for a consideration of P2,000.00.&nbsp; The white crystalline substance contained in the said one piece plastic sachet handed by appellant to PO2 Gallano was later on confirmed to be methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i> per Chemistry Report No. D-143-05 dated 24 February 2005 issued by the PNP Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; During trial, PO2 Gallano positively identified appellant as the same person who sold and handed him the one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance, proven to be <i>shabu</i>, in exchange for P2,000.00. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; When the said one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance confirmed to be <i>shabu</i> was presented in court, PO2 Gallano identified it to be the same object sold to him by appellant because of the markings found thereon, <i>i.e.</i>, "NG-1-230205," which he, himself, has written at the place where appellant was arrested.&nbsp; PO2 Gallano similarly identified in court the recovered buy-bust money from appellant consisting of four (4) pieces of P500 peso bills amounting to P2,000.00 with markings "JG," representing the initials of Jose Gentiles, the Chief of the District Intelligence and Investigation Branch.<br><br>More so, the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the documentary evidence offered in court gave a detailed picture of the series of events that transpired in the afternoon of 23 February 2005 in <i>Sitio</i> de Asis, <i>Barangay</i> San Martin de Porres, Parañaque City, leading to the consummation of the transaction, <i>i.e.</i>, illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; The prosecution vividly showed how PO2 Gallano, the <i>poseur</i>-buyer, was introduced by their male informant to appellant as a security guard in need of <i>shabu</i> for his personal use.&nbsp; The same was followed by a query from the appellant as to how much <i>shabu</i> PO2 Gallano would buy.&nbsp; Appellant subsequently asked for PO2 Gallano's money.&nbsp; The latter then handed to the former the marked money consisting of four (4) pieces of P500.00 peso bills amounting to P2,000.00. In exchange thereto, appellant gave PO2 Gallano one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance equivalent to the money the latter gave to the former.<br><br>With the foregoing, it is crystal clear that the sale transaction of illicit drug between the <i>poseur</i>-buyer and the appellant was successfully consummated.&nbsp; Accordingly, whatever doubt in connection with appellant's culpability can no longer be questioned after being caught in a buy-bust operation conducted by the police operatives of the DAID-SOT, Southern Police District, Fort Bonifacio, Taguig, Metro Manila.<br><br>On the legality of appellant's warrantless arrest, it bears stressing that he was arrested in an entrapment operation where he was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; An arrest made after an entrapment operation does not require a warrant inasmuch as it is considered a valid warrantless arrest pursuant to Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which specifically provides that:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp; <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful</i>. - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;</blockquote><br>In <i>People v. Sembrano</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> citing <i>People v. Agulay</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court held that a buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment which in recent years has been accepted as a valid and effective mode of apprehending drug pushers.&nbsp; If carried out with due regard for constitutional and legal safeguards, a buy-bust operation, as in this case, deserves judicial sanction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, <b>in a buy-bust operation, the violator is caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> and the police officers conducting the same are not only authorized but also duty-bound to apprehend the violator and consequently search him for anything that may have been part of or used in the commission of the crime</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, after the police operatives of DAID-SOT, Southern Police District, Fort Bonifacio, Taguig, Metro Manila, received information from their male informant regarding appellant's criminal activity, an entrapment plan was then set up.&nbsp; The same was made specifically to test the veracity of the informant's tip and to subsequently arrest the malefactor if the report is found to be true. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The prosecution's evidence positively showed that appellant agreed to sell <i>shabu</i> to the <i>poseur</i>-buyer, who was introduced to him by the male informant.&nbsp; He was, in fact, caught red-handed plying his illegal trade.&nbsp; Thus, the warrantless arrest of the appellant was legal and within the confines of law.&nbsp; In the same breath, it cannot be doubted that the sachet of <i>shabu</i> seized from him during the legitimate buy-bust operation is admissible and was properly admitted in evidence against him.<br><br>Appellant's assertion that he was just framed up as the <i>shabu</i> seized from him was planted evidence so he can be prosecuted for the illegal sale thereof finds no support in evidence.<br><br>Denial or frame up is a standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Law.&nbsp; As such, it has been viewed by the court with disfavor for it can just as easily be concocted. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; It should not accord a redoubtable sanctuary to a person accused of drug dealing unless the evidence of such frame up is clear and convincing. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Without proof of any intent on the part of the police officers to falsely impute appellant in the commission of a crime, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and the principle that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect, deserve to prevail over the bare denials and self-serving claims of appellant that he had been framed up. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Neither can appellant's claim of alleged extortion by the police operatives be entertained. Absent any proof, appellant's assertion of extortion allegedly committed by the police officers could not be successfully interposed.&nbsp; It remains one of those standard, worn-out, and impotent excuses of malefactors prosecuted for drug offenses.&nbsp; What appellant could have done was to prove his allegation and not just casually air it. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In this case, appellant failed to substantiate such defense.&nbsp; Other than his self-serving allegation, no other evidence whether testimonial or documentary has been adduced by him to strengthen his claim.&nbsp; No one was ever presented by the defense to corroborate the version of events proffered by the appellant.&nbsp; Hence, appellant's defense of bare denial or frame up is highly unacceptable.<br><br>As a last ditch effort to exonerate himself, appellant even avows that the marked money used during the buy-bust operation was not shown to have been previously recorded in the police blotter, which allegedly paralyzed the cause of the prosecution.<br><br>The case cited by appellant, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>People v. Fulgarillas</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> in support of the aforesaid allegation is not applicable in the present case.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Fulgarillas</i>, the <i>poseur</i>-buyer was never presented as a witness, so, the court held that the testimonies of the rest of the members of the buy-bust team are merely hearsay.&nbsp; There was even no testimony that when the appellant therein handed the stuff to the <i>poseur</i>-buyer, the latter in turn handed the marked money. The only evidence therein that could prove the sale transaction of illicit drug was the marked money but the records did not show that the markings thereon were previously blotted. Thus, the Court held therein that "[t]he act of blottering is the correct and regular procedure by which the regularity of the preparation of marked money may be established.&nbsp; Without such blotter, all attempts at establishing regularity remains dubious." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Such was not the case here since the <i>poseur</i>-buyer herein, <i>i.e.</i>, PO2 Gallano, was presented by the prosecution as a witness.&nbsp; Accordingly, the principle enunciated in <i>People v. Fulgarillas</i> finds no application in this case.&nbsp; To repeat, the testimony of PO2 Gallano clearly showed how the sale transaction between him and the appellant was consummated.&nbsp; It started the moment PO2 Gallano was introduced by their male informant to appellant and expressed his intention to buy <i>shabu</i>, until the time appellant handed him the one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance, proven to be <i>shabu</i>, in exchange to the four (4) pieces of P500.00 peso bills marked money amounting to P2,000.00 that PO2 Gallano handed to appellant.<br><br>As aptly observed by the Court of Appeals, the testimony of PO2 Gallano was corroborated by PO2 Boiser, the former's immediate back up.&nbsp; The testimonies of the said prosecution witnesses were likewise supported by other pieces of evidence, to wit: (1) the one piece plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance seized from appellant, which was identified in court by PO2 Gallano to be the same object sold to him by appellant; and (2) the marked money itself consisting of four (4) pieces of P500 peso bills amounting to P2,000.00, which was also identified by PO2 Gallano in the course of his testimony before the court <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>Granting <i>arguendo</i> that the marked money was not previously recorded in the police blotter, the same is not fatal to the prosecution's case primarily because the <i>poseur</i>-buyer testified in regards to his transaction with the appellant coupled with the presentation of the drug seized from the latter.<br><br>This Court held that neither law nor jurisprudence requires the presentation of any of the money used in a buy-bust operation, much less is it required that the boodle money be marked.&nbsp; <b>The</b> <b>only elements necessary to consummate the crime is proof that the illicit transaction took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i> or the illicit drug as evidence</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Both elements were satisfactorily proven in the present case.&nbsp; There is also no rule that requires the police to use only marked money in buy-bust operations.&nbsp; <b>This Court has in fact ruled that failure to use marked money or to present it in evidence is not material since the sale cannot be essentially disproved by the absence thereof</b>.&nbsp; Its non-presentation does not create a <i>hiatus</i> in the prosecution's evidence for as long as the sale of the illegal drugs is adequately established and the substance itself is presented before the court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing, it is with more reason that failure to previously record in the police blotter the marked money used in the buy-bust operation will neither affect nor paralyze the cause of the prosecution considering that, in this case, the <i>poseur</i>-buyer testified and the seized <i>shabu</i> was presented in evidence.<br><br><i>As to penalty</i>.&nbsp; The penalty for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, like <i>shabu</i>, is explicitly provided for in Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Sale</i><i>, Trading, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals.</i> - <b>The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00)</b> shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broke in any of such transactions. [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote><br>It is clear from the foregoing provision that the sale of any dangerous drug, like <i>shabu</i>, regardless of its quantity and purity, carries with it the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; In view, however, of the effectivity of Republic Act No. 9346, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the imposition of the supreme penalty of death has been proscribed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Accordingly, the penalty applicable to appellant shall only be life imprisonment and fine without eligibility for parole.&nbsp; This Court, therefore, sustains the penalty of imprisonment and fine imposed upon appellant by the lower courts.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
