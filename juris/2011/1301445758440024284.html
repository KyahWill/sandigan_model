				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case is about how the credibility of the rape victim's identification of her attacker often depends on her spontaneous actions and behavior following the rape.<br><br><center><b>The Facts and the Case</b><br></center><br>The city prosecutor charged the accused Jenny Tumambing (Tumambing) with rape in Criminal Case 04-227897 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila.<br><br>DK,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the complainant, testified that at around 2:00 a.m. on June 26, 2004 she went to sleep, leaving the lights on, at her cousin's rented room. She was startled when somebody entered the room after she had turned off the lights. The intruder, a man, poked a knife at DK and threatened to kill her if she made any noise. He removed DK's clothes and undressed himself. He then succeeded in ravishing her. When the man was about to leave, DK turned the light on and she saw his face. DK recognized him as the same person who passed by her cousin's room several times in the afternoon of the previous day, June 25, 2004. Later, she identified the accused Jenny Tumambing as her rapist.<br><br>On June 27, 2004 the doctor who examined DK found no bruises, hematoma, or any sign of resistance on her body but found several fresh lacerations on her genitals.<br><br>Tumambing denied committing the crime. He claimed that on June 26, 2004 he slept at the house of his employer, Nestor Ledesma. He went to bed at about 9:00 p.m. and woke up at 6:00 a.m. Tumambing swore that he never left his employer's house that night. Ledesma corroborated his story. <i>Barangay</i> officials summoned Tumambing and he went, thinking that it had something to do with a bloodletting campaign. He was shocked, however, when he learned that he had been suspected of having committed rape.<br><br>On June 27, 2006 the RTC found Tumambing guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. The RTC also ordered him to indemnify DK of P50,000.00 and pay her P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>On November 12, 2009 the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed in CA-G.R. CR-HC 02433 the decision of the RTC in its entirety, prompting Tumambing to appeal to this Court.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Presented</b><br></center><br>The sole issue presented in this case is whether or not the CA and the trial court erred in finding that accused Tumambing raped DK under the circumstances she mentioned.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>A successful prosecution of a criminal action largely depends on proof of two things: the identification of the author of the crime and his actual commission of the same. An ample proof that a crime has been committed has no use if the prosecution is unable to convincingly prove the offender's identity. The constitutional presumption of innocence that an accused enjoys is not demolished by an identification that is full of uncertainties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Here, both the RTC and the CA gave credence to DK's testimony. They maintained that DK categorically and positively identified her rapist. The CA invoked <i>People v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> where the<i> </i>Court ruled that it would be easy for a person who has once gained familiarity with the appearance of another to identify the latter even from a considerable distance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Ordinarily, the Court would respect the trial court and the CA's findings regarding the credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> But the courts mentioned appear to have overlooked or misinterpreted certain critical evidence in the case. This compels the Court to take a look at the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>DK's identification of accused Tumambing as her rapist is far from categorical. The Court's reading of her testimony shows that she was quite reluctant at the beginning but eventually pointed to him when it was suggested that it <i>might </i>be him after all. Several witnesses attested to DK's uncertainties regarding the rapist's identity when the <i>barangay</i> chairman arranged for her to meet Tumambing. PO2 Crispulo Frondozo, one of the apprehending officers, testified as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q:</b></div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Now in the <i>barangay</i>, do you have any occasion to see whether the complainant pinpointed accused as the person who abused her person?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What about in any precinct or agency, do you have any occasion to see complainant positively identified the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b> A: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Pedrito Yacub, Sr., the <i>Barangay</i> Chairman to whom DK initially reported the incident testified:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When the accused enter the <i>barangay </i>hall upon invitation, what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Correction Sir.

If this were the case, her natural reaction on seeing Tumambing would have been one of outright fury or some revealing emotion, not reluctance in pointing to him despite the <i>barangay</i> chairman's assurance that he would protect her if she identified him. In assessing the testimony of a wronged woman, evidence of her conduct immediately after the alleged assault is of critical value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The <i>barangay</i> chairman continued:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">As <i>barangay </i>captain who has the duty to enforce law and city ordinances, you came to know that there were other suspect, what did you do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A:</b></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I invited the suspect.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q:</b></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Do you remember the person whom you invited known as the second suspect?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A:</b></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">His name is Alvin Quiatcho.

The Court cannot thus accept DK's testimony that she had been familiar with the looks of the man who violated her and that she could not possibly be mistaken in identifying him as Tumambing.<br><br>Crispin Dizon, the executive officer of the same <i>barangay</i>, corroborated the <i>barangay </i>chairman's testimony:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">So what was the question?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A:</b></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The question was that, "Is this the person you saw and who rape you?"</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Court: Referring to?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Interpreter: Referring to Jenny Tumambing.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What was the reply of the victim, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">She did not answer, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What happen next when [DK] did not answer?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A:</b></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">And [DK] was again asked by the Chairman and told her not to fear and tell who raped her and point to him.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What was the reply of [DK] if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">She did not reply, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Q: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Now if you remember how many times did the Chairman asked [DK]?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>A: </b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Four times, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The RTC and the CA thought that DK was quite sure it was Tumambing who sexually attacked her. They pointed out her insistence at the police precinct that it was Tumambing who really raped her and that she positively identified him in open court. But this came about much later. The fact is that she did not refute the testimonies given by neutral witnesses that she could not point to accused Tumambing as her rapist during their initial confrontation at the <i>barangay</i> chairman's residence. These witnesses had no motive or reason to fabricate a story for the defense.<br><br>By the nature of rape, the court has to, quite often, rely on the sole testimony of the victim. For this reason, the court is always reminded to subject her testimony to a most rigid and careful scrutiny. It cannot afford to overlook details that are essential to an understanding of the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Here, as shown above, DK's testimony is anything but believable and consistent.<br><br>Although she categorically said on cross-examination that she saw her attacker enter the room,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> she did not shout or raise an alarming call. Nor did she try to escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She just lay in bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In fact, she maintained that position in bed even when her attacker was standing before her and removing his clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> She did not shout nor struggle when he penetrated her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>There is one thing that DK appeared sure of. Her rapist wore a yellow shirt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> But this is inconsistent with her testimony that after the stranger in her room was done raping her, "<i>bigla na lang po siyang lumabas </i>x x x <i>sinundan ko siya ng tingin.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Since DK did not say that the man put his clothes back on, it seems a certainty that he collected his clothes and carried this out when he left the room. Since DK then turned on the light for the first time, she had a chance to see him clearly. But, if this were so and he walked out naked, why was she so certain that he wore a yellow shirt?<br><br>With such serious doubts regarding the true identity of DK's rapist, the Court cannot affirm the conviction of accused Tumambing.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals dated November 12, 2009 in CA-G.R.
