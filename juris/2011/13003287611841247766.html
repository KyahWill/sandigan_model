Fragante (Ernesto hereafter) married CCC on October 6, 1975, in Sta. Cruz Manila, and such marriage was ratified on December 7, 1995 celebrated in San Sebastian Parish Church. That union, produced three offsprings. [AAA], the victim herein, is their third child. She was born on August 23, 1982. x x x<br><br>Sometime in April 1993 to May 1993, three or four months before her eleventh (11) birthday, [AAA] woke up one early morning to prepare for the driving lessons which her father Ernesto, promised to teach them that day. [AAA] was the first to wake up. She was in her room when her father entered and lay on her bed. He then asked [AAA] to lie beside him to which [AAA] obeyed. While lying beside her, Ernesto was talking to her about a lot of things, and as he talked he started to fondle her breast and suck her nipples.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The incident was repeated sometime between June 1993 and August 1993. Ernesto told [AAA] to get inside his room, then he would lock the door. Once inside the room, he would scold [AAA] for reasons unknown to her. When she would start to cry, her father would start to touch her breast, then he would suck her nipples while he was rubbing her vagina.<br><br>On two occasions, between October 1993 and December 1993, at Shaolin Chinese Restaurant located in Sucat, Parañaque, which the Fragante family owned, there was a small back room used as an office which later was converted into a room where they could rest. [AAA] was told by her father to rest in that room and once inside, while talking to her, he covered the windows with manila paper. He lay down beside her in the folding bed. He fondled her breast, squeezed them and then later inserted his hand under her shirt as he pull it up and put his mouth on her breast to suck it alternately. He started stroking her genitals with her shorts on. She did not do anything as she was in shock at that time.<br><br>In December 1993, [AAA] and her father bought food from Jollibee. She was instructed to eat it at the back room of their Shaolin Chinese Restaurant so that other employees would not see it. After eating, Ernesto asked her to lie down in the folding bed and he again lay down beside her and massaged her breast and sucked her nipples while continuously rubbing her vagina by inserting his hand inside her shorts.<br><br>Sometime in January 1994, around 10 o'clock in the evening, while [AAA] was sleeping in another room, Ernesto entered her room. He lay beside her, and started sucking her breast. He removed her shorts and then touched her vagina. He then inserted his finger inside her vagina.<br><br>In August-September 1994, she was around twelve (12) years old, Ernesto molested her again inside his room, by massaging her private parts and sucking her nipples while continuously rubbing her vagina and afterwards inserting his finger inside it.<br><br>In September 1995, at the age of thirteen (13), [AAA] was raped by her father Ernesto. She was told to get inside his room and was scolded by him before she was made to lie down in his bed. Her shirt was removed, and her breast and vagina were fondled by him. Thereafter, he sucked her nipples while continuously touching her vagina. He removed her shorts and panty, then spreaded her legs and inserted his penis in her vagina. She struggled and begged him to remove his penis. She said she could not recall the exact details of what her father was doing. He stayed on top of her despite her pleas. x x x<br><br>Ernesto was not able to find time to molest [AAA] in September 1995-1996, because he was hardly home and was busy with his bookstore business in Visayas and Mindanao.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the evening of October 25, 1997, Irma, together with their brother Marco accompanied their mother Gaudencia to a wake of their mother's friend. [AAA] wanted to go with them but she was left home alone with Ernesto who refused to allow [AAA] to go with them. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Her father started massaging her breast and [AAA] removed his hands and stood up but she was bitten and pushed towards the bed. Her father strangled her and asked whether she preferred to be strangled first and she answered no. He started touching her private parts again and this time she continued warding off his hands and when she heard their car entering their garage, she told her father that her mother had arrive. That was the only time she was allowed to leave but was stopped by her father and warned not tell her mother what happened.<br><br>x x x They later proceeded to the NBI, Taft Ave. Manila to report the incidents and where [AAA] executed her complaint-affidavit. Her mother and siblings also executed their affidavits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>During arraignment on April 26, 1999, the accused entered separate pleas of "Not Guilty" to all the crimes charged.<br><br>Joint trial ensued thereafter.<br><br>Prosecution presented the following witnesses: [AAA], BBB, CCC, and Dr. Bernadette Madrid.

In upholding appellant's conviction, the Court of Appeals gave credence to AAA's testimony narrating how appellant sexually abused her repeatedly. The Court of Appeals junked appellant's contentions that (1) AAA's testimony lacked specific details such as the actual date of commission of the acts of lasciviousness, and was inconsistent with respect to the charge of rape; (2) AAA was ill motivated in filing the criminal complaints; (3) the charge of rape was unsubstantiated by medical findings; and (4) the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities renders the charges dubious.<br><br>On 28 September 2007, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, of Parañaque City, Branch 260, dated July 4, 2003 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as follows:<br><br><ol><li>In Criminal Cases Nos. 98-651, 98-652, 98-653, 98-654, 98-655, 98-656, 98-657, accused-appellant Ernesto A. Fragante is hereby sentenced to suffer Indeterminate Penalty, the minimum of which is fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum and the maximum of which is seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion temporal </i>medium, for acts of lasciviousness under <b><i>Article III, Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610, </i></b>and is also ordered to pay [AAA] the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of acts of lasciviousness;<br><br></li><li>In pursuant with <b><i>Section 31(f), Article XII, of Republic Act</i></b><i> <b>No. 7610</b>,</i> a <b>FINE</b> in the amount of Thirty Thousand (Php30,000.00) Pesos for each count of the nine (9) counts of lascivious conduct is hereby imposed;<br><br></li><li>The penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 98-658 and Criminal Case No. 98-659 by the trial court is hereby <b><i>AFFIRMED without modification</i></b>;<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. 98-660, the penalty imposed is hereby reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> by virtue of R.A.

We acquit appellant for two (2) counts of acts of lasciviousness on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b><i>Criminal Case No. 98-660 for Rape</i></b><br></center><br>Appellant contends that the Court of Appeals erred in convicting him for the crime of rape since the prosecution failed to overthrow the presumption of innocence. Appellant alleges that (1) AAA's testimony was full of inconsistencies and improbabilities which cast serious doubts on the truthfulness of her account; (2) the medical findings do not support the charge of rape; (3) AAA's delayed reporting of the incident renders the charges dubious; and (4) AAA and her mother harbored a grudge against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded. The prosecution sufficiently established appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of rape.<br><br>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed.</i> - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><ol><li>By using force or intimidation;<br></li><li>When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br></li><li>When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>As correctly found by the Court of Appeals, all the essential elements of rape are present in this case. The evidence on record clearly proves that appellant had carnal knowledge of his own minor daughter AAA.<br><br>We reject appellant's contention that AAA's testimony was full of inconsistencies. On the contrary, AAA's testimony that she was raped by appellant was very consistent and straightforward. Notably, appellant did not point out the supposed inconsistencies, and proceeded in arguing that his moral ascendancy over his daughter was insufficient to intimidate AAA.<br><br>It must be stressed that the gravamen of rape is sexual congress with a woman by force and without consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In <i>People v. Orillosa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> we held that actual force or intimidation need not be employed in incestuous rape of a minor because the moral and physical dominion of the father is sufficient to cow the victim into submission to his beastly desires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> When a father commits the odious crime of rape against his own daughter, his moral ascendancy or influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The absence of violence or offer of resistance would not affect the outcome of the case because the overpowering and overbearing moral influence of the father over his daughter takes the place of violence and offer of resistance required in rape cases committed by an accused who did not have blood relationship with the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In this case, AAA's testimony clearly showed how appellant took advantage of his relationship with and his moral ascendancy over his minor daughter when he had carnal knowledge of her. As found by the Court of Appeals, appellant instilled fear on AAA's mind every time he sexually molested her, thus:<br><br><blockquote>[AAA] also admitted that after accused-appellant has started sexually molesting her until she was raped, she was so frightened of him. In fact she could not tell her mother of her ordeal, mindful of the serious threats on her life and of the chaos it would cause their family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>We likewise find appellant's claim that the medical findings do not support the charge of rape untenable. Aside from AAA's positive, straightforward, and credible testimony, the prosecution presented the medical certificate issued by Dr. Bernadette Madrid<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and the latter's testimony which corroborate AAA's claim that appellant raped her.<br><br>The Court is not impressed with appellant's claim that AAA's failure to immediately report the incidents to the proper authorities affected her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Delay could be attributed to the victim's tender age and the appellant's threats.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> A rape victim's actions are oftentimes influenced by fear, rather than reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In incestuous rape, this fear is magnified because the victim usually lives under the same roof as the perpetrator or is at any rate subject to his dominance because of their blood relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>We also find appellant's imputation of ill-motive on the part of the victim, including his wife and AAA's sister, in filing the criminal charges devoid of merit. Suffice it to state that the resentment angle, even if true, does not prove any ill motive on AAA's part to falsely accuse appellant of rape or necessarily detract from her credibility as witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Motives, such as those arising from family feuds, resentment, or revenge, have not prevented the Court from giving, if proper, full credence to the testimony of minor complainants who remained consistent throughout their direct and cross-examinations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For appellant's guilt for the crime of rape committed against his own minor daughter AAA, we sustain the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on appellant. While the Court of Appeals correctly reduced the penalty of death<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the Court of Appeals failed to indicate that the reduction of the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is without eligibility for parole in accordance with Sections 2 and 3 of Republic Act No. 9346.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As regards appellant's civil liability, we affirm the award of moral damages and civil indemnity, which are automatically granted without need of proof or pleading,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> each in the sum of P75,000.

These provisions state:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 336. <i>Acts of lasciviousness.</i> -- Any person who shall commit any act of lasciviousness upon other persons of either sex, under any of the circumstances mentioned in the preceding article, shall be punished by <i>prision</i><i> correccional.</i><br><br>Section 5. <i>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse</i>. - Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br><br>The penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed upon the following:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse of lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period; x x x</blockquote><br>The elements of sexual abuse under Section 5, Article III of Republic Act No. 7610 are as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct.<br></li><li>The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to sexual abuse.<br></li><li>The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>As correctly found by the Court of Appeals, all the elements of sexual abuse under Section 5, Article III of RA 7610 are present here.<br><br>First, appellant's repeated touching, fondling, and sucking of AAA's breasts and inserting his finger into AAA's vagina with lewd designs undoubtedly constitute lascivious conduct under Section 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 7610, to wit:<br><blockquote><br>(h) "Lascivious conduct" means the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or public area of a person.<br></blockquote><br>Second, appellant, as a father having moral ascendancy over his daughter, coerced AAA to engage in lascivious conduct, which is within the purview of sexual abuse. In <i>People v.

Section 3(a), Article I of Republic Act No. 7610 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. -<br><br>(a) "Children" refers [to] persons below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition;</blockquote><br>Since all three elements of the crime were present, the conviction of appellant for acts of lasciviousness was proper.<br><br>As to the alleged failure of the prosecution to establish with particularity the date of the commission of the acts of lasciviousness, suffice it to state that the date and time of the commission of the offense are not material ingredients of such crime. Section 11, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 11. Time of the commission of the offense. -- It is not necessary to state in the complaint or information the precise time at which the offense was committed except when time is a material ingredient of the offense, but the act may be alleged to have been committed at any time as to the actual date at which the offense was committed as the information or complaint will permit.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>People v.

Evidence so presented is admissible and sufficient if it shows 1) that the crime was committed at any time within the period of the statute of limitations; and 2) before or after the time stated in the complaint or indictment and before the action is commenced.<br></blockquote><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals in debunking appellant's claim that AAA's testimony was overly generalized and lacked specific details on when appellant sexually abused the victim.

No. 7610 is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period, the range of which is from 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law and in the absence of modifying circumstances, the maximum term of the sentence to be imposed shall be taken from the medium period of the imposable penalty, which is <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, the range of which is from 15 years, 6 months and 20 days to 16 years, 5 months and 9 days, while the minimum term shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, which is <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum, the range of which is from 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months.</blockquote><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> G.R.

The penalty imposable for acts of lasciviousness against children under 12 years of age should be that provided by R.A. 7610, which is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period. Accused-appellant is Aira's grandfather. His relationship to his victim aggravates the crime, and, as provided by R.A. 7610, Section 31, the penalty shall be imposed in the maximum period when the perpetrator is an ascendant, parent, guardian, stepparent or collateral relative within the second degree of consanguinity or affinity. Hence, the maximum period of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium should be imposed. Applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum of the penalty to be imposed should be <i>reclusion temporal</i> minimum.</blockquote><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <i> People v.
