				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BRION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Edwin Tabao (<span style="font-style: italic;">petitioner</span>) seeks reconsideration of our Resolution, dated June 8, 2009, denying his petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> for failure to show any reversible error in the assailed Court of Appeals (CA) decision to warrant the exercise of this Court’s discretionary appellate jurisdiction, and for raising substantially factual issues.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution reveals the following facts:<br><br>At around 10:00 p.m. of January 21, 1993, the petitioner was driving his Toyota Corolla car bearing plate number PCH-111 along Governor Forbes corner G. Tuazon Street towards Nagtahan when it suddenly ramped on an island divider, bumping Rochelle Lanete who was crossing the street. As a result of the impact, Rochelle was thrown into the middle of the road on her back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Thereafter, Leonardo Mendez’ speeding blue Toyota Corona car with plate number PES-764 ran over Rochelle’s body. Bystanders — armed with stones and wooden clubs — followed Mendez’ car until it stopped near the Nagtahan Flyover.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Francisco Cielo, a newspaper delivery boy, pleaded with the bystanders not to hurt Mendez. Cielo went inside Mendez’ car, sat beside him, got his driver’s license, and ordered him to move the car backwards. Mendez followed his order, but his car hit the center island twice while backing up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Cielo went out of the car and approached the sprawled body of Rochelle; he and the petitioner brought Rochelle’s body inside Mendez’ car. The three of them (the petitioner, Cielo and Mendez) brought Rochelle to the UST Hospital,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> where she died on February 6, 1993 due to <span style="font-style: italic;">septicemia secondary to traumatic injuries</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The defense presented a different version of the incident.<br><br>The petitioner narrated that at around 10:00 p.m. of January 21, 1993, he was driving along Governor Forbes corner G. Tuazon Street when his car ramped on an island at the foot of the Nagtahan Flyover. He tried to move the car backwards, but failed to do so. He alighted from his car and then saw that its two rear wheels had been elevated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He returned inside his car to turn off its engine; he then noticed that many people were approaching his car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He again alighted from his vehicle and saw a person lying on the road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> He looked at his left side and saw a car that was “running fast like a wind” pass by. He approached the person lying on the road, and noticed that she was still breathing and moaning. Afterwards, he saw Mendez’ car backing up; he carried the victim towards that car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thereafter, he, Mendez and Cielo brought the victim to the UST Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Mendez, for his part, testified that at around 9:00 to 9:30 p.m. of January 21, 1993, he left his girlfriend’s house in Blumentritt, Sta. Cruz, Manila. As he was driving along Governor Forbes corner G. Tuazon Street on his way home, he saw a vehicle that had ramped on an island divider. Suddenly, another vehicle overtook his car from the right and cut his lane. He slowed down his car when he saw a rug-like object fall from the car that overtook him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and stopped when he realized that what had fallen was a person’s body. When he moved his car backwards to help this person, many people approached his car. He alighted from his car and inquired from them what had happened. The people replied that someone was run over; some of them pointed to him as the culprit. He denied having run over the victim when they tried to hurt him. The petitioner carried the victim and placed her inside Mendez’ car. Thereafter, the two of them brought the victim to the UST Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The Office of the City Prosecutor found probable cause and thereafter charged the petitioner and Mendez with reckless imprudence resulting to homicide before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 39, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The RTC, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated September 15, 2003, found that it was “very clear that both accused are responsible for the death of Rochelle Lanete,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and convicted the two (2) accused of the crime charged. It found that the petitioner’s car first hit the victim, causing her to be thrown into the road on her back, and that Mendez’ car ran over her as she was lying down. It held that the two failed to observe the necessary precaution and due care in operating their respective vehicles, to wit: the petitioner was not attentive to his driving such that he failed to see the island divider and bumped Rochelle; Mendez was driving his car too fast at nighttime such that he was unable to avoid running over her as her body lay prone on the street. The RTC sentenced them to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor,</span> as minimum, to two years, 10 months and 20 days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional,</span> as maximum. It also ordered them to pay the heirs of the victim the following amounts: (a) P478,434.12 as actual damages; (b) P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; and (c) P50,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The petitioner filed an appeal before the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CR. No. 28401. The CA, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated July 27, 2007, agreed with the factual findings of the RTC, and affirmed its decision with the modification that the petitioner be sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of four months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor,</span> as minimum, to four years, nine months and 10 days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>, as maximum.<br><br>The petitioner moved to reconsider this decision, but the CA denied his motion in its resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of March 17, 2009.<br><br>The petitioner filed before this Court a petition for review on certiorari alleging that the courts <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo </span>erred in convicting him of the crime charged. As earlier stated, we denied this petition for failure to show any reversible error in the assailed CA decision to warrant the exercise of our discretionary appellate jurisdiction, and for raising substantially factual issues.<br><br>The petitioner now comes to us <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> the present motion for reconsideration, raising the following arguments:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE FINDINGS OF FACTS OF BOTH THE COURT OF APPEALS AND THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT ARE HIGHLY SPECULATIVE, MANIFESTLY MISTAKEN AND UNSUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE [ON RECORD;]<br><br></li><li>[THE] COURT OF APPEALS [ERRED IN UPHOLDING HIS] CONVICTION [ON THE BASIS OF THE] INCREDIBLE AND UNRELIABLE TESTIMONY OF x x x VICTOR SORIANO[; and]<br><br></li><li>THE [SUPREME] COURT DISREGARDED [HIS CONSTITUTIONAL] PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol><br></blockquote>In its Comment, the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, prays that the motion be denied for being <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span>; the petitioner merely advanced the same arguments which he raised in his appellant’s brief and motion for reconsideration before the CA.<br><br>After due consideration, we resolve to <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENY</span> the motion.<br><br>As a general rule, findings of fact of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive upon this Court; we will not normally disturb these factual findings unless they are palpably unsupported by the evidence on record or unless the judgment itself is based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> After a careful review of the records, we see no reason to overturn the lower courts’ factual findings that found the petitioner guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>Reckless imprudence, generally defined by our penal law, consists in voluntarily, but without malice, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place. Imprudence connotes a deficiency of action. It implies a failure in precaution or a failure to take the necessary precaution once the danger or peril becomes foreseen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, in order for conviction to be decreed for reckless imprudence, the material damage suffered by the victim, the failure in precaution on the part of the accused, and the direct link between material damage and failure in precaution must be established beyond reasonable doubt. We are morally convinced that all three were established in this case in accordance with the required level of evidence in criminal cases.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The petitioner was positively identified by an eyewitness</span><br><br>The fact of Rochelle Lanete’s death was stipulated during pre-trial, as well as duly established during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> What remain to be proven beyond reasonable doubt are the inexcusable lack in precaution on the part of the petitioner and the direct link of his negligence to the victim’s death.<br><br>An eyewitness account established that the petitioner’s vehicle actually hit Rochelle Lanete. Eyewitness identification is vital evidence, and, in most cases, decisive of the success or failure of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> One of the prosecution witnesses, Victor Soriano, unfortunately for the petitioner’s cause, saw the incident in its entirety; Victor thus provided direct evidence as eyewitness to the very act of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In his September 1, 1994 testimony, Victor <span style="font-weight: bold;">positively identified </span>the petitioner as the person who drove the car that ramped on an island divider along Governor Forbes corner G. Tuazon Street, and hit Rochelle.

He harps on the fact that Victor declared in his affidavit that the petitioner’s car first hit Rochelle before it ramped on an island divider; while he testified in court that the petitioner’s vehicle ramped on the island divider before hitting the victim.<br><br>We find these arguments unmeritorious.<br><br>Discrepancies and/or inconsistencies between a witness’ affidavit and testimony in open court do not impair credibility as affidavits are taken ex parte and are often incomplete or inaccurate for lack or absence of searching inquiries by the investigating officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> At any rate, Victor was able to sufficiently explain the discrepancies between his affidavit and court statements. Victor reasoned out that the secretary who typed his affidavit made a mistake; and explained that he signed the affidavit despite the inaccuracies in paragraph 2 because the secretary told him, “<span style="font-style: italic;">kasi ho magugulo ang naimakinilya na</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Accordingly, when Victor informed his lawyer during the first day of the hearing about the inaccuracy, the latter told him to state the truth regardless of what was written in his affidavit.<br><br>The general rule – that contradictions and discrepancies between the testimony of a witness and his statements in an affidavit do not necessarily discredit him – is not without exception, as when the omission in the affidavit refers to a very important detail of the incident that one relating the incident as an eyewitness would not be expected to fail to mention, or when the narration in the sworn statement substantially contradicts the testimony in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, we see no substantial contradiction in Victor’s affidavit and in his court statements as he declared in both that he saw the petitioner’s car ramp on the island divider and bump Rochelle. As to whether the car ramped on the center island before or after it bumped the victim does not detract from the fundamental fact that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Victor saw and identified the petitioner as the driver of the car that ramped on the island divider and hit Rochelle</span>. As earlier discussed, Victor sufficiently explained this inconsistency during the trial.<br><br>Victor, who stood only seven meters from the incident, clearly and in a straightforward manner described how the petitioner’s car had bumped the victim. We thus see no reason to overturn the lower courts’ finding regarding Victor’s credibility, more so since the petitioner <span style="font-style: italic;">did not impute any ill motive that could have induced Victor to testify falsely</span>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fundamental and settled rule is that the trial court's assessment regarding the credibility of witnesses is entitled to the highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal, especially when the assessment is affirmed by the CA.<br><br>The positive identification in this case, coupled with the failure of the defense to impute any ill-motive on the eyewitness, to our mind, works to dispel reasonable doubt on the fact that the petitioner’s car had in fact hit Rochelle. The eyewitness account provides the necessary link between the petitioner’s failure to exercise precaution in operating his vehicle and Rochelle Lanete’s death.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The petitioner failed to exercise precaution<br> in operating his vehicle</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>The right of a person using public streets and highways for travel in relation to other motorists is mutual, coordinate and reciprocal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He is bound to anticipate the presence of other persons whose rights on the street or highway are equal to his own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Although he is not an insurer against injury to persons or property, it is nevertheless his duty to operate his motor vehicle with due and reasonable care and caution under the circumstances for the safety of others as well as for his own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The petitioner repeatedly admitted that as he drove his vehicle on his way home from work on January 21, 1993, <span style="font-weight: bold;">he did not notice the island divider </span>at the foot of the Nagtahan Flyover.

We are not persuaded by the petitioner’s rather simplistic account that mere darkness, coupled with the traffic island’s alleged newness, caused his car to veer off the traffic trajectory of Governor Forbes Street and to end up jumping on top of the traffic island intended to channel vehicular traffic going to the Nagtahan Flyover.<br><br>A motorist is expected to exercise ordinary care and drive at a reasonable rate of speed commensurate with all the conditions encountered,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to enable him to keep the vehicle under control and, whenever necessary, <span style="font-weight: bold;">to put the vehicle to a full stop</span> to avoid injury to others using the highway.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It has not escaped our notice that the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> intersection</span> of Governor Forbes Street and G.

Tuazon Street intersection gives rise to the expectation that he would drive at a speed that anticipated — or would have anticipated — that other persons are on the road, whether as pedestrians or as motorists. The facts show, however, that the petitioner was driving his car at an inappropriate speed for a vehicle crossing an intersection. Otherwise, he should have been able to put his vehicle to a complete stop or, at the very least, at a speed that would have prevented his car from climbing entirely on top of the island divider.&nbsp; That the petitioner’s <span style="font-style: italic;">entire</span> vehicle landed on top of the traffic island — body, chassis, four wheels and all — sufficiently indicates his speed at that time. The force that propels an entire car off the street and on top of a traffic island could only have been inordinate speed, or at least speed beyond that of a motorist coming from or going to an intersection.&nbsp; In short, the ramping of his vehicle demonstrably indicates to us that the petitioner failed to observe the duty to maintain a reasonable speed.&nbsp; We therefore believe Victor’s testimony that the petitioner was speeding when he bumped the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>We are likewise not persuaded by the petitioner’s claim that darkness and the traffic island’s alleged newness justify his failure to notice the island.&nbsp; The petitioner’s admission that he did not notice the traffic island is in itself an indication of his failure to observe the vigilance demanded by the circumstances. Ultimately, it shows the criminal recklessness for which he has been convicted. The record shows that pedestrians were present in the vicinity at the time of the incident. The CA even pointed out that the vicinity is near residential areas, while we pointed out its proximity to an intersection. The darkness and these circumstances should have caused the petitioner to be more alert and more vigilant, to say nothing of slowing his car down. Newly constructed or not, the island divider should have received the petitioner’s due attention. His bare allegation that the island lacked markers or reflectorized marks is likewise not persuasive. As the trial court correctly observed, many other vehicles passed the same road that night but only the petitioner failed to notice the island divider.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We thus find the trial court to be correct when it held that the petitioner failed to exercise precaution in operating his vehicle on the night of the incident.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The location of the victim’s injuries vis-à-vis</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the position of the petitioner’s vehicle</span><br><br>The petitioner insists that his car could not have bumped the victim because his car was coming from the right side (i.e., from España), while the victim was hit on the left side of her body. He argues that if the victim was on her way to her house on Mabini Street coming from the corner of Governor Forbes Street and G. Tuazon Street (where she alighted), then the responsible vehicle could only have come from the left (i.e., from Nagtahan) as only those vehicles coming from this direction could hit the victim on the left side of her body. He further claims that his car had no dents or scratches.<br><br>The petitioner’s arguments are misleading.<br><br>Dr. Sergio Alteza, Jr., the attending physician, testified that the victim suffered multiple injuries “compatible and consistent with a vehicular accident.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He did not state that the injuries suffered by the victim were only on her left side. In fact, a perusal of Dr. Alteza’s initial medical report shows that the victim suffered injuries <span style="font-weight: bold;">both on the left and right sides of her body</span>. In addition, Dr. Floresto Arizala, Jr., the National Bureau of Investigation medico-legal officer who conducted an autopsy on Rochelle’s body, confirmed that the victim suffered injuries on various parts of her lower right and left extremities as a result of the initial or primary impact.<br><br>The petitioner relies heavily on Dr. Alteza’s statement allegedly declaring that the victim’s injuries on her lower left leg and left thigh were the “primary impact” injuries. However, this statement was not based on the actual incident but on Dr. Alteza’s presumptions.

He never declared that Rochelle suffered primary impact injuries on her lower left extremities. At any rate, it was not improbable for the victim to have been hit on the left side of her body as Victor testified that she (victim) tried to avoid the petitioner’s car, and was in fact facing the car when she was hit.<br><br>We likewise do not believe the petitioner’s claim that his vehicle was not involved in the incident due to the absence of dents or scratches. As the petitioner himself admitted, his vehicle was not subjected to any investigation after the incident. Moreover, the pictures of the car, presented by the petitioner in court, were taken long after the incident and after a repair had already been done to the vehicle. There was therefore no way of verifying petitioner’s claim that his car did not have any dent or scratch after the incident. At any rate, the absence of a dent or a scratch on the petitioner’s car, assuming it to be true, does not conclusively prove his non-participation in the incident. The absence of any dent or scratch is influenced by several factors: the type of paint, the speed of the car, the points of impact, and the material used on the car’s exteriors.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Weight of expert testimony</span><br><br>The petitioner likewise claims that the CA violated Section 49, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court when it disregarded the testimony of defense witness Police Senior Inspector Danilo Cornelio who testified that the petitioner’s car could not have bumped the victim because the latter’s body was not thrown in line with the car, but on its side. The petitioner argues that P/Sr. Insp. Cornelio is highly qualified in the field of traffic accident investigation, and as such, his statements are “backed-up by [the] principles of applied physics, engineering, and mathematics.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The petitioner’s arguments fail to convince us.<br><br>Section 49, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court states that the opinion of a witness on a matter requiring special knowledge, skill, experience or training, which he is shown to possess, <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> be received in evidence. The use of the word “may” signifies that the use of opinion of an expert witness is permissive and not mandatory on the part of the courts.&nbsp; Allowing the testimony does not mean, too, that courts are bound by the testimony of the expert witness.&nbsp; The testimony of an expert witness must be construed to have been presented not to sway the court in favor of any of the parties, but to assist the court in the determination of the issue before it, and is for the court to adopt or not to adopt depending on its appreciation of the attendant facts and the applicable law.&nbsp; It has been held of expert testimonies:<br><br><blockquote>Although courts are not ordinarily bound by expert testimonies, they may place whatever weight they may choose upon such testimonies in accordance with the facts of the case. The relative weight and sufficiency of expert testimony is peculiarly within the province of the trial court to decide, considering the ability and character of the witness, his actions upon the witness stand, the weight and process of the reasoning by which he has supported his opinion, his possible bias in favor of the side for whom he testifies, the fact that he is a paid witness, the relative opportunities for study and observation of the matters about which he testifies, and any other matters which deserve to illuminate his statements.&nbsp; The opinion of the expert may not be arbitrarily rejected; it is to be considered by the court in view of all the facts and circumstances in the case and when common knowledge utterly fails, the expert opinion may be given controlling effect.&nbsp; The problem of the credibility of the expert witness and the evaluation of his testimony is left to the discretion of the trial court whose ruling thereupon is not reviewable in the absence of abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>We emphasize that P/Sr. Insp. Cornelio was not an eyewitness to the incident; his testimony was merely based on the Traffic Accident Report prepared by SPO4 Edgar Reyes who himself did not witness the incident. At any rate, nowhere in P/Sr. Insp. Cornelio’s testimony did he <span style="font-style: italic;">conclusively </span>state that the petitioner could not have been involved in the incident.

We reiterate that the petitioner, aside from merely alleging the inconsistency between Victor’s affidavit and court testimony, did not impute any ill motive on Victor’s part to falsely testify against him. The petitioner, in fact, admitted that he and Victor did not know each other prior to the incident. We have consistently held that positive identification of the accused, when categorical and consistent, and without any showing of ill-motive on the part of the testifying eyewitness, should prevail over the denial of the accused whose testimony is not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> A denial is negative evidence.

He reiterated this claim in his motion for reconsideration before this Court. This assertion was a clear rip-off from his co-accused Mendez’ version who likewise claimed to have seen the same thing.&nbsp; To our mind, the modification of the petitioner’s story was a belated attempt to cover up his failure to convincingly explain the presence of the victim’s slumped body on the road near his car and a last-ditch effort to exculpate himself. Nowhere in his affidavit or earlier court testimonies, or even in his previous pleadings with the lower courts, did he ever state that a passing car had thrown a “rug-like thing”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> on the street. The petitioner’s sudden change of story at this stage of the proceedings casts doubt on the veracity of his claim.<br><br>In addition, we are baffled by the petitioner’s act of frequenting the hospital after the incident. Amanda Ycong, the victim’s aunt, testified that she saw the petitioner “several times” at the hospital when the victim was confined there; but would immediately leave whenever he saw members of the victim’s family. We find it highly unusual for a person who allegedly had no participation in the incident to be overly concerned with the victim’s well-being. What puzzles us even more is why the petitioner would evade members of the victim’s family whenever he was seen by them at the hospital.<br><br>All told, we see no reason to overturn the lower courts’ findings of fact and conclusions of law finding the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the Court resolves to <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENY</span> the motion with <span style="font-weight: bold;">FINALITY</span>, no substantial argument having been adduced to warrant the reconsideration sought.
