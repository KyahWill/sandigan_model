According to DELTA, it did not violate the terms of its license because it did not obtain a new mortgage over the subdivision project.&nbsp; It likewise assailed the award of moral and exemplary damages to Enriquez on the ground that the latter has no cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Board of Commissioners (Board)</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Board held that all developers should obtain a clearance for mortgage from the HLURB, regardless of the date when the mortgage was secured, because the law does not distinguish.

The BANK disagreed with the ruling upholding Enriquez's Contract to Sell; and insisted on its ownership over Lot 4.&nbsp; It argued that it has become impossible for DELTA to comply with the terms of the contract to sell and to deliver Lot 4's title to Enriquez given that DELTA had already relinquished all its rights to Lot 4 in favor of the BANK<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> via the dation in payment.<br><br>Meanwhile, Enriquez insisted that the Board erred in not applying the ceiling price as prescribed in BP 220.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Office of the President</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The OP adopted by reference the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the HLURB Decisions, which it affirmed <i>in toto. </i><br><br>Enriquez filed a motion for reconsideration, insisting that she was entitled to a reduction of the purchase price, in order to conform to the provisions of BP 220.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp;

As an alternative argument, in case the appellate court should find that DELTA retained ownership over Lot 4 and could convey the same to Enriquez, the BANK prayed that its REM over Lot 4 be respected such that DELTA would have to redeem it first before it could convey the same to Enriquez in accordance with Section 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of PD 957.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The BANK likewise sought an award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees in its favor because of the baseless suit filed by Enriquez against it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The CA ruled against the validity of the <i>dacion en pago</i> executed in favor of the BANK on the ground that DELTA had earlier <i>relinquished</i> its ownership over Lot 4 in favor of Enriquez via the Contract to Sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Since the <i>dacion en pago</i> is invalid with respect to Lot 4, the appellate court held that DELTA remained indebted to the BANK to the extent of Lot 4's value.&nbsp;

A contract to sell is one where the prospective seller <i>reserves </i>the transfer of title to the prospective buyer until the happening of an event, such as full payment of the purchase price.&nbsp; What the seller obliges himself to do is to sell the subject property only when the entire amount of the purchase price has already been delivered to him.&nbsp; "In other words, the full payment of the purchase price partakes of a suspensive condition, the non-fulfillment of which prevents the obligation to sell from arising and thus, ownership is retained by the prospective seller without further remedies by the prospective buyer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; It does not, by itself, transfer ownership to the buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, there is nothing in the provisions of the contract entered into by DELTA and Enriquez that would exempt it from the general definition of a contract to sell.&nbsp; The terms thereof provide for the reservation of DELTA's ownership until full payment of the purchase price; such that DELTA even reserved the right to unilaterally void the contract should Enriquez fail to pay three successive monthly amortizations.<br><br>Since the Contract to Sell did not transfer ownership of Lot 4 to Enriquez, said ownership remained with DELTA.&nbsp; DELTA could then validly transfer such ownership (as it did) to another person (the BANK).&nbsp; However, the transferee BANK is bound by the Contract to Sell and has to respect Enriquez's rights thereunder.&nbsp; This is because the Contract to Sell, involving a subdivision lot, is covered and protected by PD 957.&nbsp; One of the protections afforded by PD 957 to buyers such as Enriquez is the right to have her contract to sell registered with the Register of Deeds in order to make it binding on third parties.&nbsp; Thus, Section 17 of PD 957 provides:<br><blockquote><br>Section 17.&nbsp; <i>Registration.&nbsp; </i>All contracts to sell, deeds of sale, and other similar <i>instruments relative to the sale or conveyance of the subdivision lots and condominium units</i>, whether or not the purchase price is paid in full, shall be <i>registered by the seller in the Office of the Register of Deeds</i> of the province or city where the property is situated.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>The purpose of registration is to protect the buyers from any future unscrupulous transactions involving the object of the sale or contract to sell, whether the purchase price therefor has been fully paid or not.&nbsp; Registration of the sale or contract to sell makes it binding on third parties; it serves as a notice to the whole world that the property is subject to the prior right of the buyer of the property (under a contract to sell or an absolute sale), and anyone who wishes to deal with the said property will be held bound by such prior right.<br><br>While DELTA, in the instant case, failed to register Enriquez's Contract to Sell with the Register of Deeds, this failure will not prejudice Enriquez or relieve the BANK from its obligation to respect Enriquez's Contract to Sell.&nbsp; Despite the non-registration, the BANK cannot be considered, under the circumstances, an innocent purchaser for value of&nbsp; Lot 4 when it accepted the latter (together with other assigned properties) as payment for DELTA's obligation.&nbsp; The BANK was well aware that the assigned properties, including Lot 4, were subdivision lots and therefore within the purview of PD 957.&nbsp; It knew that the loaned amounts were to be used for the development of DELTA's subdivision project, for this was indicated in the corresponding promissory notes. The technical description of Lot 4 indicates its location, which can easily be determined as included within the subdivision development.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the BANK knew or should have known of the possibility and risk that the assigned properties were already covered by existing contracts to sell in favor of subdivision lot buyers.&nbsp; As observed by the Court in another case involving a bank regarding a subdivision lot that was already subject of a contract to sell with a third party:<br><br><blockquote>[The Bank] should have considered that it was dealing with a property subject of a real estate development project. A reasonable person, particularly a financial institution x x x, should have been aware that, to finance the project, funds other than those obtained from the loan could have been used to serve the purpose, albeit partially. Hence, there was a need to verify whether any part of the property was already intended to be the subject of any other contract involving buyers or potential buyers. In granting the loan, [the Bank] should not have been content merely with a clean title, considering the presence of circumstances indicating the need for a thorough investigation of the existence of buyers x x x.

As noted earlier, the BANK knew that the assigned properties were subdivision lots and covered by PD 957.&nbsp; It was aware of the nature of DELTA's business, of the location of the assigned properties within DELTA's subdivision development, and the possibility that some of the properties may be subjects of existing contracts to sell which enjoy protection under PD 957.&nbsp; Banks dealing with subdivision properties are expected to conduct a thorough due diligence review to discover the status of the properties they deal with.&nbsp; It may thus be said that the BANK, in accepting the assigned properties as full payment of DELTA's "total obligation," has assumed the risk that some of the assigned properties (such as Lot 4) are covered by contracts to sell which it is bound to honor under PD 957.<br><br>A <i>dacion en pago</i> is governed by the law of sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; Contracts of sale come with warranties, either express (if explicitly stipulated by the parties) or implied (under Article 1547 <i>et seq</i>. of the Civil Code).&nbsp; In this case, however, the BANK does not even point to any breach of warranty by DELTA in connection with the Dation in Payment.&nbsp; To be sure, the Dation in Payment has <i>no express warranties</i> relating to existing contracts to sell over the assigned properties.&nbsp; As to the <i>implied warranty</i> in case of eviction, it is waivable<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and cannot be invoked if the buyer knew of the risks or danger of eviction and assumed its consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; As we have noted earlier, the BANK, in accepting the assigned properties as full payment of DELTA's "total obligation," has assumed the risk that some of the assigned properties are covered by contracts to sell which must be honored under PD 957.<br><br><b><i>Award of damages</i></b><br><br>There is nothing on record that warrants the award of exemplary damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> as well as attorney's fees<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> in favor of the BANK.<br><br><b><i>Balance to be paid by Enriquez</i></b><br><br>As already mentioned, the Contract to Sell in favor of Enriquez must be respected by the BANK.&nbsp; Upon Enriquez's full payment of the balance of the purchase price, the BANK is bound to deliver the title over Lot 4 to her.&nbsp; As to the amount of the balance which Enriquez must pay, we adopt the OP's ruling thereon which sustained the amount stipulated in the Contract to Sell.&nbsp; We will not review Enriquez's initial claims about the supposed violation of the price ceiling in BP 220, since this issue was no longer pursued by the parties, not even by Enriquez, who chose not to file the required pleadings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> before the Court.&nbsp; The parties were informed in the Court's September 5, 2007 Resolution that issues that are not included in their memoranda shall be deemed waived or abandoned.&nbsp; Since Enriquez did not file a memorandum in either petition, she is deemed to have waived the said issue.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appealed November 30, 2004 Decision of the Court of Appeals, as well as its June 22, 2005 Resolution in CA-G.R.
