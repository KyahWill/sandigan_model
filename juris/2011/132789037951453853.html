These workers filed their complaints in December 2002 and January 2003 or more than four years from the expiration of Weesan's contractual arrangement with Fairland in 1997.&nbsp; Article 291 of the Labor Code provides that all money claims arising from employer-employee relationship shall be filed within three years from the time the cause of action accrued; otherwise, they shall be forever barred. Illegal dismissal prescribes in four years and damages due to separation from employment for alleged unjustifiable causes injuring a plaintiff's right must likewise be brought within four years under the Civil Code.&nbsp; Clearly, the claims of said six employees are already barred by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In G.R.

<b>However, there is no competent proof it paid the supposed rentals to said `owner'</b>. <b> Curiously, under the item `Rent Expenses' in its audited financial statement, only equipment rental was listed therein without any disbursement/expense for rental of factory premises</b>, which only buttressed the claim of private respondents that the place where they reported to and performed sewing jobs for petitioner [Susan] and Fairland at No. 715 Ricafort St., Tondo, Manila, belonged to Fairland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Susan contests this pronouncement by pointing out that although only sewing machines were specified under the entry "Rent Expenses" in its financial statement, the rent for the factory premises is already deemed included therein since the contracts of lease she entered into with De Luxe referred to both the factory premises and machineries.<br><br>We, however, find this contention implausible.<br><br>We went over the said contracts of lease and noted that same were principally for the lease of the premises in 715 Ricafort St., Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; Only incidental thereto is the inclusion therein of the equipment found in said premises.&nbsp; Hence, we cannot see why the rentals for the work premises, for which Susan even went to the extent of executing a contract with the purported lessor, was not included in the entry for rent expenses in Weesan's financial statement.&nbsp; Even if we are to concede to Susan's claim that the entry for rent expenses already includes the rentals for the work premises, we wonder why the rental expenses for the year 2000 which was P396,000.00 is of the same amount with the rental expenses for the year 2001.&nbsp; As borne out by the Contract of Lease covering the period August 1, 1997 to July 31, 2000, the monthly rent for the work premises was pegged at P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp;

This could only mean that said entry really only refers to the rentals of sewing machines and does not include the rentals for the work premises.&nbsp; Moreover, we note that Susan could have just simply submitted receipts for her payments of rentals to De Luxe.&nbsp; However, she failed to present even a single receipt evidencing such payment.<br><br>In an attempt to prove that it is De Luxe and not Fairland which owned the work premises, Susan attached to her petition the following: (1) a plain copy of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 139790<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and Declaration of Real Property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> both under the name of De Luxe;

Although in said Declaration, 715 Ricafort St., Tondo is the indicated address of the declarant (De Luxe), the address of the property declared is merely "<i>Ricafort, Tondo I-A</i>".&nbsp; The same thing can also be said with regard to the real property tax receipts.&nbsp; The entry under the box <i>Location of Property</i> in the receipt for 2001 is "I - 718 Ricafort" and in the receipts for 2002, 2003, and 2004, the entries are either "I - Ricafort St., Tondo" or merely "I-Ricafort St."<br><br>In sum, the Court finds that Susan's effort to negate Fairland's ownership of the work premises is futile.&nbsp; The logical conclusion now is that Weesan does not have its own workplace and is only utilizing the workplace of Fairland to whom it supplied workers for its garment business.<br><br>Suffice it to say that "[t]he presumption is that a contractor is a labor-only contractor unless such contractor overcomes the burden of proving that it has substantial capital, investment, tools and the like."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As Susan/Weesan was not able to adduce evidence that Weesan had any substantial capital, investment or assets to perform the work contracted for, the presumption that Weesan is a labor-only contractor stands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><i>The National Labor Relations Commission <br>and the Court of Appeals did not err in their<br> findings of illegal dismissal.</i><br><br>To negate illegal dismissal, Susan relies on the due closure of Weesan pursuant to the Establishment Termination Report it submitted to the DOLE-NCR.<br><br>Indeed, Article 283<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of the Labor Code allows as a mode of termination of employment the closure or termination of business.

Also hard to ignore is the absence of the mandatory 30-day prior notice to the workers.<br><br>Hence, the Court finds that Susan failed to prove that the suspension of operations of Weesan was <i>bona fide</i> and that it complied with the mandatory requirement of notice under the law.&nbsp; Susan likewise failed to discharge her burden of proving that the termination of the workers was for a lawful cause. Therefore, the NLRC and the CA, in CA-G.R.

Moreover, non-compliance with the Rules results in the denial of the right to due process for the heirs who, though not duly notified of the proceedings, would be substantially affected by the decision rendered therein. Thus, it is only when there is a denial of due process, as when the deceased is not represented by any legal representative or heir, that the court nullifies the trial proceedings and the resulting judgment therein.<br></blockquote><br>Here, the lack of formal substitution of the deceased worker Richon did not result to denial of due process as to affect the validity of the proceedings before the NLRC since his heir, Luzvilla, was aware of the proceedings therein.&nbsp; In fact, she is considered to have voluntarily appeared before the said tribunal when she signed the workers' Memorandum of Appeal filed therewith.

Geronimo to prove his authority under said provision since there was no motion to that effect from either party showing reasonable grounds therefor.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that Debbie signed the verification attached to the position paper filed by Atty. Geronimo, without a secretary's certificate or board resolution attached thereto, is not sufficient reason for the Labor Arbiter to be on his guard and require Atty. Geronimo to prove his authority.&nbsp; Debbie, as General Manager of Fairland is one of the officials of the company who can sign the verification without need of a board resolution because as&nbsp; such, she is&nbsp; in&nbsp; a position to verify the truthfulness and correctness of the allegations in the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>Although we note that Fairland filed a disbarment case against Atty. Geronimo due to the former's claim of unauthorized appearance, we hold that same is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of authority.&nbsp; Such mere filing is not proof of Atty. Geronimo's alleged unauthorized appearance.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that an attorney's presumption of authority is a strong one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>&nbsp; "A mere denial by a party that he authorized an attorney to appear for him, in the absence of a compelling reason, is insufficient to overcome the presumption, especially when the denial comes after the rendition of an adverse judgment,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> such as in the present case.<br><br>Citing <i>PNOC Dockyard and Engineering Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> the CA likewise emphasized that in labor cases, both the party and his counsel must be duly served their separate copies of the order, decision or resolution unlike in ordinary proceedings where notice to counsel is deemed notice to the party.&nbsp; It then quoted Article 224 of the Labor Code as follows:<br><br><blockquote>ARTICLE 224. <i>Execution of decisions, orders or awards</i>. - (a) the Secretary of Labor and Employment or any Regional Director, the Commission or any Labor Arbiter, or med-arbiter or voluntary arbitrator may, motu proprio or on motion of any interested party, issue a writ of execution on a judgment within five (5) years from the date it becomes final and executory, requiring a sheriff or a duly deputized officer to execute or enforce final decisions, orders or awards of the Secretary of Labor and Employment or [R]egional Director, the Commission, the Labor Arbiter or Med-Arbiter, or Voluntary Arbitrators. In any case, it shall be the duty of the responsible officer to <b>separately furnish immediately the counsels of record and the parties with copies of said decision, orders or awards.&nbsp; </b>Failure to comply with the duty prescribed herein shall subject such responsible officer to appropriate administrative sanctions x x x&nbsp; (Emphasis in the original).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA then concluded that since Fairland and its counsel were not separately furnished with a copy of the August 26, 2005 NLRC Resolution denying the motions for reconsideration of its November 30, 2004 Decision, said Decision cannot be enforced against Fairland.&nbsp; The CA likewise concluded that because of this, said November 30, 2004 Decision which held Susan/Weesan and Fairland solidarily liable to the workers, has not attained finality.<br><br>We cannot agree.&nbsp; In <i>Ginete v. Sunrise Manning Agency</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> we held that:<br><br><blockquote>The case of PNOC Dockyard and Engineering Corporation vs. NLRC cited by petitioner enunciated that `in labor cases, <i>both </i>the party and its counsel must be duly served their separate copies of the order, decision or resolution; unlike in ordinary judicial proceedings where notice to counsel is deemed notice to the party.' Reference was made therein to Article 224 of the Labor Code. But, as correctly pointed out by private respondent in its Comment to the petition, Article 224 of the Labor Code does not govern the procedure for filing a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals from the decision of the NLRC but rather, it refers to the execution of `final decisions, orders or awards' and requires the sheriff or a duly deputized officer to furnish both the parties and their counsel with copies of the decision or award for that purpose. There is no reference, express or implied, to the period to appeal or to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> as indeed the caption is `execution of decisions, orders or awards'. Taken in proper context, Article 224 contemplates the furnishing of copies of `final decisions, orders or awards' and could not have been intended to refer to the period for computing the period for appeal to the Court of Appeals from a non-final judgment or order. The period or manner of `appeal' from the NLRC to the Court of Appeals is governed by Rule 65 pursuant to the ruling of the Court in the case of St. Martin Funeral Homes vs. NLRC. Section 4 of Rule 65, as amended, states that the `petition may be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, or resolution sought to be assailed'.<br><br>Corollarily, Section 4, Rule III of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC expressly mandates that `(F)or the purposes of computing the period of appeal, the same shall be counted from receipt of such decisions, awards or orders by the counsel of record.' Although this rule explicitly contemplates an appeal before the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, we do not see any cogent reason why the same rule should not apply to petitions for certiorari filed with the Court of Appeals from decisions of the NLRC. <b>This procedure is in line with the established rule that notice to counsel is notice to party and when a party is represented by counsel, notices should be made upon the counsel of record at his given address to which notices of all kinds emanating from the court should be sent. It is to be noted also that Section 7 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure provides that `(A)ttorneys and other representatives of parties shall have authority to bind their clients in all matters of procedure'' a provision which is similar to Section 23, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court. More importantly, Section 2, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure analogously provides that if any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel.</b> (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>To stress, Article 224 contemplates the furnishing of copies of final decisions, orders or awards <i>both</i> to the parties and their counsel in connection with the execution of such final decisions, orders or awards.&nbsp; However, for the purpose of computing the period for filing an appeal from the NLRC to the CA, same shall be counted from receipt of the decision, order or award by the counsel of record pursuant to the established rule that notice to counsel is notice to party. And since the period for filing of an appeal is reckoned from the counsel's receipt of the decision, order or award, it necessarily follows that the reckoning period for their finality is likewise the counsel's date of receipt thereof, if a party is represented by counsel.&nbsp; Hence, the date of receipt referred to in Sec. 14, Rule VII of the then in force New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> which provides that decisions, resolutions or orders of the NLRC shall become executory <i>after 10 calendar days from receipt of the same</i>, refers to the date of receipt by counsel.&nbsp; Thus contrary to the CA's conclusion, the said NLRC Decision became final, as to Fairland, 10 calendar days after Atty. Tecson's receipt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup>&nbsp; In sum, we hold that the Labor Arbiter had validly acquired jurisdiction over Fairland and its manager, Debbie, through the appearance of Atty. Geronimo as their counsel and likewise, through the latter's filing of pleadings on their behalf.<br><br><i>Fairland is Weesan's principal.</i><br><br>In addition to our discussion in G.R. No. 189658 with respect to the finding that Susan/Weesan is a mere labor-only contractor which we find to be likewise significant here, a careful examination of the records reveals other telling facts that Fairland is Susan/Weesan's principal, to wit: (1) aside from sewing machines, Fairland also lent Weesan other equipment such as fire extinguishers, office tables and chairs, and plastic chairs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (2) no proof evidencing the contractual arrangement between Weesan and Fairland was ever submitted by Fairland; (3) while both Weesan and Fairland assert that the former had other clients aside from the latter, no proof of Weesan's contractual relationship with its other alleged client is extant on the records; and (4) there is no showing that any of the workers were assigned to other clients aside from Fairland. Moreover, as found by the NLRC and affirmed by both the Special Former Special Eighth Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 93860 and the First Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 93204, the activities, the manner of work and the movement of the workers were subject to Fairland's control. It bears emphasizing that "factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the NLRC, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, as in the present case, are conclusive upon the parties and binding on this Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Viewed in its entirety, we thus declare that Fairland is the principal of the labor-only contractor, Weesan.<br><br>Fairland, therefore, as the principal employer, is solidarily liable with Susan/Weesan, the labor-only contractor, for the rightful claims of the employees. Under this set-up, Susan/Weesan, as the "labor-only" contractor, is deemed an agent of the principal, Fairland, and the law makes the principal responsible to the employees of the "labor-only" contractor as if the principal itself directly hired or employed the employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court,<br><br>1) in G.R.
