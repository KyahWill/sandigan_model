Nazario Street, <i>Barangay</i> Singkamas, Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Aure was reportedly armed with a handgun and was using his car in his illegal transactions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon being apprised of the ongoing drug peddling, the Chief of the Drug Enforcement Unit of the Makati City Police Station immediately created a group of officers which would conduct a buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Composing this team was PO3 Lagasca, as the team leader, with operatives from both the police station's Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Force (AIDSOTF) and MADAC's Clusters 2 and 3 as members.<br><br>When a briefing was conducted, MADAC operative Bilason was assigned as the poseur-buyer to be provided with 12 marked five hundred peso (PhP 500) bills, amounting to six thousand pesos (PhP 6,000).<br><br>After marking the 12 PhP 500 bills, the team, with the informant, went to the place where Aure was reported to be conducting his trade.&nbsp; When they reached a point along Primo Rivera Street, about 30 meters away from F. Nazario Street, they alighted from their vehicles.&nbsp; MADAC operative Bilason and the informant walked towards F. Nazario Street, while the rest of the team members followed them.<br><br>Thereafter, when Bilason and the informant saw Aure and a certain "Buboy," who turned out to be Austriaco, seating inside a car parked along F. Nazario Street, they approached the latter.&nbsp; In the meantime, the other team members strategically positioned themselves within the area to monitor the transaction.<br><br>Bilason was introduced by the informant as a buyer of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; Aure initially expressed his apprehension that Bilason could be an operative. Nevertheless, when the informant assured him that Bilason is his friend from the province, Aure asked Bilason how much he needed.&nbsp; To this, Bilason replied "<i>Isang bolto, pare</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which meant six thousand pesos (PhP 6,000) worth of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; When demanded by Aure, Bilason handed the previously marked money to him. The latter then placed the marked money inside his right front pocket.<br><br>Afterwards, Aure secured from Austriaco a small brown bag and a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance, suspected as <i>shabu</i>, taken from the same bag.&nbsp; Aure then handed over the same plastic sachet with its contents to Bilason.<br><br>After ascertaining that what Aure gave him was <i>shabu</i>, Bilason lighted his cigarette to signal to his team members that the transaction with Aure was already consummated.&nbsp; Immediately, PO3 Lagasca and MADAC operative Flores closed in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; After introducing themselves as AIDSOTF and MADAC operatives, Bilason and his team members placed Aure and Austriaco under arrest, and ordered them to get out of the car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Bilason seized the small brown bag from Aure.&nbsp; When inspected, said bag yielded another plastic sachet containing substantial amount of suspected <i>shabu</i> wrapped in red wrapping paper, empty plastic sachets, and glass pipe tooter.&nbsp; Also seized was a .45 caliber pistol with one magazine and five live bullets found inside the car near the place where Aure was seated.&nbsp; Flores also recovered the marked money from Aure.&nbsp; The recovered items were marked by Bilason in the presence of Aure and Austriaco.&nbsp; PO3 Lagasca likewise explained to the two suspects the cause of their arrest and apprised them of their constitutional rights.<br><br>Eventually, Aure and Austriaco were brought to the AIDSOTF office.&nbsp; The examinations conducted by the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory on the plastic sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i> and the glass pipe tooter yielded positive results for Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; This was indicated in Chemistry Report No. D-1068-03<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> issued by Police Inspector Alejandro C. de Guzman.<br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></center><br>Aure and Austriaco interposed the defense of denial.<br><br>Aure testified that on August 26, 2003, at around 8:00 in the evening, he fetched Austriaco in Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The latter was referred to him by his <i>compadre</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to repair the cabinet in the house he intended to lease on F.

They proceeded to the said house in Makati City on board Aure's Toyota Celica.<br><br>At around 8:30 in the evening, while Austriaco was estimating the cost of materials to be used for the repair of the cabinet, Aure heard knocks on the door.&nbsp; When he opened the door, he saw 10 men in civilian clothes who immediately grabbed him and made him lie face down for about three minutes.<br><br>This group of men allegedly began to search the house and seized the money amounting to PhP 200,000 which Aure intended to use for purchasing a taxi cab, among other things.&nbsp; During this time, Austriaco was standing beside the cabinet near the lavatory when someone ordered, "<i>Kunin niyo na rin yung isa</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Aure was handcuffed and was subsequently brought to the office of the Drug Enforcement Unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; After about five to 10 minutes, he saw Austriaco, who was also handcuffed, being brought inside the said office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Aure further testified that a plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> was shown to him, and when he denied that the item came from him despite the arresting men's insistence that this was in his possession, he was punched by a police officer.&nbsp; He also averred that a certain Rogelio Flores tried to extort money from him.&nbsp; His wallet and license were allegedly taken from him by the persons who arrested him.<br><br>For his part, Austriaco recounted that in the evening of August 26, 2003, he was fetched by a certain Benjamin Zaide from his house in Pasay City to repair the cabinet of Aure.&nbsp; Together, they proceeded to the house of Benjamin Zaide, also in Pasay City, where Aure was waiting.&nbsp; Thereafter, they proceeded to Aure's house in Makati City.<br><br>Upon arriving at Aure's house, Austriaco immediately attended to the cabinet he was supposed to repair.&nbsp; A few minutes later, he heard some noise coming from the direction of the stairs of the house.&nbsp; Nonetheless, he went on with his work and just focused his attention on the cabinet he was estimating.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Austriaco further narrated that when Aure opened the door, he saw several men wearing civilian clothes enter the house and forcibly grab Aure.&nbsp; The latter stumbled and fell to the floor with his face down.&nbsp; The group of men began to search the house.&nbsp; Eventually, Austriaco saw Aure being brought outside of Aure's house.&nbsp; After two to three minutes, he was also taken out of the house and was brought to the Criminal Investigation Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted Aure and Austriaco.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing judgment is rendered as follows:<br><br>1.

It ruled that all the elements necessary to establish the fact of sale or delivery of illegal drugs were aptly established by the prosecution, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In the present controversy, the elements of the crimes charged were amply proven not only by the categorical and materially consistent declarations of the poseur-buyer and two other members of the buy-bust team, but also by laboratory examinations of the substance seized, drug test of one of the accused-appellants, affidavits, marked bills, and other reports which were all submitted in court. Taken collectively, these pieces of evidence bear out that the accused-appellants indeed sold a packet of white crystalline substance to MADAC operative and poseur-buyer Norman Bilason in exchange for P6,000 and that the substance seized eventually tested positive for shabu. In the prosecution of the offense of illegal sale of prohibited drugs, what is essential is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place coupled with the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>The CA held also that in the absence of proof to suggest that the arresting officers were moved by improper motives, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, as well as the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, shall prevail over the self-serving claim of having been framed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Further, the appellate court ruled that the statutory burden of guilt beyond reasonable doubt was ably discharged by the prosecution.&nbsp; After all, it ratiocinated that "proof beyond reasonable doubt" does not necessarily contemplate "absolute certainty" but that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of the foregoing discussion, the present appeal is hereby <b><i>DISMISSED</i></b>.

II of RA 9165 against accused-appellant Aure, We also find that the elements of the offense have been established by the evidence of the prosecution.<br><br>The elements necessary for the prosecution of illegal possession of dangerous drugs are: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, a brown bag was found inside the car of accused-appellant Aure.&nbsp; It yielded a plastic sachet of <i>shabu</i> weighing 86.23 grams wrapped in red wrapping paper, small plastic sachets, and an improvised plastic tooter.&nbsp; Considering that during the sale to Bilason, it was from the same bag that accused-appellant Austriaco took the sachet of <i>shabu</i>, per order of accused-appellant Aure, the owner-possessor of said bag and its contents is no other than accused-appellant Aure, who has not shown any proof that he was duly authorized by law to possess them or any evidence to rebut his <i>animus possidendi</i> of the <i>shabu</i> found in his car during the buy-bust operation.<br><br><b>Defense of denial is inherently weak</b><br><br>The sachet containing the dangerous drug was positively identified by MADAC operative Bilason during the trial as the very sachet with white crystalline substance sold and delivered to him by accused-appellants.
