The informant reported to the SAID Chief, Chief Superintendent Nilo Wong (C/Supt. Wong), the illegal drug activities of alias "Jack" and "Junior Laurel."&nbsp; Accordingly, a buy-bust team was formed composed of C/Supt. Wong, Senior Police Officer Mario Concepcion, PO2 Paculdar, PO2 Noel Magcalayo, PO2 Andy Salonga (PO2 Salonga), PO2 Cesar Collado, PO1 Estrelles, PO1 Bucatcat, and PO2 Collado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, a Pre-Operation Report was made.<br><br>The team proceeded to J.P. Laurel St., T.S.

PO2 Collado gave the PhP 200 to Pambid, and after the latter received the money, PO2 Collado executed the pre-arranged signal by scratching his head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>PO2 Collado introduced himself to Pambid as a policeman, recovered another plastic sachet from her left hand, and arrested her.&nbsp; They then brought her to the station.&nbsp; At the station, PO2 Collado turned over the money and the plastic sachets to the investigator, PO1 Estrelles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; A request for laboratory examination was then prepared and the plastic sachets were sent to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, Central Police District Crime Laboratory Office in Doña Aurora Building, EDSA, Kamuning, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Subsequently, P/Insp.

Wong, PO2 Salonga and others because they eat in the <i>carinderia</i> or foodhouse in their area.&nbsp; They searched her house for about 20 minutes but found nothing.&nbsp; At which point, PO2 Paculdar pulled her out of the house while she was carrying her child and brought her to their vehicle.&nbsp; PO2 Collado asked her if she had any money to which she replied that she had money only for milk and diapers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; PO2 Collado took the money amounting to PhP 1,200. He stapled the two PhP 100 bills on a bond paper and pocketed the rest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Afterwards, she was brought to the office of C/Supt. Wong while her child was sent home by PO2 Collado.&nbsp; She was then detained and later presented on inquest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The testimony of Parama is corroborative of the story of Pambid.&nbsp; Parama stated that on September 18, 2003 at exactly 5:30 p.m. in the afternoon, she was with Pambid, her son and her sister, Baby San Jose, at 23 J.P. Laurel, T.S. Cruz Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City.&nbsp; After conversing, Pambid went to her house and prepared milk for her son when policemen in civilian clothes entered the house and insisted to get the <i>shabu</i> which Pambid allegedly sells.&nbsp; The policemen then brought Pambid outside whereupon Pambid asked Parama to follow her to the precinct but she was unable to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Likewise, San Jose testified that on September 18, 2003, at about 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon, she was alone at home when she saw several men alight from a vehicle, a Ford Fierra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The men proceeded to the house of her aunt, Flor San Jose, and started to search for something.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; When they went out of the house, Pambid was already handcuffed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; She followed Pambid to the headquarters in Novaliches, Quezon City.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC, on February 19, 2008, found Pambid guilty of the charges.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Re: Criminal Case No. Q-03-121145, the Court finds accused <b>JACQUILINE PAMBID y CORTEZ guilty </b>beyond reasonable doubt of a violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A.

Accordingly, she is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P500,000.00) PESOS.<br><br>b) Re: Criminal Case No. Q-03-121146, the same accused is likewise found <b>guilty</b> beyond reasonable doubt of a Violation of Section 11, Article II of the same Act, and accordingly hereby sentences her to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY as Minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS as Maximum and to pay a fine in the amount of THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND (P300,000.00) PESOS.<br><br></div>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On appeal to the CA, Pambid disputed the trial court's decision finding her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the violations.&nbsp; She argued that the RTC erred in admitting the seized dangerous drugs as evidence, considering that no proper inventory was taken of the seized drugs and that there was a break in the chain of custody of the evidence. Further, she contended that the police officers failed to read her rights to her as mandated by the Constitution.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On November 27, 2009, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the foregoing considered, the appeal is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision of the RTC dated February 19, 2008 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Accused-appellant Pambid timely filed a notice of appeal from the decision of the CA.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Accused-appellant assigns the following errors in her Brief:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>The trial court gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant despite the non-compliance with the requirements for the proper custody of seized dangerous drugs as provided under R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The trial court gravely erred in giving full weight and credence to the prosecution's evidence notwithstanding its failure to prove the integrity and identity of the shabu allegedly seized.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The trial court gravely erred in convicting the accused-appellant based solely on PO2 Michael Collado's testimony.</blockquote><br>In addition, she assigns the following errors in her Supplemental Brief:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals committed a reversible error in convicting the accused-appellant despite non-compliance with the requirements for the proper custody of seized dangerous drugs under R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals gravely erred in giving full weight and credence to the prosecution's evidence notwithstanding its failure to prove the integrity of the seized drug.</blockquote><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>Essentially, accused-appellant pegs almost all of her arguments on the fact that the police officers failed to properly mark, inventory, and photograph the prohibited items allegedly seized from her.&nbsp; She argues that as a result of this failure, there is doubt as to the identity and integrity of the drugs and that there was a break in the chain of custody of the evidence.<br><br>Such argument cannot prosper.<br><br>The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 21. <b><i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i>--</b>The PDEA shall take<b> </b>charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; <b><i>Provided</i>, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted</b> <b>at the place where the search warrant is served; or</b> <b><u>at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures</u></b><u>; <b><i>Provided, further,</i> that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</b></u><b></b> x x x.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Evidently, the law itself lays down exceptions to its requirements. Thus, non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirements is not fatal. In fact, it has been ruled time and again that non-compliance with Sec. 21 of the IRR does not make the items seized inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> What is imperative is "the preservation of the integrity and the evidential value of the seized items as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the chain of custody can be easily established through the following link: (1) PO2 Collado marked the seized sachets subject of the buy-bust with "MBC," his own initials; (2) a request for laboratory examination of the seized items marked "MBC" was signed by C/Supt. Wong;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (3) the request and the marked items seized were received by the PNP Crime Laboratory; (4) Chemistry Report No. D-1007-03 confirmed that the marked items seized from accused-appellant were methylamphetamine hydrochloride;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and (5) the marked items were offered in evidence as Exhibits "B-1" and "B-2."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Hence, it is clear that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized drugs were preserved.&nbsp; This Court, therefore, finds no reason to overturn the findings of the trial court that the drugs seized from accused-appellant were the same ones presented during trial.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is but logical to conclude that the chain of custody of the illicit drugs seized from accused-appellant remains unbroken, contrary to the assertions of accused-appellant.<br><br>Lastly, accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in convicting her based on the sole testimony of PO2 Collado. We disagree.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that "the testimony of a lone prosecution witness, as long as positive and clear and not a result of improper motive to impute a serious offense against the accused, deserves full faith and credit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Here, PO2 Collado was able to clearly and directly narrate the circumstances of the buy-bust operation conducted against accused-appellant which subsequently led to her arrest.&nbsp; Further, no ill motive was proved by the defense on the part of PO2 Collado and the rest of the police officers to falsely impute such a serious crime against her.&nbsp; As such, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty must prevail.<br><br>What is more, "the factual findings of the trial court, when adopted and confirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive on this Court and will generally not be reviewed on appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As aptly held in <i>People v. Obina</i>,<i> </i>"In criminal cases, the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose conclusion thereon deserves much weight and respect, because the judge has the direct opportunity to observe them on the stand and ascertain if they are telling the truth or not."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Hence, We see no reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court.<br><br>Essentially, all the elements of the crime of illegal sale of drugs have been sufficiently established, i.e.,<i> </i>(1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; What is material is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place.&nbsp; The delivery of the <b>illicit</b> drug to the <b>poseur-buyer</b> and the receipt by the seller of the marked money successfully consummate the buy-bust transaction.<br><br>In this case, the prosecution was able to establish these elements beyond moral certainty.&nbsp; Accused-appellant sold the <i>shabu</i> for PhP 200 to PO2 Collado posing as buyer; the said drug was seized and identified as a prohibited drug and subsequently presented in evidence; there was actual exchange of the marked money and contraband; and finally, accused-appellant was fully aware that she was selling and delivering a prohibited drug.&nbsp; This was clearly shown in the testimony of PO2 Collado, viz:<br><br><blockquote>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened when you reported for duty on that date, Mr. Witness?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing, sir.

PO2 Michael Collado, the poseur buyer, identified accused herein as the seller and particularly described the transaction entered into by and between him and her specifically the exchange of the buy bust money and the plastic sachet subject thereof. In fine, accused was identified as the offender, and the dangerous drugs sold by her [were] presented by the Court. Indubitable, therefore, is the presence of the elements of the offense enumerated by jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>Likewise, the prosecution has established all the elements of the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs in the same testimony of PO2 Collado.&nbsp; The elements are: (1) that the accused is in possession of the object identified as a prohibited or regulatory drug; (2) that such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) that the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>According to the testimony of PO2 Collado, accused-appellant was caught in actual possession of the prohibited drug without showing any proof that she was duly authorized by law to possess it.&nbsp; Having been caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of <i>animus possidendi</i> on accused-appellant's part.&nbsp; As held by this Court in <i>U.S. v.
