In the "Contract," Derla stated that Hipolito owned one-half of the fishpond area, and that it was only for convenience that the permit was issued in Derla's name.&nbsp; The "Contract" also stated that Hipolito had been bearing all the expenses in relation to the fishpond area, subject to reimbursement once it became productive. Derla and Hipolito also stipulated therein that they could not alienate or transfer their rights to the fishpond area without the consent of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; On October 8, 1953, Derla executed a document captioned as "Transfer of Rights in Fishpond Permit" wherein he transferred all his rights in the fishpond area to Hipolito for Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Executed together with this document was Hipolito's own affidavit/promissory note wherein he stated that he agreed to buy his co-owner Derla's one-half undivided share for the initial amount of Four Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P4,500.00) plus Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) as rental for the year 1952.&nbsp; Hipolito also promised to pay another Four Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P4,500.00) once the conflict<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> regarding the subject fishpond area has been settled and arranged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On January 19, 1954, Hipolito filed Fishpond Application No. 11071 over the 20.5-hectare fishpond area (later reduced to 16.4 hectares due to the construction of the Biyawa Road at Panabo del Norte)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> covered by Derla's permit.&nbsp; This was approved on August 10, 1956 under Ordinary Fishpond Permit (Transfer) No. F-3054-L (Hipolito's fishpond area).<br><br>On October 15, 1960, Derla filed his own Fishpond Application No. 21335 over a 7.5-hectare fishpond area adjoining Hipolito's fishpond area.&nbsp; On November 21, 1960, Hipolito charged Derla with Qualified Theft before the then Justice of the Peace Court of Panabo for gathering and carrying away fish from Hipolito's fishpond.&nbsp; Derla, in his defense, claimed that he was still part-owner of the fishpond when he harvested the fish.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; On the strength of the "Transfer of Rights in Fishpond Permit" and Hipolito's Affidavit that he and Derla are co-owners of the fishpond and that he promised to pay Derla after the settlement of the fishpond boundary conflict, the court acquitted Derla on November 29, 1960.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 1962, the Director of Fisheries approved Derla's fishpond application.&nbsp; On November 6, 1967, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (SANR), upon Hipolito's appeal, set aside the Director of Fisheries' order and declared that the 7.5-hectare fishpond area Derla applied for was included in the the area covered by Hipolito's Fishpond Permit No. F-3054-L.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On December 5, 1967, Derla filed a complaint for "Declaration of Nullity of Transfer of Right in a Fishpond Permit" against Hipolito before the Court of First Instance (CFI), Branch II, Davao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; This was docketed as Civil Case No. 5826 and was dismissed on December 8, 1969 on the ground of prescription and estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The CFI held that the prescriptive period to bring an action to annul a contract based on fraud, mistake or want of consideration should be counted from the date of discovery, and in case of public documents, the date of discovery is the date the public document was executed.&nbsp; The CFI held that since the Transfer of Rights in Fishpond Permit was executed in 1953, the action to annul has prescribed.&nbsp; As Derla claimed that he only found out about the fraudulent transfer in 1960 when Hipolito instituted a criminal case against him, the CFI maintained that even if the date of discovery were to be counted from 1960, his complaint was still filed beyond what the prescriptive period allowed. Furthermore, the CFI said that Derla could not be permitted to assail the very document he relied on to obtain his acquittal in the criminal case filed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Derla elevated his cause to the Court of Appeals and this was docketed as CA-G.R. No. 47070-R.<br><br>Meanwhile, on October 27, 1969, the Office of the President affirmed <i>in toto</i> the SANR's November 6, 1967 decision.&nbsp; On April 20, 1970, the Commissioner of Fisheries issued Hipolito an Amended Fishpond Permit to cover a total fishpond area of 23.9 hectares, including the 7.5 hectares applied for by Derla.<br><br>On August 20, 1970, Hipolito, pursuant to Republic Act No. 5743,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> filed Sales (Fishpond) Application No. (VIII-2) 9 with the Bureau of Lands over the subject fishpond area covered by his Fishpond Permit No. F-3054-L.&nbsp; The Municipality of Panabo opposed Hipolito's application on the ground that it will disrupt the development of Panabo.&nbsp; The SANR however, recommended the denial of this opposition as the authorities concerned had certified that the area applied for was not needed by the government for any future public improvement and that it was suitable for fishpond purposes. On February 11, 1972, the Office of the President, through then Acting Assistant Executive Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora agreed with the SANR's position that Hipolito had already acquired a vested right over his fishpond area and the enactment of Republic Act No. 5743 could not <i>ipso facto</i> divest him of such right; hence, the Municipality of Panabo's opposition was dismissed and Hipolito's Fishpond Sales Application was given due course. The Municipality of Panabo filed two motions for reconsideration but both were denied by the Office of the President on November 2, 1972 and January 24, 1973.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On September 26, 1973, the Court of Appeals also dismissed Derla's appeal of the CFI's December 8, 1969 ruling in Civil Case No. 5826. The Court of Appeals, which affirmed <i>in toto</i> the CFI's decision, charged Derla with double costs as the appeal appeared to have been prosecuted solely for dilatory purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Derla's petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, docketed as G.R. No. L-38230, was likewise denied by this Court in a Resolution dated February 22, 1974, and this became final and executory on March 27, 1974 as certified in an Entry of Judgment dated April 18, 1974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the Municipality of Panabo filed with the CFI of Tagum, Davao del Norte, Civil Case No. 45 for <i>Certiorari </i>with Preliminary Injunction against Hipolito, Assistant Secretary Zamora, the Acting Director of Lands and the District Lands Officer.&nbsp; During the pendency of the case, a Municipal Judge of Panabo, Francisco Consolacion, wrote to a certain Antonio Floirendo about Hipolito's fishpond sales application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; On January 27, 1974<b>,</b> then President Ferdinand E.

Case No. 4732 and in support of her petition, Catalina alleged that she was a victim of the Marcos Regime and her fishpond was taken away from her despite a final and executory decision in her favor; that contrary to the allegations of the then mayor of Panabo, the approval of their fishpond sales application will not disrupt the municipality's development plan; that the Office of the President had already categorically ruled that Republic Act No. 5743 cannot divest Hipolito of his vested rights over the fishpond area; that the February 11 and November 2, 1972 Decisions have already lapsed into finality; and that the supposed conversion of the fishpond area into a fishery school was but a mere subterfuge to unjustly deprive the Hipolitos of their right over the fishpond area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Catalina's petition was referred to the then Ministry of Agriculture and Food (now Department of Agriculture) for an updated comment and recommendation. On April 18, 1988, the Ministry, in its return communication<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> to the Office of the President, commented that the subject fishpond area could not be fully utilized and were in excess of the Municipality of Panabo's needs as certain portions were leased out; that the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) paid as reimbursement to Hipolito was insufficient considering that Hipolito invested a total of Two Hundred Fifty-Eight and Six Hundred Pesos (P258,600.00) in the development and improvement of the subject fishpond area; that Catalina had not been deprived of her right to renew her late husband's fishpond permit or her right to apply for a fishpond lease contract, and that in fact, under Section 23 of Presidential Decree No. 704, public lands suitable for fishpond purposes shall be sold to applicants whose applications have been processed and approved on or before November 6, 1972.&nbsp; The Ministry found that based on the records, the Hipolitos were not accorded due process when they were deprived of the subject fishpond area in favor of the Municipality of Panabo, thus recommended that Catalina's petition be given due course, subject to her refund of the One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) she had received as reimbursement from the Municipality of Panabo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the basis of the above findings and recommendation, the Office of the President, through then Executive Secretary Franklin M. Drilon, granted Catalina's petition in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated November 11, 1991, with the following dispositive portion:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, and in the interest of more enlightened, impartial and substantive justice, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources is hereby directed to process and approve Sales (Fishpond) Application No. (VIII-2)9 of the late Ricardo Hipolito covering 23.9 hectares situated at San Vicente, Biyawa, Panabo, Davao del Norte, and thereafter issue the corresponding sales patent or certificate of title, excluding, however, therefrom a strip of one hundred (100) meters from the shoreline at high tide.&nbsp; It is further hereby directed that petitioner Catalina D.

Dolor and Panes' protest with motion for reconsideration was likewise dismissed on the ground that their claims to the subject fishpond area were anchored on lease contracts which were legally questionable for having been executed by the Municipality of Panabo at a time when it was judicially restrained from allowing private persons to enter, occupy or make any kind of construction on the subject fishpond area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On September 30, 1992, the petitioners filed an unsigned "Second Motion for Reconsideration" which was denied by the Office of the President in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated February 26, 1993 as the November 11, 1991 Resolution sought to be reconsidered had already become final. The Order also required the records of the case to be remanded to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources for immediate execution/implementation of the November 11, 1991 Resolution.<br><br>Upon the Department of Environment and Natural Resources' (DENR) request, the Office of the President declared its November 11, 1991 Resolution final and executory in an Order dated April 27, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On May 22, 1995, the petitioners wrote then Executive Secretary Ruben Torres, praying for the suspension of the implementation of the November 11, 1991 Resolution in O.P.

Case No. 4732 has attained finality twenty (20) years ago.&nbsp; It is valid and binding.&nbsp; In fact, on April 27, 1995, the Office of the President issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> for the sole purpose of declaring its November 11, 1991 decision final and executory.<br><br>This Court has held time and again that a final and executory judgment, no matter how erroneous, cannot be changed even by this Court:<br><br><blockquote>Nothing is more settled in law than that once a judgment attains finality it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable. It may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>There can be no mistake as to the presence of all the elements of <i>res judicata</i> in this case. The parties, although later substituted by their respective successors-in-interest, have been the same from the very beginning and in all the proceedings affecting the subject fishpond area.&nbsp; The concerned agencies and the lower courts have validly ruled on the rights to the subject fishpond area, the validity of the documents covering it, and even the actions associated and related to it.&nbsp; The subject fishpond area is undoubtedly the same subject matter involved in O.P. Case No. 4732 and the petition now before us.&nbsp; With regard to the identity of the causes of action, this Court, in <i>Mendiola v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><i> </i>held that:<br><br><blockquote>The test of identity of causes of action lies not in the form of an action but on whether the same evidence would support and establish the former and the present causes of action.&nbsp; The difference of actions in the aforesaid cases is of no moment. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The similarity between the two causes of action cannot be impugned.&nbsp; The facts and evidence which supported Catalina's petition for revival of Hipolito's fishpond sales application in O.P. Case No. 4732 are the same facts and evidence now before us; hence, the difference of actions in the two cases is of no moment. In O.P. Case No. 4732, the action was to revive Hipolito's fishpond sales application, which, when granted, gave the respondents the right to the subject fishpond area, eventually leading to their ownership over the same.&nbsp; The action in Civil Case No. 97-15, the case that was elevated to become this petition, is for the nullification of the respondents' respective titles to the subject fishpond area on the ground that the respondents have no right thereto.&nbsp; If we allow the nullification of these titles on the ground presented by the petitioners, then we would also be nullifying the decision in O.P. Case No. 4732, because it is the decision in that case which gave the respondents the right to the subject fishpond area.<br><br>Notwithstanding the difference in the forms of the two actions, the doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>still applies considering that the parties were litigating over the same subject fishpond area.&nbsp; More importantly, the same contentions and evidence as advanced by the petitioners in this case were already used to support their arguments in the previous cause of action.<br><br>The petitioners argue that <i>res judicata</i> cannot apply to this case because O.P. Case No. 4732 is an <i>administrative</i> case.<br><br>While it is true that this Court has declared that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> applies only to judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, and not to the exercise of administrative powers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we have also limited the latter to proceedings purely administrative in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, when the administrative proceedings take on an adversary character, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> certainly applies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; As this Court held in <i>Fortich v. Corona</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>The rule of <i>res judicata</i> which forbids the reopening of a matter once judicially determined by competent authority applies as well to <b>the judicial and quasi-judicial acts of public, executive or</b> <b>administrative officers and boards acting within their jurisdiction</b> as to the judgments of courts having general judicial powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>The petitioners cannot deny the fact that though initially, they were not able to participate in O.P. Case No. 4732, the fact that they were able to file a motion for reconsideration not once, but twice, and these motions were resolved by the Office of the President, meant that they were given ample opportunity to be heard. Moreover, a careful reading of the November 11, 1991 Resolution in O.P. Case No. 4732 itself will show that in resolving Catalina's petition to revive her late husband's fishpond sales application, the Office of the President, through then Executive Secretary Franklin M. Drilon, had carefully studied the antecedent facts of the case, and passed upon the rights of all the parties involved, including those of the petitioners, even before they participated in the said case.<br><br>The petitioners' complaint in Civil Case No. 97-15, the very same case subject of this petition, is one for declaration of nullity and cancellation of the original certificates of title of the respondents to the very same fishpond area subject of the respondents' petition in O.P. Case No. 4732.&nbsp; To grant petitioners' prayer now would be to nullify the final and executory decision of the Office of the President in O.P. Case No. 4732.<br><br>The petitioners also argue that if <i>res judicata</i> is to be applied in this case, then it should be applied to bar O.P. Case No. 4732 as it overturned the final and executory decisions of the same office dated February 5 and July 23, 1974.&nbsp; The petitioners are forgetting the fact that before these 1974 decisions were made, the February 11, 1972 decision of the same Office of the President had already become final and executory and the rights conferred to Hipolito by virtue of that final and executory decision had already become vested in him.&nbsp; To follow the petitioners' line of argument therefore, would lead us to the conclusion that if there is any one decision that should be retained, then it should be the first decision that had attained finality.&nbsp; This reasoning finds support in <i>Collantes v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> where we held that when faced with two conflicting final and executory decisions, one of the options the Court can take is to determine which judgment came first.&nbsp; The first judgment to become final and executory is the February 11, 1972 decision of the Office of the President, which is still in favor of Hipolito and the respondents, as Hipolito's successors-in-interest.<br><br>To nullify however the November 11, 1991 decision to give way to the reinstatement of the February 11, 1972 decision, would not in any way help in resolving this tedious and protracted debate.&nbsp; The almost 20-year old November 11, 1991 decision in O.P. Case No. 4732 is a well-written decision filled with details and factual antecedents that clearly spell out each of the parties' respective rights in the subject fishpond area. Moreover, it also explained its rationale for revoking or overturning its own decisions rendered on February 5 and July 23, 1974.&nbsp; Lastly, it is essentially a repeat of the 1972 decision as it confers the same rights and privileges to Hipolito.&nbsp; Thus, the most prudent thing to do is to retain the more exhaustive and factually updated version of the decision of the Office of the President, which is the November 11, 1991 Decision in O.P. Case No. 4732.<br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the finality of O.P. Case No. 4732 will not trigger the application of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> to bar the petition now before us, the petitioners' cause must still fail because the petitioners hinge their claim on the alleged fraudulent transfer to Hipolito of their father Derla's right to the Fishpond Permit No. F-1080-F.&nbsp; It must be remembered that this has also been the subject of a separate complaint in Civil Case No. 5826, wherein the RTC ruled that aside from the action being filed beyond the prescriptive period, Derla was estopped from disputing the authenticity of the transfer as he used the very same document to defend himself in the criminal case filed against him by Hipolito.&nbsp; In fact, the RTC acquitted him on the basis of that same document he had disputed and which his heirs are now disputing. The RTC's denial of Derla's petition to nullify the transfer of fishpond rights was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 47070-R and then by this Court in G.R. No. L-38230 in a Resolution dated February 22, 1974.&nbsp; The ruling in that case thus became final on March 27, 1974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The controversy over the subject fishpond area has long been debated in many actions and in various forums.&nbsp; The Court puts all the issues in this case to rest, with finality, in this Decision.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The August 30, 2002 Decision and March 17, 2003 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
