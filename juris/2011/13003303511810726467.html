				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On January 22, 1996, Revelina Limson<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (Revelina) purchased from Conchita Benitez an apartment unit (Unit 703) at Wack Wack Apartments, Wack Wack Road, Mandaluyong City.<br><br>Upon moving in, Revelina noticed defects in the electrical main panel located inside the unit, drawing her to report them, by letter of February 22, 1996, to the Wack Wack Condominium Corporation (respondent), a non-stock corporation organized for the purpose of holding title to and managing the common areas of Wack Wack Apartments<br><br>Racquel Gonzalez, who sits as Member of respondent's Board of Directors, replied by letter of February 23, 1996 that under Section 3 of the House Rules and Regulations, it is the duty of the unit owner to maintain the electrical and plumbing systems at his/her expense.<br><br>By still another letter dated February 28, 1996, Revelina informed respondent that the "switch board is such that No. 12 wire is protected by 30 ampere fuse" and that five appliances - refrigerator, freezer, iron, dryer and washing machine - are connected to only one fuse.<br><br>Revelina later sought professional assistance from a private electrical consultant, Romago, Incorporated.&nbsp; It was concluded that the wirings in Unit 703 are unsafe, hazardous and did not comply with the Philippine Electrical Code.<br><br>On Revelina's request, the City Building Office conducted an inspection of Unit 703 following which a Report dated January 21, 1997 was accomplished with the following findings and recommendations:<br><br><blockquote><b>Findings:</b><br><br><ol><li> The load center consists of 100 A 2 pst main switch and fusible cut out Blocks with 16 circuits. The fusible cut out block enclosure is not provided with cover, exposing electrical live part that makes it hazardous, unsafe and will be difficult to maintain because a portion was blocked by a shelf.<br></li><li>The jumper cable from main safety switch to fusible cut-out blocks used 2 #10 wire (Capt. 60 amp) per phase. This is undersized and would overheat.<br></li><li>The fusible current protective devise where all 30 Amp., sp., 240 v FOR 2 #12 TW (20 AMP. Capacity wire) this does not comply with the provision of the Philippine Electrical Code that stipulates rating of the protective devise shall be the same as the conductor ampacity especially on a multi outlet circuit.<br></li><li>Power supply for water heaters was tapped to small appliance for convenience outlet circuit.<br></li></ol><br><b>Recommendation:</b><br><br><ol><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Replacement of fusible load center</span> with panel board and circuit breaker components to correct the problem as enumerated on items 2, 3, 4 of our findings.<br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Replace the embedded circular loom</span> with conduit on moulding.<br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check all grounded circuit for water heater lad.</span><br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provide separate circuit for water heater lad.</span><br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Submit As Built Electrical Plan</span> signed and sealed by a Professional Electrical Engineer together with the previous approved Electrical Plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>The Report was sent by then Mayor Benjamin Abalos, Sr. to respondent by letter dated January 31, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 3, 1997, respondent, through Architect Eugenio Gonzalez, wrote Revelina to demand that repairs in line with the above-stated recommendation of the City Building Office be undertaken within ten (10) days.<br><br>Before the deadline, respondent's Board of Directors convened on February 7, 1997 and resolved to impose a daily fine of P1,000.00 on Revelina and her husband Benjamin, to commence on February 14, 1997, should the latter fail to comply.<br><br>Revelina and her husband refused to undertake the repairs and to pay the fine.&nbsp; They claimed that the electrical main panel forms part of the common areas, citing Section 6 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 4726<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>, "An Act to Define Condominium, Establish Requirements for its Creation and Government of its Incidents,"<i>&nbsp; </i>the pertinent provision of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 6.

The subject electrical main panel being located inside the unit and its principal function being to control the flow of electricity into the unit, the appellate court concluded that charges for its repair cannot be for respondent's account.<br><br>On the imposition of fine on the spouses Limson for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure to correct the faulty electrical wiring</span> despite notice, the appellate court upheld respondent's authority to enforce the same.&nbsp; Finding, however, that the amount of P1,000 fine per day was excessive, it reduced the same to P200.<br><br>Respecting respondent's imposition of a fine of P1,000 per day on the spouses' alleged <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure to repair the 7</span><sup style="text-decoration: underline;">th</sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> floor utility room</span>, the appellate court disallowed the same, however, it holding that respondent did not first seek reimbursement from them before assessment.<br><br>Finally, the appellate court denied respondent's prayer for actual damages in the amount of P5,000 representing repair expenses on the utility room, it having failed to present receipts therefor.<br><br>Her Motion for Reconsideration having been denied, Revelina filed the present petition for review.<br><br>The Court finds for Revelina.<br><br>The pertinent provisions of the Wack Wack Apartments Master Deed follow:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5.

There should be no departure from the words of the statute, for speech is the index of intention.<br><br>An explanation of the Apartment's electrical supply system was presented by respondent, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote>a.) x x x [T]he electrical system of the Apartments commences with a <u>common main electrical line</u> (main line) provided by the Apartments, connected to a Meralco line outside the building. This <u>common main line runs to the ground floor of the building, where the common meter station is located; from where individual secondary lines, are tapped to the common main line. There are as many individual secondary lines tapped to the common main line, as there are units. EVERY SECONDARY LINE TRAVELS VERTICALLY TO ITS DESIGNATED FLOOR AND LEADS TO AN INDIVIDUAL UNIT.</u><br><br>b.) The construction is such, that every secondary line is embedded within the wall of a unit, until it surfaces from the wall, ready to supply electricity to that unit; the UNIT, in this case, has <u>two (2) metal boxes, inside the UNIT</u>; both attached to the wall of the UNIT. The first of the two (2) metal boxes is the main switch box. (Annex "B" and "B-1" The main switch box <u>has a hole</u>, through which the <u>secondary line</u> enters and is attached to the upper end of two (2) big fuses, located in the main switch box (Annex "B-1-a"). <u>The upper end of the two (2) big fuses, where the secondary line (tapped to the main line) ends</u> are indicated and marked as (Annex "B-1-b" and "B-1-c")<br><br>c.) At the lower end of these two (2) big fuses, there are separate electrical wires (technically called "<u>jumper cables</u>"). The jumper cables originate <u>in the UNIT's second metal box which is the fusible cutout box</u> (fuse box), and the jumper cables are connected to the lower end of the two (2) big fuses in the main switch box t<u>o draw electricity to feed the fuse box</u>. x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (capitalization and underscoring in the original)</blockquote><br>In a multi-occupancy dwelling such as Apartments, limitations are imposed under R.A. 4726<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in accordance with the common interest and safety of the occupants therein which at times may curtail the exercise of ownership. To maintain safe, harmonious and secured living conditions, certain stipulations are embodied in the duly registered deed of restrictions, in this case the Master Deed, and in house rules which the condominium corporation, like respondent, is mandated to implement. Upon acquisition of a unit, the owner not only affixes his conformity to the sale; he also binds himself to a contract with other unit owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Unquestionably, the fuse box controls the supply of electricity into the unit. Power is sourced through jumper cables attached to the main switch which connects the unit's electrical line to the Apartment's common electrical line. <u>It is an integral component of a power utility installation</u>. Respondent cannot disclaim responsibility for the maintenance of the Apartments' electrical supply system solely because a component thereof is placed inside a unit.<br><br>As earlier stated, both the law and the Master Deed refer to utility installations as forming part of the common areas, which reference is justified by practical considerations. Repairs to correct any defects in the electrical wiring should be under the control and supervision of respondent to ensure safety and compliance with the Philippine Electrical Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> not to mention security and peace of mind of the unit owners<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals Decision of December 19, 2008 is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
