Having fully established himself as the undisputed "coconut king" with unlimited powers to deal with the coconut levy funds, the stage was now set for Defendant Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. to launch his predatory forays into almost all aspects of Philippine economic activity namely: softdrinks, agribusiness, oil mills, shipping, cement manufacturing, textile, as more fully described below.<br><br>14. Defendant Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. taking undue advantage of his association, influence and connection, acting in unlawful concert with Defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos, and the individual defendants, embarked upon devices, schemes and stratagems, including the use of defendant corporations as fronts, to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of Plaintiff and the Filipino people, such as when he - misused coconut levy funds to buy out majority of the outstanding shares of stock of San Miguel Corporation in order to control the largest agri-business, foods and beverage company in the Philippines, more particularly described as follows:<br><br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(a)&nbsp; Having control over the coconut levy, Defendant Eduardo M. Cojuangco invested the funds in diverse activities, such as the various businesses SMC was engaged in (e.g. large beer, food, packaging, and livestock)</span>;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(b)&nbsp; He entered SMC in early 1983 when he bought most of the 20 million shares Enrique Zobel owned in the Company.&nbsp; The shares, worth $49 million, represented 20% of SMC;</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(c)&nbsp; Later that year, Cojuangco also acquired the Soriano stocks through a series of complicated and secret agreements, a key feature of which was a "voting trust agreement" that stipulated that Andres, Jr. or his heir would proxy over the vote of the shares owned by Soriano and Cojuangco.&nbsp; This agreement, which accounted for 30% of the outstanding shares of SMC and which lasted for five (5) years, enabled the Sorianos to retain management control of SMC for the same period;</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(d)&nbsp; Furthermore, in exchange for an SMC investment of $45 million in non-voting preferred shares in UCPB, Soriano served as the vice-chairman of the supposed bank of the coconut farmers, UCPB, and in return, Cojuangco, for investing funds from the coconut levy, was named vice-chairman of SMC;</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(e) Consequently, Cojuangco enjoyed the privilege of appointing his nominees to the SMC Board, to which he appointed key members of the ACCRA Law Firm (herein Defendants) instead of coconut farmers whose money really funded the sale;</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(f)&nbsp; The scheme of Cojuangco to use the lawyers of the said Firm was revealed in a document which he signed on 19 February 1983 entitled "Principles and Framework of Mutual Cooperation and Assistance" which governed the rules for the conduct of management of SMC and the disposition of the shares which he bought.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(g)&nbsp;

Through insidious means and machinations, ACCRA, being the wholly-owned investment arm, ACCRA Investments Corporation, became the holder of approximately fifteen million shares representing roughly 3.3% of the total outstanding capital stock of UCPB as of 31 March 1987.

The Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) is without authority to act in the name and in behalf of the "Republic of the Philippines".<br><br>7.01. As constituted in E.O. No. 1, the PCGG was composed of "Minister Jovito R. Salonga, as Chairman, Mr. Ramon Diaz, Mr. Pedro L. Yap, Mr. Raul Daza and Ms. Mary Concepcion Bautista, as Commissioners". When the complaint in the instant case was filed, Minister Salonga, Mr. Pedro L. Yap and Mr. Raul Daza had already left the PCGG.&nbsp; By then the PCGG had become functus officio.<br><br>7.02. The Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over the complaint or over the transaction alleged in the complaint.<br><br>7.03. The complaint does not allege any cause of action.<br><br>7.04. The complaint is not brought in the name of the real parties in interest, assuming any cause of action exists.<br><br>7.05. Indispensable and necessary parties have not been impleaded.<br><br>7.06. There is improper joinder of causes of action (Sec. 6, Rule 2, Rules of Civil Procedure). The causes of action alleged, if any, do not arise out of the same contract, transaction or relation between the parties, nor are they simply for money, or are of the same nature and character.<br><br>7.07. There is improper joinder of parties defendants (Sec. 11, Rule 3, Rules of Civil Procedure).The causes of action alleged as to defendants, if any, do not involve a single transaction or a related series of transactions. Defendant is thus compelled to litigate in a suit regarding matters as to which he has no involvement.&nbsp; The questions of fact and law involved are not common to all defendants.<br><br>7.08. In so far as the complaint seeks the forfeiture of assets allegedly acquired by defendant "manifestly out of proportion to their salaries, to their other lawful income and income from legitimately acquired property," under R.A. 1379, the "previous inquiry similar to preliminary investigation in criminal cases" required to be conducted under Sec. 2 of that law before any suit for forfeiture may be instituted, was not conducted; as a consequence, the Court may not acquire and exercise jurisdiction over such a suit.<br><br>7.09. The complaint in the instant suit was filed July 31, 1987, or within one year before the local election held on January 18, 1988.&nbsp; If this suit involves an action under R.A. 1379, its institution was also in direct violation of Sec. 2, R.A. No. 1379.<br><br>7.10. E.O. No. 1, E.O. No. 2, E.O. No. 14 and 14-A, are unconstitutional.&nbsp; They violate due process, equal protection, ex post facto and bill of attainder provisions of the Constitution.<br><br>7.11.

However, the Republic sought several extensions to file its own Pre-Trial Brief, and eventually did so on May 9, 2000.<br><br>In the meanwhile, some non-parties sought to intervene. On November 22, 1999, GABAY Foundation, Inc. (GABAY) filed its complaint-in-intervention.&nbsp; On February 24, 2000, the Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc., Maria Clara L. Lobregat, Jose R. Eleazar, Jr., Domingo Espina, Jose Gomez, Celestino Sabate, Manuel del Rosario, Jose Martinez, Jr., and Eladio Chato (collectively referred to as COCOFED, considering that the co-intervenors were its officers) also sought to intervene, citing the October 2, 1989 ruling in G.R. No. 75713 entitled <i>COCOFED v. PCGG</i> whereby the Court recognized COCOFED as the "private national association of coconut producers certified in 1971 by the PHILCOA as having the largest membership among such producers" and as such "entrusted it with the task of maintaining continuing liaison with the different sectors of the industry, the government and its mass base."&nbsp; Pending resolution of its motion for intervention, COCOFED filed a Pre-Trial Brief on March 2, 2000.<br><br>On May 24, 2000, the Sandiganbayan denied GABAY's intervention without prejudice because it found "that the allowance of GABAY to enter under the special character in which it presents itself would be to open the doors to other groups of coconut farmers whether of the same kind or of any other kind which could be considered a sub-class or a sub-classification of the coconut planters or the coconut industry of this country."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>COCOFED's intervention as defendant was allowed on May 24, 2000, however, because "the position taken by the COCOFED is relevant to the proceedings herein, if only to state that there is a special function which the COCOFED and the coconut planters have in the matter of the coconut levy funds and the utilization of those funds, part of which is in dispute in the instant matter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The pre-trial was actually held on May 24, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> during which the Sandiganbayan sought clarification from the parties, particularly the Republic, on their respective positions, but at the end it found the clarifications "inadequately" enlightening. Nonetheless, the Sandiganbayan, not disposed to reset, terminated the pre-trial:<br><br><blockquote>xxx primarily because the Court is given a very clear impression that the plaintiff does not know what documents will be or whether they are even available to prove the causes of action in the complaint.&nbsp; The Court has pursued and has exerted every form of inquiry to see if there is a way by which the plaintiff could explain in any significant particularity the acts and the evidence which will support its claim of wrong-doing by the defendants.&nbsp; The plaintiff has failed to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>The following material portions of the pre-trial order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> are quoted to provide a proper perspective of what transpired during the pre-trial, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Upon oral inquiry from the Court, the issues which were being raised by plaintiff appear to have been made on a very generic character.&nbsp; Considering that any claim for violation or breach of trust or deception cannot be made on generic statements but rather by specific acts which would demonstrate fraud or breach of trust or deception, together with the evidence in support thereof, the same was not acceptable to the Court.<br><br>The plaintiff through its designated counsel for this morning, Atty. Dennis Taningco, has represented to this Court that the annexes to its pre-trial brief, more particularly the findings of the COA in its various examinations, copies of which COA reports are attached to the pre-trial brief, would demonstrate the wrong, the act or omission attributed to the defendants or to several of them and the basis, therefore, for the relief that plaintiff seeks in its complaint.&nbsp; It would appear, however, that the plaintiff through its counsel at this time is not prepared to go into the specifics of the identification of these wrongs or omissions attributed to plaintiff.<br><br>The Court has reminded the plaintiff that a COA report proves itself only in proceedings where the issue arises from a review of the accountability of particular officers and, therefore, to show the existence of shortages or deficiencies in an examination conducted for that purpose, provided that such a report is accompanied by its own working papers and other supporting documents.<br><br>In civil cases such as this, a COA report would not have the same independent probative value since it is not a review of the accountability of public officers for public property in their custody as accountable officers.&nbsp; It has been the stated view of this Court that a COA report, to be of significant evidence, may itself stand only on the basis of the supporting documents that upon which it is based and upon an analysis made by those who are competent to do so.&nbsp; The Court, therefore, sought a more specific statement from plaintiff as to what these documents were and which of them would prove a particular act or omission or a series of acts or omissions purportedly committed by any, by several or by all of the defendants in any particular stage of the chain of alleged wrong-doing in this case.<br><br>The plaintiff was not in a position to do so.<br><br>The Court has remonstrated with the plaintiff, insofar as its inadequacy is concerned, primarily because this case was set for pre-trial as far back as December and has been reset from its original setting, with the undertaking by the plaintiff to prepare itself for these proceedings.&nbsp; It appears to this Court at this time that the failure of the plaintiff to have available responses and specific data and documents at this stage is not because the matter has been the product of oversight or notes and papers left elsewhere; rather, the agitation of this Court arises from the fact that at this very stage, the plaintiff through its counsel does not know what these documents are, where these documents will be and is still anticipating a submission or a delivery thereof by COA at an undetermined time.&nbsp; The justification made by counsel for this stance is that this is only pre-trial and this information and the documents are not needed yet.<br><br>The Court is not prepared to postpone the pre-trial anew primarily because the Court is given a very clear impression that the plaintiff does not know what documents will be or whether they are even available to prove the causes of action in the complaint.&nbsp; The Court has pursued and has exerted every form of inquiry to see if there is a way by which the plaintiff could explain in any significant particularity the acts and the evidence which will support its claim of wrong-doing by the defendants. The plaintiff has failed to do so.<br><br>Defendants Cojuangco have come back and reiterated their previous inquiry as to the statement of the cause of action and the description thereof.&nbsp; While the Court acknowledges that logically, that statement along that line would be primary, the Court also recognizes that sometimes the phrasing of the issue may be determined or may arise after a statement of the evidence is determined by this Court because the Court can put itself in a position of more clearly and perhaps more accurately stating what the issues are. The Pre-Trial Order, after all, is not so much a reflection of merely separate submissions by all of the parties involved, witnesses by the Court, as to what the subject matter of litigation will be, including the determination of what matters of fact remain unresolved.&nbsp; At this time, the plaintiff has not taken the position on any factual statement or any piece of evidence which can be subject of admission or denial, nor any specifics of any act which could be disputed by the defendants; what plaintiff through counsel has stated are general conclusions, general statements of abuse and misuse and opportunism.<br><br>After an extended break requested by some of the parties, the sessions were resumed and nothing anew arose from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought fifteen (15) days to file a reply to the comments and observations made by defendant Cojuangco to the pre-trial brief of the plaintiff. This Court denied this Request since the submissions in preparation for pre-trial are not litigious or contentious matters.&nbsp; They are mere assertions or positions which may or may not be meritorious depending upon the view of the Court of the entire case and if useful at the pre-trial. At this stage, the plaintiff then reiterated its earlier request to consider the pre-trial terminated. The Court sought the positions of the other parties, whether or not they too were prepared to submit their respective positions on the basis of what was before the Court at pre-trial.&nbsp; All of the parties, in the end, have come to an agreement that they were submitting their own respective positions for purpose of pre-trial on the basis of the submissions made of record.<br><br>With all of the above, the pre-trial is now deemed terminated.<br><br>This Order has been overly extended simply because there has been a need to put on record all of the events that have taken place leading to the conclusions which were drawn herein.<br><br>The parties have indicated a desire to make their submissions outside of trial as a consequence of this terminated pre-trial, with the plea that the transcript of the proceedings this morning be made available to them, so that they may have the basis for whatever assertions they will have to make either before this Court or elsewhere. The Court deems the same reasonable and the Court now gives the parties fifteen (15) days after notice to them that the transcript of stenographic notes of the proceedings herein are complete and ready for them to be retrieved.&nbsp; Settings for trial or for any other proceeding hereafter will be fixed by this Court either upon request of the parties or when the Court itself shall have determined that nothing else has to be done.<br><br>The Court has sought confirmation from the parties present as to the accuracy of the recapitulation herein of the proceedings this morning and the Court has gotten assent from all of the parties.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>In the meanwhile, the Sandiganbayan, in order to conform with the ruling in <i>Presidential Commission on Good Government v.

Cojuangco, Jr. and the defendant Cojuangco Companies)</i> upon the following reasons:<br><br><blockquote><b>In the instant case, a circumspect review of the records show that while there are facts which appear to be undisputed, there are also genuine factual issues raised by the defendants which need to be threshed out in a full-blown trial. Foremost among these issues are the following:</b><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>1) </b><b>What are the "various sources" of funds, which the defendant Cojuangco and his companies claim they utilized to acquire the disputed SMC shares?</b><br><br><b>2) </b><b>Whether or not such funds acquired from alleged "various sources" can be considered coconut levy funds;</b><br><br><b>3) </b><b>Whether or not defendant Cojuangco had indeed served in the governing bodies of PC, UCPB and/or CIIF Oil Mills at the time the funds used to purchase the SMC shares were obtained such that he owed a fiduciary duty to render an account to these entities as well as to the coconut farmers;</b><br><br><b>4) </b><b>Whether or not defendant Cojuangco took advantage of his position and/or close ties with then President Marcos to obtain favorable concessions or exemptions from the usual financial requirements from the lending banks and/or coco-levy funded companies, in order to raise the funds to acquire the disputed SMC shares; and if so, what are these favorable concessions or exemptions?</b><br></div><br><b>Answers to these issues are not evident from the submissions of the plaintiff and must therefore be proven through the presentation of relevant and competent evidence during trial.&nbsp; A perusal of the subject Motion shows that the plaintiff hastily derived conclusions from the defendants' statements in their previous pleadings although such conclusions were not supported by categorical facts but only mere inferences. In the Reply dated October 2, 2003, the plaintiff construed the supposed meaning of the phrase "<i>various sources</i>" (referring to the source of defendant Cojuangco's funds which were used to acquire the subject SMC shares), which plaintiff said was quite obvious from the defendants' admission in his Pre-Trial Brief</b>, which we quote:<br><br><blockquote>"According to Cojuangco's own Pre-Trial Brief, these so-called `various sources', i.e., the sources from which he obtained the funds he claimed to have used in buying the 20% SMC shares are not in fact `various' as he claims them to be.&nbsp; He says he obtained `loans' from UCPB and `advances' from the CIIF Oil Mills.&nbsp; He even goes&nbsp; as far as to admit that his <i>only</i> evidence in this case would have been `records of UCPB' and a `representative of the CIIF Oil Mills' obviously the `records of UCPB' relate to the `loans' that Cojuangco claims to have obtained from UCPB - of which he was President and CEO - while the `representative of the CIIF Oil Mills' will obviously testify on the `advances' Cojuangco obtained from CIIF Oil Mills - of which he was also the President and CEO."</blockquote><br>From the foregoing premises, plaintiff went on to conclude that:<br><br><blockquote>"These admissions of defendant Cojuangco are outright admissions that he (1) took money from the bank entrusted by law with the administration of coconut levy funds and (2) took more money from the very corporations/oil mills in which part of those coconut levy funds (the CIIF) was placed - treating the funds of UCPB and the CIIF as his own personal capital to buy `his' SMC shares."</blockquote><br><b>We cannot agree with the plaintiff's contention that the defendant's statements in his Pre-Trial Brief regarding the presentation of a possible CIIF witness as well as UCPB records, can already be considered as admissions of the defendant's exclusive use and misuse of coconut levy funds to acquire the subject SMC shares and defendant Cojuangco's alleged taking advantage of his positions to acquire the subject SMC shares. Moreover, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court "should take that view of the evidence most favorable to the party against whom it is directed, giving such party the benefit of all inferences."&nbsp; Inasmuch as this issue cannot be resolved merely from an interpretation of the defendant's statements in his brief, the UCPB records must be produced and the CIIF witness must be heard to ensure that the conclusions that will be derived have factual basis and are thus, valid.</b><br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the forgoing, the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment dated July 11, 2003 is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>Thereafter, on December 28, 2004, the Sandiganbayan resolved the other pending motions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE<b>,</b> in view of the foregoing, the Motion for Reconsideration dated May 25, 2004 filed by defendant Eduardo M.

No. 169203, the Sandiganbayan lifted the nine WOS for the following reasons, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Having studied the antecedent facts, this Court shall now resolve the pending incidents especially defendants' "Motion to Affirm that the Writs or Orders of Sequestration Issued on Defendants' Properties Were Unauthorized, Invalid and Never Became Effective" dated March 5, 1999.<br><br>Section 3 of the PCGG Rules and Regulations promulgated on April 11, 1986, provides:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 3.&nbsp; Who may issue. - A writ of sequestration or a freeze or hold order may be issued by the Commission upon the <i>authority of at least two Commissioners,</i> based on the affirmation or complaint of an interested party or motu propio (sic) the issuance thereof is warranted."</blockquote><br>In this present case, of all the questioned writs of sequestration issued after the effectivity of the PCGG Rules and Regulations or after April 11, 1986, only writ no. 87-0218 issued on May 27, 1987 complied with the requirement that it be issued by at least two Commissioners, the same having been issued by Commissioners Ramon E. Rodrigo and Quintin S. Doromal.&nbsp; However, even if Writ of Sequestration No. 87-0218 complied with the requirement that the same be issued by at least two Commissioners, the records fail to show that it was issued with factual basis or with factual foundation as can be seen from the Certification of the Commission Secretary of the PCGG of the excerpt of the minutes of the meeting of the PCGG held on May 26, 1987, stating therein that:<br><br><blockquote>"The Commission approved the recommendation of Dir. Cruz to sequester all the shares of stock, assets, records, and documents of Balete Ranch, Inc. and the appointment of the Fiscal Committee with ECI Challenge, Inc./Pepsi-Cola for Balete Ranch, Inc. and the Aquacor Marketing Corp. vice Atty. S. Occena. The objective is to consolidate the Fiscal Committee activities covering three associated entities of Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco.Upon recommendation of Comm. Rodrigo, the reconstitution of the Board of Directors of the three companies was deferred for further study."</blockquote><br>Nothing in the above-quoted certificate shows that there was a prior determination of a factual basis or factual foundation.&nbsp; It is the absence of a <i>prima facie</i> basis for the issuance of a writ of sequestration and not the lack of authority of two (2) Commissioners which renders the said writ void <i>ab initio</i>.&nbsp; Thus, being the case, Writ of Sequestration No. 87-0218 must be automatically lifted.<br><br>As declared by the Honorable Supreme Court in two cases it has decided,<br><br><blockquote>"The absence of a prior determination by the PCGG of a <i>prima facie</i> basis for the sequestration order is, unavoidably, a fatal defect which rendered the sequestration of respondent corporation and its properties void <i>ab initio</i>."&nbsp; And<br><br>"The corporation or entity against which such writ is directed will not be able to visually determine its validity, unless the required signatures of at least two commissioners authorizing its issuance appear on the very document itself.&nbsp; The issuance of sequestration orders requires the existence of a prima facie case.&nbsp; The two -commissioner rule is obviously intended to assure a collegial determination of such fact.&nbsp; In this light, a writ bearing only one signature is an obvious transgression of the PCGG Rules."</blockquote><br>Consequently, the writs of sequestration nos. 86-0062, 86-0069, 86-0085, 86-0095, 86-0096, 86-0097 and 86-0098 must be lifted for not having complied with the pertinent provisions of the PCGG Rules and Regulations, all of which were issued by only one Commissioner and after April 11, 1986 when the PCGG Rules and Regulations took effect, an utter disregard of the PCGG's Rules and Regulations.&nbsp; The Honorable Supreme Court has stated that:<br><br><blockquote>"Obviously, Section 3 of the PCGG Rules was intended to protect the public from improvident, reckless and needless sequestrations of private property.&nbsp; And since these Rules were issued by Respondent Commission, it should be the first entity to observe them."</blockquote><br>Anent the writ of sequestration no. 86-0042 which was issued on April 8, 1986 or prior to the promulgation of the PCGG Rules and Regulations on April 11, 1986, the same cannot be declared void on the ground that it was signed by only one Commissioner because at the time it was issued, the Rules and Regulations of the PCGG were not yet in effect. However, it again appears that there was no prior determination of the existence of a <i>prima facie</i> basis or factual foundation for the issuance of the said writ.&nbsp; The PCGG, despite sufficient time afforded by this Court to show that a prima facie basis existed prior to the issuance of Writ No. 86-0042, failed to do so.&nbsp; Nothing in the records submitted by the PCGG in compliance of the Resolutions and Order of this Court would reveal that a meeting was held by the Commission for the purpose of determining the existence of a <i>prima facie</i> evidence prior to its issuance.&nbsp; In a case decided by the Honorable Supreme Court, wherein it involved a writ of sequestration issued by the PCGG on March 19, 1986 against all assets, movable and immovable, of Provident International Resources Corporation and Philippine Casino Operators Corporation, the Honorable Supreme Court enunciated:<br><br><blockquote>"The questioned sequestration order was, however issued on March 19, 1986, prior to the promulgation of the PCGG Rules and Regulations. As a consequence, we cannot reasonably expect the commission to abide by said rules, which were nonexistent at the time the subject writ was issued by then Commissioner Mary Concepcion Bautista. Basic is the rule that no statute, decree, ordinance, rule or regulation (and even policies) shall be given retrospective effect unless explicitly stated so.&nbsp; We find no provision in said Rules which expressly gives them retroactive effect, or implies the abrogation of previous writs issued not in accordance with the same Rules.&nbsp; Rather, what said Rules provide is that they "shall be effective immediately," which in legal parlance, is understood as "upon promulgation".&nbsp; Only penal laws are given retroactive effect insofar as they favor the accused.<br><br>We distinguish this case from <i>Republic vs. Sandiganbayan, Romualdez and Dio Island Resort, G.R. No. 88126, July 12, 1996</i> where the sequestration order against Dio Island Resort, dated April 14, 1986, was prepared, issued and signed not by two commissioners of the PCGG, but by the head of its task force in Region VIII. In holding that said order was not valid since it was not issued in accordance with PCGG Rules and Regulations, we explained:<br><br><blockquote>"(Sec. 3 of the PCGG Rules and Regulations), couched in clear and simple language, leaves no room for interpretation.&nbsp; On the basis thereof, it is indubitable that under no circumstances can a sequestration or freeze order be validly issued by one not a commissioner of the PCGG.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Atty. Ramirez had been given prior authority by the PCGG to place Dio Island Resort under sequestration, nevertheless, the sequestration order he issued is still void since PCGG may not delegate its authority to sequester to its representatives and subordinates, and any such delegation is valid and ineffective."<br></blockquote><br>We further said:<br><br>"In the instant case, there was clearly no prior determination made by the PCGG of a prima facie basis for the sequestration of Dio Island Resort, Inc. x x x<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>The absence of a prior determination by the PCGG of a <i>prima facie</i> basis for the sequestration order is, unavoidably, a fatal defect which rendered the sequestration of respondent corporation and its properties void <i>ab initio</i>.&nbsp; Being void <i>ab initio</i>, it is deemed nonexistent, as though it had never been issued, and therefore is not subject to ratification by the PCGG.<br><br>What were obviously lacking in the above case were the basic requisites for the validity of a sequestration order which we laid down in <i>BASECO vs. PCGG, 150 SCRA 181, 216, May 27, 1987,</i> thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Section (3) of the Commission's Rules and regulations provides that sequestration or freeze (and takeover) orders issue upon the authority of at least two commissioners, based on the <i>affirmation or complaint of an interested party, or motu propio</i> (sic) when the Commission has <i>reasonable grounds</i> to believe that the issuance thereof is warranted."<br><br>In the case at bar, there is no question as to the presence of <i>prima facie</i> evidence justifying the issuance of the sequestration order against respondent corporations.&nbsp; But the said order cannot be nullified for lack of the other requisite (authority of at least two commissioners) since, as explained earlier, such requisite was nonexistent at the time the order was issued."</blockquote><br>As to the argument of the Plaintiff Republic that Defendants Cojuangco, et al. have not shown any contrary <i>prima facie</i> proof that the properties subject matter of the writs of sequestration were legitimate acquisitions, the same is misplaced. It is a basic legal doctrine, as well as many times enunciated by the Honorable Supreme Court that when a <i>prima facie</i> proof is required in the issuance of a writ, the party seeking such extraordinary writ must establish that it is entitled to it by complying strictly with the requirements for its issuance and not the party against whom the writ is being sought for to establish that the writ should not be issued against it.</blockquote></blockquote><br>According to the Republic, the Sandiganbayan thereby gravely abused its discretion in: (<i>a</i>) in lifting WOS No. 86-0042 and No. 87-0218 despite the basic requisites for the validity of sequestration being existent; (<i>b</i>) in denying the Republic's alternative prayer for the issuance of an order of sequestration against all the subject shares of stock in accordance with the ruling in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>, 258 SCRA 685, as stated in its <i>Motion For Reconsideration</i>; and (<i>c</i>) in deleting the last two conditions the Sandiganbayan had earlier imposed on the subject shares of stock.<br><br>We sustain the lifting of the nine WOS for the reasons made extant in the assailed resolution of October 8, 2003, <i>supra</i>.<br><br>Section 3 of the Rules of the PCGG, promulgated on April 11, 1986, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Who may issue</i>. - A writ of sequestration or a freeze or hold order may be issued by the Commission upon the authority of at least two Commissioners, based on the affirmation or complaint of an interested party or <i>motu proprio</i> when the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the issuance thereof is warranted.</blockquote><br>Conformably with Section 3, <i>supra</i>, WOS No. 86-0062 dated April 21, 1986; WOS No. 86-0069 dated April 22, 1986; WOS No. 86-0085 dated May 9, 1986; WOS No. 86-0095 dated May 16, 1986; WOS No. 86-0096 dated May 16, 1986; WOS No. 86-0097 dated May 16, 1986; and WOS No. 86-0098 dated May 16, 1986 were lawfully and correctly nullified considering that only one PCGG Commissioner had issued them.<br><br>Similarly, WOS No. 86-0042 dated April 8, 1986 and WOS No. 87-0218 dated May 27, 1987 were lawfully and correctly nullified&nbsp; - notwithstanding that WOS No. 86-0042, albeit signed by only one Commissioner (<i>i.e</i>., Commissioner Mary Concepcion Bautista), was not at the time of its issuance subject to the two-Commissioners rule, and WOS No. 87-0218, albeit already issued under the signatures of two Commissioners&nbsp; -&nbsp; considering that both had been issued without a prior determination by the PCGG of a <i>prima facie</i> basis for the sequestration.<br><br>Plainly enough, the irregularities infirming the issuance of the several WOS could not be ignored in favor of the Republic and resolved against the persons whose properties were subject of the WOS. Where the Rules of the PCGG instituted safeguards under Section 3, <i>supra</i>, by requiring the concurrent signatures of two Commissioners to every WOS issued and the existence of a <i>prima facie</i> case of ill gotten wealth to support the issuance, the non-compliance with either of the safeguards nullified the WOS thus issued. It is already settled that sequestration, due to its tendency to impede or limit the exercise of proprietary rights by private citizens, is construed <i>strictly</i> against the State, conformably with the legal maxim that statutes in derogation of common rights are generally strictly construed and rigidly confined to the cases clearly within their scope and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the nullification of the nine WOS, being in implementation of the safeguards the PCGG itself had instituted, did not constitute any abuse of its discretion, least of all grave, on the part of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Nor did the Sandiganbayan gravely abuse its discretion in reducing from four to only two the conditions imposed for the lifting of the WOS. The Sandiganbayan thereby acted with the best of intentions, being all too aware that the claim of the Republic to the sequestered assets and properties might be prejudiced or harmed <i>pendente lite</i> unless the protective conditions were annotated in the corporate books of SMC. Moreover, the issue became academic following the Sandiganbayan's promulgation of its decision dismissing the Republic's <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint</i>, which thereby removed the stated reason - "<i>the Republic continues to hold a claim on the shares which is yet to be resolved</i>" - underlying the need for the annotation of the conditions (whether four or two).<br><br><center><b>II</b><br><b>The Concept and Genesis of</b><br><b>Ill-Gotten Wealth in the Philippine Setting</b><br></center><br>A brief review of the Philippine law and jurisprudence pertinent to <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> should furnish an illuminating backdrop for further discussion.<br><br>In the immediate aftermath of the peaceful 1986 EDSA Revolution, the administration of President Corazon C. Aquino saw to it, among others, that rules defining the authority of the government and its instrumentalities were promptly put in place. It is significant to point out, however, that the administration likewise defined the limitations of the authority.<br><br>The first official issuance of President Aquino, which was made on February 28, 1986, or just two days after the EDSA Revolution, was Executive Order (E.O.) No. 1, which created the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). Ostensibly, E.O. No. 1 was the first issuance in light of the EDSA Revolution having come about mainly to address the pillage of the nation's wealth by President Marcos, his family, and cronies.<br><br>E.O. No. 1 contained only two WHEREAS Clauses, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, <b>vast resources of the government</b> have been amassed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates both here and abroad;<br><br>WHEREAS, there is an urgent need to recover <b>all ill-gotten wealth</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></blockquote><br>Paragraph (4) of E.O. No. 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> further required that the wealth, to be ill-gotten, must be "acquired by them through or as a result of improper or illegal use of or the conversion of funds belonging to the Government of the Philippines or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of their official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense and to the grave damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines."<br><br>Although E.O. No. 1 and the other issuances dealing with ill-gotten wealth (<i>i.e</i>., E.O. No. 2, E.O. No. 14, and E.O. No. 14-A) only identified the subject matter of ill-gotten wealth and the persons who could amass ill-gotten wealth and did not include an explicit definition of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i>, we can still discern the meaning and concept of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> from the WHEREAS Clauses themselves of E.O. No. 1, in that <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> consisted of the "<i>vast resources of the government</i>" amassed by "former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives and close associates both here and abroad." It is clear, therefore, that <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> would not include all the properties of President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates but only the part that originated from the "vast resources of the government."<br><br>In time and unavoidably, the Supreme Court elaborated on the meaning and concept of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i>. In <i>Bataan Shipyard &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. v. Presidential Commission on Good Government</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> or <i>BASECO</i>, for the sake of brevity, the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>xxx until it can be determined, through appropriate judicial proceedings, <b>whether the property was in truth "ill-gotten,"</b> <i>i.e</i>., acquired&nbsp; through or as a result of improper or illegal use of or the conversion of <b>funds belonging to the Government or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions,</b> or by taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence, resulting in unjust enrichment of the ostensible owner and grave damage and prejudice to the State.&nbsp; And this, too, is the sense in which the term is commonly understood in other jurisdictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote><br>The <i>BASECO</i> definition of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> was reiterated in <i>Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Lucio C. Tan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><i> </i>where the Court said:<br><br><blockquote>On this point, we find it relevant to define "ill-gotten wealth." In <i>Bataan Shipyard and Engineering Co., Inc.</i>, this Court described "ill-gotten wealth" as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Ill-gotten wealth is that acquired through or as a result of improper or illegal use of or the conversion of funds belonging to the Government or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence, resulting in unjust enrichment of the ostensible owner and grave damage and prejudice to the State. And this, too, is the sense in which the term is commonly understood in other jurisdiction."</blockquote><br>Concerning respondents' shares of stock here, there is no evidence presented by petitioner that they belong to the Government of the Philippines or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions.&nbsp; Nor is there evidence that respondents, taking undue advantage of their connections or relationship with former President Marcos or his family, relatives and close associates, were able to acquire those shares of stock.<br></blockquote><br>Incidentally, in its 1998 ruling in <i>Chavez v. Presidential Commission on Good Government</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the Court rendered an identical definition of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i>, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>xxx. We may also add that `ill-gotten wealth', by its very nature, assumes a public character. Based on the aforementioned Executive Orders, `ill-gotten wealth' refers to assets and properties purportedly acquired, directly or indirectly, by former President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives and close associates through <b>or as a result of their improper or illegal use of government funds or properties; or their having taken undue advantage of their public office; or their use of powers, influence or relationships</b>, "resulting in their unjust enrichment and causing grave damage and prejudice to the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines." <b>Clearly, the assets and properties referred to supposedly originated from the government itself</b>. <b>To all intents and purposes, therefore, they belong to the people. As such, upon reconveyance they will be returned to the public treasury</b>, subject only to the satisfaction of positive claims of certain persons as may be adjudged by competent courts.&nbsp; Another declared overriding consideration for the expeditious recovery of ill-gotten wealth is that it may be used for national economic recovery.</blockquote><br>All these judicial pronouncements demand two concurring elements to be present before assets or properties were considered as <i>ill-gotten wealth,</i> namely: (<i>a</i>) they must have "originated from the government itself," and (<i>b</i>) they must have been taken by former President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates <i>by illegal means</i>.<br><br>But settling the sources and the kinds of assets and property covered by E.O. No. 1 and related issuances did not complete the definition of <i>ill-gotten wealth</i>. The further requirement was that the assets and property should have been amassed by former President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates both here and abroad. In this regard, identifying former President Marcos, his immediate family, and relatives was not difficult, but identifying other persons who <i>might be</i> the <i>close associates</i> of former President Marcos presented an <i>inherent difficulty, </i>because<i> </i>it was not fair and just<i> </i>to include within the term <i>close associates</i> everyone who had had any association with President Marcos, his immediate family, and relatives.<br><br>Again, through several rulings, the Court became the arbiter to determine who were the close associates within the coverage of E.O. No. 1.<br><br>In <i>Republic v. MigriÃ±o</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> the Court held that respondents MigriÃ±o, <i>et al.</i> were not necessarily among the persons covered by the term <i>close subordinate</i> or <i>close associate</i> of former President Marcos by reason alone of their having served as government officials or employees during the Marcos administration, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b>It does not suffice, as in this case, that the respondent is or was a government official or employee during the administration of former Pres. Marcos. There must be a <i>prima facie</i> showing that the respondent unlawfully accumulated wealth by virtue of his close association or relation with former Pres. Marcos and/or his wife</b>. This is so because otherwise the respondent's case will fall under existing general laws and procedures on the matter. xxx</blockquote><br>In <i>Cruz, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> the Court declared that the petitioner was not a <i>close associate</i> as the term was used in E.O. No. 1 just because he had served as the President and General Manager of the GSIS during the Marcos administration.<br><br>In <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> the Court stated that respondent Maj. Gen. Josephus Q. Ramas' having been a Commanding General of the Philippine Army during the Marcos administration "d[id] not automatically make him a subordinate of former President Ferdinand Marcos as this term is used in Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A absent a showing that he enjoyed close association with former President Marcos."<br><br>It is well to point out, consequently, that the distinction laid down by E.O. No. 1 and its related issuances, and expounded by relevant judicial pronouncements unavoidably required <i>competent evidentiary substantiation</i> made in <i>appropriate judicial proceedings</i> to determine: (<i>a</i>) whether the assets or properties involved had come from the vast resources of government, and (<i>b</i>) whether the individuals owning or holding such assets or properties were close associates of President Marcos. The requirement of <i>competent evidentiary substantiation</i> made in <i>appropriate judicial proceedings</i> was imposed because the factual premises for the reconveyance of the assets or properties in favor of the government due to their being ill-gotten wealth could not be simply assumed. Indeed, in <i>BASECO</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> the Court made this clear enough by emphatically observing:<br><br><blockquote>6.&nbsp; <i>Government's Right and Duty to Recover All Ill-gotten Wealth</i><br><br>There can be no debate about the validity and eminent propriety of the Government's plan "to recover all ill-gotten wealth."<br><br>Neither can there be any debate about the proposition that assuming the above described factual premises of the Executive Orders and Proclamation No. 3 to be true, to be demonstrable by competent evidence, the recovery from Marcos, his family and his minions of the assets and properties involved, is not only a right but a duty on the part of Government.<br><br><b>But however plain and valid that right and duty may be, still a balance must be sought with the equally compelling necessity that a proper respect be accorded and adequate protection assured, the fundamental rights of private property and free enterprise</b> which are deemed pillars of a free society such as ours, and to which all members of that society may without exception lay claim.<br><br>xxx Democracy, as a way of life enshrined in the Constitution, embraces as its necessary components freedom of conscience, freedom of expression, and freedom in the pursuit of happiness. <i>Along with these freedoms are included economic freedom and freedom of enterprise</i> within reasonable bounds and under proper control. xxx Evincing much concern for the protection of property, the Constitution distinctly recognizes the preferred position which real estate has occupied in law for ages.&nbsp; <i>Property is bound up with every aspect of social life in a democracy as democracy is conceived in the Constitution</i>.&nbsp; The Constitution realizes the indispensable role which property, owned in reasonable quantities and used legitimately, plays in the stimulation to economic effort and the formation and growth of a solid social middle class that is said to be the bulwark of democracy and the backbone of every progressive and happy country.<br><br>a. <b><i> Need of Evidentiary Substantiation in Proper Suit</i></b><br><br>Consequently, <b>the factual premises of the Executive Orders cannot simply be assumed.&nbsp; They will have to be duly established by adequate proof in each case, in a proper judicial proceeding, so that the recovery of the ill-gotten wealth may be validly and properly adjudged and consummated;</b> although there are some who maintain that the fact -- that an immense fortune, and "vast resources of the government have been amassed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates both here and abroad," and they have resorted to all sorts of clever schemes and manipulations to disguise and hide their illicit acquisitions -- is within the realm of judicial notice, being of so extensive notoriety as to dispense with proof thereof. <b>Be this as it may, the requirement of evidentiary substantiation has been expressly acknowledged, and the procedure to be followed explicitly laid down, in Executive Order No. 14.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></blockquote><br>Accordingly, the Republic should furnish to the Sandiganbayan in proper judicial proceedings the competent evidence proving who were the close associates of President Marcos who had amassed assets and properties that would be rightly considered as <i>ill-gotten wealth.</i><br><br><center><b>III.</b><br><b>Summary Judgment was not warranted;</b><br><b>The Republic should have adduced evidence</b><br><b>to substantiate its allegations against the Respondents</b><br></center><br>We affirm the decision of November 28, 2007, because the Republic did not discharge its burden as the plaintiff to establish by preponderance of evidence that the respondents' SMC shares were illegally acquired with coconut-levy funds.<br><br>The decision of November 28, 2007 fully explained why the Sandiganbayan dismissed the Republic's case against Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i>, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Going over the evidence, especially the laws, <i>i.e.</i>, P.D. No. 961, P.D. No. 755, and P.D. No. 1468, over which plaintiff prayed that Court to take judicial notice of, it is worth noting that these same laws were cited by plaintiff when it filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings and/or summary judgment regarding the CIIF block of SMC shares of stock.&nbsp; Thus, the Court has already passed upon the same laws when it arrived at judgment determining ownership of the CIIF block of SMC shares of stock.&nbsp; Pertinently, in the Partial Summary Judgment promulgated on May 7, 2004, the Court gave the following rulings finding certain provisions of the above-cited laws to be constitutionally infirmed, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In this case, Section 2(d) and Section 9 and 10, Article III, of P.D. Nos. 961 and 1468 mandated the UCPB to utilize the CIIF, an accumulation of a portion of the CCSF and the CIDF, for investment in the form of shares of stock <i>in corporations organized for the purpose of engaging in the establishment and the operation of industries and commercial activities and other allied business undertakings</i> relating to coconut and other palm oils industry in all aspects.&nbsp; The investments made by UCPB in CIIF companies are required by the said Decrees to be equitably distributed for free by the said bank to the coconut farmers (Sec. 10, P.D. No. 961 and Sec. 10, P.D. No. 1468).&nbsp; The public purpose sought to be served by the free distribution of the shares of stock acquired with the use of public funds is not evident in the laws mentioned.&nbsp; More specifically, it is not clear how private ownership of the shares of stock acquired with public funds can serve a public purpose.&nbsp; The mode of distribution of the shares of stock also left much room for the diversion of assets acquired through public funds into private uses or to serve directly private interests, contrary to the Constitution.&nbsp; In the said distribution, defendants COCOFED, et al. and Ballares, et al. admitted that UCPB followed the administrative issuances of PCA which we found to be constitutionally objectionable in our Partial Summary Judgment in Civil Case No. 0033-A, the pertinent portions of which are quoted hereunder:<br><br><center>xxx xx xxx.<br></center><br>The distribution for free of the shares of stock of the CIIF Companies is tainted with the above-mentioned constitutional infirmities of the PCA administrative issuances.&nbsp; In view of the foregoing, we cannot consider the provision of P.D. No. 961 and P.D. No. 1468 and the implementing regulations issued by the PCA as valid legal basis to hold that assets acquired with public funds have legitimately become private properties.<br><br>The CIIF Companies having been acquired with public funds, the 14 CIIF-owned Holding Companies and all their assets, including the CIIF Block of SMC Shares, being public in character, belong to the government.&nbsp; Even granting that the 14 Holding Companies acquired the SMC Shares through CIIF advances and UCPB loans, said advances and loans are still the obligations of the said companies.&nbsp; The incorporating equity or capital of the 14 Holding Companies, which were allegedly used also for the acquisition of the subject SMC shares, being wholly owned by the CIIF Companies, likewise form part of the coconut levy funds, and thus belong to the government in trust for the ultimate beneficiaries thereof, which are all the coconut farmers.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx.<br></center></blockquote>And, with the above-findings of the Court, the CIIF block of SMC shares were subsequently declared to be of public character and should be reconveyed to the government in trust for coconut farmers.&nbsp; The foregoing findings notwithstanding, a question now arises on whether the same laws can likewise serve as ultimate basis for a finding that the Cojuangco, et al. block of SMC shares are also imbued with public character and should rightfully be reconveyed to the government.<br><br><b>On this point, the Court disagrees with plaintiff that reliance on said laws would suffice to prove that defendants Cojuangco, et al.'s acquisition of SMC shares of stock was illegal as public funds were used. For one, plaintiff's reliance thereon has always had reference only to the CIIF block of shares, and the Court has already settled the same by going over the laws and quoting related findings in the Partial Summary judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 0033-A.&nbsp; For another, the allegations of plaintiff pertaining to the Cojuangco block representing twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding capital stock of SMC stress defendant Cojuangco's acquisition by virtue of his positions as Chief Executive Officer of UCPB, a member-director of the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) Governing Board, and a director of the CIIF Oil Mills.&nbsp; Thus, reference to the said laws would not settle whether there was abuse on the part of defendants Cojuangco, et al. of their positions to acquire the SMC shares.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br><b>Besides, in the Resolution of the Court on plaintiff's Motion for Parial Summary Judgment (Re: Shares in San Miguel Corporation Registered in the Respective Names of Defendants Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. and the defendant Cojuangco Companies), the Court already rejected plaintiff's reference to said laws.&nbsp; In fact, the Court declined to grant plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment because it simply contended that defendant Cojuangco's statements in his pleadings, which plaintiff again offered in evidence herein, regarding the presentation of a possible CIIF witness as well as UCPB records can already be considered admissions of defendants' exclusive use and misuse of coconut levy funds.&nbsp; In the said resolution, the Court already reminded plaintiff that the issues cannot be resolved by plaintiff's interpretation of defendant Cojuangco's statements in his brief. Thus, the substantial portion of the Resolution of the Court denying plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is again quoted for emphasis:</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We cannot agree with the plaintiff's contention that the defendant's statements in his Pre-Trial Brief regarding the presentation of a possible CIIF witness as well as UCPB records, can already be considered as admissions of the defendant's exclusive use and misuse of coconut levy funds to acquire the subject SMC shares and defendant Cojuangco's alleged taking advantage of his positions to acquire the subject SMC shares.&nbsp; Moreover, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court "should take that view of the evidence most favorable to the party against whom it is directed, giving such party the benefit of all favorable inferences." <b><i>Inasmuch as this issue cannot be resolved merely from an interpretation of the defendant's statements in his brief, the UCPB records must be produced and the CIIF witness must be heard to ensure that the conclusions that will be derived have factual basis and are thus, valid.</i></b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment dated July 11, 2003 is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br><b>Even assuming that, as plaintiff prayed for, the Court takes judicial notice of the evidence it offered with respect to the Cojuangco block of SMC shares of stock, as contained in plaintiff's manifestation of purposes, still its evidence do not suffice to prove the material allegations in the complaint that Cojuangco took advantage of his positions in UCPB and PCA in order to acquire the said shares.&nbsp; As above-quoted, the Court, itself, has already ruled, and hereby stress that "UCPB records must be produced and the CIIF witness must be heard to ensure that the conclusions that will be derived have factual basis and are thus, valid." Besides, the Court found that there are genuine factual issues raised by defendants that need to be threshed out in a full-blown trial, and which plaintiff had the burden to substantially prove.&nbsp; Thus, the Court outlined these genuine factual issues as follows:</b><br><br><blockquote><b>1) What are the "various sources" of funds, which defendant Cojuangco and his companies claim they utilized to acquire the disputed SMC shares?</b><br><br><b>2) Whether or not such funds acquired from alleged "various sources" can be considered coconut levy funds;</b><br><br><b>3) Whether or not defendant Cojuangco had indeed served in the governing bodies of PCA, UCPB and/or CIIF Oil Mills at the time the funds used to purchase the SMC shares were obtained such that he owed a fiduciary duty to render an account to these entities as well as to the coconut farmers;</b><br><br><b>4) Whether or not defendant Cojuangco took advantage of his position and/or close ties with then President Marcos to obtain favorable concessions or exemptions from the usual financial requirements from the lending banks and/or coco-levy funded companies, in order to raise the funds to acquire the disputed SMC shares; and if so, what are these favorable concessions or exemptions?</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Answers to these issues <b>are not evident from the submissions of plaintiff and <i>must therefore be proven through the presentation of relevant and competent evidence during trial.</i>&nbsp; </b>A perusal of the subject Motion shows that the plaintiff <b>hastily derived conclusions from the defendants' statements in their previous pleadings although such conclusions were not supported by categorical facts <i>but only mere inferences.</i></b>&nbsp; xxx xxx xxx." (Emphasis supplied) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup></blockquote><br>Despite the foregoing pronouncement of the Court, plaintiff did not present any other evidence during the trial of this case but instead made its manifestation of purposes, that later served as its offer of evidence in the instant case, that merely used the same evidence it had already relied upon when it moved for partial summary judgment over the Cojuangco block of SMC shares. Altogether, the Court finds the same insufficient to prove plaintiff's allegations in the complaint because more than judicial notices, the factual issues require the presentation of admissible, competent and relevant evidence in accordance with Sections 3 and 4, Rule 128 of the Rules on Evidence.<br><br>Moreover, the propriety of taking judicial notice of plaintiff's exhibits is aptly questioned by defendants Cojuangco, et al.&nbsp; Certainly, the Court can take judicial notice of laws pertaining to the coconut levy funds as well as decisions of the Supreme Court relative thereto, but taking judicial notice does not mean that the Court would accord full probative value to these exhibits.&nbsp; Judicial notice is based upon convenience and expediency for it would certainly be superfluous, inconvenient, and expensive both to parties and the court to require proof, in the ordinary way, of facts which are already known to courts.&nbsp; However, <b>a court cannot take judicial notice of a factual matter in controversy.&nbsp; Certainly, there are genuine factual matters in the instant case, as above-cited, which plaintiff ought to have proven with relevant and competent evidence other than the exhibits it offered</b>.<br><br>Referring to plaintiff's causes of action against defendants Cojuangco, et al., <b>the Court finds its evidence insufficient to prove that the source of funds used to purchase SMC shares indeed came from coconut levy funds</b>. In fact, there is no direct link that the loans obtained by defendant Cojuangco, Jr. were the same money used to pay for the SMC shares. The scheme alleged to have been taken by defendant Cojuangco, Jr. was not even established by any paper trail or testimonial evidence that would have identified the same.&nbsp; On account of his positions in the UCPB, PCA and the CIIF Oil Mills, the Court cannot conclude that he violated the fiduciary obligations of the positions he held in the absence of proof that he was so actuated and that he abused his positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup></blockquote><br>It was plain, indeed, that Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> had tendered genuine issues through their responsive pleadings and did not admit that the acquisition of the Cojuangco block of SMC shares had been illegal, or had been made with public funds. As a result, the Republic needed to establish its allegations with preponderant competent evidence, because, as earlier stated, the fact that property was ill gotten could not be presumed but must be substantiated with competent proof adduced in proper judicial proceedings. That the Republic opted not to adduce competent evidence thereon despite stern reminders and warnings from the Sandiganbayan to do so revealed that the Republic did not have the competent evidence to prove its allegations against Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i><br><br>Still, the Republic, relying on the 2001 holding in <i>Republic v. COCOFED</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> pleads in its petition for review (G.R. No. 180702) that:<br><br><blockquote>With all due respect, the Honorable Sandiganbayan failed to consider legal precepts and procedural principles<br> vis-Ã -vis the records of the case showing that the funds or "various loans" or "advances" used in the acquisition of the disputed SMC Shares ultimately came from the coconut levy funds.<br><br>As discussed hereunder, respondents' own admissions in their Answers and Pre-Trial Briefs confirm that the "various sources" of funds utilized in the acquisition of the disputed SMC shares came from "borrowings" and "advances" from the UCPB and the CIIF Oil Mills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Thereby, the Republic would have the Sandiganbayan pronounce the block of SMC shares of stock acquired by Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> as <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> even without the Republic first presenting preponderant evidence establishing that such block had been acquired illegally and with the use of coconut levy funds.<br><br>The Court cannot heed the Republic's pleas<i> </i>for the following reasons:<br><br>To begin with, it is notable that the decision of November 28, 2007 <i>did not rule</i> on whether coconut levy funds were public funds or not. The silence of the Sandiganbayan on the matter was probably due to its not seeing the need for such ruling following its conclusion that the Republic had not preponderantly established the <i>source</i> of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the concerned SMC shares, and whether the shares had been acquired with the use of coconut levy funds.<br><br>Secondly, the ruling in <i>Republic v. COCOFED</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><i> </i>determined only whether certain stockholders of the UCPB could vote in the stockholders' meeting that had been called. The issue now before the Court could not be controlled by the ruling in<i> Republic v. COCOFED, </i>however, for even as that ruling determined the issue of voting, the Court was forthright enough about not thereby preempting the Sandiganbayan's decisions <i>on the merits</i> on <i>ill-gotten wealth</i> in the several cases then pending, including this one, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In making this ruling, we are in no way preempting the proceedings the Sandiganbayan may conduct or the final judgment it may promulgate in Civil Case No. 0033-A, 0033-B and 0033-F.&nbsp; Our determination here is merely <i>prima facie</i>, and should not bar the anti-graft court from making a final ruling, after proper trial and hearing, on the issues and prayers in the said civil cases, particularly in reference to the ownership of the subject shares.<br><br><b>We also lay down the caveat that, in declaring the coco levy funds to be <i>prima facie </i>public in character, we are not ruling in any final manner on their classification -- whether they are general or trust or special funds -- since such classification is not at issue here.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that the public nature of the coco levy funds is decreed by the Court only for the purpose of determining the right to vote the shares, pending the final outcome of the said civil cases.</b><br><br><b> Neither are we resolving in the present case the question of whether the shares held by Respondent Cojuangco are, as he claims, the result of private enterprise. This factual matter should also be taken up in the final decision in the cited cases that are pending in the court <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; Again, suffice it to say that the only issue settled here is the right of PCGG to vote the sequestered shares, pending the final outcome of said cases</b>.<br></blockquote><br>Thirdly, the Republic's assertion that coconut levy funds had been used to source the payment for the Cojuangco block of SMC shares was premised on its allegation that the UCPB and the CIIF Oil Mills were public corporations. But the premise was grossly erroneous and overly presumptuous, because:<br><br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) The fact of the UCPB and the CIIF Oil Mills being public corporations or government-owned or government-controlled corporations precisely remained <i>controverted</i> by Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> in light of the lack of any competent <i>to that effect</i> being in the records;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) Cojuangco explicitly averred in paragraph 2.01.(<i>b</i>) of his <i>Answer</i> that the UCPB was a "private corporation;" and<br><br>(<i>c</i>) The Republic did not competently identify or establish which ones of the Cojuangco corporations had supposedly received advances from the CIIF Oil Mills.<br></blockquote><br>Fourthly, the Republic asserts that the contested block of shares had been paid for with "borrowings" from the UCPB and "advances" from the CIIF Oil Mills, and that such borrowings and advances had been illegal because the shares had not been purchased for the "benefit of the Coconut Farmers." To buttress its assertion, the Republic relied on the admissions supposedly made in paragraph 2.01 of Cojuangco's <i>Answer</i> in relation to paragraph 4 of the Republic's <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint</i>.<br><br>The best way to know what paragraph 2.01 of Cojuangco's <i>Answer</i> admitted is to refer to both paragraph 4 of the <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint</i> and paragraph 2.01 of his <i>Answer, </i>which<i> </i>are hereunder quoted:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u>Paragraph 4 of the <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint</i></u><br></div><br>4.

 defendant specifically denies the rest of the allegations of paragraph

with the late Ferdinand Marcos or Imelda Marcos has been in connection 
with any of the acts or transactions alleged in the complaint or for any
 unlawful purpose.<br></blockquote><u><center><br></center></u>It is basic in remedial law that a defendant in a civil case must apprise the trial court and the adverse party of the facts alleged by the complaint that he admits and of the facts alleged by the complaint that he wishes to place into contention. The defendant does the former either by stating in his answer that they are true or by failing to properly deny them. There are two ways of denying alleged facts: one is by general denial, and the other, by specific denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>In this jurisdiction, only a specific denial shall be sufficient to place into contention an alleged fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Under Section 10,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Rule 8 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, a specific denial of an allegation of the complaint may be made in any of three ways, namely: (<i>a</i>) a defendant specifies each material allegation of fact the truth of which he does not admit and, whenever practicable, sets forth the substance of the matters upon which he relies to support his denial; (<i>b</i>) a defendant who desires to deny only a part of an averment specifies so much of it as is true and material and denies only the remainder; and (<i>c</i>) a defendant who is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of a material averment made in the complaint states so, which has the effect of a denial.<br><br>The express qualifications contained in paragraph 2.01 of Cojuangco's <i>Answer</i> constituted efficient specific denials of the averments of paragraph 2 of the Republic's <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint </i>under the first method mentioned in Section 10 of Rule 8, <i>supra</i>. Indeed, the aforequoted paragraphs of the <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint</i> and of Cojuangco's <i>Answer</i> indicate that Cojuangco thereby<i> expressly qualified </i>his admission of having been the President and a Director of the UCPB with the averment that the UCPB was a "private corporation;" that his <i>Answer</i>'s allegation of his being a member of the Board of Directors of the United Coconut Oil Mills, Inc. did not admit that he was a member of the Board of Directors of the CIIF Oil Mills, because the United Coconut Oil Mills, Inc. was not one of the CIIF Oil Mills; and that his <i>Answer</i> nowhere contained any admission or statement that he had held the various positions in the government or in the private corporations at the same time <i>and</i> in 1983, the time when the contested acquisition of the SMC shares of stock took place.<br><br>What the Court stated in <i>Bitong v. Court of Appeals (Fifth Division)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><i> </i>as to admissions is illuminating:<br><br><blockquote>When taken in its totality, the <i>Amended Answer to the Amended Petition, </i>or even the <i>Answer to the Amended Petition</i> alone, clearly raises an issue as to the legal personality of petitioner to file the complaint.&nbsp; <b>Every alleged admission is taken as an entirety of the fact which makes for the one side with the qualifications which limit, modify or destroy its effect on the other side.</b>&nbsp; The reason for this is, where part of a statement of a party is used against him as an admission, the court should weigh any other portion connected with the statement, which tends to neutralize or explain the portion which is against interest.<br><br>In other words, <b>while the admission is admissible in evidence, its probative value is to be determined from the whole statement and others intimately related or connected therewith as an integrated unit.</b> Although acts or facts admitted do not require proof and cannot be contradicted, however, evidence <i>aliunde </i>can be presented to show that the admission was made through palpable mistake.&nbsp; <b>The rule is always in favor of liberality in construction of pleadings so that the real matter in dispute may be submitted to the judgment of the court.</b></blockquote><br>And, lastly, the Republic cites the following portions of the joint Pre-Trial Brief of Cojuangco, <i>et al</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">IV.<br>PROPOSED EVIDENCE<br>xxx<br></div><br>4.01. xxx Assuming, however, that plaintiff presents evidence to support its principal contentions, defendant's evidence in rebuttal would include testimonial and documentary evidence showing: a) the ownership of the shares of stock prior to their acquisition by respondents (listed in Annexes `A" and `B"); b) the consideration for the acquisition of the shares of stock by the persons or companies in whose names the shares of stock are now registered; and c) <b>the source of the funds used to pay the purchase price.</b><br><br>4.02. <b>Herein respondents intend to present the following evidence:</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>b.

Such location indicated that the statements were only being <i>proposed</i>, that is, they were <i>not yet</i> intended or offered as admission of any fact stated therein. In other words, the matters stated or set forth therein might <i>or</i> might not be presented at all. Also, the text and tenor of the statements <i>expressly conditioned</i> the proposal on the Republic ultimately presenting its evidence in the action. After the Republic opted not to present its evidence, the condition did not transpire; hence, the proposed admissions, assuming that they were that, did not materialize.<br><br>Obviously, too, the statements found under the heading of <i>Proposed Evidence</i> in the joint Pre-Trial Brief were incomplete and inadequate on the important details of the <i>supposed</i> transactions (<i>i.e</i>., alleged borrowings and advances). As such, they could not constitute admissions that the funds had come from borrowings by Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> from the UCPB or had been credit advances from the CIIF Oil Companies. Moreover, the purpose for presenting the records of the UCPB and the representatives of the UCPB and of the still unidentified or unnamed CIIF Oil Mills as declared<i> </i>in the joint Pre-Trial Brief<i> </i>did not at all show whether the UCPB and/or the unidentified or unnamed CIIF Oil Mills were the <i>only</i> sources of funding, or that such institutions, assuming them to be the sources of the funding, had been the <i>only</i> sources of funding. Such ambiguousness disqualified the statements from being relied upon as admissions. It is fundamental that any statement, to be considered as an admission for purposes of judicial proceedings, should be <i>definite</i>, <i>certain</i> and <i>unequivocal</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> otherwise, the disputed fact will not get settled.<br><br>Another reason for rejecting the Republic's posture is that the Sandiganbayan, as the trial court, was in no position to <i>second-guess</i> what the non-presented records of the UCPB <i>would</i> show as the borrowings made by the corporations listed in Annexes A and B, or by the companies affiliated or associated with them, that "were used to source payment of the shares of stock of the San Miguel Corporation subject of this case," or what the representative of the UCPB or the representative of the CIIF Oil Mills would testify about loans or credit advances used to source the payment of the price of SMC shares of stock.<br><br>Lastly, the <i>Rules of Court</i> has no rule that treats the statements found under the heading <i>Proposed Evidence </i>as admissions binding Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> On the contrary, the <i>Rules of Court</i> has even distinguished between <i>admitted facts</i> and <i>facts proposed to be admitted</i> during the stage of pre-trial. Section 6 (b),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Rule 18 of the <i>Rules of Court,</i> requires a Pre-Trial Brief to include a <i>summary of admitted facts </i>and a<i> proposed stipulation of facts.</i> Complying with the requirement, the joint Pre-Trial Brief of Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> included the <i>summary of admitted facts </i>in its paragraph 3.00 of its Item III, separately and distinctly from the <i>Proposed Evidence</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center>III.<br>SUMMARY OF UNDISPUTED FACTS<br></center><br>3.00. Based on the complaint and the answer, the acquisition of the San Miguel shares by, and their registration in the names of, the companies listed in Annexes "A" and "B" may be deemed undisputed.<br><br>3.01. <b>All other allegations in the complaint are disputed</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></blockquote><br>The burden of proof, according to Section 1, Rule 131 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, is "the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to establish his claim or defense by the amount of evidence required by law." Here, the Republic, being the plaintiff, was the party that carried the burden of proof. That burden required it to demonstrate through competent evidence that the respondents, as defendants, had purchased the SMC shares of stock with the use of public funds; and that the affected shares of stock constituted <i>ill-gotten wealth</i>. The Republic was well apprised of its burden of proof, first through the joinder of issues made by the responsive pleadings of the defendants, including Cojuangco, <i>et al</i>. The Republic was further reminded through the pre-trial order and the Resolution denying its <i>Motion for Summary Judgment, supra,</i> of the duty to prove the factual allegations on ill-gotten wealth against Cojuangco, <i>et al</i>., specifically the following disputed matters:<br><br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) When the loans or advances were incurred;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) The amount of the loans from the UCPB and of the credit advances from the CIIF Oil Mills, including the specific CIIF Oil Mills involved;<br><br>(<i>c</i>) The identities of the borrowers, that is, all of the respondent corporations together, or separately; and the amounts of the borrowings;<br><br>(<i>d</i>) The conditions attendant to the loans or advances, if any;<br><br>(<i>e</i>) The manner, form, and time of the payments made to Zobel or to the Ayala Group, whether by check, letter of credit, or some other form; and<br><br>(<i>f</i>) Whether the loans were paid, and whether the advances were liquidated.</blockquote><br>With the Republic nonetheless choosing not to adduce evidence proving the factual allegations, particularly the aforementioned matters, and instead opting to pursue its claims by <i>Motion for Summary Judgment</i>, the Sandiganbayan became completely deprived of the means to know the necessary but crucial details of the transactions on the acquisition of the contested block of shares. The Republic's failure to adduce evidence shifted no burden to the respondents to establish anything, for it was basic that the party who asserts, not the party who denies, must prove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Indeed, in a civil action, the plaintiff has the burden of pleading every essential fact and element of the cause of action and proving them by preponderance of evidence. This means that if the defendant merely denies each of the plaintiff's allegations and neither side produces evidence on any such element, the plaintiff must necessarily fail in the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Thus, the Sandiganbayan correctly dismissed Civil Case No. 0033-F for failure of the Republic to prove its case by preponderant evidence.<br><br>A summary judgment under Rule 35 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> is a procedural technique that is proper only when there is no genuine issue as to the existence of a material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> It is a method intended to expedite or promptly dispose of cases where the facts appear <i>undisputed</i> and <i>certain</i> from the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Upon a motion for summary judgment the court's sole function is to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried, and all doubts as to the existence of an issue of fact must be resolved <i>against</i> the moving party. In other words, a party who moves for summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating clearly the absence of any genuine issue of fact, and any doubt as to the existence of such an issue is resolved against the movant.&nbsp; Thus, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court should take that view of the evidence most favorable to the party against whom it is directed, giving that party the benefit of all favorable inferences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>The term <i>genuine issue</i> has been defined as an issue of fact that calls for the presentation of evidence as distinguished from an issue that is sham, fictitious, contrived, set up in bad faith, and patently unsubstantial so as not to constitute a genuine issue for trial. The court can determine this on the basis of the pleadings, admissions, documents, affidavits, and counter-affidavits submitted by the parties to the court. Where the facts pleaded by the parties are disputed or contested, proceedings for a summary judgment cannot take the place of a trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Well-settled is the rule that a party who moves for summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating clearly the absence of any genuine issue of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Upon that party's shoulders rests the burden to prove the cause of action, and to show that the defense is interposed solely for the purpose of delay. After the burden has been discharged, the defendant has the burden to show facts sufficient to entitle him to defend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> Any doubt as to the propriety of a summary judgment shall be resolved against the moving party.<br><br>We need not stress that the trial courts have limited authority to render summary judgments and may do so only in cases where no genuine issue as to any material fact clearly exists between the parties.&nbsp; The rule on summary judgment does not invest the trial courts with jurisdiction to try summarily the factual issues upon affidavits, but authorizes summary judgment only when it appears clear that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br><center><b>IV.</b><br><b>Republic's burden to establish by preponderance of evidence<br> that respondents' SMC shares had been illegally acquired with coconut-levy <br>funds was not discharged</b></center><br><br>Madame Justice Carpio Morales argues in her dissent that although the contested SMC shares could be inescapably treated as fruits of funds that are <i>prima facie</i> public in character, Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> abstained from presenting countervailing evidence; and that with the Republic having shown that the SMC shares came into fruition from coco levy funds that are <i>prima facie</i> public funds, Cojuangco, <i>et al.</i> had to go forward with contradicting evidence, but did not.<br><br>The Court disagrees.

It did not also establish whether or not the loans were DOSRI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> or issued in violation of the Single Borrower's Limit. Secondly, the Republic could not outrightly assume that President Marcos had issued LOI 926 for the purpose of allowing the loans by the UCPB in favor of Cojuangco. There must be competent evidence to that effect. And, finally, the loans, assuming that they were of a DOSRI nature or without the benefit of the required approvals or in excess of the Single Borrower's Limit, would not be void for that reason. Instead, the bank or the officers responsible for the approval and grant of the DOSRI loan would be subject only to sanctions under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br><center><b>VI.</b><br><b>Cojuangco violated no fiduciary duties</b><br></center><br>The Republic invokes the following pertinent statutory provisions of the <i>Civil Code</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Article 1455.&nbsp; When any trustee, guardian or other person holding a fiduciary relationship uses trust funds for the purchase of property and causes the conveyance to be made to him or to a third person, a trust is established by operation of law in favor of the person to whom the funds belong.<br><br>Article 1456.&nbsp; If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it s by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes.<br></blockquote><br>and the <i>Corporation Code</i>, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 31. <i>Liability of directors, trustees or officers.--</i>Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation or acquire any personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with their duty as such directors, or trustees shall be liable jointly and severally for all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its stockholders or members and other persons.<br><br>When a director, trustee or officer attempts to acquire or acquires, in violation of his duty, any interest adverse to the corporation in respect of any matter which has been reposed in him in confidence, as to which equity imposes a disability upon him to deal in his own behalf, he shall be liable as a trustee for the corporation and must account for the profits which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation.</blockquote><br>Did Cojuangco breach his "fiduciary duties" as an officer and member of the Board of Directors of the UCPB? Did his acquisition and holding of the contested SMC shares come under a constructive trust in favor of the Republic?<br><br>The answers to these queries are in the negative.<br><br>The conditions for the application of Articles 1455 and 1456 of the <i>Civil Code </i>(like the trustee using trust funds to purchase, or a person acquiring property through mistake or fraud), and Section 31 of the <i>Corporation Code</i> (like a director or trustee willfully and knowingly voting for or assenting to patently unlawful acts of the corporation, among others) require factual foundations to be first laid out in appropriate judicial proceedings. Hence, concluding that Cojuangco breached fiduciary duties as an officer and member of the Board of Directors of the UCPB <i>without competent evidence thereon</i> would be unwarranted and unreasonable.<br><br>Thus, the Sandiganbayan could not fairly find that Cojuangco had committed breach of any fiduciary duties as an officer and member of the Board of Directors of the UCPB. For one, the <i>Amended</i> <i>Complaint</i> contained no clear factual allegation on which to predicate the application of Articles 1455 and 1456 of the <i>Civil Code</i>, and Section 31 of the <i>Corporation Code</i>. Although the trust relationship supposedly arose from Cojuangco's being an officer and member of the Board of Directors of the UCPB, the <i>link</i> between this alleged fact and the borrowings or advances was not established.&nbsp; Nor was there evidence on the loans or borrowings, their amounts, the approving authority, <i>etc</i>. As trial court, the Sandiganbayan could not presume his breach of fiduciary duties without evidence showing so, for fraud or breach of trust is never presumed, but must be alleged <i>and</i> proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>The thrust of the Republic that the funds were <i>borrowed</i> or <i>lent</i> might even preclude any consequent trust implication. In a contract of loan, one of the parties (<i>creditor</i>) delivers money or other consumable thing to another (<i>debtor</i>) on the condition that the same amount of the same kind and quality shall be paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Owing to the consumable nature of the thing loaned, the resulting duty of the borrower in a contract of loan is <i>to pay,</i> not <i>to return,</i> to the creditor or lender the very thing loaned. This explains why the ownership of the thing loaned is transferred to the debtor upon perfection of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Ownership of the thing loaned having transferred, the debtor enjoys all the rights conferred to an owner of property, including the right to use and enjoy (<i>jus utendi</i>), to consume the thing by its use (<i>jus abutendi</i>), and to dispose (<i>jus disponendi</i>), subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Evidently, the resulting relationship between a creditor and debtor in a contract of loan cannot be characterized as fiduciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>To say that a relationship is fiduciary when existing laws do not provide for such requires evidence that confidence is reposed by one party in another who exercises dominion and influence. Absent any special facts and circumstances proving a higher degree of responsibility, any dealings between a lender and borrower are not fiduciary in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> This explains why, for example, a trust receipt transaction is not classified as a simple loan and is characterized as fiduciary, because the <i>Trust Receipts Law</i> (P.D.

As owner, the debtor can dispose of the thing borrowed and his act will not be considered misappropriation of the thing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> The only liability on his part is to pay the loan together with the interest that is either stipulated or provided under existing laws.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court dismisses the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> in G.R.

Cojuangco, Jr. (<i>Cojuangco</i>), 11 other individuals, and 71 corporations.&nbsp; The properties sought to be recovered were two blocks of SMC shares, generally described as follows:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; 33,133,266 SMC shares, labeled for convenience as the <b><i>"</i></b><b><i>Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)</i></b><i> <b>block"</b></i> or <b>"<i>CIIF block"</i></b> and registered in the names of 14 holding companies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>; and<br><br>(2) 16,276,545 SMC shares, known for convenience as the <b>"<i>Cojuangco block</i>"</b> and registered in the names of the 44 respondent corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The CIIF block was subsequently awarded to the Republic by the Sandiganbayan in its Partial Summary Judgment promulgated on May 7, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; This judgment lapsed to finality and was duly executed.&nbsp; Litigation on the Cojuangco block continued.&nbsp; This is the aspect of Civil Case No. 0033-F that is now before the Court through the present consolidated petitions.<br><br><b>A.&nbsp; <u>The Complaint</u></b><br><br>In its complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Republic claimed that Cojuangco served as a public officer during the Marcos administration.&nbsp; In the course of this service, he acquired assets, funds, and other properties manifestly disproportionate to his lawful income. He allegedly had control over the coconut levy funds, which he misused to buy out the majority of the outstanding shares of SMC.&nbsp; In 1983, he bought most of the 20 million shares of Enrique Zobel in SMC. Allegedly, the Cojuangco block numbered&nbsp; <b>16,276,897 shares </b>and were worth $49,000,000. Some of these shares were placed in the names of Meadowlark Plantations, Inc. and Primavera Farms, Inc., which are also defendants in Civil Case No. 0033-F.&nbsp; The Articles of Incorporation of Meadowlark Plantations, Inc., Primavera Farms, Inc., and Silver Leaf Plantations, Inc. show that Atty. Jose C. Concepcion owned 99.6% of their outstanding stocks. His shares in these companies, however, were covered by three documents entitled <b><i>Declaration of Trust and Assignment of Subscription,</i></b> which he had executed in favor of an unnamed assignee. Additionally, Atty. Concepcion and four other stockholders of the three corporations executed <b><i>Voting Trust Agreements</i></b> in favor of Cojuangco.&nbsp; (Thus, the shares - while really belonging to an unknown assignee - were controlled and could be voted by Cojuangco.) The other defendant corporations (also respondents in the present petitions) are purportedly owned by interlocking directors who have admitted their status as mere "nominee" stockholders. The Republic claimed that the respondents used the funds advanced by six large coconut oil mills and 10 <i>copra</i> trading companies and borrowed as well from the United Coconut Planters Bank (<i>UCPB</i>) to purchase the holding companies and the SMC shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Republic alleged, too, that Cojuangco acquired the SMC shares in breach of public trust and by abuse of right and power, resulting in his unjust enrichment. Thus, it sought to recover the funds and properties, including their increments (such as cash and stock dividends and interests), as these are properties held under constructive trust for the Republic.&nbsp; It likewise prayed for the award of damages - actual, moral, temperate, nominal, and exemplary - and attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and treble judicial costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><b>B. <u>The Answer</u></b><br><br>In his <i>Answer</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Cojuangco denied that he engaged in any unlawful transaction and used coconut levy funds in acquiring the subject property.

The Sandiganbayan ruled that the provisions in PD No. 755, 961 and 1468 -- mandating the free distribution of the UCPB shares and of the bank's investments in the CIIF Companies to the coconut farmers -- are fatally defective for failing to show how the avowed public purpose of the same laws could be achieved by the free distribution of shares. It added that the laws failed to provide sufficient standards to guide the PCA in promulgating rules and regulations to effect the free distribution. The Sandiganbayan categorically stated:<br><br><blockquote>The investments made by UCPB in CIIF Companies are required by [P.D. 755, 961 and 1468] to be equally distributed <b>for free</b> by [UCPB] to the coconut farmers.

Thus, the <b>first cause of action</b> was for the recovery of properties that were alleged to be manifestly disproportionate to Cojuangco's income. The <b>second</b> was to recover the properties that Cojuangco allegedly acquired in breach of the public trust through abuse of the power he enjoyed because of his close association with former President Marcos.<br><br>Somewhere in the course of prosecuting the case, the Republic dropped its pursuit of the first cause of action.&nbsp; Thus, this claim proved to be a road not taken for the government.&nbsp; The <b>second cause of action</b>, on the other hand and for purposes perhaps of an orderly and logical handling, was divided into two aspects with different set of objectives.&nbsp; The <b>first aspect</b> identified and concentrated on the CIIF block of SMC shares registered in the names of 14 holding companies (which in turn were formed by the six CIIF Oil Mills where UCPB had made coconut levy fund investments).&nbsp; The <b>second</b>, identified as the Cojuangco block of SMC shares, concentrated on Cojuangco and the companies he established to purchase the SMC shares.&nbsp; The loans from the UCPB and the advances from the CIIF Oil Mills were alleged to be the conduits through which coconut levy funds were channeled and used to pay for the purchased SMC shares.<br><br>After pre-trial, the Republic separately moved for partial summary judgments for the CIIF block and for the Cojuangco block, believing - rightly or wrongly - that enough undisputed facts existed to justify a judgment on the merits. The motion covering the CIIF block met favorable response from the Sandiganbayan, whose award of the shares to the Republic did not merit any contrary response from Conjuangco; faced with the Sandiganbayan judgment, the opposition that Cojuangco and the other respondents initially showed simply melted.&nbsp; Thus, this aspect of the case faded into the background, together with the first cause of action for unjust enrichment.&nbsp; The Cojuangco block aspect, on the other hand, continued to be litigated under the theory that Cojuangco amassed these shares through abuse of power made possible by his close association with the martial law regime.<br><br>In another turn of events, the counsels for the Republic chose not to go to trial <b>despite</b> an earlier rejection of its motion for summary judgment and the unmistakable signals from the Sandiganbayan that it considered the case unripe for submission for decision.&nbsp; Instead, the Republic served a <i>Manifestation of Purpose</i> that the Sandiganbayan chose to regard as its formal offer of documentary evidence.&nbsp; Faced with this move, Cojuangco likewise chose not to submit evidence on the theory that the Republic's <b>submission</b>, composed mainly of <b><i>pleadings filed, decided cases</i></b> and <b><i>laws</i></b>, did not at all prove the allegations of the remaining aspect of the complaint.<br><br>A reminder of the wider view of the case as originally filed is offered as an opening in these Reflections in order to ensure that the original big picture is not forgotten. The original picture the Republic painted through the complaint is about <b><i>a series of interconnected moves</i></b> - <b><i>both at the CIIF end and from the end of Cojuangco, the UCPB, and the allied Cojuangco companies - where Cojuangco was at the center</i></b> to use the coconut levy funds, or the companies funded or supported by coconut levy funds, for the purchase of SMC shares.&nbsp; While the Republic itself, wittingly or unwittingly, has partitioned this big picture into a forgotten first cause of action and a second cause of action that was divided into two aspects, <b><i>this big picture and the grand and coordinated moves that it drew at the beginning should remain in mind as a background in viewing the remaining aspect under litigation.</i></b>&nbsp; This background may be useful in sifting through the facts established by the Partial Summary Judgment on the CIIF block of SMC shares for use in considering the present Cojuangco block aspect; <b>facts established between the same parties in one aspect of the same case should be conclusive in the remaining aspect of the case. </b>Advances from the CIIF Oil Mills were, after all, admitted by Cojuangco, as discussed below; the interconnectedness of the two aspects of the second cause of action are plain and evident and only remains to be linked by evidence. These established facts may also somehow contribute to a deeper understanding of the turn of events in the Republic's handling of and the developments in the case, leading to an unappealed partial summary judgment and the virtual refusal of the Republic's counsels to proceed to trial. Certainly, these established facts as well as the attendant circumstances and developments in the remaining Cojuangco block aspect of the case can be very useful in appreciating and judging the actions of the lawyers of the Republic in terms of the competence, degree of care and even the integrity they exhibited in handling the case.<br><br><b><i>A.2</i></b><i>. <b>W</b></i><b><i>hat is at stake - value of </i></b><br><br><b>&nbsp; </b><b><i>Cojuangco block of SMC shares</i></b><br><br>The Republic's Third Amended Complaint, filed in 1995, claimed ownership over the 16,276,545 of SMC shares that were allegedly acquired by Cojuangco in 1983 with the use of coconut levy funds.&nbsp; At the time of acquisition, this Cojuangco block of SMC shares constituted 20% of the total shareholdings of SMC and was purchased for US$49 million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Because&nbsp; of&nbsp; the issuance of new shares, the Cojuangco block's shareholding was reduced to 17% in 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and 15% in 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><b>&nbsp; As of December 2010, the remaining 15% shareholding translates to 493,375,183 common shares, and is worth about P84.56 billion</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><b> or US$1.86 billion.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; At the current exchange rate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the original acquisition cost of the shares is now equivalent to P2.23 billion, which means that over the past 27 years, the shares have ballooned 38 times its original value.<br><br>For added perspective, the shares' acquisition cost of US$49 million was equivalent to <b>0.94% of the national budget for 1982</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> it was also equivalent to 12.29% of the budget allocated for education,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> 307.83% of the budget for social service and development,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and 25.07% of the budget for health.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; The present worth of the shares (P84.56 billion) is equivalent to <b>5.49% of the entire national budget for 2010</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; This is also equivalent to about half the 2010 appropriation for education or 48.94%, 5.83% of the budget for social welfare and development, and 2.97% of the budget for health.<br><br>The SMC is one of the biggest conglomerates in the country.&nbsp; It is the leading food, beverage and packaging company, now with diversified interests and substantial investments in non-related industries like power and other utilities, banking, mining, energy, tollways, infrastructure, and airports.&nbsp; According to SMC's Annual Report for 2009, its total assets amount to P438.5 billion, and its income was P57.8 billion - double the amount appropriated in 2010 for health and social welfare, and one-third of that for education.&nbsp; SMC generates nearly 4% of the gross national product and pays 6% of the total taxes collected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Certainly, the State's recovery of the SMC shares, if substantiated, would translate into a significant increase in the government's assets and would be a steady source of income. <i>But the State's interest in SMC goes beyond these numerical figures.</i> The SMC is a company that has been in existence for over 120 years.

What the Republic claimed in its Memorandum of January 19, 2007 - that it should have been UCPB and CIIF Oil Mills and not the respondents who should have purchased the subject shares<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> - would also apply.&nbsp; However, if the amount that Cojuangco borrowed consisted of funds that the UCPB could use for other investments, then no sufficient basis exists under the <i>ultra vires</i> rule to claim that the loans granted to Cojuangco for the purchase of SMC shares had been contrary to UCPB's purpose under PD No. 755. Under this situation, UCPB's grant of the loan for the purchase of SMC shares, by itself, would not constitute an <i>ultra vires</i> act, unless the Republic specifies some other irregularity whose consequence is to make the act <i>ultra vires</i>.<br><br><b><i>E.2&nbsp; Breach of Fiduciary Duties </i></b><br><br>The grant of loans to Cojuangco, who was a director and officer of UCPB at the time that the shares were purchased, raises propriety questions under Sections 31 and 34 of the Corporation Code which provide:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 31 <i>Liability of directors, trustees or officers</i>.--Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation or <b>acquire any personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with their duty as such directors or trustees shall be liable jointly and severally for all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its stockholders or members and other persons.</b><br><br>When <b>a director, trustee, or officer attempts to acquire or acquires, in violation of his duty, any interest adverse to the corporation</b> in respect of any matter which has been reposed in him in confidence, as to which equity imposes a disability upon him to deal in his own behalf, he shall be liable as a trustee for the corporation and <b>must account for the profits</b> which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Section 34.&nbsp; <i>Disloyalty of a director</i>.--Where a director, by virtue of his office, <b>acquires for himself a business opportunity which should belong to the corporation, thereby obtaining profits to the prejudice of such corporation, he must account to the latter for all such profits by refunding the same</b>, unless his act has been ratified by a vote of the stockholders owning or representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding capital stock.&nbsp; This provision shall be applicable, notwithstanding the fact that the director risked his own funds in the venture. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>As early as 1929, the Court recognized the rule that directors of a corporation are bound to care for its property and manage its affairs in good faith. If a violation of these duties results in the waste of corporate assets or injury to corporate property, the directors, like other trustees, are liable for the waste or injury.&nbsp; If they perform acts clearly beyond their power, whereby loss ensues to the corporation, or dispose of its property or pay away its money without authority, they will be required to pay for the loss out of their private assets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Notably, in<i> Palting v.

This trust relationship is not a matter of statutory or technical law; it springs from the fact that directors have the control and guidance of corporate affairs and property and, hence, of the property and interests of the stockholders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In <i>Bailey v.

As the plaintiff who made the positive allegation that Cojuangco was a UCPB officer and director in 1983, the Republic has the obligation to prove this fact.&nbsp; What is baffling, however, about this disputed issue is the fact that the <b>certification of the UCPB corporate secretary</b> - <b><i>already in the Republic's possession and annexed to one of its pleadings</i></b> <b><i>- was not formally presented as evidence.</i></b>&nbsp; There is nothing in the rules of evidence that shifts the burden of proof on Cojuangco merely because he made a general statement that he served as a public officer during the Marcos Administration.&nbsp; More importantly, <b><i>the Republic did not even state the amount of the UCPB loan which was used to purchase the SMC shares or how many of these shares were purchased with the proceeds of the UCPB loan.</i></b>&nbsp; In contrast with this apparent discrepancy between the Republic's factual allegations and supporting evidence, the plaintiff in <i>Bailey</i> had been able to describe in detail the advances taken by the erring director - <i>i.e</i>., when they were taken, the details of his purchase and sale of the relevant shares. Without clarificatory evidence on how much of the UCPB funds were used; and how many shares were acquired; whether Cojuangco was indeed an officer at the time; and how Board approval was made -- this Court has no basis to award to the Republic all the shares claimed for reversion.<br><br><b><i>E.3.&nbsp; Violation of single-borrowers </i></b><br><b><i>&nbsp; limit and DOSRI rules </i></b><br><br>At the time the alleged transactions took place in 1983, Sections 23 and 83 of the General Banking Act, as amended - <i>i.e.,</i> the rules on the single borrower's limit and liabilities of directors, officers, stockholders (<i>DOSRI</i>) - were already in place.&nbsp; These Sections respectively state:<br><br><blockquote>Section 23.&nbsp; Except as the Monetary Board may otherwise prescribe, the total liabilities of any person, company, corporation or firm, to a commercial banking corporation for money borrowed, excluding (a) loans secured by obligations of the Central Bank or of the Philippine Government; (b) loans fully guaranteed by the government as to the payment of the principal and interest; (c) loans to the extent covered by holding out on, or assignment of, deposits; and (d) other loans or credits which the Monetary Board may, from time to time, specify as non-risk assets, shall at no time exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the unimpaired capital and surplus of such bank.<br><br>The total liabilities of any borrower may amount to a further fifteen (15%) of the unimpaired capital and surplus of such banking corporation provided the additional liabilities are adequately secured by shipping documents, warehouse receipts or other similar documents transferring or securing title covering readily marketable, non-perishable staples, which staples must be fully covered by insurance, and must have a market value equal to at least one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of such additional liabilities.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Section 83.&nbsp; No director or officer of any banking institution shall, either directly or indirectly, for himself or as representative or agent of others, borrow any of the deposits of funds of such bank nor shall he become a guarantor, indorser, or surety for loans from such bank to others, or in any manner be an obligor for moneys borrowed from the bank or loaned by it, except with the written approval of the majority of the directors of the bank, excluding the director concerned.&nbsp; Any such approval shall be entered upon the records of the corporation and a copy of such entry shall be transmitted forthwith to the Superintendent of Banks. The office of any director or officer of a bank who violates the provisions of this section shall immediately become vacant and the director or officer shall be punished with imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than ten years and by a fine of not less than one thousand nor more than ten thousand pesos.<br><br>The Monetary Board may regulate the amount of credit accommodations that may be extended, directly or indirectly, by banking institutions to their directors, officers or stockholders.&nbsp; However, the outstanding credit accommodations which a bank may extend to each of its stockholders owning two percent (2%) or more of the subscribed capital stock, its directors, or its officers, shall be limited to an amount equivalent to the respective outstanding deposits and book value of the paid-in capital&nbsp; contribution in the bank: Provided, however, that loans and advances to officers in the form of fringe benefits granted in accordance with the rules and regulations as may be prescribed by Monetary Board shall not be subject to the preceding limitation.</blockquote><br>Cojuangco claims exemption from these provisions on the strength of&nbsp; Letter of Instructions No. (<i>LOI</i>) 926.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>&nbsp; I agree with the <i>ponencia</i>, however, that Cojuangco cannot seek refuge under this LOI, since the exemption covers only the borrowings of participating oil mills and private corporations organized to serve as instruments to pool and coordinate the resources of the coconut farmers and oil millers, not those of individuals such as Cojuangco or the respondent corporations who acted as nominal stockholders.&nbsp; LOI 926, too, required the loans to be used to finance <i>capital expenditures</i>, not investments in shares of stock.<br><br>Despite this view, however, I disagree that the Republic successfully established that these provisions were violated or that these laws can be the basis for the return of the SMC shares.&nbsp; To reiterate, the Republic has neither stated nor proved the amount of the UCPB loans taken to purchase the SMC shares or the unimpaired capital or the surplus of UCPB; it utterly failed to support the details of whatever loans had been taken with sufficient evidence.&nbsp; Thus, the Court cannot declare that the 15% limitation under the single borrower's limit was breached.&nbsp; Similarly, there can be no violation of the DOSRI rules where the manner under which the loan was taken was not alleged; the Republic failed to prove whether or not the UCPB board of directors approved the loans in question.<br><br><b>F.&nbsp; <u>Close Association with President Marcos</u></b><br><br>A close examination of the records fails to reveal any specific allegation, much less proof, that Cojuangco amassed ill-gotten SMC shares because he is a relative or was a close associate of the late President Ferdinand Marcos.&nbsp; While the media may be replete with stories of Cojuangco's close relationship with President Marcos and his family, these stories are not evidence unless testified to by a competent witness or are&nbsp; materials that can be subject of judicial notice.&nbsp; At the most, what appears in the offered evidence in this case are admissions by Cojuangco of the positions he assumed in government, specifically at the PCA and at the UCPB.&nbsp; The Republic's <i>Reply</i> dated October 2, 2003, too, contained attached documents indicating the positions he assumed at the UCPB and its allied companies and in the CIIF oil mills or its holding companies. These documents, however, were never marked as exhibits and offered as evidence.&nbsp; Even if they had been so marked and offered, however, these may not suffice to prove "close association" under the standards of the jurisprudence on this point - not every senior official of the Marcos government falls under the category of a "close associate";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> proof of this type of association has to be adduced.&nbsp; Again, the Republic failed on this point.<br><br><b>G.&nbsp; <u>Conclusions</u></b><br><br>Based on the above considerations, I would agree with Justice Bersamin that the Republic had failed to preponderantly establish its claim.&nbsp; The Republic has taken a significant step in proving a claim for reversion of ill-gotten wealth against Cojuangco, but simply failed to make a complete case leading to that conclusion.<br><br>Despite this conclusion, I do not agree that the Court should simply dismiss the petition and affirm the Sandiganbayan's decision.&nbsp; This decision - while seemingly correct on the basis of the evidence presented and recognized - cannot and should not be allowed to bind the Republic in light of the massive violation of its right to due process through the fatal omissions that the Republic's counsels made in handling the case.&nbsp; <b>In the absence of any clear evidence pointing to a criminal act under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act or Republic Act (<i>RA</i>) No. 3019, the counsels mishandling of the case should be held responsible for gross negligence.&nbsp; Thus, un urgent point to consider in the review of the records of this case and of the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan is whether the Republic's counsels substantially fulfilled their duty to handle the Republic's case competently and responsibly.</b>&nbsp; As heretofore discussed, at stake are not only the substantial SMC shares involved but the integrity of government processes and its political will in addressing claimed abuses under the martial law regime.<br><br><center><u><b>III</b><b>.

Even at that, it refused to go to trial; it submitted its case on the basis of an offer of evidence consisting of materials that need not even be offered because they are part of the records or are matters appropriate for judicial notice.<br><br>To reiterate <i>for emphasis</i> what have heretofore been pointed out, (1) a cause of action duly pleaded was simply abandoned and completely forgotten; (2) materials proposed to be presented as evidence in the pre-trial brief or which were already mentioned in the pleadings were never introduced as evidence; (3) public documents available in governments records do not appear to have been considered; (4) likewise the availability of compulsory processes to compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of records were hardly availed of; (5) clear signals and warnings from the Sandiganbayan and even from the respondents went unheeded or unnoticed; (6) counsels patently exhibited lack of preparation, causing delays at the instance of the Republic; (7) the evidence offered were not evidence at all but were to confined to pleadings already on record, and laws and Supreme Court decisions that can be cited without need of offering them as evidence; and finally, (8) counsels simply refused to go to trial despite an incomplete case. <b>These are acts or omissions in the handling of the case that cannot be labeled as criminal for lack of clear evidence of the intent to place the government at a disadvantage and of the active motivation that drove this intent, but they can, at the very least, be labeled as gross negligence in the handling of the case, resulting at the Sandiganbayan level, in the denial of a fair opportunity for the government to present a case with a fair chance&nbsp; of achieving the recovery it sought. </b><br><br><b>A. </b><b><u>Abandonment of, or Negligence in Pursuing</u>, </b><br><b><u> Forfeiture Action under RA No. 1379</u></b><br><br>Sections 2 and 6 of RA No. 1379 authorize the recovery by the government of unlawfully acquired properties of public officers or employees:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2<b>.</b> <i>Filing of petition.</i> Whenever any public officer or employee has acquired during his incumbency an amount of property which is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer or employee and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired property, said property shall be presumed <i>prima facie</i> to have been unlawfully acquired.

Specifically, there must be:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; A <b>subject</b> or a public officer or employee, who is <b>any person holding any public office or employment</b> by virtue of an appointment, election or contract, <i>and</i> any person holding any office or employment, by appointment or contract, in any State owned or controlled corporation or enterprise;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; An<b> object </b>which refers to <b>the properties</b> acquired by the public officer during his incumbency <b>which are manifestly out of proportion to his salary</b> as officer and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired properties.</blockquote><br><br>Procedurally, Section 2 of RA No. 1379, as amended, requires a prior inquiry similar to a preliminary investigation in criminal cases to be made by the Ombudsman before a forfeiture proceeding can be initiated before the Court by the Solicitor General. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>In the present case, no prior inquiry appeared to have been conducted. Thus, Cojuangco raised this defense in his <i>Answer</i>, together with the time bar in bringing the complaint because of its proximity to an election.&nbsp; <b>Thereafter, the Republic simply disregarded its RA No. 1379 cause of action and does not appear to have ever undertaken any corrective action to continue to address the lapses that Cojuangco noted in his <i>Answer</i>.</b><br><br>Save for the noted lapses, however, a forfeiture action under RA No. 1379, was a very promising opportunity for government to achieve the reversion that it sought.&nbsp; All that is required for this kind of action is to show the concurrence of the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; <i>the offender is a public officer or employee</i>;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; <i>he acquired a considerable amount of money or property during his incumbency</i>; and<br><br>(3)&nbsp; <i>the amount is manifestly out of proportion to his salary as such public officer or employer and to his other lawful income and the income from legitimately acquired property</i>.<br></blockquote><br>Notably in this regard, the Republic's <i>Pre-Trial Brief</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> already mentioned the following documentary evidence:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; the <b>COA reports</b> (which the Sandiganbayan, however, expressly rejected in its extended Pre-Trial Order);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>(2)&nbsp; <b>Cojuangco's Statements of Assets and Liabilities</b> (<i>SAL</i>) for the years 1973, 1976, 1978, and <b>1982</b> <b>;</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> and<br><br>(3) a <b>Summation Analysis of the Wealth and Income </b>of Cojuangco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></blockquote><br>These were good starting points for a RA No. 1379 action as many other documentary evidence proving the elements of a forfeiture action are public documents that were already with, or could then easily be accessed by, the Republic.&nbsp; Notably, the Republic had in its possession proof that Cojuangco was a public officer and an admission that he was the beneficial owner of the shares. It would also seem that the PCGG had access to the SAL that Cojuangco filed during his incumbency and could have accessed other relevant documents through compulsory process.<br><br>With these documentary evidence on hand or within reach, the Republic chose to actively pursue another cause of action - breach of fiduciary duties of a director, but likewise failed to present crucial evidence therefor, particularly the loan documents evidencing the loans that Cojuangco wrongfully obtained as director.&nbsp; Interestingly, even the above-listed documents were not among those offered as evidence through the Republic's <i>Manifestation of Purpose</i>.&nbsp; Notably missing, too, were Cojuangco's SAL for the <b>year 1983</b> (the year when he acquired the disputed SMC shares) and the testimony of those who prepared the COA reports (after the Sandiganbayan belittled the probative value of the COA reports in its denial of the motion for summary judgment), separately from the RA 1379 cause of action, these could have been useful evidence to establish the misuse of the coconut levy funds and establish the damage to the Republic through proof of Cojuangco's unjust enrichment.<br><br><b>B. </b><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Gross Negligence in Pursuing </b><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp; Action under EO No. 1</b><br><br>EO No. 1, in relation with EO Nos. 2, 14 and 14-A, is another law that authorizes the government to recover ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; A recovery action under EO No. 1 requires<br><br><b>(1)&nbsp; a subject defendant, </b>which refers to the former President Ferdinand E.

While RA No. 1379 broadly covers <i>all public officers</i>, EO No. 1 is confined to President Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates. Unlike EO No. 1, RA No. 1379 is not concerned with the manner of acquisition of the unlawfully acquired property. Despite these differences, both laws provide basis for the recovery or forfeiture of properties that rightfully belong to the State.<br><br>A reading of the complaint shows that the Republic's action for recovery under EO No. 1 of the Cojuangco block of SMC shares was premised on Cojuangco's act of supposedly <i>taking undue advantage of official position or authority</i>, resulting in his unjust enrichment and grave damage and prejudice to the State. Thus, <b>it was crucial for the Republic to prove that, at the time the subject shares were acquired, Cojuangco occupied an official position.</b><br><br>While Cojuangco admitted that he (a) served as PCA Director and as President and Director of the UCPB; (b) acquired the SMC shares in 1983 and (c) used proceeds of loans and advances from UCPB and the CIIF Oil Mills, the Republic's submitted evidence and Cojuangco's admissions did not sufficiently prove that the details that EO No. 1 required, specifically, the period of Cojuangco's service as a public officer; the details of the loans and advances secured; whether and how much of these loans and advances funded the purchase of SMC shares; the details of the purchases made, when, by whom, for how much; the unjust enrichment on the part of Cojuangco and the prejudice to the government, in the manner done in <i>Bailey</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br><b>All these omissions cannot but be evidentiary gaps resulting from the counsel's gross negligence that should preclude the Court from entering a judgment of forfeiture in favor of the government.&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>C. </b><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Judicial Warnings on the </b><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><b style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; Completeness of&nbsp; the Petitioner's Case </b><br><br>At the scheduled pre-trial conference on May 24, 2000, the Sandiganbayan apparently forewarned the Republic that the court "has not been adequately enlightened as to the basis for [its] claims"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> in its <i>Third Amended Complaint</i> in Civil Case No. 0033-F.

These exhibits consisted of <b>four pleadings</b>, which were already part of the records, <b>three laws</b> and <b>two Supreme Court decisions.</b>&nbsp; In effect, the Republic presented as evidence documents that did not even have to be formally offered because they would have been admissible under judicial admissions and judicial notice.<br><br>What the Republic offered as evidence appears noticeably irregular, when compared with the evidence already in its possession as reflected in its pre-trial brief, specifically: (<b>1</b>) the Secretary's Certificate of UCPB and CIIF Oil Mills stating that Cojuangco was an officer and director of these entities in 1983; (<b>2</b>) Affidavits, Blank Declarations of Trust, and Voting Trust Agreements executed by the directors of the respondent corporations disclosing, for all intents and purposes, that they merely held the subject shares for Cojuangco; (<b>3</b>) Cojuangco's Statement of Assets and Liabilities (<i>SAL</i>) for the years 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1982. The Summation Analysis of Wealth and Income, a report prepared by PCGG and a part of the annexes of the Republic's <i>Pre-Trial Brief</i>, implies that the PCGG had records of Cojuangco's SAL from 1967 to 1985.&nbsp; Additionally, the COA's report on UCPB, dated 1986, referred to the financial statements of UCPB, which could have helped to determine whether or not the loans extended to Cojuangco violated the DOSRI or the single borrower's limit.<br><br>Another extreme irregularity was the Republic's <b>failure to produce and offer the loan documents</b> as evidence, given that the Republic's claim is dependent on the theory that the SMC shares were acquired with UCPB loans.&nbsp; These documents would have definitely established the dates the loans were granted, the amounts and terms of the loans, and even the approving authorities who participated in the grant of the loan.&nbsp; In 1986, the Republic had control of the UCPB and would have had access to these loan agreements.&nbsp; If the loan documents could no longer be found, other documents such as the financial statements and the reports to the Central Bank would have referred to the loan transactions which might have amounted to at least $49 million, if the Republic's Third Amended Complaint were to be believed. If the loan documents had been lost, a manifestation in the Sandiganbayan would have been proper, as well as a demand for the respondents to produce loan documents, given that they had admitted to the loan transactions. Instead, the records are jarringly silent about these loan documents.&nbsp; What is true for the UCPB loan documents applies as well to advances from the CIIF Oil Mills which could not have been simply drawn without supporting documentation.<br><br>Lastly, it must be pointed out that the Republic was not definite in identifying the number of shares that it sought to claim.&nbsp; The <i>Third Amended Complaint</i> refers to 16,276,545 shares; Cojuangco's <i>Pre-Trial Brief</i> refers to an Annex "B" showing that there were 20,693,980 shares; and the Republic's <i>Pre-Trial Brief</i> refers to 27,198,545 shares. The records are likewise devoid of any details relating to the acquisition of the SMC shares; the Republic failed to allege, much less prove, their acquisition cost or even their acquisition dates, and when the purported stock splits occurred or the stock dividends were distributed. These failures happened despite the clear suggestions from respondent's counsel - Atty. Estelito Mendoza - that while loans were secured, the details of the grant of the loans were not admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup>&nbsp; The Republic could have easily asked for the subpoena of the stock transfer books or other pertinent records of SMC, but chose not to do so.<br><br>To summarize, the records of the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan show that the Republic had not presented relevant evidence within its possession and crucial evidence that it could have obtained.&nbsp; It also neglected to pursue a cause of action that it could have proven or take corrective action to continue to pursue this cause of action.&nbsp; The stubborn refusal of the Republic despite the warnings of the Sandiganbayan during pre-trial and thereafter, cannot be considered as anything but gross negligence.&nbsp; The question of whether the government's counsel can so prejudice the government's claim for recovery of valuable assets through the gross negligence of its counsel must be addressed by this Court as a measure to secure a full determination and closure of this case.<br><br><center><u><b>IV. </b><b>NEGLIGENCE AND</b><b>&nbsp; </b><br><b>DUE PROCESS CONSIDERATIONS</b></u></center><br><br><b>A.&nbsp; <u>Gross Negligence of Counsel and its Effects</u></b><br><br>That negligence of counsel binds the client is a strong and settled rule in jurisprudence. This is based on the rule that any act performed by a counsel within the scope of his general or implied authority is regarded as an act of his client. Consequently, the mistake or negligence of counsel may result in the rendition of an unfavorable judgment against the client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup>&nbsp; The reason for this rule is to avoid the foreseeable tendency of every losing party to raise the negligence of his or her counsel to escape an adverse decision; experience shows that very few graciously accept a losing verdict and parties would go to great lengths and seize every opportunity to avoid a loss, although the attempt at evasion is to the detriment of justice and our justice system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>It is equally settled, too, with the same strength and emphasis that once the rule on mistake or negligence of counsel deserts its proper office as an aid to justice, and on the contrary becomes a hindrance and its chief enemy, the rigors of the rule must be relaxed to admit of exceptions and thereby prevent a miscarriage of justice. In other words, the Court has the power to consider a particular case an exception to the operation of the negligence of counsel rule whenever the purposes of justice require it. What should guide judicial action as a norm is that a party should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his action or defense, rather than allow him to lose life, honor or property because of technicalities or acts or omissions that denied him of his day in court.<br><br>Thus, the rule that the negligence of counsel binds the client admits of exceptions. The recognized exceptions are: (1) where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law, (2) when its application will result in outright deprivation of the client's liberty or property or (3) where the interests of justice so require. In such cases, courts must step in and accord relief to a party-litigant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>Gross negligence has been defined as the want or absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care. It is the thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>In this case, the omissions of Republic's counsel in handling its case has heretofore been itemized and discussed and need not be mentioned again. Suffice it to say that its failure to present evidence it had in its possession and those that it could have easily availed of, considered alone, already amounted to an abandonment or total disregard of its case. They show conscious indifference to or utter disregard of the possible adverse repercussions to the client. Such chronic inaction was present in this case when the Republic's counsel exhibited it as early as the pre-trial, at its motion for summary judgment where no less than the Sandiganbayan commented on the state of the counsel's preparation, and in the all-important presentation of evidence stage when counsel, without much thought, marked as evidence&nbsp; materials that need not even be marked and offered as evidence, and thereafter refused to go to trial.&nbsp; These acts cannot but constitute gross negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>In <i>Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) v. Bengson Commercial Buildings</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> the Court pointed out that a pattern of fraud is evident when GSIS's counsel opted not to present evidence to contradict the plaintiff's evidence.&nbsp; Additionally, its abandonment of a cause of action without any apparent reason signifies the counsel's unbecoming disregard for the outcome of the case.<br><br>The uniqueness of the negligence in this case lies in the patent ineptitude that counsel for the Republic committed, as it passively allowed the government to be stripped of its interests in valuable assets claimed to be ill gotten wealth. The glaring errors of the counsel for the Republic were not minor errors in the exercise of discretion; the voluminous records of this case are replete with instances when counsel's attention was called concerning gaps in its case and its evidence, both by the Sandiganbayan and by the respondents.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan even noted the apparent ignorance of the Republic's counsel regarding the case that it handled -- its inability, despite the lapse of a substantial&nbsp; length of time, to respond to the questions of the Sandiganbayan and to identify the documents that it would present.&nbsp; These warnings alone should serve as a gauge to the Court of how egregious the negligence had been.<br><br>The party aggrieved in this case, it must be remembered, is not an ordinary client; it is the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; Unlike other parties who may cry out and insist on changing an incompetent counsel in order to protect its claims, the Republic cannot as easily do so.&nbsp; It is bound by law to rely on the skill, honesty, and diligence of the agency assigned to represent it.<br><br>Under these circumstances, it becomes the duty of the Court to ensure that the Republic is not prejudiced by a grossly incompetent or negligent counsel and is not thereby cheated out of its proper claims. For this Court to gloss over this incompetence, negligence, apathy and unconcern, and not to act on what clearly appears to be an aberrant situation, would simply run counter to its duty to uphold justice.&nbsp; If the incompetence, ignorance or inexperience of counsel is so great and his errors are so serious that the client who otherwise has a good cause, is prejudiced and denied his day in court, the litigation may be reopened to give the client another chance to present his case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>The fundamental purpose of procedural rules is to afford each litigant every opportunity to present evidence in their behalf in order that substantial justice is achieved. Court litigations are primarily for the search of truth, and a liberal interpretation of the rules by which both parties are given the fullest opportunity to adduce proofs is the best way to ferret out such truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>&nbsp; While we cannot but find in this case that the Republic presented insufficient evidence to support its claim, we also find in the records pieces of evidence indicating that there is much more to the Republic's claim than was presented by the Republic's counsel.<br><br>While the Republic as a litigant should be bound by the mistake or negligence of its counsel, this should not be our conclusion in this case where the negligence, from every perspective, is gross and has effectively deprived the Republic of its day in court.<br><br>As a last word on this point, our jurisprudence teaches us that the State is never estopped from questioning the acts of its officials, if they are erroneous,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> and more so if they are irregular.&nbsp; Such acts involve plain bureaucratic venality which leaves large and easily identifiable traces of neglect of duty.

The government seeks to recover what it claims to be property that should belong to the Filipino people, particularly to the coconut farmers, and to redress what it claims to be abuses committed during an unusual period in the country's history - the martial law years. That the recovery and redress are important government interests is evident from the extraordinary steps that the government has already taken pursuant to its inherent sovereign powers to address the aftermath of the martial law years; pursuant to its police power, the government has allowed the seizure and sequestration of wealth <i>prima facie</i> found to be ill-gotten during the martial law years, so that these properties can be preserved for appropriate judicial process.<br><br>In this judicial process, the government yields its character as sovereign and operates under equal terms with the owners of sequestered properties; it submits itself to the same rights and opportunities that every other litigant enjoys in a court case. The most basic of these rights is the right to due process - the right to be heard and to be given the opportunity to present and defend one's cause.<br><br>As these discussions show, the Sandiganbayan denied the government's claim for recovery, not because the government did not have any right under the law to recover ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; <b>The government lost because of the acts of its counsel that amounted to no less than giving the claim away through omission, inaction or precipitate and ill-considered action that, at the very least, should be considered gross negligence of counsel in handling the government's case</b>.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the government - like, any other litigant - should be allowed to invoke the same due process right that individuals invoke to secure an equal and impartial justice under the law.<br><br>The requirements of due process are satisfied if the following conditions are present: (1) there is a court or tribunal clothed with judicial power to hear and determine the matter before it; (2) jurisdiction is lawfully acquired over the person of the defendant or over the property which is the subject of the proceedings; (3) the defendant is given an opportunity to be heard; and (4) judgment is rendered upon a lawful hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup>&nbsp; Substantively, what underlies due process is the rule of reason; it is a rule against arbitrariness and injustice measured under the standards of reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> Procedurally, the fundamental requirement of due process involves the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup>&nbsp; Whether in the substantive or in the procedural signification, due process must comport with the deepest notions of what is fair and right and just.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>On a superficial consideration, the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan appear to have complied with all that due process demands in a judicial proceeding.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan granted the government the opportunity to be heard and was not remiss in reminding the Republic's counsel of its view of the status of the government's case.&nbsp; That counsel chose to formally offer as evidence documents that were already on record or subject to judicial notice, and that it miserably failed to support its stated claims, do not appear to be a violation of the requirements of procedural due process. However, <b><i>the right to due process in our legal system does not merely rely on technical and pedantic application of procedural formalities; it involves as well the consideration of the substance of the affected underlying rights whose denial under unreasonable circumstances is equivalent to the loss of day in court that is entitled to redress and correction to afford justice to all.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br><b>The denial, as it transpired in this case, is unique but is not any less a basic and inherent unfairness.</b> The Court is now faced with a situation where the conclusions of the Sandiganbayan are valid, <i>based on the evidence formally offered,</i> but are contradicted by existing evidence that counsel chose not to offer and evidence that, by omission, it chose not to explore. Effectively, it is a situation of abandonment by the Republic's counsel of causes of action that it could have successfully proven, and the loss by government of a real opportunity to be heard, especially after its counsel opted not to pursue its remedies under RA No. 1379 and after it obstinately refused to present the most basic documents to prove its claim under EO No. 1 despite the dire warnings of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; The Court stands to participate in this unfairness and injustice if it stands idly and let the government be deprived of valuable assets, or the chance to prove its interest in these assets, knowing fully well the gross incompetence and negligence of its counsel that brought on the injustice.<br><br>If the Court is convinced that gross injustice transpired brought on by the failure on the part of the Republic to present its case due to the gross negligence of its counsel, an outright dismissal of the present petition would not comply with the due process requirements enshrined in our Constitution.&nbsp; Let it be noted that the Republic's case is not totally without merit.&nbsp; Records are replete with indications that a meritorious case can be made out for the recovery sought if only the Republic can have its day in court.&nbsp; <b><i>Under these circumstances, the Court's remedy can be no less than a continuation of the proceedings of this case through its remand of the case for a full-blown trial on the merits in proceedings that accord the government a real chance to present all of its evidence.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>To be sure, the Court is not wanting in authority to impose this remedy; it is a well-established and accepted doctrine that rules of procedure may be modified at any time to become effective at once, so long as the change does not affect vested rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup>&nbsp; In short, this Court can adapt the rules of procedure, as its response to the duty and obligation to act in the higher interests of justice.<br><br>In its Third Amended Complaint, the Republic included in its prayer "such further relief as may appear to the Honorable Court to be just and equitable under the premises."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup>&nbsp; This Court has always been disposed to grant equitable relief to parties aggrieved by perfidy, fraud, reckless inattention and the downright incompetence of lawyers whose consequence is the deprivation of their clients' day in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup>&nbsp; Following this lead, a remand of the case to the Sandiganbayan for further hearing on the evidence of both parties is only proper.&nbsp; The remand would permit the Republic to properly present its case in accordance with the dictates of due process, and the courts to decide this important case based on real evidence and not merely by the omissions on the part of the Republic's counsel.<br><br>To reiterate what is at stake is not only public property of significant value may be involved, this case also marks a crucial step in our people's quest for integrity and accountability in our public officers.

No. 90529 August 16, 1991), the Court clarified that the preliminary inquiry required in a RA 1379 forfeiture cases originally given to the city or provincial fiscals are now vested with the Office of the Ombudsman and the jurisdiction over the forfeiture case is vested in the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; The Court said:<br><br><blockquote>A perusal of the law originally creating the Office of the Ombudsman then (to be known as the Tanodbayan), and the amendatory laws issued subsequent thereto will show that, at its inception, <b>the Office of the Ombudsman was already vested with the power to investigate and prosecute civil and criminal cases before the Sandiganbayan and even the regular courts.</b> xxx<br><br>Presidential Decree No. 1630 was the existing law governing the then Tanodbayan when Republic Act No. 6770 was enacted providing for the functional and structural organization of the present Office of the Ombudsman. This later law retained in the Ombudsman the power of the former Tanodbayan to investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient. In addition, the Ombudsman is now vested with primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan. xxx<br><br>Nonetheless, while we do not discount the authority of the Ombudsman, we believe and so hold that the exercise of his correlative powers to both investigate and initiate the proper action for the recovery of ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth is restricted only to cases for the recovery of ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth which were amassed after February 25, 1986. Prior to said date, the Ombudsman is without authority to initiate such forfeiture proceedings. <b>We, however, uphold his authority to investigate cases for the forfeiture or recovery of such ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth amassed even before the aforementioned date, pursuant to his general investigatory power under Section 15(l) of Republic Act No. 6770. </b>(Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>See also <i>Garcia v.

The "opportunity to contest" will be meaningless <b>unless there is a record, on the basis of which the reviewing authority, including the court, may determine whether the PCGG's ruling that the property sequestered is "ill-gotten wealth" was issued "with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</b>." That record should include the reason why the shares of stock are being sequestered and the record of the proceedings, on the basis of which, issuance of the order of sequestration was authorized.

Presidential Commission on Good Government</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> bears recalling, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote><i>The COCONUT LEVY FUNDS:</i><br><br>The sequestration of the corporations and the other acts complained of were undertaken by the PCGG preparatory to the filing of suit in the Sandiganbayan against Marcos and his associates for the illicit conversion of the coconut levy funds, purportedly channeled through the COCOFED and the other sequestered businesses, into private pelf.&nbsp; These funds fall into four general classes, <i>viz.</i>: (a) the Coconut Investment Fund created under R.A. 6260 (effective June 19, 1971); (b) the Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund created under PD 276 (effective August 20, 1973); (c) the Coconut Industry Development Fund created under PD 582 (effective November 14, 1974); and (d) the Coconut Industry Stabilization Fund created under P.D. 1841 (effective October 2, 1981).<br><br><i>The Coconut Investment Fund (CIF):</i><br><br>The Coconut Investment Fund, or CIF, was put up in 1971 by R.A. 6260 which declared it to be the national policy to accelerate the development of the coconut industry through the provision of adequate medium and long term financing for capital investment in the industry.<b><sup>&nbsp; </sup></b>A levy of P0.55 was imposed on the first domestic sale of every 100 kilograms of copra or equivalent coconut product,<b><sup> </sup></b>fifty centavos (P0.50) of which accrued to the CIF.&nbsp; The Philippine Coconut Administration (or PHILCOA) received three centavos (P0.03)<b><sup> </sup></b>of the five remaining, and the balance was placed "at the disposition of the recognized national association of coconut producers with the largest x x x membership"- which association was declared by PHILCOA to be petitioner COCOFED.<br><br>The CIF was to be used exclusively to pay for the Philippine Government's subscription to the capital stock of the Coconut Investment Company (CIC), a corporation with a capitalization of P100,000,000.00 created by the statute to administer the Fund, as has already been stated, and to invest its capital in financing "agricultural, industrial or other productive (coconut) enterprises" qualified under the terms of the statute to apply for loans with the CIC.<b><sup> </sup></b>The State was to initially subscribe to CIC's capital stock "for and on behalf of the coconut farmers," to whom such shares were supposed to be transferred "upon full payment (with the collections on the levy) of the authorized capital stock x x x or upon termination of a ten-year period from the start of the collection of the levy x x, whichever comes first." The scheme, in short, called for the use of the CIF- funds collected mainly from coconut farmers- to pay for the CIC shares of stock to be subscribed by the Government and held by it until the levy was lifted, whereupon the Government was to "convert" the receipts issued to the farmers (as evidence of payment of the levy) "into shares of stock"- this time in the farmers' names- in the new, private corporation to be formed by them at such time, conformably with the provisions of the law.<br><br>The levy imposed by R.A. 6260 was collected from 1972 to 1982.<br><br><i>The Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund (CCSF)</i><br><br>P.D. 276 established a second fund on August 20, 1973, barely a year after the creation of the CIF.&nbsp; The decree imposed a "Stabilization Fund Levy" of fifteen pesos (P15.00) on the first sale of every 100 kilograms of <i>copra resecada</i> or equivalent product. The revenues were to be credited to the Coconut [Consumers] Stabilization Fund (CCSF) which was to be used to subsidize the sale of coconut-based products at prices set by the Price Control Council, in order to stabilize the price of edible oil and other coconut oil-based products for the benefit of consumers.&nbsp; The levy was to be collected for only one year.<b><sup>&nbsp; </sup></b>The CCSF however became a permanent fund under PD 414.<br><br><i>The Coconut Industry Development Fund (CIDF):</i><br><br>On November 14, 1974, PD 582 was promulgated setting up yet another "permanent fund x x (this time to) finance the establishment, operation and maintenance of a hybrid coconut seednut farm x x (and the implementation of) a nationwide coconut replanting program" "using precocious high-yielding hybrid seednuts x x to (be) distribute(d), x x free, to coconut farmers."&nbsp; The fund was denominated the Coconut Industry Development Fund, or the CIDF.&nbsp; Its initial capital of P100 million was to be paid from the CCSF, and in addition to this, the PCA was directed to thereafter remit to the fund "an amount equal to at least twenty centavos (P0.20) per kilogram of <i>copra resecada</i> or its equivalent out of its current collections of the coconut consumers stabilization levy."&nbsp; The CIDF was assured of continued contribution from the permanent levy in the same amount deemed to be "automatically imposed" in the event of the lifting of the Stabilization Fund Levy.<br><br><i>The Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)</i><br><br>The various laws relating to the coconut industry were codified in 1976; promulgated on October 21 of that year was PD 961 or the "Coconut Industry Code," which later came to be known as the "Revised Coconut Industry Code" upon its amendment by PD 1468, effective June 11, 1978.&nbsp; The Code provided for the continued enforcement of the Stabilization Fund Levy imposed by PD 276 and for the use of the CCSF and the CIDF for substantially the same purposes specified by the enactments ordaining their creation.<br><br>A new provision was however inserted in the Code, authorizing the use of the balance of the CIDF not needed to finance the replanting program and other authorized projects, for the acquisition of "shares of stock in corporations organized for the purpose of engaging in the establishment and operation of industries, x x commercial activities and other allied business undertakings relating to coconut and other palm oil indust(ries)." <span style="text-decoration: underline;">From this fund thus created, the Coconut Industry Investment Fund or the CIIF, were purchased the shares of stock in what have come to be known as the "CIIF companies"- the sequestered corporations into which said CIIF (Coconut Industry Investment Fund) was heavily invested after its creation</span>.<br><br><i>The Coconut Industry Stabilization Fund (CISF): (Formerly CCSF)</i><br><br>The collection of the CCSF and the CIDF was suspended for a time in virtue of PD 1699.&nbsp; However, on October 2, 1981, PD 1841 was issued reviving the levies and r<span style="text-decoration: underline;">enaming the CCSF the Coconut Industry Stabilization Fund, or the CISF, to which accrued the new collections</span>.&nbsp; The impost was in the amount of P50.00 for every 100 kilos of <i>copra resecada</i> or equivalent product delivered to exporters and other copra users.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The funds collected were to be apportioned among</span> the CIDF,<b><sup> </sup></b>the COCOFED,<b><sup> </sup></b>the PCA, and the "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">bank acquired for the benefit of the coconut farmers under PD 755" referring to the United Coconut Planters Bank or the UCPB</span>.<br><br><i>The AGENCIES INVOLVED:</i><br><br>As may be observed, <b style="text-decoration: underline;">three agencies played key roles in the collection, management, investment and use of the coconut levy funds: (a) the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA), formerly the Philippine Coconut Administration or the PHILCOA; (b) the COCOFED; and (c) the UCPB</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.&nbsp; Charged with the duty to "receive and administer the funds provided by law,"</span><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><sup> </sup></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Philippine Coconut Authority or the PCA was created on June 30, 1973 by P.D. 232</span> to replace and assume the functions of (1) the Philippine Coconut Administration or PHILCOA (which had been established in 1954), (2) the Coconut Coordinating Council (CCC), and (3) the Philippine Coconut Research Institute (PHILCORIN).&nbsp; By virtue of the Decree, the PCA took over the collection of the CIF Levy under RA 6260 in 1973, while subsequent statutes, to wit, PD 276 (in relation to PD 414), PD 582, and PD 1841, empowered it specifically to manage the CCSF, the CIDF, and the CISF, from the time of their creation.&nbsp; Under the laws just mentioned, the PCA, as the government arm that "formulate(s) x x (the) general program of development for the coconut x x and palm oil indust(ries)," is allotted a share in the funds kept in its trust.&nbsp; Its governing board is composed of members coming from the public and private sectors, among them representatives of COCOFED.<br><br>The Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. or the COCOFED, as the private national association of coconut producers certified in 1971 by the PHILCOA as having the largest membership among such producers, receives substantial portions of the coconut funds to finance its operating expenses and socio-economic projects.&nbsp; R.A. 6260 entrusted it with the task of maintaining "continuing liaison with the different sectors of the industry, the government and its own mass base."&nbsp; Its president sits on the governing board of the PCA and on the Philippine Coconut Consumers Stabilization Committee, the agency assisting the PCA in the administration of the CCSF.&nbsp; It is also represented in the Board of Directors of the CIC and of two (2) CIIF companies COCOMARK (the COCOFED Marketing Corporation) and COCOLIFE (the United Coconut Planters' Life Insurance Co.).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The United Coconut Planters Bank (or the UCPB) is a commercial bank acquired "for the benefit of the coconut farmers" with the use of the Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund (CCSF) in virtue of P.D. 755, promulgated on July 29, 1975.&nbsp; The Decree authorized the Bank to provide the intended beneficiaries with "readily available credit facilities at preferential rates</span>."&nbsp; It also authorized the distribution of the Bank's shares of stock, free, to the coconut farmers; and some 1,405,366 purported recipients have been listed as UCPB stockholders as of April 10, 1986.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The UCPB was thereafter empowered by PD 1468 to "(make) investments for the benefit of the coconut farmers" using that part of the CIDF referred to as the CIIF.&nbsp; Thus were organized the "CIIF companies" subject of the sequestration orders herein assailed.&nbsp; As in the case of the shares of stock in the UCPB, the law provided for the "equitable distribution" to the coconut farmers, free, of the investments made in the CIIF companies</span>.&nbsp; Among the corporations in which the UCPB has come to have substantial shareholdings are the COCOFED Marketing Corporation (COCOMARK), United Coconut Planters' Life Insurance (COCOLIFE) GRANEX, ILICOCO, Southern Island Oil Mill, Legaspi Oil of Davao City and of Cagayan de Oro City, Anchor Insurance Brokerage, Inc., Southern Luzon Coconut Oil Mills, and San Pablo Oil Manufacturing Co., Inc.&nbsp; Some of these corporations in turn acquired UCPB shares of stock as well as shareholdings in the San Miguel Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The foregoing historical account has settled that <b>UCPB and CIIF Oil Mills owe their existence to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">coconut levy funds</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">martial law issuances</span></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>&nbsp; The Court went on in the same case to pronounce:<br><br><blockquote><b>The utilization and proper management of the coconut levy funds, raised as they were by the State's police and taxing powers, are certainly the concern of the Government.</b>&nbsp; It cannot be denied that it was the welfare of the entire nation that provided the prime moving factor for the imposition of the levy.&nbsp; It cannot be denied that the coconut industry is one of the major industries supporting the national economy.&nbsp; It is, therefore, the State's concern to make it a strong and secure source not only of the livelihood of a significant segment of the population but also of export earnings the sustained growth of which is one of the imperatives of economic stability.&nbsp;

Cojuangco, Jr. are "dummies" or manipulated instruments, or repositories of wealth deceitfully amassed at the expense of the People, or simply the fruits thereof.<br><br>A. Dummy Owners of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) Stock<br><br>For instance three (3) corporations, namely: (1) Meadow-Lark Plantations, Inc., (2) Primavera Farms, Inc., and (3) Silver-Leaf Plantations, Inc., appear in the books of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) as owners of 8,138,440 shares of the latter's stock. And a certain Jose C. Concepcion also appears in its books as owner of "San Miguel Corporation Stock Certificate No. A962930 for 5,000 shares."<br><br>All the outstanding capital stock (100%) of these three (3) companies is owned by five (5) persons, all lawyers, namely: (1) the aforenamed Jose C. Concepcion, (2) Victoria C. de los Reyes, (3) Florentino M. Herrera III, (4) Teresita J. Herbosa, and (5) Jose Riodil Montebon. Concepcion, Herbosa and Montebon are members of one law firm; Herrera and de los Reyes are members of another.<br><br>All these (5) are shown to be signatories of three (3) identically worded voting trust agreements executed on April 13, 1984 giving to Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. the right to vote for a period of five (5) years, the shares of stock of the three (3) corporations above mentioned -- of the entire capital stock of which they are, as aforestated, the ostensible owners.<br><br>Moreover, there are on record more or less identically worded affidavits of Jose C. Concepcion, Teresita J. Herbosa and Jose R.D. Montebon frankly confessing that the shares of stock listed under their names in the corporate books of the three (3) corporations above mentioned -- and several other firms shortly to be named -- were merely assigned to them as "nominee stockholders," but in truth they do "not have any proprietary interest in any of . . . (said) shares of stock."<br><br>Concepcion's affidavit contains the additional declaration of his being "nominee stockholder" of "San Miguel Corporation Stock Certificate No. A962930 for 5,000 shares and all stock dividends declared thereon," supra, although in truth he does "not have any proprietary interest" therein.<br><br>It thus appears that by their own unequivocal admissions, not one of the aforementioned five attorneys is the owner of the stock under their names in the three (3) corporations above mentioned, which in turn own not inconsiderable stock in San Miguel Corporation.<br><br>Jose C. Concepcion appears further more to have executed in blank three (3) documents entitled "DECLARATION OF TRUST AND ASSIGNMENT OF SUBSCRIPTION," all dated April 13, 1984, in each of which he (a) declares that all shares of stock registered in his name in the three corporations above named (Meadow-Lark Plantations, Inc., Primavera Farms, Inc., and Siver-Leaf Plantations, Inc.) were assigned to him "only as nominee and only for the benefit and in trust for" an assignee whom he does not name, and (b) binds himself "to assign, transfer and convey all his rights, title and interest in the aforesaid shares of stock in favor of the (unnamed) ASSIGNEE or his nominees or assigns at anytime upon the request of the ASSIGNEE."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <i>Republic v.
