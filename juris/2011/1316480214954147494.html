No. 705 as amended by Executive Order No. 277.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, however, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Cagayan de Oro City issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated March 13, 1996 recommending the filing of an Information for the aforesaid charge not only against Latayada, Baillo and Boyatac but also against petitioner Crisostomo Villarin (Villarin), then <i>Barangay</i> Captain of Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City.&nbsp; The dismissal of the complaint against Sudaria was likewise recommended.&nbsp; Said Resolution was then approved by the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao through a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated May 9, 1996 ordering the filing of the Information in the RTC of Cagayan de Oro City.<br><br>Thus, on October 29, 1996, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> was filed against petitioners Villarin and Latayada and their co-accused Baillo and Boyatac, for violation of Section 68, P.D.

The Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao likewise opined that Villarin was directly implicated by Latayada, his co-accused.<br><br>The RTC thus proceeded with the arraignment of the accused who entered separate pleas of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br><b><i>The Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>On December 31, 1995, at around five o'clock in the afternoon, prosecution witness Roland Granada (Granada) noticed that a public utility jeep loaded with timber stopped near his house. The driver, petitioner Latayada, was accompanied by four to five other persons, one of whom was Boyatac while the rest could not be identified by Granada.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; They alighted from the jeep and unloaded the timber 10 to 15 meters away from the Batinay bridge at <i>Barangay</i> Pagalungan, Cagayan De Oro City.&nbsp; Another prosecution witness, Pastor Pansacala (Pansacala), also noticed the jeep with plate number MBB 226 and owned by Sudaria, loaded with timber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Being then the president of a community-based organization which serves as a watchdog of illegal cutting of trees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Pansacala even ordered a certain Mario Bael to count the timber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>At six o'clock in the evening of the same day, <i>Barangay</i> Captain Angeles Alarcon (Alarcon)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> noticed that the pile of timber was already placed near the bridge.&nbsp; Since she had no knowledge of any scheduled repair of the Batinay bridge she was surprised to discover that the timber would be used for the repair.&nbsp; After inquiring from the people living near the bridge, she learned that Latayada and Boyatac delivered the timber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Another prosecution witness, Ariel Palanga (Palanga), testified that at seven o'clock in the morning of January 1, 1996, Boyatac bought a stick of cigarette from his store and requested him to cover the pile of timber near the bridge for a fee.&nbsp; Palanga acceded and covered the pile with coconut leaves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On January 13, 1996, at around ten o'clock in the morning, prosecution witness Juan Casenas (Casenas), a radio and TV personality of RMN-TV8, took footages of the timber<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> hidden and covered by coconut leaves. Casenas also took footages of more logs inside a bodega at the other side of the bridge. In the following evening, the footages were shown in a news program on television.<br><br>On the same day, members of the DENR Region 10 Strike Force Team measured the timber which consisted of 63 pieces of Apitong flitches and determined that it totaled 4,326 board feet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and subsequently entrusted the same to Alarcon for safekeeping.<br><br>Upon further investigation, it was learned that the timber was requisitioned by Villarin, who was then <i>Barangay</i> Captain of Pagulangan, Cagayan de Oro City.&nbsp; Villarin gave Sudaria the specifications for the requisitioned timber. Thereafter, Boyatac informed Villarin that the timber was already delivered on December 31, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On January 18, 1996, Felix Vera Cruz (Vera Cruz), a security guard at the DENR Region 10 Office, received and signed for the confiscated timber since the property custodian at that time was not around.<br><br>The filing of the aforestated Information followed.<br><br><b><i>The Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>In response to the clamor of the residents of <i>Barangays</i> Tampangan, Pigsag-an, Tuburan and Taglinao, all in Cagayan De Oro City, Villarin, decided to repair the impassable Batinay bridge. The project was allegedly with the concurrence of the <i>Barangay</i> Council.<br><br>Pressured to immediately commence the needed repairs, Villarin commissioned Boyatac to inquire from Sudaria about the availability of timber without first informing the City Engineer. Sudaria asked for the specifications which Villarin gave.&nbsp; Villarin then asked Baillo and Boyatac to attend to the same.&nbsp; When the timber was already available, it was transported from Tagpangi to Batinay.&nbsp; However, the timber flitches were seized by the DENR Strike Force Team and taken to its office where they were received by Vera Cruz, the security guard on duty.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Memorandum filed before the trial court, the defense notified the court of Boyatac's demise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; However, the trial court did not act on such notice.&nbsp; Instead, it proceeded to rule on the culpability of Boyatac.&nbsp; Thus, in its Judgment, the trial court found herein petitioners and the deceased Boyatac guilty as charged.&nbsp; On the other hand, it found the evidence against Baillo insufficient. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing findings, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Crisostomo Villarin, Cipriano Boyatac and Aniano Latayada guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 68 of Presidential Decree No. 705 as amended, and hereby sentences each of them to suffer an indeterminate sentence of twelve (12) years of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years of reclusion temporal as maximum.<br><br>Accused Marlon Baillo is hereby acquitted for lack of evidence.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>In reaching said conclusions, the RTC noted that:<br><br><blockquote>Without an iota of doubt, accused Crisostomo Villarin, being then a Barangay Captain of Pagalungan, Cagayan de Oro City, was the one who procured the subject flitches, while accused Aniano Latayada and Cipriano Boyatac mutually helped him and each other by transporting the flitches from Sitio Batinay to the Pagalungan Bridge. The accused would like to impress upon the Court that the subject fltiches were intended for the repair of the Pagalungan Bridge and were acquired by virtue of Barangay Resolution No. 110 of Barangay Pagalungan. The Court is not impressed by this lame excuse. There is no dispute that the flitches were intended for the repair of the bridge. The Court finds it a laudable motive. The fact remains though that the said forest products were obtained without the necessary authority and legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the RTC in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated August 20, 2002.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals </i></b><br><br>Petitioners filed an appeal which was denied by the CA in its Decision dated June 28, 2005.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the judgment of the court a quo finding [d]efendant-[a]ppellants Crisostomo Villarin, Cipriano Boyatac and Aniano Latayada GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violating Sec. 68 of Presidential Decree 705 is hereby AFFIRMED in toto. No pronouncement as to cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which the appellate court denied for lack of merit in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> promulgated on September 22, 2006.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Undeterred, petitioners filed the instant petition raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS[,] ON [THE] MATTER OF PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION[,] DECIDED NOT IN ACCORD WITH JURISPRUDENCE OF THE SUPREME COURT;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS DEPARTED FROM WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SAYING, THAT, TO CONVICT AN ACCUSED ALL ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME MUST BE PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT and;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS[,] IN AFFIRMING THE PENALTY IMPOSED BY THE COURT A QUO[,] DEPARTED FROM JURISPRUDENCE THAT EVEN IN CRIMES [INVOLVING] VIOLATION OF SPECIAL LAWS[,] SPECIAL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT [CAN BE CONSIDERED AS MITIGATING HAD THE VIOLATION BEEN PENALIZED UNDER THE REVISED PENAL CODE, IN ORDER TO REDUCE PENALTY].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Petitioners argue that the refusal of the Ombudsman to conduct a reinvestigation is tantamount to a denial of the right to due process.&nbsp; As Villarin was indicted in the Information despite his not being included in the criminal complaint filed by Pioquinto of the TL Strike Force Team of the DENR, they claim that he was not afforded a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; They also bewail the fact that persons who appear to be equally guilty, such as Sudaria, have not been included in the Information.&nbsp; Hence, they argue that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying their petition for reinvestigation because it deprived Villarin of his right to preliminary investigation and in refusing and to equally prosecute the guilty.&nbsp; They contend that the Ombudsman should not have relied on the prosecutor's Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> contained in the Information to the effect that a preliminary investigation was conducted in the case.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners contend that the evidence was insufficient to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt since they had no intention to possess the timber and dispose of it for personal gain.&nbsp; They likewise claim that there was failure on the part of the prosecution to present the timber, which were the object of the offense.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is unmeritorious.<br><br><b><i>Villarin was properly afforded his right <br>to due process.</i></b><br><br>Records show that the investigating prosecutor received a criminal complaint charging Sudaria, Latayada, Baillo and Boyatac with violation of Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The said complaint did not state the known addresses of the accused.&nbsp; Neither was the notarized joint-affidavit of the complainants attached thereto. The subpoena issued to the accused and the copy of their counter-affidavits were also not part of the record.&nbsp; Moreover, the complaint did not include Villarin as a respondent.&nbsp; However, said infirmities do not constitute denial of due process particularly on the part of Villarin.<br><br>It is evidently clear from the Resolution dated March 13, 1996 of the Office of the City Prosecutor that Villarin and all the accused participated in the scheduled preliminary investigation that was conducted prior to the filing of the criminal case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; They knew about the filing of the complaint and even denied any involvement in the illegal cutting of timber.&nbsp; They were also given the opportunity to submit countervailing evidence to convince the investigating prosecutor of their innocence.<br><br>Foregoing findings considered, there is no factual basis to the assertion that Villarin was not afforded a preliminary investigation. Accordingly, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao in denying Villarin's motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; It validly relied on the certification contained in the Information that a preliminary investigation was properly conducted in this case.&nbsp; The certification was made under oath by no less than the public prosecutor, a public officer who is presumed to have regularly performed his official duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, it aptly noted that "Villarin was implicated by x x x Latayada in his affidavit dated January 22, 1996 before Marcelino B. Pioquinto, Chief, Forest Protection and Law Enforcement Unit.&nbsp; The denial of Villarin cannot prevail over the declaration of witnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the absence of a proper preliminary investigation must be timely raised and must not have been waived.&nbsp; This is to allow the trial court to hold the case in abeyance and conduct its own investigation or require the prosecutor to hold a reinvestigation, which, necessarily "involves a re-examination and re-evaluation of the evidence already submitted by the complainant and the accused, as well as the initial finding of probable cause which led to the filing of the Informations after the requisite preliminary investigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Here, it is conceded that Villarin raised the issue of lack of a preliminary investigation in his Motion for Reinvestigation.&nbsp; However, when the Ombudsman denied the motion, he never raised this issue again.&nbsp; He accepted the Ombudsman's verdict, entered a plea of not guilty during his arraignment and actively participated in the trial on the merits by attending the scheduled hearings, conducting cross-examinations and testifying on his own behalf.&nbsp; It was only after the trial court rendered judgment against him that he once again assailed the conduct of the preliminary investigation in the Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Whatever argument Villarin may have regarding the alleged absence of a preliminary investigation has therefore been mooted.&nbsp; By entering his plea, and actively participating in the trial, he is deemed to have waived his right to preliminary investigation.<br><br>Petitioners also contend that Sudaria should also have been included as a principal in the commission of the offense.&nbsp; However, whether Sudaria should or should not be included as co-accused can no longer be raised on appeal.&nbsp; Any right that the petitioners may have in questioning the non-inclusion of Sudaria in the Information should have been raised in a motion for reconsideration of the March 13, 1996 Resolution of the Office of the City Prosecutor which recommended the dismissal of the complaint against&nbsp; Sudaria.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; Having&nbsp; failed to avail of&nbsp; the proper procedural remedy, they are now estopped from assailing his non-inclusion.<br><br><b><i>Two Offenses Penalized Under Sec. 68<br> of Presidential Decree No. 705.</i></b><br><br>Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended, provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 68.<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cutting, Gathering and/or Collecting Timber or Other Forest Products Without License.</i> - Any person who shall cut, gather, collect, remove timber or other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable or disposable public land, or from private land, without any authority, or possess timber or other forest products without legal documents as required under existing forest laws and regulations, shall be punished with the penalties imposed under Articles 309 and 310 of the Revised Penal Code: Provided, that in the case of partnerships, associations, or corporations, the officers who ordered the cutting, gathering, collection or possession shall be liable, and if such officers are aliens, they shall, in addition to the penalty, be deported without further proceedings on the part of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation.</blockquote><br>"There are two distinct and separate offenses punished under Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, to wit:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Cutting, gathering, collecting and removing timber or other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable or disposable public land, or from private land without any authorization; and<br><br>(2) Possession of timber or other forest products without the legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></div><br>The Information charged petitioners with the second offense which is consummated by the mere possession of forest products without the proper documents.<br><br>We reviewed the records and hold&nbsp; that the prosecution had&nbsp; discharged the<br><br>burden of proving all the elements of the offense charged. The evidence of the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners were in custody of timber without the necessary legal documents.&nbsp; Incidentally, we note that several transcripts of stenographic notes (TSNs) were not submitted by the trial court.&nbsp; No explanation was provided for these missing TSNs.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the incomplete TSNs, we still find that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt petitioners' culpability.<br><br>The prosecution adduced several documents to prove that timber was confiscated from petitioners.&nbsp; It presented a Tally Sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> to prove that the DENR Strike Force Team examined the seized timber on January 13, 1996.&nbsp; The number, volume and appraised value of said timber were also noted in the Tally Sheet.&nbsp; Seizure receipts were also presented to prove that the confiscated timber were placed in the custody of Alarcon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and eventually taken to the DENR Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> There was a photograph of the timber taken by the television crew led by Casenas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

timber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>More significantly, Villarin admitted that he was the one who commissioned the procurement of the timber<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> for the repair of the Batinay bridge.&nbsp; He even deputized Boyatac to negotiate with Sudaria and gave Latayada P2,000.00 to transport the logs.&nbsp; Boyatac later informed him of the delivery of timber.&nbsp; However, he could not present any document to show that his possession thereof was legal and pursuant to existing forest laws and regulations.<br><br>Relevant portions of

The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods, if the value of the thing stolen is more than 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; but if the value of the thing stolen exceeds the latter amount, the penalty shall be the maximum period of the one prescribed in this paragraph, and one year for each additional ten thousand pesos, but the total of the penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <i>prision mayor</i> or <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as the case may be.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br></blockquote> The Information filed against the petitioners alleged that the 63 pieces of timber without the requisite legal documents measuring 4,326 board feet were valued at P108,150.00.&nbsp; To prove this allegation, the prosecution presented Pioquinto to testify, among others, on this amount. Tally Sheets and Seizure Receipts were also presented to corroborate said amount.&nbsp; With the value of the timber exceeding P22,000.00, the basic penalty is <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods to be imposed in its maximum, the range of which is eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to ten (10) years.&nbsp; Since none of the qualifying circumstances in Article 310 of the RPC was alleged in the Information, the penalty cannot be increased two degrees higher.<br><br>In determining the additional years of imprisonment, P22,000.00 is to be deducted from P108,150.00, which results to P86,150.00.&nbsp; This remainder must be divided by P10,000.00, disregarding any amount less than P10,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, eight (8) years must be added to the basic penalty.&nbsp; Thus the maximum imposable penalty ranges from sixteen (16) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to eighteen (18) years of <i>reclusion temporal.</i><br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum imposable penalty should be taken anywhere within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, without considering the modifying circumstances.&nbsp; The penalty one degree lower from <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods is <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium and maximum periods, the range of which is from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.&nbsp; Thus, the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, erroneously fixed the minimum period of the penalty at twelve (12) years of <i>prision mayor.</i><br><br>Finally, the case against Boyatac must be dismissed considering his demise even before the RTC rendered its Judgment.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision dated June 28, 2005 and the Resolution dated September 22, 2006 in CA-G.R.
