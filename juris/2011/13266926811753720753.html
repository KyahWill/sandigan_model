				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In <i>Land Bank v.

SP No. 106104 entitled <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Hon. Conchita C.

Lucia, Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro with a total area of 3,682.0285 hectares. In 1972, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) expropriated 948.1911 hectares of Suntay’s land pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner Land Bank and DAR fixed the value of the expropriated portion at P4,497.50/hectare, for a total valuation of P4,251,141.68.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Rejecting the valuation, however, Suntay filed a petition for determination of just compensation in the Office of the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD) of Region IV, DARAB, docketed as DARAB Case No. V-0405-0001-00; his petition was assigned to RARAD Conchita Miñas (RARAD Miñas).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On January 24, 2001, after summary administrative proceeding in DARAB Case No. V-0405-0001-00, RARAD Miñas rendered a decision fixing the total just compensation for the expropriated portion at P157,541,951.30. Land Bank moved for a reconsideration, but RARAD Miñas denied its motion on March 14, 2001. It received the denial on March 26, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On April 20, 2001, Land Bank brought a petition for the judicial determination of just compensation in the RTC (Branch 46) in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro as a Special Agrarian Court, impleading Suntay and RARAD Miñas.

Land Bank contested the order through a motion for reconsideration, but RARAD Miñas denied the motion for reconsideration on July 10, 2001.<br><br>On July 18, 2001, RARAD Miñas issued a writ of execution directing the Regional Sheriff of DARAB Region IV to implement the decision of January 24, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 2001, Land Bank filed in DARAB a petition for certiorari (with prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order (TRO)/preliminary injunction), docketed as DSCA No. 0252, seeking to nullify the following issuances of RARAD Miñas, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>(a) The decision of January 24, 2001 directing Land Bank to pay Suntay just compensation of P147,541,951.30;<br><br>(b) The order dated May 22, 2001 declaring the decision of January 24, 2001 as final and executory;<br><br>(c) The order dated July 10, 2001 denying Land Bank’s motion for reconsideration; and<br><br>(d) The writ of execution dated July 18, 2001 directing the sheriff to enforce the decision of January 24, 2001.<br></blockquote><br>On September 12, 2001, DARAB enjoined RARAD Miñas from proceeding with the implementation of the decision of January 24, 2001, and directed the parties to attend the hearing to determine the propriety of issuing a preliminary or permanent injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On September 20, 2001, Josefina Lubrica (Lubrica), the assignee of Suntay, filed a petition for prohibition in the CA (CA-G.R. SP No. 66710) to prevent DARAB from proceeding in DSCA No. 0252 by mainly contending that the CARL did not grant to DARAB jurisdiction over special civil actions for certiorari. On the same day, the CA granted the prayer for TRO.<br><br>On October 3, 2001, DARAB issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining RARAD Miñas from implementing the January 24, 2001 decision and the orders incidental to said decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>DARAB submitted its own comment to the CA, arguing that it had issued the writ of injunction under its power of supervision over its subordinates, like the PARADs and the RARADs.<br><br>Land Bank also submitted its own comment, citing the prematurity of the petition for prohibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On August 22, 2002, the CA promulgated its decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 66710, holding that DARAB, being a mere formal party, had no personality to file a comment vis-à-vis the petition for prohibition; and that DARAB had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of DSCA No. 1252, considering that its exercise of jurisdiction over a special civil action for certiorari had no constitutional or statutory basis. Accordingly, the CA granted the petition for prohibition and perpetually enjoined DARAB from proceeding in DSCA No. 1252, which the CA ordered dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Thence, DARAB appealed the adverse CA decision to this Court via petition for review on <i>certiorari,</i> docketed as G.R.

Lubrica</i> (G.R. No. 159145),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> denying the petition for review. The Court opined that DARAB’s limited jurisdiction as a quasi-judicial body did not include the authority to take cognizance of petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, in the absence of an express grant in R.A. No. 6657, Executive Order (E.O.) No. 229, and E.O. No. 129-A.<br><br><center><b>G.R. No. 157903<br><i>Land Bank v.

SP No. 70015, granting Land Bank’s petition for certiorari; nullifying the RTC’s orders dated January 18, 2002 and March 8, 2002; allowing due course to Land Bank’s notice of appeal; and permanently enjoining the RTC from enforcing the nullified orders, and the RARAD from enforcing the writ of execution issued in DARAB Case No. V-0405-0001-00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, upon Suntay’s motion for reconsideration, the CA reversed itself through the amended decision dated February 5, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and dismissed Land Bank’s petition for <i>certiorari</i>, thuswise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED.

Suntay).</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On October 12, 2005, the Court issued a TRO upon Land Bank’s urgent motion to stop the implementation of RARAD Miñas’ decision dated January 24, 2001 pending the final resolution of G.R. No. 157903.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On October 11, 2007, this Court promulgated its decision in <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> viz:<br><br><blockquote>The <b>crucial issue</b> for our resolution is whether the RTC erred in dismissing the Land Bank’s petition for the determination of just compensation.<br><br>It is clear that the RTC treated the petition for the determination of just compensation as an <b>appeal</b> from the RARAD Decision in DARAB Case No. V-0405-0001-00.&nbsp;&nbsp; In dismissing the petition for being filed out of time, the RTC relied on Section 11, Rule XIII of the DARAB New Rules of Procedure which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 11. <i>Land Valuation and Preliminary Determination and Payment of Just Compensation. </i>– The decision of the Adjudicator on land valuation and preliminary determination and payment of just compensation shall not be appealable to the Board [Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB)] but shall be brought directly to the Regional Trial Courts designated as Special Agrarian Courts within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the notice thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any party shall be entitled to only one motion for reconsideration.</blockquote><br>The RTC erred in dismissing the Land Bank’s petition. It bears stressing that the petition is <b>not</b> an <b>appeal</b> from the RARAD final Decision but an <b>original action</b> for the determination of the just compensation for respondent’s expropriated property, over which the RTC has <b>original</b> and <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction. This is clear from Section 57 of R.A. No. 6657 which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction</i>. – The Special Agrarian Courts [the designated Regional Trial Courts] shall have <b>original </b>and <b>exclusive</b> jurisdiction over <b>all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, </b>and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act.<br><br>The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Parenthetically, the above provision is not in conflict with Section 50 of the same R.A. No. 6657 which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 50. <i>Quasi-judicial Powers of the DAR</i>. – The DAR is hereby vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) x x x.</blockquote><br>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals,</i> we held that Section 50 must be construed in harmony with Section 57 by considering cases involving the determination of just compensation and criminal cases for violations of R.A. No. 6657 as <b>excepted</b> from the plenitude of power conferred upon the DAR. Indeed, there is a reason for this distinction.&nbsp;&nbsp; The DAR is an administrative agency which cannot be granted jurisdiction over cases of eminent domain (such as taking of land under R.A. No. 6657) and over criminal cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada, Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay and Sumulong v. Guerrero,</i> we held that the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which cannot be vested in administrative agencies. Also, in <i>Scoty’s Department Store, et al. v. Micaller,</i> we struck down a law granting the then Court of Industrial Relations jurisdiction to try criminal cases for violations of the Industrial Peace Act.<br><br>The procedure for the determination of just compensation cases under R.A. No. 6657, as summarized in <i>Landbank of the Philippines v. Banal</i>, is that <b>initially</b>, the Land Bank is charged with the responsibility of determining the value of lands placed under land reform and the compensation to be paid for their taking under the voluntary offer to sell or compulsory acquisition arrangement. The DAR, relying on the Land Bank’s determination of the land valuation and compensation, then makes an offer through a notice sent to the landowner. If the landowner accepts the offer, the Land Bank shall pay him the purchase price of the land after he executes and delivers a deed of transfer and surrenders the certificate of title in favor of the government.&nbsp; In case the landowner rejects the offer or fails to reply thereto, the DAR adjudicator conducts summary administrative proceedings to determine the compensation for the land by requiring the landowner, the Land Bank and other interested parties to submit evidence as to the just compensation for the land. A party who disagrees with the Decision of the DAR adjudicator may bring the matter to the RTC designated as a Special Agrarian Court for the determination of just compensation. In determining just compensation, the RTC is required to consider several factors enumerated in Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657. These factors have been translated into a basic formula in DAR Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by DAR A.O. No. 11, Series of 1994, issued pursuant to the DAR’s rule-making power to carry out the object and purposes of R.A. No. 6657.<br><blockquote><center>xxx<br></center><br>Obviously, these factors involve <b>factual</b> matters which can be established only during a hearing wherein the contending parties present their respective evidence. In fact, to underscore the intricate nature of determining the valuation of the land, Section 58 of the same law even authorizes the Special Agrarian Courts to appoint commissioners for such purpose.</blockquote><br>In the instant case, the Land Bank properly instituted its petition for the determination of just compensation before the RTC in accordance with R.A. No. 6657. The RTC erred in dismissing the petition. To repeat, Section 57 of R.A. No. 6657 is explicit in vesting the RTC, acting as a Special Agrarian Court, “original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners.” As we held in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><br><blockquote>xxx. It would subvert this “original and exclusive” jurisdiction of the RTC for the DAR to vest original jurisdiction in compensation cases in administrative officials and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions.<br><br>Consequently, although the new rules [Section 11, Rule XIII of the DARAB New Rules of Procedure] speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from Section 57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. <b>Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Section 57 and therefore would be void.</b> What adjudicators are empowered to do is only to determine in a preliminary manner the reasonable compensation to be paid to landowners, leaving to the courts the ultimate power to decide this question.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the instant Petition for Review on Certiorari.&nbsp;&nbsp; The assailed Amended Decision dated February 5, 2003 and Resolution dated April 10, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 70015 are <b>REVERSED</b>.&nbsp; The Orders dated January 18, 2002 and March 8, 2002 issued by the RTC in Agrarian Case No. R-1241 are <b>NULLIFIED</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The RTC is <b>ORDERED</b> to conduct further proceedings to determine the just compensation of respondent’s expropriated property in accordance with the guidelines set by this Court in Landbank of the Philippines v.

In other words, this Court is dismissing the case out of practicality because proceeding with the merit of the case would only be an exercise in futility. This is because <b>whichever way this Court would later decide the case would only be rendered immaterial and ineffectual by the foregoing new Orders of the RARAD</b>. To elaborate, a denial of the instant petition would mean that We are sustaining the Miñas’ Order dated October 30, 2008 which, as matters stand right now, had been superseded by the two new orders of the RARAD. Will sustaining RARAD Miñas’ Order have the effect of nullifying the two new orders of RARAD Casabar? The answer is still in the negative.

In <i>David v. Macapagal-Arroyo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court has declared that the moot-and-academic principle is not a magical formula that automatically dissuades courts from resolving cases, because they will decide cases, otherwise moot and academic, if they find that:<br><br><blockquote>(a) There is a grave violation of the Constitution;<br><br>(b) The situation is of exceptional character, and paramount public interest is involved;<br><br>(a) The constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the Bench, the Bar, and the public; or<br><br>(b) A case is capable of repetition yet evading review.</blockquote><br>In addition, in <i>Province of North Cotabato v. Government of the Republic of the Philippines Peace Panel on Ancestral Domain (GRP)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the Court has come to consider a voluntary cessation by the defendant or the doer of the activity complained of as another exception to the moot-and-academic principle, the explanation for the exception being that:<br><br><blockquote>xxx once a suit is filed and the doer voluntarily ceases the challenged conduct, it does not automatically deprive the tribunal of power to hear and determine the case and does not render the case moot especially when the plaintiff seeks damages or prays for injunctive relief against the possible recurrence of the violation.</blockquote><br>The exception of voluntary cessation of the activity without assuring the non-recurrence of the violation squarely covers this case. Hence, the CA’s dismissal of CA-G.R. SP No. 106104 on the ground of mootness must be undone.<br><br>Yet another reason why the Court should still resolve derives from the fact that the supervening RARAD Casabar’s recall order did not at all resolve and terminate the controversy between the parties. The CA itself conceded that Lubrica could still assail the validity of RARAD Casabar’s recall order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> That possibility underscores the need to definitely resolve the controversy between the parties to avoid further delay. As herein shown, this appeal is the third time that the intervention of the Court has been invoked regarding the controversy, the earlier ones being <i>DARAB&nbsp; v. Lubric</i>a (G.R. No. 159145) and <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903). The need to put an end to the controversy thus becomes all the more pressing and practical.<br><br>We further discern that the parties have heretofore acted to advance their respective interests and claims against each other by relying on seemingly conflicting pronouncements made in <i>DARAB v. Lubrica</i> (G.R. No. 159145) and <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903). Their reliance has unavoidably spawned and will continue to spawn confusion about their rights and can occasion more delays in the settlement of their claims.<br><br>The Court does not surely desire confusion and delay to intervene in any litigation, because the Court only aims to ensure to litigants a just, speedy, and inexpensive administration of justice. Thus, the Court feels bound to undo the CA’s deeming Land Bank’s petition for <i>certiorari</i> mooted by RARAD Casabar’s recall order. Verily, RARAD Miñas’ assailed order, until and unless its legality is declared and settled by final judgment, may yet be revived, and the judicial dispute between the parties herein may then still resurrect itself.<br><br><center><b>II.<br>Whether or not RARAD Miñas’ order<br>dated October 30, 2008 was valid</b><br></center><br>The controversy is traceable to the October 30, 2005 Order of RARAD Miñas directing the DARAB sheriffs to resume the implementation of the <i>alias</i> writ of execution she had issued in DARAB Case No. V-0405-0001-00. She predicated her order on the following pronouncement made in <i>Land Bank v.

Thus, w<i>hile a petition for the fixing of just compensation with the SAC is not an appeal from the agrarian reform adjudicator’s decision but an original action, the same has to be filed within the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules; otherwise, the adjudicator’s decision will attain finality.</i> This rule is not only in accord with law and settled jurisprudence but also with the principles of justice and equity. Verily, a belated petition before the SAC, e.g., one filed a month, or a year, or even a decade after the land valuation of the DAR adjudicator, must not leave the dispossessed landowner in a state of uncertainty as to the true value of his property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></blockquote><br>Land Bank contends, however, that <i>Land Bank v.

No. 157903) being applicable, it was <i>DARAB v. Lubrica</i> (G.R. No. 159145) that had become immutable and unalterable.<br><br>Lubrica is grossly mistaken.<br><br>Through the resolution promulgated on January 30, 2008 in <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R.

No. 157903) were to nullify the order dated January 18, 2002 (denying due course to Land Bank’s notice of appeal of the dismissal of its petition for determination of just compensation upon Suntay’s motion to dismiss) and the order dated March 8, 2002 (denying Land Bank’s motion for reconsideration), both issued by the RTC in Agrarian Case No. R-1241; and to order the RTC to “conduct further proceedings to determine the just compensation of (Suntay)’s expropriated property in accordance with the guidelines set by this Court in <i>Landbank of the Philippines v. Banal.</i>”<br><br>In effect, <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903) set aside the decision of RARAD Miñas dated January 24, 2000 fixing the just compensation. The finality of the judgment in <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903) meant that the decrees thereof could no longer be altered, modified, or reversed even by the Court <i>en banc</i>. Nothing is more settled in law than that a judgment, once it attains finality, becomes immutable and unalterable, and can no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> This rule rests on the principle that all litigation must come to an end, however unjust the result of error may appear; otherwise, litigation will become even more intolerable than the wrong or injustice it is designed to correct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Resultantly, Lubrica cannot invoke the pronouncement in Land Bank v.

No. 157903) was the appropriate case for the determination of the issue of the finality of the assailed RARAD Decision by virtue of its originating from Land Bank’s filing on April 20, 2001 of its petition for judicial determination of just compensation against Suntay and RARAD Miñas in the RTC sitting as a Special Agrarian Court. Therein, Suntay filed a motion to dismiss mainly on the ground that the petition had been filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period as required by Section 11, Rule XIII of the <i>Rules of Procedure of DARAB</i>. After the RTC granted the motion to dismiss, Land Bank appealed to the CA, which sustained the dismissal. As a result, Land Bank came to the Court (G.R. No. 157903), and the Court then defined the decisive issue to be: “whether the RTC erred in dismissing the Land Bank’s petition for the determination of just compensation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The Court ruled in favor of Land Bank. For both Land Bank and Suntay (including his assignee Lubrica), the holding in <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R.

Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the Court defined <i>law of the case</i> as “the opinion delivered on a former appeal.”&nbsp; <i>Law of the case</i> is a term applied to an established rule that when an appellate court passes on a question and remands the case to the lower court for further proceedings, the question there settled becomes the law of the case upon subsequent appeal.&nbsp; It means that whatever is once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> With the pronouncement in G.R.

No. 169008, July 31, 2008, 560 SCRA 776) is unavailing for the simple reason that the pronouncement was absolutely unrelated to the present controversy.<br><br><i>Land Bank v. Martinez</i> concerned a different set of facts, a different set of parties, and a different subject matter; it was extraneous to the present matter, or to <i>DARAB v. Lubrica</i> (G.R. No. 159145) and <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903). Land Bank and Suntay (and his assignee Josefina Lubrica) were not parties in <i>Land Bank v. Martinez</i>, rendering the pronouncement inapplicable to them now.<br><br>At best, <i>Land Bank v. Martinez</i> may only guide the resolution of similar controversies, <i>but only prospectively</i>. We note that <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903) was promulgated in October 11, 2007, while <i>Land Bank v. Martinez</i> was promulgated on July 31, 2008. The rule followed in this jurisdiction is that a judicial interpretation that varies from or reverses another is applied prospectively and should not apply to parties who relied on the old doctrine and acted in good faith. To hold otherwise is to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and justice, for, then, there is no recognition of what had transpired prior to such adjudication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, if posterior changes in doctrines of the Court cannot retroactively be applied to nullify a prior final ruling in the same proceeding where the prior adjudication was had,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> we have stronger reasons to hold that such changes could not apply to a different proceeding with a different set of parties and facts.<br><br>Suntay is also incorrect to insinuate that a modification or reversal of a final and executory decision rendered by a division of the Court would be valid only if done by the Court <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Such insinuation runs afoul of the well settled doctrine of immutability of judgments.

Nor is a hierarchy of courts thereby established within the Supreme Court, which remains a unit notwithstanding that it also works in divisions.

It is equally evident that at no time in <i>DARAB v. Lubrica</i> (G.R. No. 159145) did the finality of RARAD Miñas’ decision become the issue, precisely because the finality of RARAD Miñas’ decision had been put in issue instead in <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903), a suit filed ahead of <i>DARAB v. Lubrica</i> (G.R. No. 159145). In short, the question about the finality of RARAD Miñas’ decision was itself the lis mota in <i>Land Bank v.

It is notable that Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9700 expressly provided that “all just compensation payments to landowners, including execution of judgments therefore, shall only be sourced from the Agrarian Reform Fund;” and that “just compensation payments that cannot be covered within the approved annual budget of the program shall be chargeable against the debt service program of the national government, or any unprogrammed item in the General Appropriations Act.”<br><br>The enactments of the Legislature decreed that the money to be paid to the landowner as just compensation for the taking of his land is to be taken only from the ARF. As such, the liability is not the personal liability of Land Bank, but its liability only as the administrator of the ARF. In fact, Section 10, Rule 19 of the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure, reiterates that the satisfaction of a judgment for just compensation by writ of execution should be from the ARF in the custody of Land Bank, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 10. <i>Execution of judgments for Just Compensation which have become Final and Executory.</i> – <b>The Sheriff shall enforce a writ of execution</b> of a final judgment for compensation by demanding for the payment of the amount stated in the writ of execution <b>in cash and bonds against the Agrarian Reform Fund in the custody of LBP</b> [Land Bank of the Philippines] in accordance with RA 6657 xxx.&nbsp; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>Consequently, the immediate and indiscriminate levy by the DARAB sheriffs of Land Bank’s MERALCO shares, without first determining whether or not such assets formed part of the ARF, disregarded Land Bank’s proprietary rights in its own funds and properties.<br><br>The prior determination of whether the asset of Land Bank sought to be levied to respond to a judgment liability under the CARP in favor of the landowner was demanded by its being a banking institution created by law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> possessed with universal or expanded commercial banking powers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 251.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> As a regular&nbsp; bank, Land Bank is under the supervision and regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Being the official depository of Government funds, Land Bank is also invested with duties and responsibilities related to the implementation of the CARP, mainly as the administrator of the ARF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Given its discrete functions and capacities under the laws, Land Bank’s assets and properties must necessarily come under segregation, namely: (a) those arising from its proprietary functions as a regular banking or financial institution; and (b) those arising from its being the administrator of the ARF.

It explains that there are three different accounts relative to its MERALCO shares, to wit: (a) Trust Account No. 03-141, which was the subject of a Custodianship Agreement it had with the Asset Privatization Trust (APT); (b) Account titled “FAO PCGG ITF MFI”, which was the subject of a Custodial Safekeeping Agreement between Land Bank and the Three-Man Board for the MERALCO Privatization (c/o PCGG); and (c) LBP Proprietary Account with PCD Nominee Corporation involving Stock Certificate No. 87265, Stock Certificate No. 664638, Stock Certificate No. 0707447 and Stock Certificate No. 0707448. It insists that the LBP Proprietary Account was not part of the ARF, and that its shares covered by Stock Certificate No. 87265, Stock Certificate No. 664638, Stock Certificate No. 0707447, and Stock Certificate No. 0707448 had been acquired or obtained in the exercise of its proprietary function as a universal bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Land Bank presented copies of the Custodianship Agreement with the APT, the Custodial Safekeeping Agreement with the Three-Man Board for the MERALCO Privatization (c/o PCGG), and the joint affidavit of Land Bank’s officers.<br><br>In light of the clarifications by Land Bank, the Court concludes that the procedure of execution adopted by the DARAB sheriffs thoroughly disregarded the existence of Land Bank’s proprietary account separate and distinct from the ARF. The procedure thereby contravened the various pertinent laws and rules earlier adverted to and which the DARAB sheriffs were presumed to be much aware of, denying to the DARAB sheriffs any presumption in the regularity of their performance of their duties.<br><br>Also significant is that Section 20 of Executive Order No. 229 has mandated that the ARF “shall be sourced from the receipts of the sale of the assets of the APT and receipts of the sale of ill-gotten wealth recovered through the PCGG and such other sources as government may deem appropriate;” and that Section 63 of the CARL has authorized that additional amounts be appropriated as and when needed to augment the ARF.<br><br>It should not be difficult to see the marked distinction between <i>proceeds</i> or <i>receipts</i>, on one hand, and <i>asset</i> or <i>wealth derived</i> from such <i>proceeds</i> or receipts, on the other hand. The term proceeds refers to “the amount proceeding or accruing from some possession or transaction,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> and is synonymous to product, income, yield, receipts, or returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Clearly, therefore, the ARF was sourced from the money or cash realized either from the sale of or as income from the assets or properties held by the APT or the PCGG. The levied MERALCO shares were neither proceeds nor receipts. Thus, the DARAB sheriffs had no authority to indiscriminately levy such shares because they were clearly not part of the ARF.<br><br>Moreover, the DARAB sheriffs did not strictly comply with the rule in force at the time of their execution of the writ of execution and the alias writ of execution, which was Section 10, Rule 19 of the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure, viz:<br><br><blockquote>Section 10. <i>Execution of judgments for Just Compensation Which Have Become Final and Executory.</i> – <b>The Sheriff shall enforce a writ of execution</b> of a final judgment for compensation <b>by demanding for the payment</b> of the amount stated in the writ of execution <b>in cash and bonds against the Agrarian Reform Fund</b> in the custody of LBP [Land Bank of the Philippines] <b>in accordance with RA 6657</b>, and <b>the LBP shall pay the same in accordance with the final judgment and the writ of execution within five (5) days from the time the landowner accordingly executes and submits to the LBP the corresponding deed/s of transfer in favor of the government and surrenders the muniments of title to the property</b> in accordance with Section 15 (c) of RA 6657. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>As the rule reveals, a condition was imposed before Land Bank could be made to pay the landowner by the sheriff. The condition was for Suntay as the landowner to first submit to Land Bank the corresponding deed of transfer in favor of the Government and to surrender the muniments of the title to his affected property. Yet, by immediately and directly levying on the shares of stocks of Land Bank and forthwith selling them at a public auction to satisfy the amounts stated in the assailed writs without&nbsp; first requiring Suntay to comply with the condition, the DARAB sheriffs unmitigatedly violated the <i>2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure</i>.<br><br>Relevantly, Section 18 of the CARL, which Section 10 of the 2003 <i>DARAB Rules</i> of <i>Procedure</i> implements, has expressly listed the modes by which the landowner may choose to be paid his just compensation, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 18.

The total claim of Suntay under the assailed RARAD decision was only P157.5 million, but the worth of Land Bank’s 53,557,257 MERALCO shares, 912,230 PLDT shares and First Gen Corporation bonds auctioned off by the DARAB sheriffs at P1.00 /share for the total of only P53,557,257.00 was probably about P841 million. If that probable worth was true, the levy and execution were patently unconscionable and definitely worked against the interest of the Government represented by Land Bank.<br><br>Further, Suntay complains of the delay in the payment of just compensation due to him.<br><br>The Court finds that Suntay has only himself to blame. As early as in 2005 <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i> (G.R. No. 157903) already opened the way for the RTC to determine the just compensation in Agrarian Case No. R-1241.
