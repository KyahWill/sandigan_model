On her way back home, "AAA" passed by a bakery where Olesco was working.&nbsp; Thereafter, somebody pulled her and covered her mouth with a hanky which caused her to be unconscious.&nbsp; When she regained consciousness at around 11:00 o'clock p.m., "AAA" found herself naked beside Olesco inside a room located near the bakery.&nbsp; Her whole body ached, especially her cheeks, tummy and her private part.&nbsp; "AAA" then slapped the accused three times and asked him why he raped her.&nbsp; Olesco answered that he would kill her should she report the incident to the police.&nbsp; After a while, accused told her to go home.&nbsp; She dressed up immediately and went home running.<br><br>When she arrived home, "AAA" told her cousin "EEE" about what happened.&nbsp; After two (2) days, "AAA" reported the incident to the barangay. The barangay officials asked her the whereabouts of the accused which she did not know then as she saw the accused [only] once and knows him only by face since at that time, she was just a week old in "DDD."<br><br>"AAA" explained that she was able to report the incident to the barangay officials two days after it happened since when she woke up in the morning of October 18, 200<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, it was already 9:00 o'clock a.m. and she could not stand as her whole body ached.<br><br>Thereafter, the barangay officials referred the matter to the police.&nbsp; An investigation was subsequently conducted.&nbsp; Thereafter, "AAA" was referred to the Philippine National Police Crime Division, Camp Crame, Quezon City, for medico-legal examination.<br><br>On October 20, 2001, Dr. Jericho Angelito Q. Cordero, a Medico-Legal Officer based at the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory, Camp Crame, Quezon City, conducted a physical and genital examination on "AAA." x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>According to Dr. Cordero, at the time of the examination, "AAA" was in a non-virgin state physically which means that she had a previous intercourse&nbsp; x x x about ten days or maybe a year ago.&nbsp; "AAA" had also a lacerated wound with a healing period of about ten (10) to fifteen (15) days caused by a hard, blunt instrument inserted into her vagina like a finger or an erect penis which would fit and succumb to elasticity or x x x a stick.&nbsp; He also testified that the laceration of the victim was consistent with the time of the alleged commission of the crime.&nbsp; He likewise testified that "AAA" told him that she only discovered the wounds when she woke up [naked] at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of October 17, 200<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> with Olesco beside her x x x.&nbsp; Aside from his Initial Medico-Legal Report, he likewise made his Final Report No. M-2674-01 (Exhibit "E") whereby he concluded that there are no external signs of any form of trauma on the external genital area which has a deep healed laceration consistent with sexual intercourse.<br><br>Olesco denied having raped "AAA" and put up the "sweetheart defense".&nbsp; He testified that he worked as a baker for five (5) months in a bakery inside "FFF," "BBB," owned by Rafael Arimado.&nbsp; Prior to the alleged rape incident, "AAA" used to buy bread in the bakery.&nbsp; He came to know her when "AAA" introduced herself x x x.&nbsp; After three months, he and "AAA" became sweethearts.&nbsp; According to Olesco, there is no truth to the complaint filed against him by "AAA."&nbsp; He alleged that it was "AAA" who went to him at the bakery at around 7:00 o'clock in the evening of October 17, 2001.&nbsp; "AAA" wanted him to go with her [to her] province in Leyte, to which he agreed.&nbsp; The room referred to by "AAA" is for the female workers near the bakery where they talked in the presence of their employer. Che-Che and Alex, his co-workers, Jerry and Annalyn Arimando were also inside the room when they entered but they went out.&nbsp; He further testified that during his second month stay in the bakery, he got attracted to "AAA" whom he used to see every afternoon and they talked even for just a minute until he proposed his love to her x x x.&nbsp; When they became steady, there were occasions that they kissed each other, held hands and x x x even made love in a room beside the bakery prior to October 17, 2001 at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening and thereafter, "AAA" left at 10:00 o'clock.&nbsp; However, on October 18, 2001, "AAA" had him arrested by the barangay tanods [who] brought [him] to the Coastal Police Headquarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On September 23, 2003, the RTC rendered its Decision disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In fine, the Court finds accused, REYNALDO OLESCO Y ONDAYANG liable for SIMPLE RAPE under Article 266-A, par. 1 3(b) in relation to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 8353 and the penalty to be meted the accused should be RECLUSION PERPETUA in the absence of any aggravating or qualifying circumstance which is from twenty (20) years and one (1) day to forty (40) years of imprisonment.<br><br>Moreover, accused has to indemnify the private complainant the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity as well as the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.&nbsp; This is because "under the present case law, an award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity is mandatory upon finding of the fact of rape.&nbsp; This is exclusive of the award of moral damages of P50,000.00 without need of further proof as it is now recognized as inherently concomitant with and necessarily proceeds from the appalling crime of rape which per se warrants an award for moral damages. (People v. Caratay, 316 SCRA 251).<br><br>WHEREFORE, the prosecution having been able to prove the guilt of accused, REYNALDO OLESCO y ONDAYANG beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of SIMPLE RAPE defined and punished under Art. 266-A, par. 1[,] 3(b) in relation to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 8353[,] accused REYNALDO OLESCO y ONDAYANG is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.<br><br>Pursuant to existing jurisprudence, accused REYNALDO OLESCO y ONDAYANG, is ordered to indemnify "AAA," the private complainant, the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>No pronouncement as to cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>In finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, the RTC noted that "AAA" positively identified appellant as the malefactor;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that appellant failed to rebut the testimony of the victim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> or impute ill-motive on her part;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and that "AAA's" testimony was brief, clear, and straightforward<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and supported by the medical findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the RTC observed that appellant's "sweetheart defense" lacked sufficient and convincing proof;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> neither was it substantiated by any documentary and/or other evidence like mementos, love letters, notes, pictures and the like. Worse, appellant did not present his employer or any of his co-workers to corroborate his claim that he and "AAA" were sweethearts and that "AAA" used to frequent his place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC also held that assuming "AAA" and appellant were sweethearts, it does not serve as license or justification to commit rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On September 30, 2003, appellant filed his Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which was given due course by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>On appeal, the appellate court affirmed the trial court's Decision <i>in toto</i>, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the assailed September 23, 2003 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Para√±aque City, Branch 258, in Criminal Case No. 01-01193, is hereby AFFIRMED in its entirety.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><b><i>The Parties' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Appellee maintains that appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>On the other hand, appellant claims that he was denied his right to due process considering that as alleged in the Information, the rape was committed through the use of force and intimidation. However, what was established by the prosecution is the fact that "AAA" was unconscious when she was raped. Appellant also insists that there was nothing in "AAA's" testimony that would indicate that appellant had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; Appellant likewise insists that no sufficient evidence was presented to prove his culpability.&nbsp; He argues that "AAA's" testimony is ambiguous and full of discrepancies.&nbsp; He opines that "AAA's" claim that she lost consciousness when her mouth was covered with a drug-laced handkerchief was unbelievable and ridiculous.&nbsp; Moreover, appellant alleges that "AAA's" testimony in open court contradicts her narration in her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay.</i><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>The CA correctly disregarded appellant's claim that he did not use force nor resort to intimidation in the commission of the crime. We agree with the CA that appellant's act of pulling "AAA" and covering her face with drug-laced handkerchief is synonymous with force, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>It has been duly established that when "AAA" passed by the bakery, Olesco immediately pulled her and covered her mouth with a handkerchief.&nbsp; She smelled something like a "snow bear" and lost consciousness. Thereafter, Olesco raped her.<br><br>In other words, "AAA" became unconscious after accused employed force on her; that is, pulling her and covering her mouth with a "snow bear" smelling hanky.&nbsp; The act of pulling her and covering her face with a drug-laced hanky is the immediate cause why "AAA" fell unconscious which facilitated accused's bestial desire against "AAA."&nbsp; There is, therefore, no truth to the claim of Olesco that no force was employed upon "AAA" to satisfy his bestial desire.&nbsp; It is a well-established doctrine that for the crime of rape to exist, it is not necessary that the force employed accomplishing it be so great or of such character as could not be resisted; it is only necessary that the force employed by the guilty party be sufficient to consummate the purpose which he had in view x x x.&nbsp; Thus, the use of force and intimidation as alleged in the information has been sufficiently established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Indeed, "[f]ailure to offer tenacious resistance does not make the submission by the complainant to the criminal acts of the accused voluntary. What is necessary is that the force employed against her be sufficient to consummate the purpose which he has in mind."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><sup></sup><br><br>Appellant's contentions that "AAA's" testimony is ambiguous and full of discrepancies and that her claim that she lost consciousness when her mouth was covered with a drug-laced handkerchief is unbelievable and ridiculous deserve scant consideration.&nbsp; To be sure, these contentions pertain to the assessment of witness's credibility which is properly within the province of the trial court.&nbsp; In this case, the trial court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Based on the foregoing, the Court in its careful analysis of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as compared to that of the defense, found that those of the former carry greater weight and credence for being straightforward, reasonable, clear and categorical which is entirely different from the allegations of the defense. To the Court, the rape was consummated under paragraph 1, 3(b) of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We find no reason to depart from said findings of the trial court, which were affirmed by the CA. "As a rule, x x x findings [of the trial court] deserve weight and respect. The same is true as regards the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, because it is the trial judge who hears them and observes their demeanor while testifying. It is only when the trial court has overlooked or misapprehended some facts or circumstances of weight and influence that these matters are re-opened for independent examination and review by appellate courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; "The age-old rule is that the task of assigning values to the testimonies of witnesses in the stand and weighing their credibility is best left to the trial court which forms its first-hand impressions as a witness testifies before it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Both the trial court and the CA properly disregarded appellant's claim that he and "AAA" were sweethearts. "The `sweetheart theory' or `sweetheart defense' is an oft-abused justification that rashly derides the intelligence of this Court and sorely tests our patience.&nbsp; For the Court to even consider giving credence to such defense, it must be proven by compelling evidence.&nbsp; The defense cannot just present testimonial evidence in support of the theory, as in the instant case. Independent proof is required -- such as tokens, mementos, and photographs. There is none presented here by the defense." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><table ¬†="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">So, you said you came to know this "AAA" since she used to buy bread at the bakery and you testified that you became steady.&nbsp; Can you remember what particular month or date you became steady with "AAA"?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I cannot remember that anymore, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And do you have any remembrance or anything that will prove that this "AAA" has been your steady or girlfriend?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">None, ma'am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And how long did you become steady with this "AAA" before October 17?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Three (3) months, ma'am.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></blockquote><br>"In any event, the claim is inconsequential since it is well-settled that being sweethearts does not negate the commission of rape because such fact does not give appellant license to have sexual intercourse against her will, and will not exonerate him from the criminal charge of rape.
