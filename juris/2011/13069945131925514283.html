				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>May funds of the Philippine Coconut Authority, a public corporation, be 
garnished on account of an execution pending appeal? </p>
<p>This is the pivotal issue raised in the instant petition for review which 
assails the January 22, 1997 Decision of respondent Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. 
SP No. 42829<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> holding that such funds 
are public funds exempt from garnishment. </p>
<p>The facts are simple: </p>
<p>On September 10, 1996, the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 99, 
rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Civil Case No. 
Q-93-14581, entitled <i>"Corona International, Inc., Plaintiff versus Philippine 
Coconut Authority, Defendant"</i>, disposing of the case as follows -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby 
rendered - </p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the total sum of P9,082,068.00 
representing the balance of the contract price for Phase III of the project, the 
10% retention for Phases I, II and III of the project, and the contract price 
for Phase IV of the project;<br>
</li><li>Ordering the defendant to indemnify plaintiff the sum equal to two (2%) per 
centum of P9,082,068.00 monthly from date of the filing of the complaint up to 
March 30, 1995, as actual and for damages;<br>
</li><li>Ordering the defendant to indemnify plaintiff the sum equal to 1 and Â½% per 
cent of P9,082.068.00 monthly from March 30, 1995 up to the time the full amount 
is fully paid, as and by way of actual damages;<br>
</li><li>The sum of P1,000,000.00 as and for attorney's fee; plus the costs of the 
suit. </li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The counterclaim interposed by the defendant is hereby dismissed for lack of 
evidence to sustain it.</p>
<p>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>On September 25, 1996, petitioner filed a Motion for Execution of Judgment 
Pending Appeal to which private respondent filed an Opposition. After hearing, 
the trial court granted the motion for execution pending appeal "if only to 
prevent the irreparable collapse of" petitioner's business operations. It also 
considered the appeal taken by private respondent as "patently unmeritorious and 
would only result in the delay of the final disposition of the case." It, 
however, required petitioner to post a Twenty Million (P20,000,000.00) bond to 
protect private respondent in the event its decision is reversed on appeal. </p>
<p>With the filing by petitioner of the required bond, a writ of execution was 
issued, on the strength of which funds of private respondent with the Land Bank 
of the Philippines, in the amount of Seventeen Million Five Hundred Twenty Nine 
Thousand Three Hundred Sixty Three Pesos and Seventy Six Centavos 
(P17,529,363.76), was garnished. The bank, however, refused to release the said 
amount, prompting petitioner to file a Motion to Require Release of Bank 
Deposit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on December 5, 1996, private respondent filed a Motion to Quash 
Writ of Execution Pending Appeal and Notice of Garnishment alleging that it had 
not yet received a copy of the Order granting petitioner's Motion for Execution 
of Judgment Pending Appeal which allowed the garnishment of its funds with the 
Land Bank of the Philippines. It further contended that the bond filed by 
petitioner did not bear the court's approval. Finally, it expressed its 
readiness to file a supersedeas bond to stay execution of the court's judgment. 
Petitioner filed its Opposition on December 10, 1996. </p>
<p>On December 11, 1996, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> denying private respondent's Motion to 
Quash and ordered the Land Bank of the Philippines to release and turn over to 
the court sheriff the garnished fund of private respondent immediately upon its 
receipt of said Order. </p>
<p>Private respondent then filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with 
respondent Court of Appeals. On January 22, 1997, the Court of Appeals rendered 
the assailed Decision, nullifying and setting aside the Order of the trial court 
granting the execution pending appeal. It also issued a writ of preliminary 
injunction enjoining the court sheriff from enforcing both the Writ of Execution 
and Notice of Garnishment against private respondent.</p>
<p>Hence, the instant petition for review anchored upon the following grounds 
-</p>
<p align="center">"I </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW, IN HOLDING THAT 
THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF OR 
EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ISSUING THE ORDER (ANNEX "F") ALLOWING EXECUTION 
PENDING APPEAL, AND ORDER (ANNEX "I") ORDERING THE GARNISHEE TO RELEASE AND TURN 
OVER THE FUNDS OF RESPONDENT PCA TO DEPUTY SHERIFF JOSE G. MARTINEZ. 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">II </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW, IN ENTERTAINING ISSUES NOT 
RAISED IN THE LOWER COURT TO SUPPORT ITS DECISION REVERSING THE CHALLENGED 
ORDERS. </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">III </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW, IN HOLDING THAT THE 
PHILIPPINE COCONUT AUTHORITY IS AN AGENCY OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND IN 
HOLDING THAT ITS FUNDS ARE EXEMPT FROM LEVY ON EXECUTION AND/OR 
GARNISHMENT.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW, IN ISSUING A WRIT OF 
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is apparent from the challenged Decision that the rationale for setting 
aside the execution pending appeal was its finding that the funds of private 
respondent, being public in nature, cannot be garnished. </p>
<p>As argued by petitioner, however, the issue of whether or not the funds 
garnished were public in nature was not raised in the trial court and was merely 
entertained for the first time in the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings before the 
Court of Appeals. We agree with petitioner on this ground and so rule that not 
having been raised below, such an issue could no longer be considered in the 
Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>This leaves us with the question of whether or not there is basis to sustain 
execution pending appeal ordered by the trial court. </p>
<p><b><i>Section 2, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</i></b> lays 
down the rule for execution pending appeal, categorized as discretionary 
execution, to wit -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 2. Discretionary execution. </p>
<p>(a) Execution of a judgment or final order pending appeal. - On motion of the 
prevailing party with notice to the adverse party filed in the trial court while 
it has jurisdiction over the case and is in possession of either the original 
record or the record on appeal, as the case may be, at the time of the filing of 
such motion, said court may, in its discretion, order execution of a judgment or 
final order even before the expiration of the period to appeal. </p>
<p>After the trial court has lost jurisdiction, the motion for execution pending 
appeal may be filed in the appellate court. </p>
<p>Discretionary execution may only issue upon good reasons to be stated in a 
special order after due hearing." </p></blockquote>
<p>It is evident from the foregoing that a primary consideration for allowing 
execution pending appeal would be the existence of good reasons. In turn, "good 
reasons" has been held to consist of compelling circumstances justifying the 
immediate execution lest judgment becomes illusory. Such reasons must constitute 
superior circumstances demanding urgency which will outweigh the injury or 
damages should the losing party secure a reversal of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p>We note that the reason of the trial court in granting execution pending 
appeal was to prevent the irreparable collapse of petitioner's business 
operation and that private respondent's appeal is patently unmeritorious and 
would only result in the delay of the final disposition of the case. </p>
<p>Does this constitute good reason to order execution pending appeal? Will this 
outweigh the injury or damage caused private respondent should the latter secure 
a reversal of the judgment against it? </p>
<p>We find that it does not. </p>
<p>To begin with, it would appear that the irreparable collapse of petitioner's 
business operation, as feared by the trial court, is illusory. As manifested by 
private respondent, petitioner has an application for the expansion of its 
operations with the National Telecommunications Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Evidently, such an application would not 
have been filed had petitioner truly been in the brink of financial bankruptcy. 
Moreover, the latest financial report submitted by petitioner to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, on the records, would readily show that its assets 
exceed its liabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p>We also note that the property bond offered by petitioner and accepted by the 
trial court has already been conveyed to Natas-ya Enterprises, Inc. <i>via</i> a 
Deed of Exchange dated January 30, 1996 and registered on July 25, 1997. Said 
Natas-ya Enterprises is now the registered owner of the subject property under 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. N-179573 of the Register of Deeds of Quezon 
City. The same property is further the subject of a case pending before the 
Quezon City Regional Trial Court. Clearly, then, this property bond can no 
longer serve its purpose as security for damages that may be obtained by private 
respondent on account of execution pending appeal. </p>
<p>In upholding the disallowance of the execution pending appeal ordered by the 
trial court, <i>albeit</i> on different grounds, we are guided by the rule that 
execution pending appeal must be strictly construed being an exception to the 
general rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> So, too, execution 
pending appeal is not to be availed of and applied routinely, but only in 
extraordinary circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Here, 
with the alleged collapse of petitioner's business operations rendered doubtful, 
we find no good reason to order execution pending appeal. </p>
<p>Finally, it is not difficult to see the injury or damage execution pending 
appeal would cause private respondent which is a public corporation tasked to 
implement the national policy of the State to promote the rapid integrated 
development and growth of the coconut and palm oil industry and to ensure that 
the coconut farmers become direct participants of such development and 
growth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Among the funds held by 
private respondent which would be subject to execution pending appeal would be 
coconut levy funds vital both to the coconut industry and to coconut farmers, 
which being vested with public interest, we are duty bound to protect. Weighed 
against these considerations, execution pending appeal further proves unwise.
