This it failed to do.<br><br>A perusal of the Agreement dated May 9, 1992 clearly shows that the sewing machines, snap machines and boilers were pledged to Nonwoven by Juniat to guarantee his obligation.&nbsp; However, under Article 2096 of the Civil Code, "[a] pledge shall not take effect against third persons if a description of the thing pledged and the date of the pledge do not appear in a public instrument."&nbsp; Hence, just like the chattel mortgage executed in favor of petitioner, the pledge executed by Juniat in favor of Nonwoven cannot bind petitioner.<br><br>Neither can we sustain the finding of the CA that: "The machineries were ceded to THIRD PARTY NONWOVEN by way of <i>dacion en pago</i>, a contract later entered into by WINWOOD/WINGYAN and THIRD PARTY NONWOVEN."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As aptly pointed out by petitioner, no evidence was presented by Nonwoven to show that the attached properties were subsequently sold to it by way of a <i>dacion en pago</i>.&nbsp; Also, there is nothing in the Agreement dated May 9, 1992 to indicate that the motorized sewing machines, snap machines and boilers were ceded to Nonwoven as payment for the Wingyan's and Winwood's obligation.&nbsp; It bears stressing that there can be no transfer of ownership if the delivery of the property to the creditor is by way of security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, in case of doubt as to whether a transaction is one of pledge or <i>dacion en pago</i>, the presumption is that it is a pledge as this involves a lesser transmission of rights and interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, we are constrained to reverse the ruling of the CA.&nbsp; Nonwoven is not entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the attached properties because it failed to show that it has a better title over the same.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED. </b> The assailed June 23, 2005 Decision and the February 9, 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
