Other bacterial, viral and parasitic infections may also produce an antigenic component. Some of these infections are Typhoid fever, Syphilis, Leptospirosis, Toxoplasmosis, Varicella, Mumps, Measles, Schistosomiasis and Hepatitis B and C infection.<br><br>·&nbsp; May form part of a multisystem immune-complex disorder such as Lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, Cryoglobulinemia, Bacterial Endocarditis, Systemic Vasculitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis.’</blockquote><br>The appellant alleged that he was exposed to tremendous pressures demanded by his job necessitating prolonged hours of work, most of the time sitting for hours and even delaying or foregoing urination in order not to disrupt the continuity of concentration on the job.&nbsp; He also alleged that during his field assignments, mostly in remote provinces, he also experienced foregoing urination and skipping of meals in order to rush the completion of his examination reports.&nbsp; Unfortunately, his bare assertions do not automatically make his ailment compensable. Awards for compensation cannot rest on speculations or presumptions.&nbsp; The employee must present evidence to prove a positive proposition (Orate vs. CA, G.R. No. 132761, March 26, 2003).&nbsp; The appellant’s habit of delaying his urination should not be attributed to his work but to personal neglect of his health.<br><br>Generally, a physician’s report is the best evidence of work-connection and be the basis for an award because the physician is in the best position to judge possible causal relation between the illness and the work performed.&nbsp; In this case, the certificate issued by the appellant’s attending physician is silent under the item which reads: <i><b>Was the injury or illness directly caused by the employee’s duties?</b></i>&nbsp; Having failed to find substantial evidence to establish work-connection in this case, this Commission finds no sufficient cause to deviate from the decision of the System denying appellant’s claim.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is <b>AFFIRMED</b> and the claim is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals </i></b><br><br>On appeal, the CA reversed the ruling of the ECC.&nbsp; The CA ruled that Besitan is entitled to compensation benefits under PD No. 626, as amended, because his ailment was aggravated by the nature of his work, as evidenced by the Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> issued by Dr. Gregorio Suarez II, Bank Physician III of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision of the CA reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>UPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS</b>, the petition for review is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The November 16, 2006 Decision of the Employees’ Compensation Commission in ECC Case No. GM-17449-1002-06 is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; The respondent Government Service Insurance System is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay the petitioner Manuel P.

It would appear therefore that the nature of his work could have increased his risk of contracting the disease. His frequent travels to remote areas in the country could have exposed him to certain bacterial, viral, and parasitic infection, which in turn could have caused his disease.&nbsp; Delaying his urination during his long trips to the provinces could have also increased his risk of contracting his disease.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, even the Bank Physician of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Dr. Gregorio Suarez II, agreed that Besitan’s working condition could have contributed to the weakening of his kidneys, which could have caused his disease, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>This is to certify that Mr. Manuel P. Besitan [is] a Bank Examiner of BSP, whose duties [require] him to work over prolonged hours and travel to remote places in the Philippines.<br><br>He claims that during the delivery of his duties he often [foregoes] urination and taking replenishment of water.&nbsp; At times, he claims that he has to eat and drink what is available in the area [of his bank examination].&nbsp; This could probably contribute to the increase of uric acid in his system.<br><br>All these conditions could contribute to the weakening of his kidney thereby [progressing] to the present condition of his ESRD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, the above-quoted Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> is sufficient to prove that the working condition of Besitan increased his risk of contracting Glomerulonephritis.&nbsp; In claims for compensation benefits, a doctor’s certification as to the nature of a claimant’s disability deserves full credence because no medical practitioner would issue certifications indiscriminately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; As we see it then, Besitan was able to prove by substantial evidence his entitlement to compensation benefits under PD No. 626.<br><br>In closing, it may not be amiss to add that the primordial purpose of PD No. 626 is to provide meaningful protection to the workers against the hazards of disability or illness; hence, a liberal attitude in favor of the employee and his beneficiaries in deciding claims for compensation should be adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.

The pertinent portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br>In the case at bench, we believe that this probability exists. The petitioner’s job as Bank Officer II required him to work for long hours, obliging him, most of the time, to sit for hours on end, to forgo urination and to skip meals. And during his field assignments in remote and depressed areas especially in Mindanao and the Visayas, he was forced to take inadequate food and poor quality of water. To our mind, all these conditions probably led to the deterioration of the petitioner’s health and the development of his kidney ailment. In fact, Dr. Gregorio Suarez II, Bank Physician III of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, issued a certification to the effect that conditions present in the nature of the petitioner’s job “could contribute to the weakening of his kidney thereby [progressing] to the present condition of his ESRD.” In the premises, we hold that the ailment of the petitioner was aggravated by the nature of his work, and thus compensable under PD No. 626, as amended<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Id. at 120.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Id. at 125.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Id. at 140.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Id. at 141.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Id. at 145.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Id. at 141.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Id. at 141-144.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Id. at 144.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Implementing Presidential Decree No. 626.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>Castor-Garupa v.
