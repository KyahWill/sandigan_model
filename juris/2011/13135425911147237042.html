(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>A certificate of deposit is defined as "a written acknowledgment by a bank or banker of the receipt of a sum of money on deposit which the bank or banker promises to pay to the depositor, to the order of the depositor, or to some other person or his order, whereby the relation of debtor and creditor between the bank and the depositor is created." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner claims that its SAP is not a certificate of deposit bearing interest because unlike a time deposit, its SAP is payable on demand and is evidenced by a passbook and not by a certificate of deposit.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>In <i>China Banking Corporation v.
