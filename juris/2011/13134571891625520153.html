				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At bench is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed pursuant to Rule 45 of the <i>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, primarily assailing the Decision dated 25 October 2005 rendered by the then Special Twenty-Third Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 69368, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, dated October 9, 1995 is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; The Complaint filed by Plaintiff-Appellee is DISMISSED.&nbsp; Spouses ELENA ARCIAGA and ROGELIO Arciaga are hereby declared the rightful owner[s] of the disputed property.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Facts</i></b><br></center><br>The suit concerns a 911 square meter parcel of land situated in the District of Toril, Davao City, presently registered in the name of respondent Elena Arciaga (Elena), married to respondent Rogelio Arciaga (Rogelio), under Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-139473 of the Davao City registry. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; The land used to form part of the Y. Furukawa Daliao Plantation which, after being turned over to the Philippine government, was initially administered by the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation (NAFCO) and, later, by the Board of Liquidators (BOL), pursuant to Republic Act No. 477, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as amended. A former tenant of NAFCO at the Furukawa Plantation, Co., Inc., <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> it appears that Loreto Luga (Loreto) became a tenant of the BOL <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and, in said capacity, occupied the subject parcel since 1957, eventually building a house of light of materials thereon. On 28 July 1960, however, it appears that an Occupant's Affidavit was executed by one Honorio Romero (Honorio), a former employee of NAFCO, over a 2.5 hectare landholding of which the land in litigation formed part. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 3 December 1970, Honorio executed a Deed of Transfer of Right over a 600 square meter portion of said landholding in favor of Rogelio who paid the sum of P10,000.00 as consideration for the improvements thereon. On 23 March 1972, the former further executed a similar deed selling in favor of the latter his interest over an adjacent 340 square meter portion of the same landholding, for the sum of P2,000.00. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; In receipt of Elena's application for patent/title over the subject parcel, the BOL issued and caused the posting of the 16 November 1987 Notice directing person/s affected thereby to make known their adverse claim/s, if any. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In support of her application, Elena filed the required Occupant's Affidavit of Application, buttressed by a Joint-Affidavit executed by her witnesses as well as a Certification issued by Barangay Chairman of Toril, attesting to her actual possession of the subject parcel. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>With the appraisal and inspection of the land in litigation, the approval of Elena's application was recommended by BOL Officer-in-Charge/Operation's Manager Gaudencio Wamelda to the BOL's General Manager. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On 8 March 1988, Elena was apprised of the fact that her application had been approved under said Board's Resolution No. 60, Series of 1988, subject to the payment of the total cost of P14,235.00 which she paid on 24 March 1988. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Upon the execution on 12 May 1988 of the Deed of Absolute Sale over the parcel, the BOL favorably indorsed and requested the issuance of a certificate of title in favor of Elena and forwarded to the Davao City Register of Deeds copies of the approved tracing cloth plan, white print copies thereof as well as the technical descriptions of the subject parcel. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On 29 November 1988, Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-139473 was eventually issued in favor of respondent Elena who, forthwith, declared the land in her name for taxation purposes and started paying the real estate taxes due thereon. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On 2 March 1994, Loreto commenced the instant suit with the filing of his complaint for reconveyance of title and damages against Elena and Rogelio which was docketed as Civil Case No. 22,718-94 before Branch 17 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City (RTC).&nbsp; Claiming that he had been in possession of the subject parcel since 1957, Loreto alleged, among other matters, that he discovered the titling of the same in the name of Elena only in 1993; and, that the latter had fraudulently misled the BOL into believing that she was the one in possession of the land. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Served with summons, Elena and Rogelio, on the other hand, filed their 16 April 1994 answer, specifically denying the material allegations of the complaint. Contending that they acquired the disputed parcel from Honorio, they averred that the possession asserted by Loreto had been by virtue of their tolerance and consent as well as that of their said predecessor-in-interest. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; In his 5 May 1994 reply, Loreto, in turn, insisted that he and his family had stayed on the land long before Honorio and the Spouses Arciaga laid claim thereto. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The issues joined and the mandatory pre-trial conference subsequently terminated, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the RTC went on to receive the testimonial and documentary evidence the parties adduced in support of their respective causes. In addition to his own testimony <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> as well as the documents presented in the course thereof, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Loreto proffered those elicited from his neighbors Canuto Blantucas and Sofronio Obenque, BOL employee Bruno Arlegui, <i>Barangay </i>Toril Pangkat Secretary Fidel Blantucas and the same locality's&nbsp; <i>Barangay</i> Chairman, Consing Te. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The defense evidence, on the other hand, consisted of the testimonies of Elena and Rogelio <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as well as those given by their predecessor-in-interest, Honorio and BOL Branch Operation Manager Gaudencio Wamelda. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; In refutation of said defense witnesses' testimonies as well as the pieces of documentary evidence adduced in connection therewith, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Loreto once again took the witness stand on rebuttal <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and offered the testimonial <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and/or documentary evidence <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> provided by Luis Denia Farm Manager, Manuel Denia.<br><br>On 9 October 1995, the RTC rendered a decision, finding that the evidence adduced by the parties preponderantly established that Loreto is entitled to the land in litigation since his possession thereof preceded that asserted by the Spouses Arciaga.&nbsp; Brushing aside the latter's claim that former's possession was merely tolerated by them and Honorio, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the RTC disposed of the case in the following wise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of the plaintiff, as well as that of the defendants, sufficient to prove by preponderance of evidence the right for reconveyance of TCT No. T-139473, from defendant Elena Arciaga, obtain[ed] through fraud and misrepresentation, and falsification of document with the Board of Liquidators, Toril, Davao City, into the name of plaintiff, Loreto Luga, within thirty (30) days from receipt of decision, by defendants.<br><br>Failure of defendants to execute a deed of reconveyance of the above-title in favor of plaintiff, within the above-period, the Clerk of Court, of this court, will execute the proper deed of reconveyance in favor of plaintiff, of the above-mentioned certificate of title, with cost against defendants.<br><br>Plaintiff's prayer for recovery of moral damages, exemplary damages and litigation expenses, cannot be granted for failure of plaintiff to support award of the above damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Elevated by Elena and Rogelio on appeal before the CA <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> under docket of CA-G.R. CV No. 69368, the foregoing decision was, however, reversed and set-aside in the herein assailed 25 October 2005 decision rendered by said court's then Special Twenty-Third Division.&nbsp; In upholding the Spouses' Arciaga's claim over that asserted by Loreto, the CA ruled that the evidence on record disclose that: (a) the latter was merely allowed to occupy the land in litigation by the former's predecessor-in-interest, Honorio; (b) Loreto's testimony revealed that he never possessed the parcel in the concept of an owner; (c) unlike the Spouses Arciaga, Loreto never declared the land for taxation purposes in his own name and only attempted to do so only in 1993; and, (d) since Loreto's evidence does not constitute the "well-nigh incontrovertible" evidence required to acquire title to land through possession and occupation, he is not entitled to the recoveyance ordered by the RTC. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Having filed a motion for the reconsideration of the foregoing decision, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), as Loreto's counsel, moved for substitution of parties in view of its client's death on 6 October 1998. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; As a consequence, Loreto was substituted in the case by his wife, Celerina Luga (Celerina), and their children, petitioners Purificacion Luga-Biong, Elizabeth Luga-Cabana, Rosalie Luga-Tanutan, Ledia Luga-Guy-ab, Marites Luga-Gravino, Nestor Luga and David Luga (petitioners).&nbsp; Duly opposed by the Spouses Arciaga, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the aforesaid motion for reconsideration was denied for lack of merit in the CA's resolution dated 27 October 2006, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> hence, this petition. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Subsequent to Celerina's death on 5 November 2005, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Rogelio also died on 6 July 2006, survived by Elena and their children, Rogel, Gerlyn and Giselle, all surnamed Arciaga. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Issue</i></b><br></center><br>Petitioners urge the reversal of the assailed 25 October 2005 decision and 27 October 2006 resolution, upon the affirmative of the following issue:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHETHER THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN GRANTING THE APPEAL OF THE RESPONDENTS AND IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE PETITIONERS.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>We find the petition bereft of merit.<br><br>As part of the Y. Furukawa Daliao Plantation which had been turned over to the Republic of the Philippines in accordance with the Philippine Property Act of 1946 and Republic Act No. 8, the disposition of the land in litigation by the BOL is clearly governed Republic Act No. 477. As amended by Republic Act No. 1970, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Section 1 of Republic Act No. 477 provides that all lands which have been so transferred to the Republic of the Philippines shall be subdivided into convenient sized lots, except such portions thereof as the President of the Philippines may reserve for the use of the National or Local government, or the use of corporations or entities owned or controlled by the government. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; As amended by Presidential Decree No. 967, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> on the other hand, Section 3 of the same law provides that such lands of the public domain, except commercial and industrial lots, shall be sold by the BOL to persons who are qualified to acquire public lands, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> giving preference first to <i>bona fide</i> occupants thereof on or before 12 December 1946 but not later than 31 October 1960 and who shall be limited to the area they have actually and continuously improved and maintained. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Our perusal of the record shows that, as the party asserting a right superior to that claimed by the Spouses Arciaga, Loreto failed to prove that he was a <i>bona fide</i> occupant of the land in litigation.
