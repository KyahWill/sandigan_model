</blockquote>

<p>The second assailed issuance of the CA denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.
  
</p>
<p>The facts:</p>
<p>Respondent was employed by petitioner ClientLogic Philippines, Inc. 
(now known as shall hereafter be referred to as SITEL on February 14,
    2005 as a call center agent for its Bell South Account. After six 
(6) months, he was promoted to the “Mentor” position, and thereafter to
    the “Coach” position. A “Coach” is a team supervisor who is in 
charge of dealing with customer complaints which could not be resolved 
by
    call center agents. In June 2006, he was transferred to the Green 
Dot Account.</p>
<p>During respondent’s stint at the Dot Green Account, respondent 
noticed that some of the call center agents under his helm would
    often make excuses to leave their work stations. Their most common 
excuse was that they would visit the company’s medical clinic. To
    verify that they were not using the clinic as an alibi to cut their 
work hours, respondent sent an e-mail to the clinic’s personnel
    requesting for the details of the agents who sought medical 
consultation. His request was denied on the ground that medical records
    of employees are highly confidential and can only be disclosed in 
cases of health issues, and not to be used to build any
    disciplinary case against them.</p>
<p>On October 11, 2006, respondent received a notice requiring him to 
explain why he should not be penalized for: (1) violating Green Dot
    Company’s Policy and Procedure for Direct Deposit Bank Info Request 
when he accessed a customer’s online account and then gave the latter’s
    routing and reference numbers for direct deposit; and (2) gravely 
abusing his discretion when he requested for the medical records of his
    team members. Respondent did not deny the infractions imputed 
against him. He, however, justified his actuations by explaining that 
the
    customer begged him to access the account because she did not have a
 computer or an internet access and that he merely requested for a
    patient tracker, not medical records.</p>
<p>In November 2006, a poster showing SITEL’s organizational chart was 
posted on the company’s bulletin board, but respondent’s name
    and picture were conspicuously missing, and the name and photo of 
another employee appeared in the position which respondent was
    supposedly occupying.</p>
<p>On January 22, 2007, SITEL posted a notice of vacancy for 
respondent’s position, and on February 12, 2007, he received a Notice of
    Termination. These events prompted him to file a complaint for 
illegal dismissal; non-payment of overtime pay, rest day pay, holiday
    pay, service incentive leave pay; full backwages; damages; and 
attorney’s fees before the Labor Arbiter (LA) against herein
    petitioners SITEL and its officers, Joseph Velasquez, Irene Roa, and
 Rodney Spires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p>In their position paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 petitioners averred that respondent was dismissed on account of valid 
and justifiable causes. He acted
    with serious misconduct which breached the trust and confidence 
reposed in him by the company. He was duly furnished with the twin
    notices required by the Labor Code and further, he is not entitled 
to overtime pay, rest day pay, night shift differential, holiday
    pay, and service incentive leave pay because he was a supervisor, 
hence, a member of the managerial staff.</p>
<p>In a decision dated June 29, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 the LA ruled in favor of respondent by declaring him illegally 
dismissed and ordering
      petitioners to pay his full backwages and, in lieu of 
reinstatement, his separation pay.  The LA further awarded respondents 
money
      claims upon finding that he was not occupying a managerial 
position. The decretal portion of the decision reads: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, all premises duly considered,  [petitioners] are hereby found guilty of illegally dismissing [respondent]. As
  such, [petitioners] shall be jointly and solidarily liable to pay [respondent] his full backwages from the date of his
  dismissal to the finality of this decision, computed as of today at <b>One Hundred Thirty Eight Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty
  Nine Pesos and 80/100 (P138,759.80)</b> plus, Seven Hundred Sixty Three Thousand Two Hundred Forty Eight Pesos and 67/100
  (P763,248.67) representing his separation pay at one month pay for every year of service, holiday pay and service incentive
  leave pay for the three years prior to the filing of this case, overtime pay for six(6) hours daily, rest day pay and ten
  percent (10%) as attorney’s fees.</p>
  <p>All other claims are hereby dismissed for lack of evidence.</p>
  <p>The computation of the foregoing monetary claims is hereto attached and made an integral part hereof as Annex “A.”</p>
  <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the NLRC which, in its November 29, 2007 resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 reversed and set aside the decision of the
  LA by dismissing the complaint for lack of merit on the ground that 
respondent’s employment was terminated for a just cause. The
  NLRC failed to discuss the money claims.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2008, the CA affirmed the NLRC’s finding that there was no illegal dismissal. Anent the money claims, the CA
  concurred with the LA’s ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p>
<p>Petitioners and respondent respectively moved for partial 
reconsideration, but their motions were denied in the CA Resolution 
dated January
  7, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> From the said 
denial, only petitioners resorted to this Court through the petition at 
bar. Respondent’s failure to partially
  appeal the CA’s Decision finding him not illegally dismissed has now 
rendered the same final and executory; hence, the instant petition
  shall traverse only the issue on money claims.</p>
<p>Petitioners argue in the main<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> that, as a team supervisor, respondent was a member of the managerial staff; hence, he is not
  entitled to overtime pay, rest day pay, holiday pay, and service incentive leave pay. </p>
<p>We deny the petition.</p>
<p>The petition hinges on the question of whether the duties and 
responsibilities performed by respondent qualify him as a member of
    petitioners’ managerial staff. This is clearly a question of fact, 
the determination of which entails an evaluation of the evidence on
    record.</p>
<p>The alleged errors of the CA lengthily enumerated in the petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> are essentially factual in nature and, therefore, outside the ambit of a
    petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules 
of Civil Procedure. The Court does not try facts since such statutory 
duty is
    devolved upon the labor. It is not for this Court to weigh and 
calibrate pieces of evidence otherwise adequately passed upon by the 
labor
    tribunals especially when affirmed by the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p>Petitioners claim exception to the foregoing rule and assert that the
 factual findings of the LA and the NLRC were conflicting. This is not
    true. The labor tribunals’ decisions were at odds only with respect 
to the issue of illegal dismissal. Anent, the money claims issue, it
    cannot be said that their rulings were contradictory because the 
NLRC, disappointingly, did not make any finding thereon and it 
erroneously
    construed that the resolution of the money claims was intertwined 
with the determination of the legality of respondent’s dismissal.
    Nonetheless, the CA has already rectified such lapse when it made a 
definitive review of the LA’s factual findings on respondent’s money
    claims. Agreeing with the LA, the CA held: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Article 82 of the Labor Code states that the provisions of the 
Labor Code on working conditions and rest periods shall not apply to
  managerial employees. Generally, managerial employees are not entitled
 to overtime pay for services rendered in excess of eight hours a
  day.</p>
  <p>Article 212(m) of the Labor Code defines a managerial employee as 
“one who is vested with powers or prerogatives to lay down and execute
    management policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, 
recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees, or to effectively
    recommend such managerial actions.”</p>
  <p>In his Position Paper, [respondent] states that he worked from 8:00
 p.m. to 10:00 a.m. or 4 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. of the following day; he was
    also required to work during his restdays and during holidays but he
 was not paid; he was also not paid overtime pay, night shift
    differentials, and service incentive leave. He was employed as call 
center agent on 14 February 2005, then promoted as “Mentor” in August
    2005, and again promoted to “Coach” position in September 2005, 
which was the position he had when he was terminated. A “coach” is a 
team
    supervisor who is in charge of dealing with customer complaints 
which could not be dealt with by call center agents, and if a call 
center
    agent could not meet the needs of a customer, he passes the 
customer’s call to the “coach.” Clearly, [respondent] is not a 
managerial
    employee as defined by law. Thus, he is entitled to [his] money 
claims.</p>
  <p>As correctly found by Executive Labor Arbiter Bose: “Employees are 
considered occupying managerial positions if they meet all of the 
following conditions, namely: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“1)	Their primary duty consists of management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or subdivision
  thereof;</p>
    <p>“2)	They customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more employees therein;</p>
    <p>“3)	They have the authority to hire or fire other employees of lower rank; or their suggestions and recommendations as to the
      hiring and firing and as to the promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight. </p>
  </blockquote>
“They are considered as officers or members of a managerial staff if they perform the following duties and responsibilities:

<blockquote>
  <p>“1)	The primary duty consists of the performance of work directly related to management  policies of their employer;</p>
  <p>“2)
    Customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment;</p>
  <p>“3)	(i) Regularly and directly assist a proprietor or a
    managerial employee whose primary duty consists of management of the
 establishment in which he is employed or subdivision thereof;
    or (ii) execute under general supervision work along specialized or 
technical lines requiring special training, experience, or
    knowledge; or (iii) execute, under general supervision, special 
assignment and tasks x x x. </p>
</blockquote>
“[Respondent’s] duties do not fall under any of the categories 
enumerated above. His work is not directly related to management
policies. Even the circumstances shown by the instant case reveal that 
[respondent] does not regularly exercise discretion and
independent judgment.  [Petitioners] submitted a list of the 
responsibilities of ‘HR Manager/Supervisor’ and ‘Division
Manager/Department Manager/Supervisors’ but these do not pertain to 
[respondent] who does not have any of the said positions. He was
just a team Supervisor and not [an] HR or Department Supervisor.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>We find no reversible error in the above ruling. The test of 
“supervisory” or “managerial status” depends on whether a person 
possesses
  authority to act in the interest of his employer and whether such 
authority is not merely routinary or clerical in nature, but requires 
the
  use of independent judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The position held by respondent and its concomitant duties failed to hurdle this test.</p>
<p> As a coach or team supervisor respondent’s main duty was to deal 
with customer complaints which could not be handled or solved by call
  center agents. If the members of his team could not meet the needs of a
 customer, they passed the customer’s call to respondent.</p>
<p>This job description does not indicate that respondent can exercise 
the powers and prerogatives to effectively recommend such managerial
  actions which require the customary use of independent judgment. There
 is no showing that he was actually conferred or actually exercising
  the following duties attributable to a “member of the managerial 
staff,” viz.: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1) 	The primary duty consists of the performance of work directly related to management of policies of their employer;</p>
  <p> 2)	Customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment;</p>
  <p>3)	(i)	Regularly and directly assist a proprietor or a managerial 
employee whose primary duty consists of management of the
    establishment in which he is employed or subdivision thereof; or 
(ii) execute under general supervision work along specialized or 
technical
    lines requiring special training, experience, or knowledge; or (iii)
 execute, under general supervision, special assignment and tasks; and</p>
  <p>4)	Who do not devote more than 20 percent of their hours worked in a
 work week to activities which are not directly and closely related
      to the performance of the work described in paragraphs (1), (2), 
and (3) above.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

According to petitioners, respondent also performed the following 
duties, as shown in the company’s Statement of Policy of Discipline:

<blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Know and understand in full the Policy on Discipline including their underlying reasons.

</li><li>Implement strictly and consistently the Policy on Discipline.

</li><li>Ensure that the said Policy on Discipline is communicated to and understood by all employees.

</li><li>Monitor compliance by employees with the said Policy.

</li><li>Advise HR Manager on the state of discipline in their respective departments; problems, if any, and recommend solution(s) and
corrective              action(s).</li></ol></blockquote>

<p>As correctly observed by the CA and the LA, these duties clearly 
pertained to “Division Managers/Department Managers/ Supervisors,” which
  respondent was not as he was merely a team supervisor. Petitioners 
themselves described respondent as “the superior of a call center agent;
  he heads and guides a specific number of agents, who form a team.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>
<p>From the foregoing, respondent is thus entitled to his claims for 
holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, overtime pay and rest day pay,
  pursuant to Book Three of the Labor Code, specifically Article 82,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in relation to Articles 87,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 93,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and 95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> thereof. </p>
