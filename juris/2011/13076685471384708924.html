45 of the Rules of Court seeks to annul the July 11, 2008 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the November 4, 2008 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 99088, which reversed and set aside the October 24, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and the February 26, 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>Orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of 
Quezon City, Branch 92. 
<p>The RTC Orders revived Criminal Case No. Q-03-115490, entitled “<em>People of 
the Philippines v. Juliet Yaneza, Pablo Abunda, Jr., Oscar Mapalo and Vicente 
Afulugencia,”</em> after the same was dismissed in an earlier Order. </p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The Facts</em></strong></p>
<p align="left">On September 12, 2002, petitioner Joseph Cerezo filed a complaint 
for libel against respondents Juliet Yaneza, Pablo Abunda, Jr., and Vicente 
Afulugencia (respondents), as well as Oscar Mapalo (Mapalo).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>Finding probable cause to indict 
respondents,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6] </sup>the Quezon City 
Prosecutor’s Office (OP-QC) filed the corresponding Information against them on 
February 18, 2003 before the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p align="left">Respondents thereafter filed a Motion for Reconsideration and/or 
Motion to Re-evaluate Prosecution’s Evidence before the OP-QC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
<p align="left">In its resolution dated November 20, 2003, the OP-QC reversed its 
earlier finding and recommended the withdrawal of the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Consequently, a Motion to Dismiss and 
Withdraw Information was filed before the RTC on December 3, 2003. During the 
intervening period, specifically on November 24, 2003, respondents were 
arraigned. All of them entered a “not guilty” plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p>
<p align="left">In deference to the prosecutor’s last resolution, the RTC ordered 
the criminal case dismissed in its Order dated March 17, 2004, <em>viz.: 
</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Settled is the rule that the determination of the persons to be 
prosecuted rests primarily with the Public Prosecutor who is vested with 
quasi-judicial discretion in the discharge of this function. Being vested with 
such power, he can reconsider his own resolution if he finds that there is 
reasonable ground to do so. x x x.</p>
<p align="left">More so, the Court cannot interfere with the Public Prosecutor’s 
discretion to determine probable cause or the propriety of pursuing or not a 
criminal case when the case is not yet filed in Court, as a general rule. 
However, if the same criminal case has been filed in Court already, the Public 
Prosecutor can still interfere with it subject to the approval of the Court. In 
the case of Republic vs. Sunga, et al., the Supreme Court held that while it has 
been settled in the case of Crespo vs. Mogul that the trial court is the sole 
judge on whether a criminal case should be dismissed after the complaint or 
information has been filed in court, nonetheless any motion of the offended 
party for the dismissal of the criminal case, even if without objection of the 
accused, should first be referred to the prosecuting fiscal and only after 
hearing should the court exercise its exclusive authority to dismiss or continue 
with the prosecution of the case. The Court, therefore, after hearing and 
conferring with the fiscal, can dismiss the case if convinced that there is [no] 
reason to continue with the prosecution [of] the same. As in this case, the 
Court finds merit [in] the motion of the Public Prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="left">Aggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration of the said Order, 
arguing that the November 20, 2003 OP-QC resolution has not yet attained 
finality, considering that the same was the subject of a Petition for Review 
filed before the Department of Justice (DOJ).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The RTC deferred action on the said 
motion to await the resolution of the DOJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p>
<p align="left">On June 26, 2006, the Secretary of Justice promulgated his 
resolution reversing and setting aside the OP-QC’s November 20, 2003 resolution, 
and directing the latter to refile the earlier Information for libel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>
<p align="left">On October 24, 2006, the RTC issued its first assailed Order 
granting petitioner’s motion for reconsideration, conformably with the 
resolution of the DOJ Secretary, thus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Considering the findings of the Department of Justice reversing 
the resolution of the City Prosecutor, the Court gives favorable action to the 
Motion for Reconsideration. In the same manner as discussed in arriving at its 
assailed order dated 17 March 2004, the Court gives more leeway to the Public 
Prosecutor in determining whether it has to continue or stop prosecuting a case. 
While the City Prosecutor has previously decided not to pursue further the case, 
the Secretary of Justice, however, through its resolution on the Petition for 
Review did not agree with him.</p>
<p align="left">The Court disagrees with the argument raised by the accused that 
double jeopardy sets in to the picture. The order of dismissal as well as the 
withdrawal of the Information was not yet final because of the timely filing of 
the Motion for Reconsideration. The Court[,] therefore, can still set aside its 
order. Moreover, there is no refiling of the case nor the filing of a new one. 
The case filed remains the same and the order of dismissal was merely vacated 
because the Court finds the Motion for Reconsideration meritorious. </p>
<p>WHEREFORE, finding the Motion for Reconsideration meritorious, the Order 
dated 17 March 2004 is hereby RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE.</p>
<p>Let the arraignment of accused Oscar Mapalo and pre-trial [of] the other 
accused be set on 06 December 2006 at 8:30 in the morning.</p>
<p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Respondents moved for reconsideration, but the motion was denied in the RTC’s 
second assailed Order dated February 26, 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
<p>Relentless, respondents elevated their predicament to the CA through a 
Petition for <em>Certiorari</em> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, arguing in 
the main that the RTC Orders violated their constitutional right against double 
jeopardy. </p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Ruling of the CA </em></strong></p>
<p align="left">The appellate court found the RTC to have gravely abused its 
discretion in ordering the reinstatement of the case. The CA annulled the 
impugned RTC Orders, ruling that all the elements of double jeopardy exist. 
There was a valid Information sufficient in form and substance filed before a 
court of competent jurisdiction to which respondents had pleaded, and that the 
termination of the case was not expressly consented to by respondents; hence, 
the same could not be revived or refiled without transgressing respondents’ 
right against double jeopardy. </p>
<p align="left">The CA further found that the DOJ Secretary improperly took 
cognizance of the Petition for Review because DOJ Department Order No. 223 
mandates that no appeal shall be entertained if the accused has already been 
arraigned or, if the arraignment took place during the pendency of the appeal, 
the same shall be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p>
<p align="left">Petitioner interposed the instant appeal when his motion for 
reconsideration of the CA Decision was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The Issues </em></strong></p>
<p>Petitioner ascribes the following errors to the CA: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in finding that there was Double 
Jeopardy, specifically on the alleged existence of the requisites to constitute 
Double Jeopardy; </p>
<p>b. The Honorable Court of Appeals failed to consider the fact that there was 
NO refiling of the case nor the filing of a new one in arriving [at] its 
conclusion that Double Jeopardy sets in to the picture; </p>
<p>c. The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in finding that there was 1.) <u>a 
valid termination</u> of the case on the basis of the Order of the Trial Court 
dated 17 March 2004, and allegedly 2.) without the express consent of the 
respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The assigned errors will be subsumed into this issue: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Whether there was a valid termination of the case so as to usher in the 
impregnable wall of double jeopardy.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Our Ruling</em></strong></p>
<p>The petition is impressed with merit. </p>
<p>Well-entrenched is the rule that once a case is filed with the court, any 
disposition of it rests on the sound discretion of the court. In thus resolving 
a motion to dismiss a case or to withdraw an Information, the trial court should 
not rely solely and merely on the findings of the public prosecutor or the 
Secretary of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is the 
court’s bounden duty to assess independently the merits of the motion, and this 
assessment must be embodied in a written order disposing of the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> While the recommendation of the 
prosecutor or the ruling of the Secretary of Justice is persuasive, it is not 
binding on courts.</p>
<p>In this case, it is obvious from the March 17, 2004 Order of the RTC, 
dismissing the criminal case, that the RTC judge failed to make his own 
determination of whether or not there was a <em>prima facie </em>case to hold 
respondents for trial. He failed to make an independent evaluation or assessment 
of the merits of the case. The RTC judge blindly relied on the manifestation and 
recommendation of the prosecutor when he should have been more circumspect and 
judicious in resolving the Motion to Dismiss and Withdraw Information especially 
so when the prosecution appeared to be uncertain, undecided, and irresolute on 
whether to indict respondents. </p>
<p>The same holds true with respect to the October 24, 2006 Order, which 
reinstated the case. The RTC judge failed to make a separate evaluation and 
merely awaited the resolution of the DOJ Secretary. This is evident from the 
general tenor of the Order and highlighted in the following portion thereof: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As discussed during the hearing of the Motion for Reconsideration, the Court 
will resolve it depending on the outcome of the Petition for Review. Considering 
the findings of the Department of Justice reversing the resolution of the City 
Prosecutor, the Court gives favorable action to the Motion for 
Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>By relying solely on the manifestation of the public prosecutor and the 
resolution of the DOJ Secretary, the trial court abdicated its judicial power 
and refused to perform a positive duty enjoined by law. &nbsp; The said Orders were 
thus stained with grave abuse of discretion and violated the complainant’s right 
to due process. They were void, had no legal standing, and produced no effect 
whatsoever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p>
<p>This Court must therefore remand the case to the RTC, so that the latter can 
rule on the merits of the case to determine if a <em>prima facie</em> case 
exists and consequently resolve the Motion to Dismiss and Withdraw Information 
anew. </p>
<p>It is beyond cavil that double jeopardy did not set in. Double jeopardy 
exists when the following requisites are present: (1) a first jeopardy attached 
prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy has been validly terminated; and (3) 
a second jeopardy is for the same offense as in the first. A first jeopardy 
attaches only (a) after a valid indictment; (b) before a competent court; (c) 
after arraignment; (d) when a valid plea has been entered; and (e) <strong>when 
the accused has been acquitted or convicted, or the case dismissed or otherwise 
terminated without his express consent</strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p>
<p>Since we have held that the March 17, 2004 Order granting the motion to 
dismiss was committed with grave abuse of discretion, then respondents were not 
acquitted nor was there a valid and legal dismissal or termination of the case. 
Ergo, the fifth requisite which requires the conviction and acquittal of the 
accused, or the dismissal of the case without the approval of the accused, was 
not met. Thus, double jeopardy has not set in. </p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong> , the petition is hereby <strong>GIVEN DUE 
COURSE</strong>, and the assailed July 11, 2008 Decision and the November 4, 
2008 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 99088, and the October 
24, 2006 and the February 26, 2007 Orders of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon 
City, Branch 92, are hereby <strong>ANNULLED</strong> and <strong>SET ASIDE. 
</strong>The case is <strong>REMANDED</strong> to the Quezon City RTC, Branch 
92, for evaluation on whether probable cause exists to hold respondents for 
trial.</p>
