				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE CHARGES OF PLAGIARISM, ETC., AGAINST ASSOCIATE JUSTICE MARIANO C. DEL CASTILLO.<BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioners Isabelita C. Vinuya, <i>et al.</i>, all members of the Malaya Lolas Organization, seek reconsideration of the decision of the Court dated October 12, 2010 that dismissed their charges of plagiarism, twisting of cited materials, and gross neglect against Justice Mariano Del Castillo in connection with the decision he wrote for the Court in G.R. No. 162230, entitled <i>Vinuya v. Romulo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Mainly, petitioners claim that the Court has by its decision legalized or approved of the commission of plagiarism in the Philippines.&nbsp; This claim is absurd.&nbsp; The Court, like everyone else, condemns plagiarism as the world in general understands and uses the term.<br><br>Plagiarism, a term not defined by statute, has a popular or common definition.&nbsp; To plagiarize, says Webster, is "to steal and pass off as one's own" the ideas or words of another.&nbsp; Stealing implies malicious taking.&nbsp; Black's Law Dictionary, the world's leading English law dictionary quoted by the Court in its decision, defines plagiarism as the "deliberate and knowing presentation of another person's original ideas or creative expressions as one's own."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The presentation of another person's ideas as one's own must be deliberate or premeditated--a taking with ill intent.<br><br>There is no commonly-used dictionary in the world that embraces in the meaning of plagiarism errors in attribution by mere accident or in good faith.<br><br>Certain educational institutions of course assume different norms in its application.&nbsp; For instance, the Loyola Schools Code of Academic Integrity ordains that "plagiarism is identified not through intent but through the act itself.&nbsp; The objective act of falsely attributing to one's self what is not one's work, whether intentional or out of neglect, is sufficient to conclude that plagiarism has occurred.&nbsp; Students who plead ignorance or appeal to lack of malice are not excused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>But the Court's decision in the present case does not set aside such norm. The decision makes this clear, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>To paraphrase Bast and Samuels, while the academic publishing model is based on the originality of the writer's thesis, the judicial system is based on the doctrine of stare decisis, which encourages courts to cite historical legal data, precedents, and related studies in their decisions.&nbsp; The judge is not expected to produce original scholarship in every respect. The strength of a decision lies in the soundness and general acceptance of the precedents and long held legal opinions it draws from.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Original scholarship is highly valued in the academe and rightly so.&nbsp; A college thesis, for instance, should contain dissertations embodying results of original research, substantiating a specific view.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; This must be so since the writing is intended to earn for the student an academic degree, honor, or distinction.&nbsp; He earns no credit nor deserves it who takes the research of others, copies their dissertations, and proclaims these as his own.&nbsp; There should be no question that a cheat deserves neither reward nor sympathy.<br><br>But the policy adopted by schools of disregarding the element of malicious intent found in dictionaries is evidently more in the nature of establishing what evidence is sufficient to prove the commission of such dishonest conduct than in rewriting the meaning of plagiarism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it would be easy enough for a student to plead ignorance or lack of malice even as he has copied the work of others, certain schools have adopted the policy of treating the mere presence of such copied work in his paper sufficient objective evidence of plagiarism.&nbsp; Surely, however, if on its face the student's work shows as a whole that he has but committed an obvious mistake or a clerical error in one of hundreds of citations in his thesis, the school will not be so unreasonable as to cancel his diploma.<br><br>In contrast, decisions of courts are not written to earn merit, accolade, or prize as an original piece of work or art.&nbsp; Deciding disputes is a service rendered by the government for the public good.&nbsp; Judges issue decisions to resolve everyday conflicts involving people of flesh and blood who ache for speedy justice or juridical beings which have rights and obligations in law that need to be protected. The interest of society in written decisions is not that they are originally crafted but that they are fair and correct in the context of the particular disputes involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Justice, not originality, form, and style, is the object of every decision of a court of law.<br><br>There is a basic reason for individual judges of whatever level of courts, including the Supreme Court, not to use original or unique language when reinstating the laws involved in the cases they decide.&nbsp; Their duty is to apply the laws as these are written.&nbsp; But laws include, under the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>, judicial interpretations of such laws as are applied to specific situations.&nbsp; Under this doctrine, Courts are "to stand by precedent and not to disturb settled point." Once the Court has "laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases, where facts are substantially the same; regardless of whether the parties or property are the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>And because judicial precedents are not always clearly delineated, they are quite often entangled in apparent inconsistencies or even in contradictions, prompting experts in the law to build up regarding such matters a large body of commentaries or annotations that, in themselves, often become part of legal writings upon which lawyers and judges draw materials for their theories or solutions in particular cases.&nbsp; And, because of the need to be precise and correct, judges and practitioners alike, by practice and tradition, usually lift passages from such precedents and writings, at times omitting, without malicious intent, attributions to the originators.<br><br>Is this dishonest?&nbsp; No. Duncan Webb, writing for the International Bar Association puts it succinctly.&nbsp; When practicing lawyers (which include judges) write about the law, they effectively place their ideas, their language, and their work in the public domain, to be affirmed, adopted, criticized, or rejected.&nbsp; Being in the public domain, other lawyers can thus freely use these without fear of committing some wrong or incurring some liability.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>The tendency to copy in law is readily explicable.&nbsp; In law accuracy of words is everything.&nbsp; Legal disputes often centre round the way in which obligations have been expressed in legal documents and how the facts of the real world fit the meaning of the words in which the obligation is contained.&nbsp; This, in conjunction with the risk-aversion of lawyers means that refuge will often be sought in articulations that have been tried and tested.&nbsp; In a sense therefore the community of lawyers have together contributed to this body of knowledge, language, and expression which is common property and may be utilized, developed and bettered by anyone.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>The implicit right of judges to use legal materials regarded as belonging to the public domain is not unique to the Philippines.&nbsp; As Joyce C. George, whom Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno cites in her dissenting opinion, observed in her Judicial Opinion Writing Handbook:<br><br><blockquote><b>A judge writing to resolve a dispute, whether trial or appellate, is exempted from a charge of plagiarism even if ideas, words or phrases from a law review article, novel thoughts published in a legal periodical or language from a party's brief are used without giving attribution.&nbsp; Thus judges are free to use whatever sources they deem appropriate to resolve the matter before them, without fear of reprisal.&nbsp; This exemption applies to judicial writings intended to decide cases for two reasons: the judge is not writing a literary work and, more importantly, the purpose of the writing is to resolve a dispute.&nbsp; As a result, judges adjudicating cases are not subject to a claim of legal plagiarism.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><b> </b></blockquote><br>If the Court were to inquire into the issue of plagiarism respecting its past decisions from the time of Chief Justice Cayetano S. Arellano to the present, it is likely to discover that it has not on occasion acknowledged the originators of passages and views found in its decisions.&nbsp; These omissions are true for many of the decisions that have been penned and are being penned daily by magistrates from the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals, the Regional Trial Courts nationwide and with them, the municipal trial courts and other first level courts. Never in the judiciary's more than 100 years of history has the lack of attribution been regarded and demeaned as plagiarism.<br><br>This is not to say that the magistrates of our courts are mere copycats. They are not.&nbsp; Their decisions analyze the often conflicting facts of each case and sort out the relevant from the irrelevant.&nbsp; They identify and formulate the issue or issues that need to be resolved and evaluate each of the laws, rulings, principles, or authorities that the parties to the case invoke.&nbsp; The decisions then draw their apt conclusions regarding whether or not such laws, rulings, principles, or authorities apply to the particular cases before the Court. These efforts, reduced in writing, are the product of the judges' creativity.&nbsp; It is here--actually the substance of their decisions--that their genius, originality, and honest labor can be found, of which they should be proud.<br><br>In <i>Vinuya</i>, Justice Del Castillo examined and summarized the facts as seen by the opposing sides in a way that no one has ever done.&nbsp; He identified and formulated the core of the issues that the parties raised.&nbsp; And when he had done this, he discussed the state of the law relevant to their resolution.&nbsp; It was here that he drew materials from various sources, including the three foreign authors cited in the charges against him.&nbsp; He compared the divergent views these present as they developed in history.&nbsp; He then explained why the Court must reject some views in light of the peculiar facts of the case and applied those that suit such facts. Finally, he drew from his discussions of the facts and the law the right solution to the dispute in the case. On the whole, his work was original. He had but done an honest work.<br><br>The Court will not, therefore, consistent with established practice in the Philippines and elsewhere, dare permit the filing of actions to annul the decisions promulgated by its judges or expose them to charges of plagiarism for honest work done.<br><br>This rule should apply to practicing lawyers as well.&nbsp; Counsels for the petitioners, like all lawyers handling cases before courts and administrative tribunals, cannot object to this.&nbsp; Although as a rule they receive compensation for every pleading or paper they file in court or for every opinion they render to clients, lawyers also need to strive for technical accuracy in their writings.&nbsp; They should not be exposed to charges of plagiarism in what they write so long as they do not depart, as officers of the court, from the objective of assisting the Court in the administration of justice.<br><br>As Duncan Webb said:<br><br><blockquote><b>In presenting legal argument most lawyers will have recourse to either previous decisions of the courts, frequently lifting whole sections of a judge's words to lend weight to a particular point either with or without attribution.&nbsp; The words of scholars are also sometimes given weight, depending on reputation.&nbsp; Some encyclopaedic works are given particular authority.&nbsp; In England this place is given to Halsbury's Laws of England which is widely considered authoritative.&nbsp; A lawyer can do little better than to frame an argument or claim to fit with the articulation of the law in Halsbury's.&nbsp; While in many cases the very purpose of the citation is to claim the authority of the author, this is not always the case.&nbsp; Frequently commentary or dicta of lesser standing will be adopted by legal authors, largely without attribution. </b><br><br><b>x x x x</b><br><br><b>The converse point is that originality in the law is viewed with skepticism.&nbsp; It is only the arrogant fool or the truly gifted who will depart entirely from the established template and reformulate an existing idea in the belief that in doing so they will improve it.&nbsp; While over time incremental changes occur, the wholesale abandonment of established expression is generally considered foolhardy.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Court probably should not have entertained at all the charges of plagiarism against Justice Del Castillo, coming from the losing party.&nbsp; But it is a case of first impression and petitioners, joined by some faculty members of the University of the Philippines school of law, have unfairly maligned him with the charges of plagiarism, twisting of cited materials, and gross neglect for failing to attribute lifted passages from three foreign authors.&nbsp; These charges as already stated are false, applying the meaning of plagiarism as the world in general knows it.<br><br>True, Justice Del Castillo failed to attribute to the foreign authors materials that he lifted from their works and used in writing the decision for the Court in the <i>Vinuya</i> case.&nbsp; But, as the Court said, the evidence as found by its Ethics Committee shows that the attribution to these authors appeared in the beginning drafts of the decision.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as testified to by a highly qualified and experienced court-employed researcher, she accidentally deleted the same at the time she was cleaning up the final draft.&nbsp; The Court believed her since, among other reasons, she had no motive for omitting the attribution.&nbsp; The foreign authors concerned, like the dozens of other sources she cited in her research, had high reputations in international law.<br><br>Notably, those foreign authors expressly attributed the controversial passages found in their works to earlier writings by others.&nbsp; The authors concerned were not themselves the originators. As it happened, although the <i>ponencia</i> of Justice Del Castillo accidentally deleted the attribution to them, there remained in the final draft of the decision attributions of the same passages to the earlier writings from which those authors borrowed their ideas in the first place.&nbsp; In short, with the remaining attributions after the erroneous clean-up, the passages as it finally appeared in the <i>Vinuya</i> decision still showed on their face that the lifted ideas did not belong to Justice Del Castillo but to others.&nbsp; He did not pass them off as his own.<br><br>With our ruling, the Court need not dwell long on petitioners' allegations that Justice Del Castillo had also committed plagiarism in writing for the Court his decision in another case, <i>Ang Ladlad v. Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners are nit-picking.&nbsp; Upon close examination and as Justice Del Castillo amply demonstrated in his comment to the motion for reconsideration, he in fact made attributions to passages in such decision that he borrowed from his sources although they at times suffered in formatting lapses.<br><br>Considering its above ruling, the Court sees no point in further passing upon the motion of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for leave to file and admit motion for reconsideration-in-intervention dated January 5, 2011 and Dr. Peter Payoyo's claim of other instances of alleged plagiarism in the Vinuya decision.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court <b>DENIES</b> petitioners' motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., Velasco, Jr., Nachura,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr.,  JJ</span>., concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, J.</span>, see dissenting opinion.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio Morales, J</span>., please see separate opinion.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, J</span>., I concur and also join the separate opinion of J.

 disciplining authority of all impeachable officers, including Justices 
of this Court, is Congress. Section 3(1), Article XI of the Constitution
 provides that, "The House of Representatives shall have the <b>exclusive power</b> to initiate all cases of impeachment." Likewise, Section 3(6) of the same Article provides that, "The Senate shall have the <b>sole power</b> to try and decide cases of impeachment." These provisions constitute Congress as the <b>exclusive authority to discipline all impeachable officers</b> for any impeachable offense, including "betrayal of public trust," a "catchall phrase"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to cover any misconduct involving breach of public trust by an impeachable officer.<br><br>While impeachment is often described as a political process, it also functions as the <b><i>equivalent</i></b>
 of administrative disciplinary proceedings against impeachable 
officers. Impeachable officers are not subject to administrative 
disciplinary proceedings either by the Executive or Judicial branch, in 
the same manner that non-impeachable officers are subject. Thus, <b>impeachment by Congress takes the place of administrative disciplinary proceedings against impeachable officers</b> <b><i>as there is no other authority that can administratively discipline impeachable officers</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Removal from office and disqualification to hold public office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which is the penalty for an impeachable offense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> is also the most severe penalty that can be imposed in administrative disciplinary proceedings.<br><br>Impeachment
 is not a criminal proceeding because conviction in an impeachment 
complaint is not a bar to criminal prosecution for the same act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 An impeachable offense, like betrayal of public trust, may not even 
constitute a criminal act. Like in an administrative proceeding, proof 
beyond reasonable doubt is not required for conviction in impeachment. 
If an impeachable officer is charged of a <b>crime</b>, as distinguished
 from an administrative charge, the proper court has jurisdiction to try
 such impeachable officer because the proceeding is criminal, not 
administrative. However, neither the conviction nor acquittal of such 
impeachable officer in the criminal case constitutes a bar to his 
subsequent impeachment by Congress. There is no double jeopardy because 
impeachment is not a criminal proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Only Congress, as the <b>exclusive disciplining authority</b> of all impeachable officers, can decide in a non-criminal, non-civil proceeding<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 whether a sitting Justice of this Court has committed plagiarism. 
Plagiarism is a betrayal of public trust because, as the majority puts 
it, to plagiarize is "`to steal and pass off as one's own' the ideas of 
another."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, <b><i>in writing judicial decisions</i></b> a judge is liable for plagiarism only if the copying violates the moral rights of the author under the Law on Copyright.<br><br>This
 Court may conduct an investigation of an administrative complaint 
against a sitting Justice to determine if there is basis in <b><i>recommending</i></b>
 to the House of Representatives the initiation of an impeachment 
complaint against the sitting Justice. This Court may also conduct an 
investigation of an administrative complaint against a sitting Justice 
to determine if the complaint constitutes contempt of this Court. <b>However,
 this Court has no power to decide on the guilt or innocence of a 
sitting Justice in the administrative complaint because such act is a 
usurpation of the exclusive disciplinary power of Congress over 
impeachable officers under the Constitution</b>. Any decision by this 
Court in an administrative case clearing a sitting Justice of an 
impeachable offense is void for want of jurisdiction and for violation 
of an express provision of the Constitution.<br><br>Such a decision will
 put this Court on a collision course with Congress if subsequently an 
impeachment complaint for plagiarism is filed with Congress against the 
sitting Justice. Incidentally, an impeachment complaint has already been
 filed in the House of Representatives involving the same complaint 
subject of this administrative case. If the House of Representatives 
decides to take cognizance of the complaint and initiates an impeachment
 based on the same administrative complaint that this Court had already 
dismissed as baseless, then this Court would have created a 
constitutional crisis that could only weaken the public's faith in the 
primacy of the Constitution.<br><br>The Supreme Court <b>cannot</b> 
assume jurisdiction over an administrative complaint against a sitting 
Justice of this Court by invoking Section 6, Article VIII of the 
Constitution. This provision states that the "Supreme Court shall have 
administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof." 
This provision refers to the administrative supervision that the 
Department of Justice used to exercise over the courts and their 
personnel, as shown by the folowing exchange during the deliberations of
 the Constitutional Commission:<br><br><blockquote>MR. GUINGONA: xxx.<br><br>The
 second question has reference to Section 9, about the administrative 
supervision over all courts to be retained in the Supreme Court. I was 
wondering if the Committee had taken into consideration the proposed 
resolution for the transfer of the administrative supervision from the 
Supreme Court to the Ministry of Justice. But as far as I know, none of 
the proponents had been invited to explain or defend the proposed 
resolution.<br><br>Also, I wonder if the Committee also took into 
consideration the fact that the UP Law Constitution Project in its 
Volume I, entitled: Annotated Provision had, in fact, made this an 
alternative proposal, the transfer of administrative supervision from 
the Supreme Court to the Ministry of Justice.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>MR. CONCEPCION: May I refer the question to Commissioner Regalado?<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sarmiento): Commissioner Regalado is recognized.<br><br>MR. REGALADO: Thank you, Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>We
 did invite Minister Neptali Gonzales, who was the proponent for the 
transfer of supervision of the lower courts to the Ministry of Justice. I
 even personally called up and sent a letter or a short note inviting 
him, but the good Minister unfortunately was enmeshed in a lot of 
official commitments. We wanted to hear him because the Solicitor 
General of his office, Sedfrey Ordoñez, appeared before us, and asked 
for the maintenance of the present arrangement wherein the supervision 
over lower courts is with the Supreme Court. But aside from that, 
although there were no resource persons, we did further studies on the 
feasibility of transferring the supervision over the lower courts to the
 Ministry of Justice. All those things were taken into consideration 
motu proprio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>For sure, the <b>disciplinary authority</b> of the Supreme Court <b>over judges </b>is expressly governed by another provision, that is, Section 11, Article VIII of the Constitution. Section 11 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 11. xxx The Supreme Court <i>en banc</i> shall have the <b>power to discipline judges of lower courts</b>,
 or order their dismissal by a vote of a majority of the Members who 
actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and 
voted thereon. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Clearly, the 
disciplinary authority of the Supreme Court over judges is found in 
Section 11 of Article VIII. However, this disciplinary authority is 
expressly limited to lower court judges, and does not include Supreme 
Court Justices, precisely because the Constitution expressly vests 
exclusively on Congress the power to discipline Supreme Court Justices. 
By excluding Supreme Court Justices, Section 11 <b>withholds</b> from the Supreme Court <i>en</i> <i>banc</i> the power to discipline its own members.<br><br>The <i>Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980</i> of the United States, which gives judicial councils <b>composed of federal judges</b> the power to discipline federal judges short of removal from office, does <b>not</b>
 apply to Justices of the United States Supreme Court who are subject to
 discipline only by the United States Congress. Moreover, a similar law 
cannot be enacted in the Philippines because all lower court judges are 
subject to discipline by the Supreme Court <i>en banc</i> under Section 11, Article VIII of the Constitution. Thus, reference to the <i>Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980</i> is inappropriate in this jurisdiction.<br><br>I
 submit that this Court recall the Resolution of 12 October 2010 subject
 of the present motion for reconsideration for lack of jurisdiction to 
decide the administrative complaint against Justice Mariano C. Del 
Castillo.<br><br>II. <b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>The Judge Must Follow the Law on Copyright </i></b><br><br><b><i>a. Copying from Works of the Government</i></b><br><br>In writing judicial decisions, a judge should make the proper attribution in copying passages from any <b>judicial decision, statute, regulation, or other Works of the Government</b>. The <b><i>Manual of Judicial Writing </i></b>adopted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> by this Court provides how such attribution should be made.<br><br>However, the failure to make such attribution does not violate the Law on Copyright.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The law expressly provides that Works of the Government are not subject to copyright.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 This means that there is neither a legal right by anyone to demand 
attribution, nor any legal obligation from anyone to make an 
attribution, when Works of the Government are copied. The failure to 
make the proper attribution of a Work of the Government is not 
actionable but is merely a case of sloppy writing. Clearly, there is no <b>legal</b> obligation, by a judge or by any person, to make an attribution when copying Works of the Government.<br><br>However,
 misquoting or twisting, with or without attribution, any judicial 
decision, statute, regulation or other Works of the Government in 
judicial writing, <b>if done to mislead the parties or the public</b>, is actionable. Under Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, a judge "<b>should perform official duties honestly</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Rule 3.01<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and Rule 3.02<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 of the Code provide that a judge must be faithful to the law, maintain 
professional competence, and strive diligently to ascertain the facts 
and the applicable law.<br><br>The foregoing applies to any non-copyrightable work, and any work in the public domain, whether local or foreign.<br><br><b><i>b. Copying from Pleadings of Parties</i></b><i> </i><br><br>In
 writing judicial decisions, the judge may copy passages from the 
pleadings of the parties with proper attribution to the author of the 
pleading. However, the failure to make the proper attribution is not 
actionable.<br><br>Pleadings are submitted to the court precisely so that the <b><i>pleas</i></b>, or the arguments written on the pleadings, are accepted by the judge. <b>There is an implied offer by the pleader that the judge may make any use of the pleadings in resolving the case</b>.
 If the judge accepts the pleader's arguments, he may copy such 
arguments to expedite the resolution of the case. In writing his 
decision, the judge does not claim as his own the arguments he adopts 
from the pleadings of the parties. Besides, the legal arguments in the 
pleadings are in most cases merely reiterations of judicial precedents, 
which are Works of the Government.<br><br>However, misquoting or twisting, with or without attribution, any passage from the pleadings of the parties, <b>if done to mislead the parties or the public</b>,
 is actionable. Under Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, a judge 
"should perform official duties honestly." Rule 3.01 and Rule 3.02 of 
the Code provide that a judge must be faithful to the law, maintain 
professional competence, and strive diligently to ascertain the facts 
and the applicable law.<br><br><b><i>c. Copying from Textbooks, Journals and other Non-Government Works</i></b><br><br>In
 writing judicial decisions, the judge may copy passages from textbooks,
 journals and other non-government works with proper attribution. 
However, whether the failure to make the proper attribution is 
actionable or not depends on the nature of the passages copied.<br><br>If
 the work copied without proper attribution is copyrighted, the failure 
to make such attribution violates Section 193 of the Intellectual 
Property Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 193. <b><i>Scope of Moral Rights</i></b>.
 The author of a work shall, independently of the economic rights in 
Section 177 or the grant of an assignment or license with respect to 
such right, have the right:<br><br>193.1. <b>To require that</b> <b>the authorship of the works be attributed to him</b>, in particular, the right that his name, as far as practicable, be indicated in a prominent way on the copies, and <b>in connection with the public use of his work</b>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>193.3 <b>To object to any distortion</b>, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation <b>to his work which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation;</b><br><br>x x x x. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Section
 184(k) of the Intellectual Property Code expressly allows, as a 
limitation on the copyright or economic rights of the author, "<b>any use</b> <b>made of a work for the purpose of any judicial proceedings</b> x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Section 184(k) clearly authorizes a judge to copy copyrighted works for "<b>any use</b>"
 in judicial proceedings, which means the judge, in writing his 
decision, can copy passages beyond the quantitative limitations of "<b>fair-use</b>"
 under Section 184(b). This is the significance of Section 184(k), 
allowing the judge to copy lengthy passages of copyrighted work even 
beyond what is required by fair-use. Section 184(k) is silent on the 
obligation of the judge to make the proper attribution, unlike Section 
184(b) on fair-use by the public which expressly requires a proper 
attribution.<br><br>However, Section 193 nevertheless requires anyone, 
including a judge writing a judicial decision, to make the proper 
attribution to show respect for the moral rights of the author. Thus, 
while the author has no right to demand economic compensation from the 
judge or the government for the unlimited and public use of his work in a
 judicial decision, the law requires that "<b>the authorship of the works be attributed to him x x x in connection with the public use of his work</b>."
 In short, the judge is legally obligated to make the proper attribution
 because Section 193 protects the moral rights of the author.<br><br>The
 moral rights under Section 193 of the Intellectual Property Code arise 
only if the work of an author is copyrighted. If the work is not 
copyrighted, then there are no moral rights to the work. If the passages
 in a textbook, journal article, or other non-work of the government are
 merely quotations from Works of the Government, like sentences or 
paragraphs taken from judicial decisions, then such passages if copied 
by a judge do not require attribution because such passages, <b>by themselves</b>, are Works of the Government. The same is true for works in the public domain.<br><br>However, the arrangement or presentation of passages copied from Works of the Government may be subject to copyright,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 and a judge copying such arrangement or presentation, together with the
 passages, may have to make the proper attribution. If the passages are 
those of the author himself, and not copied from Works of the Government
 or from works in the public domain, then clearly there is a legal 
obligation on the part of the judge to make the proper attribution. 
Failure by the judge to make such attribution violates not only Section 
193 of the Intellectual Property Code, but also Canon 3 of the Code of 
Judicial Conduct.<br><br>The moral rights of an author are independent 
of the author's economic rights to his work in the sense that even if 
the author assigns his work, the moral rights to the work remain with 
him, being inalienable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Any violation of an author's moral rights entitles him to the same remedies as a violation of the economic rights to the work,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 whether such economic rights are still with him or have been assigned 
to another party. Thus, while called "moral rights," these rights are 
legally enforceable.<br><br>Two essential elements of an author's moral 
rights are the right to attribution and the right to integrity. The 
right to attribution or paternity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 is the right of the author to be recognized as the originator or father
 of his work, a right expressly recognized in Section 193.1 of the 
Intellectual Property Code. The right to integrity is the right of the 
author to prevent any distortion or misrepresentation of his work, a 
right expressly recognized in Section 193.3 of the Code. The Legislature
 incorporated the moral rights of an author in the Intellectual Property
 Code in compliance with the treaty obligations of the Philippines under
 the Berne Convention, which requires treaty states to enact legislation
 protecting the moral rights of authors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The rationale behind moral rights is explained in a local intellectual property textbook, citing American jurisprudence:<br><br><blockquote>The term moral rights has its origins in the civil law and is a translation of the French <i>le droit moral</i>,
 which is meant to capture those rights of a spiritual, non-economic and
 personal nature. The rights spring from a belief that an artist in the 
process of creation injects his spirit into the work and that the 
artist's personality, as well as the integrity of the work, should 
therefore be protected and preserved. Because they are personal to the 
artist, moral rights exist independently of an artist's copyright in his
 or her work. <b>While the rubric of moral rights encompasses many 
varieties of rights, two are protected in nearly every jurisdiction 
recognizing their existence:</b> <b>attribution and integrity. The right
 of attribution generally consists of the right of an artist to be 
recognized by name as the author of his work or to publish anonymously 
or pseudonymously, the right to prevent the author's work from being 
attributed to someone else, and to prevent the use of the author's name 
on works created by others, including distorted editions of the author's
 original work. The right of integrity allows the author to prevent any 
deforming or mutilating changes to his work, even after title of the 
work has been transferred. </b>In some jurisdictions, the integrity 
right also protects artwork from destruction. Whether or not a work of 
art is protected from destruction represents a fundamentally different 
perception of the purpose of moral rights. If integrity is meant to 
stress the public interest in preserving a nation's culture, destruction
 is prohibited; if the right is meant to emphasize the author's 
personality, destruction is seen as less harmful than the continued 
display of deformed or mutilated work that misrepresents the artist and 
destruction may proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>When
 a judge respects the right to attribution and integrity of an author, 
then the judge observes intellectual honesty in writing his decisions. 
Writing decisions is the most important official duty of a judge, more 
so of appellate court judges. Conversely, if a judge fails to respect an
 author's right to attribution and integrity, then the judge fails to 
observe intellectual honesty in the performance of his official duties, a
 violation of Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>The duty 
of a judge to respect the moral rights of an author is certainly not 
burdensome on the performance of his official duties. All the reference 
materials that a judge needs in writing judicial decisions are either 
Works of the Government or works in the public domain. <b>A judge must base his decision on the facts and the law,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><b> and the facts and the law are all in the public domain</b>. <b>There is no need for a judge to refer to copyrighted works</b>.
 When a judge ventures to refer to copyrighted works by copying passages
 from such works, he immediately knows he is treading on protected 
works, and should readily respect the rights of the authors of those 
works. The judge, whose most important function is to write judicial 
decisions, must be the first to respect the rights of writers whose 
lives and passions are dedicated to writing for the education of 
humankind.<br><br>Besides, Section 184(k) of the Intellectual Property 
Code already generously allows the judge unlimited copying of 
copyrighted works in writing his judicial decisions. The Code, however, 
does not exempt the judge from recognizing the moral rights of the 
author. The basic rule of human relations, as embodied in Article 19 of 
the Civil Code, requires that the judge should give to the author of the
 copyrighted work what is due him. Thus, Article 19 states: "Every 
person must, in the exercise of his rights and <b>in the performance of his duties</b>, act with justice, <b>give everyone his due</b>, <b>and</b> <b>observe honesty and good faith</b>."<br><br>d. <b><i>Difference from the Academe </i></b><br><br>Academic
 writing, such as writing dissertations or articles in academic 
journals, is governed by standards different from judicial decision 
writing. The failure to make the proper attribution for passages copied 
from Works of the Government is not actionable against a judge when 
writing a judicial decision. However, the same failure by a student or a
 faculty member may be deemed plagiarism in the academe, meriting a 
severe <b>administrative</b> penalty. Nevertheless, the Judiciary and the academe should have the same rule when it comes to copyrighted works. <b>In
 every case, there is a legal duty to make the proper attribution when 
copying passages from copyrighted works because the law expressly 
requires such attribution</b> <b>without exception</b>.<br><br>The 
academe requires that passages copied from Works of the Government, 
works in the public domain, and non-copyrighted works should be properly
 attributed in the same way as copyrighted works. The rationale is to 
separate the original work of the writer from the works of other authors
 in order to determine the original contribution of the writer to the 
development of a particular art or science. This rationale does not 
apply to the Judiciary, where adherence to jurisprudential precedence is
 the rule. However, if a judge writes an article for a law journal, he 
is bound by the same rules governing academic writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>RECALL</b>

following exchange took place during the deliberations of the 
Constitutional Commission:<br><br><blockquote>MR. REGALADO: Thank you, Madam President.<br><br>xxx<br><br>First, this is with respect to Section 2, on the grounds for impeachment, and I quote:<br><br>.
 . . culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, other 
high crimes, graft and corruption or betrayal of public trust.<br><br>Just
 for the record, what would the Committee envision as a betrayal of the 
public trust which is not otherwise covered by the other terms 
antecedent thereto?<br><br>MR. ROMULO: I think, if I may speak for the 
Committee and subject to further comments of Commissioner de los Reyes, 
the concept is that this is a catchall phrase. Really, it refers to his 
oath of office, in the end that the idea of a public trust is connected 
with the oath of office of the officer, and if he violates that oath of 
office, then he has betrayed that trust.<br><br>MR. REGALADO: Thank you.<br><br>MR. MONSOD: Madam President, may I ask Commissioner de los Reyes to perhaps add to those remarks.<br><br>THE PRESIDENT: Commissioner de los Reyes is recognized.<br><br>MR.
 DE LOS REYES: The reason I proposed this amendment is that during the 
Regular Batasang Pambansa when there was a move to impeach then 
President Marcos, there were arguments to the effect that there is no 
ground for impeachment because there is no proof that President Marcos 
committed criminal acts which are punishable, or considered penal 
offenses<b>. And so the term "betrayal of public trust," as explained by
 Commissioner Romulo, is a catchall phrase to include all acts which are
 not punishable by statutes as penal offenses but, nonetheless, render 
the officer unfit to continue in office. It includes betrayal of public 
interest, inexcusable negligence of duty, tyrannical abuse of power, 
breach of official duty by malfeasance or misfeasance cronyism, 
favoritism, etc. to the prejudice of public interest and which tend to 
bring the office into disrepute</b>. That is the purpose, Madam President. Thank you.<br><br>MR.
 ROMULO: If I may add another example, because Commissioner Regalado 
asked a very good question. This concept would include, I think, 
obstruction of justice since in his oath he swears to do justice to 
every man; so if he does anything that obstructs justice, it could be 
construed as a betrayal of the public trust. Thank you. (Emphasis

 the Commission concludes that Congress may not provide for removal as a
 criminal penalty. If removal may lawfully follow on conviction for a 
federal judge, then it may do so for the Vice President of the United 
States or perhaps even the President. But if the constitutional grant of
 a term of office to the Vice President and President prevails against 
any provision for removal in the criminal law, the same should be true 
of the tenure the Constitution grants to judges. The Constitution quite 
explicitly separates impeachment and removal from the ordinary criminal 
process. The Commission does not believe that Congress's power to punish
 crimes is an exception to judicial life tenure, or alternatively a way 
in which good behavior may be inquired into, in the way that the 
impeachment process clearly is.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Commission

 Professor Laurence H. Tribe writes: "The independence of the process of
 impeachment and criminal prosecution is highlighted by the case of 
Judge Alcee Hastings, who was acquitted of bribery by a federal jury in 
1983, but was subsequently impeached by the House and convicted by the 
Senate for the same offense - and for testifying falsely about it under 
oath at his federal criminal trial. Similarly, Judge Walter Nixon was 
impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate in 1989 for falsely 
testifying under oath before a federal grand jury investigating Judge 
Nixon's improper discussions with a state prosecutor in a case involving
 a business acquaintance's son, despite an earlier acquittal in a 
federal prosecution for bribery arising out of those very events. And, 
although this precise sequence is not addressed by Article I, Section 3,
 clause 7, it should also be possible for an official to be acquitted by
 the Senate in an impeachment trial but subsequently convicted of the 
same underlying acts in a federal court. The Senate's acquittal, after 
all, could well represent a determination merely that the charged 
offenses were not impeachable, or that the nation would be harmed more 
than protected by pronouncing the official guilty." <i>American Constitutional Law</i>, Volume 1 (3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[rd]</sup> edition), pp. 159-160.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>

 rule that an impeachable officer cannot be criminally prosecuted for

resignation, or permanent disability, there can be no bar to his 
criminal prosecution in the courts.<br><br><u>Nor does retirement bar an administrative investigation from proceeding</u>

also monitor and report to the Court the progress of the investigation 
of similar complaints <u>against Supreme Court</u> officials and employees, and handle the annual update of the Court's ethical rules and standards for submission to the <i>en banc</i>.&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The
 Court acknowledged its power to take cognizance of complaints against 
its incumbent Members.&nbsp; It is circumscribed, however, by the 
abovementioned principle of constitutional law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in terms of <u>grounds and penalties</u>.<br><br>In at least two recent instances, the Court had conducted administrative proceedings against its incumbent Members.<br><br>In the controversy surrounding the 1999 Bar Examinations, the Court, by Resolution of March 22, 2000 in Bar Matter No. 979, <b>censured</b> then incumbent <u>Justice Fidel Purisima</u> for his failure to disclose on time his relationship to an examinee and for breach of duty and confidence, and declared <b>forfeited</b>
 50% of the fees due him as chairperson of the 1999 Bar Examinations 
Committee.&nbsp; The impositions did not, however, douse the clamor for 
stiffer penalties on Justice Purisima in case he were found liable after
 a full, thorough and formal investigation by an independent and 
impartial committee, which some quarters urged the Court to form.<br><br>Meanwhile,
 Justice Purisima retired from the Court on October 28, 2000.&nbsp; By 
Resolution of November 28, 2000, the Court ruled that "<u>[h]is 
retirement makes it untenable for this Court to further impose 
administrative sanctions on him as he is no longer a member of the Court</u>" and referred the bar matter to the Special Study Group on Bar Examination Reforms for report and recommendation.<br><br>The
 implication that the Court could have imposed further administrative 
sanctions on Justice Purisima had he not retired is a recognition that 
the Court may discipline one of its sitting members.<br><br>Further, the
 Court did not explain why the "further" imposition of administrative 
sanctions was untenable except for the fact that Justice Purisima was no
 longer a member of the Court.&nbsp; Could it be that the earlier imposed 
penalties (<i>i.e.</i>, censure and partial forfeiture of fees) were 
already considered sufficient? Could it be that the proper 
administrative case (arising from the earlier bar matter) was not 
instituted before Justice Purisima retired?&nbsp; Or could it be that Justice
 Purisima's retirement benefits were already released to him, leaving 
the Court with nothing more to go after to or impose (except, perhaps, 
disqualification to hold any government office)?<br><br>I thus submit that <b>the failure to initiate an administrative proceeding <i>prior</i> to Justice Purisima's retirement made it untenable for the Court to further impose administrative sanctions on him</b>.&nbsp; What was confirmed by the <i>Purisima </i>case,
 nonetheless, for purposes of pertinent discussion, is that the Court 
has jurisdiction to take cognizance of a complaint against an incumbent 
Justice.<br><br>Then there was the case <i>In re: Undated Letter of Mr. Louis Biraogo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> where Justice Ruben Reyes was, <i>inter alia</i>, "held liable for <b>GRAVE MISCONDUCT </b>for leaking a confidential internal document of the Court" for which he was "<b>FINED P500,000.00</b>,<b> </b>
 to be charged against his retirement benefits, and disqualified to hold
 any office or employment in any branch or instrumentality of the 
government including government-owned or controlled corporations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; The question in <i>Biraogo</i>
 was not so much on the Court's jurisdiction over the case but on the 
effect of Justice Reyes' subsequent retirement during the pendency of 
the case.<br><br>Unlike the present case, however, impeachment 
proceedings against Justices Purisima and Reyes did not see the light of
 day as they eventually retired, which mandatory retirement either 
foreclosed the initiation of further administrative proceedings or 
directed the imposable sanctions to the retirement benefits.<br><br>In 
view of the impeachment complaint filed with the House of 
Representatives involving the same subject matter of the case, which 
denotes that a co-equal branch of government found the same act or 
omission grievous as to present a ground for impeachment and opted to 
exercise its constitutional function, <u>I submit that the Court cannot proceed with the administrative complaint against Justice Del Castillo</u>
 for it will either (i) take cognizance of an impeachable offense which 
it has no jurisdiction to determine, or (ii) downplay the questioned 
conduct and preempt the impeachment proceedings.<br><br>I thus join the call of Justice Carpio to recall the Court's October 15, 2010 Resolution, but <u>only insofar</u>
 as Justice Del Castillo is concerned.&nbsp; All related administrative 
concerns and issues involving non-impeachable officers therein should 
still be considered effectual.<br><br>In <i>Biraogo</i>, the unauthorized release of the unpromulgated <i>ponencia</i> of Justice Reyes in the consolidated <i>Limkaichong</i>
 cases spawned an investigation to determine who were responsible for 
the leakage of the confidential internal document of the Court.&nbsp; The 
investigation led to the <u>disciplining of not just Justice Reyes but also two members of his staff, who were <i>named</i> without hesitation by the Court,</u> <i>viz.</i>, Atty. Rosendo B. Evangelista and Armando Del Rosario, and who were held liable for <b>SIMPLE NEGLECT OF DUTY</b> and ordered to pay <b>FINE</b> in the amount of <b>P10,000.00 </b>and <b>P5,000.00</b>, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Why,
 in the present case, the legal researcher who is hiding behind her 
credentials appears to be held a sacred cow, I cannot fathom.&nbsp; Hers is a
 new (or better) specie of initialed personification (e.g., "xxx") under
 the likes of <i>Cabalquinto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which should apply only to cases involving violence against women and children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The
 unjustified non-disclosure of her identity is unfair to Atty. 
Evangelista who, aside from having his own credentials to protect, had 
to be mentioned as a matter of course in the committee report adopted by
 the Court in <i>In re: Undated Letter of Mr. Louis Biraogo</i>, after similarly cooperating with and explaining his side before the investigating committee.<br><br>Atty.
 Evangelista was eventually found by the Court to be wanting in care and
 diligence in securing the integrity and confidentiality of a document.&nbsp;
 In the present case, the Court's October 15, 2010 <i>per curiam</i> Decision cleared the name of the unnamed legal researcher.<br><br>While what was at stake in<i> Biraogo</i> was the "<u>physical integrity</u>" of a <i>ponencia</i>, what is at stake in the present case is the "<u>intellectual integrity</u>" of a <i>ponencia</i>.&nbsp;
 The Court is committing a disservice to its judicial function if it 
values the physical form of a decision more than what a decision 
substantially contains.<br><br>Moreover, the liability of Justice Reyes 
did not save the day for Atty. Evangelista who, as the judicial staff 
head, was tasked to secure and protect the copies of the <i>Limkaichong </i>Decision.&nbsp;
 Similarly in the present case, independently of Justice Del Castillo's 
"shortcomings," the legal researcher, who was the lone drafter, 
proofreader and citechecker, was tasked like any other Court Attorney to
 secure and ensure the substance and legal reasoning of the <i>Vinuya</i>
 Decision.&nbsp; Like Justice Reyes, Justice Del Castillo can only do so much
 in claiming responsibility and full control of his office processes and
 shielding the staff under the mantle of his impeachable wings.<br><br>Notably, Rule 10.2 of Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states that lawyers shall "not knowingly <u>misquote or misrepresent the contents of a paper</u>, the language or the argument of opposing counsel, or the <u>text of a decision or authority</u>,
 or knowingly cite as law a provision already rendered inoperative by 
repeal or amendment, or assert as a fact that which has not been 
proved."&nbsp; <i>While the provision presupposes knowledge or willful 
intent, it does not mean that negligent acts or omissions of the same 
nature by lawyers serving the government go scot-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><br>Simple
 neglect of duty is defined as the failure to give proper attention to a
 task expected of an employee resulting from either carelessness or 
indifference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>I submit that the legal researcher was remiss in her duties of re-studying the sources or authorities invoked in the <i>Vinuya</i>
 Decision and checking the therein citations or, at the very least, 
those whose authors' rights to attribution and integrity are protected 
under Intellectual Property Law.&nbsp; While it is incumbent upon her to 
devise ways and means of legal research, her admitted method or process 
as shown in the <i>Vinuya</i> case reflects a disregard of a duty 
resulting from carelessness or indifference.&nbsp; She failed to exercise the
 required degree of care to a task expected of a lawyer-employee of the 
Supreme Court.<br><br>While the Court recognizes that there were indeed lapses in the editorial work in the drafting of the <i>Vinuya </i>Decision,
 it easily attributed them to "accidental deletions."&nbsp; It conveniently 
assigned such human errors to the realm of accidents, without explaining
 whether it could not have been foreseen or avoided. <br><br><i>I, 
therefore, posit that the legal researcher, who must hitherto be named, 
is liable for Simple Neglect of Duty and must be ordered to pay a Fine 
in the amount of, following Biraogo, P10,000.00, with warning of more 
severe sanctions for future similar conduct. </i><br><br>Whether liability attaches to what the October 15, 2010 <i>per curiam</i>
 Decision finds to be deletion or omission of citation "unquestionably 
due to inadvertence or pure oversight," the fact remains, nonetheless, 
that there is a need for a textual correction of the <i>Vinuya</i> 
Decision.&nbsp; This Court should cause the issuance of a corrected version 
in the form of, what Justice Ma. Lourdes P. A. Sereno suggests as, a 
"corrigendum."<br><br>The matter of making corrections in judicial 
issuances is neither novel nor something beneath the Court.&nbsp; As early as
 February 22, 2000, the Court already accepted the reality of human 
error.&nbsp; In <b>A.M. No. 00-2-05-SC</b>, <i>"In the Matter of Correction of Typographical Errors in Decisions and Signed Resolutions,"</i> the Court provided a simple procedure in making proper corrections:<br><br><blockquote>Inadvertent
 typographical errors in decisions and signed resolutions of the Court 
may occur every now and then.&nbsp; As these decisions and signed resolutions
 are published and preserved for posterity in the Philippine Reports, 
the Supreme Court Reports Annotated, and other publications as well as 
in the Supreme Court website, the need for making them free of 
typographical errors cannot be overemphasized.&nbsp; Care should, therefore, 
be taken in proofreading them before they are submitted for promulgation
 and/or publication.<br><br>Nevertheless, should typographical errors be
 discovered after the promulgation and/or publication of decisions and 
resolutions, the following procedure should be observed to the end that 
unauthorized corrections, alterations, or intercalations in what are 
public and official documents are not made.<br><br>1. In case of 
decisions and signed resolutions with the author['s] names indicated, 
the Reporter and the Chief of the Management Information Systems Office 
of the Supreme Court should secure the authority of the author concerned
 to make the necessary correction of typographical errors.&nbsp; In case of <i>per curiam</i> decisions and unsigned resolutions, authority to make corrections should be secured from the Chief Justice.<br><br>2.
 The correction of typographical errors shall be made by crossing out 
the incorrect word and inserting by hand the appropriate correction 
immediately above the cancelled word.&nbsp; Such correction shall be 
authenticated by the author by signing his initials immediately below 
the correction.&nbsp; In <i>per curiam</i> decisions and unsigned 
resolutions, and in cases where the author is no longer a member of the 
Court, the authentication shall be made by the Chief Justice.<br><br>3. 
The Reporter and the Chief of the Management Information Systems Office 
shall submit to the Court, through the Clerk of Court, a quarterly 
report of decisions and resolutions in which corrections have been 
made.&nbsp; The Clerk of Court must thereafter include the report in the 
agenda of the Court <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>This resolution takes effect immediately.<br></blockquote><br>Despite the avowals of "slip in attribution," "bad footnoting," and "editorial error" in the Court's October 15, 2010 <i>per curiam</i> Decision, to date no effort has been made to correct the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision in conformity with A.M. No. 00-2-05-SC, which only implies that the lapses are <i>not</i> typographical in nature. The corrections of the <i>Vinuya </i>Decision
 cannot simply be made by crossing out the incorrect word and inserting 
by hand the appropriate correction immediately above the cancelled word,
 with authentication by the <i>ponente </i>or writer.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Constitution, Art.

 This framework of constitutional law likewise explains why incumbent 
Justices of the Supreme Court, by virtue of their being impeachable 
officers, are <b>not included</b> from the operation of A.M. No. 
02-9-02-SC on the "Automatic Conversion of Some Administrative Cases 
Against Justices of the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan, Judges 
of Regular and Special Courts, and Court Officials Who Are Lawyers as 
Disciplinary Proceedings Against Them Both as Officials and as Members 
of the Philippine Bar" (September 17, 2002).&nbsp; The rule provides that 
when the said administrative case is based on grounds which are likewise
 grounds for a disciplinary action of members of the Bar, the 
administrative case shall also be considered a disciplinary action 
against the respondent justice, judge or court official concerned as a 
member of the Bar [as applied in <i>Avancena v. Liwanag</i>, A.M. No. 
MTJ-01-1383, March 5, 2003, 398 SCRA 541 and July 17, 2003, 406 SCRA 300

 Its application to a particular administrative action is not dependent

 Committee finds that Atty. Evangelista, Justice Reyes' Judicial Staff 
Head, was remiss in his duties, which includes the supervision of the 
operations of the office, particularly with respect to the promulgation 
of decisions. While it is incumbent upon him to devise ways and means to
 secure the integrity of confidential documents, his actuations 
reflected above evinced "a disregard of a duty resulting from 
carelessness or indifference."<br><br>Atty. Evangelista was admittedly 
unmindful of the responsible safekeeping of draft ponencias in an 
unlocked drawer of a member of the staff. He failed to make sure that 
the unused portion of confidential documents like the second signatory 
page of the ponencia in Gilbert form had been properly disposed of or 
shredded. He was not on top of things that concerned the promulgation of
 ponencias, for he failed to ascertain the status and procedural 
implication of an "on hold" order after having been apprised thereof by 
his subordinate, Del Rosario, on July 17, 2008. Despite his awareness 
that the Limkaichong case would eventually be called again, he admitted 
that he was not privy to the preparation of the copy of the ponencia for
 the subsequent session on July 29, 2008.<br><br>With these findings, the Court finds him <b>liable for SIMPLE NEGLECT OF DUTY</b>.<br><br><b><i>Liability of Armando Del Rosario </i></b><br><br>The
 committee likewise finds Del Rosario administratively liable for 
failing to exercise the required degree of care in the custody of the 
Gilbert copy. Del Rosario admittedly kept the Gilbert copy in an 
unlocked drawer from July 16, 2008 to December 10, 2008 when he should 
have known that, by the nature of the document in his custody, he should
 have kept it more securely. His carelessness renders him 
administratively <b>liable for SIMPLE NEGLECT OF DUTY</b>, defined as 
the failure to give proper attention to a task expected of an employee 
resulting from either carelessness or indifference.<br><br>Time and 
again, the Court has emphasized the heavy burden and responsibility 
which court officials and employees are mandated to carry. They are 
constantly reminded that any impression of impropriety, misdeed or 
negligence in the performance of official functions must be avoided. The
 Court will never countenance any conduct, act or omission on the part 
of all those involved in the administration of justice which would 
violate the norm of public accountability and diminish the people's 
faith in the judiciary.<br><br>Under Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus
 Civil Service Rules and Regulations, (simple) neglect of duty is 
punishable by suspension of one month and one day to six months for the 
first offense. Under Sec. 19, Rule XIV of the same Rules, the penalty of
 fine (instead of suspension) may also be imposed in the alternative. 
Following the Court's ruling in several cases involving (simple) neglect
 of duty, we find the penalty of fine on Atty. Evangelista and Del 
Rosario in the amount of P10,000 and P5,000, respectively, just and 
reasonable. (<i>Id.</i> at 161-163; emphasis, italics and underscoring in the original).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>People v. Cabalquinto</i>, G.R. No. 167693, September 19, 2006, 502 SCRA 419.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Vide</i>

 present administrative disciplinary case against Supreme Court 
Associate Justice Mariano C. del Castillo stemmed from the decision he 
penned for the Court in G.R. No. 162230, entitled <i>Isabelita C. </i><i>Vinuya, et al. v. Executive Secretary</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Vinuya</i> Decision was promulgated on April 28, 2010 with 13 justices of this Court concurring with the ruling to dismiss the case.<br><br>On July 19, 2010, Attys. Harry Roque and Rommel Bagares, counsels for petitioners Vinuya, <i>et al.</i>,
 filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration raising, among others, 
the plagiarism allegedly committed by Justice del Castillo for using the
 works of three foreign legal authors in his <i>ponencia</i>.&nbsp; They 
alleged that the use was without proper attribution and that Justice del
 Castillo twisted the foreign authors' works to support the Decision.&nbsp; 
They considered it "highly improper for x x x the Court x x x to wholly 
lift, without proper attribution, from at least three sources - an 
article published in 2009 in the Yale Law Journal of International Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> a book published by the Cambridge University Press in 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and an article published in the Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 - and to make it appear that these sources support the assailed 
Judgment's arguments for dismissing [their] petition[,] when in truth, 
the plagiarized sources even make a strong case for the Petition's 
claims[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In reply 
to the accusation, Justice del Castillo wrote and circulated a letter 
dated July 22, 2010 to the members of this Court.&nbsp; <b>On July 27, 2010, the Court decided to refer the letter to the Ethics and Ethical Standards Committee </b>(the "<i>Ethics Committee" </i>or<i> "committee</i>") <b>which docketed it as an administrative matter. </b>The
 committee required Attys. Roque and Bagares to comment on Justice del 
Castillo's letter, after which it heard the parties.&nbsp; After the parties'
 memoranda, the committee submitted its findings and recommendations to 
the Court.<br><br><b><i>The Court's Decision on the Plagiarism<br> Charge against Justice del Castillo</i></b><br><br><b>In a Decision dated October 12, 2010, the Court resolved to dismiss the plagiarism charges against Justice del Castillo.</b>&nbsp; It recognized that indeed certain passages of the foreign legal article were lifted and used in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision and that "no attributions were made to the x x x authors in [its] footnotes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 However, the Court concluded that the failure to attribute did not 
amount to plagiarism because&nbsp; no malicious intent attended the failure; 
the attributions (present in Justice del Castillo's original drafts) 
were simply accidentally deleted in the course of the drafting process. 
Malicious intent was deemed an essential element, as "plagiarism is 
essentially a form of fraud where intent to deceive is inherent." Citing
 <i>Black's Law Dictionary's</i> definition of plagiarism - the 
deliberate and knowing presentation of another person's original ideas 
or creative expressions as one's own - the Court declared that 
"plagiarism presupposes intent and a deliberate, conscious effort to 
steal another's work and pass it off as one's own."&nbsp; In fact, the Court 
found that by citing the foreign author's original sources, Justice del 
Castillo never created the impression that he was the original author of
 the passages claimed to have been lifted from the foreign law articles:<br><br><blockquote>The
 Court also adopts the Committee's finding that the omission of 
attributions to Criddle-Descent and Ellis did not bring about an 
impression that Justice Del Castillo himself created the passages that 
he lifted from their published articles. That he merely got those 
passages from others remains self-evident, despite the accidental 
deletion. The fact is that he still imputed the passages to the sources 
from which Criddle-Descent and Ellis borrowed them in the first place.</blockquote><br>As
 to the charge that Justice del Castillo twisted the meaning of the 
works of the foreign authors, the Court ruled that it was impossible for
 him to have done so because:<br><br><blockquote>first, since the 
attributions to Criddle-Descent and Ellis were accidentally deleted, it 
is impossible for any person reading the decision to connect the same to
 the works of those authors as to conclude that in writing the decision 
Justice Del Castillo "twisted" their intended messages. And, second, the
 lifted passages provided mere background facts that established the 
state of international law at various stages of its development. These 
are neutral data that could support conflicting theories regarding 
whether or not the judiciary has the power today to order the Executive 
Department to sue another country or whether the duty to prosecute 
violators of international crimes has attained the status of jus cogens.<br></blockquote><br>The
 Court, thus, declared that "only errors [of judges] tainted with fraud,
 corruption, or malice are subject of disciplinary action" and these&nbsp; 
were not present in Justice del Castillo's case; the failure was not 
attended by any malicious intent not to attribute the lifted passages to
 the foreign authors.<br><br>Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno 
dissented from the Court's October 12, 2010 Decision based mainly on her
 disagreement with the majority's declaration that malicious intent is 
required for a charge of plagiarism to prosper.<br><br>On November 15, 
2010, Attys. Roque and Bagares filed a motion for reconsideration of the
 Court's October 12, 2010 Decision.&nbsp; This motion was the subject of the 
Report/Resolution submitted to the Court for consideration. 
Incidentally, <b>the same counsels filed an impeachment complaint for 
betrayal of public trust against Justice del Castillo with the House of 
Representatives on December 14, 2010</b>.<br><br><b><i>The Court's Action on the </i></b><br><b><i>Motion for Reconsideration</i></b><br><br><b>The
 Court referred the motion for reconsideration to the Ethics Committee 
and its Report recommended the dismissal of the motion for 
reconsideration.</b>&nbsp; The Report differentiated academic writing from 
judicial writing, declaring that originality of ideas is not required of
 a judge writing decisions and resolving conflicts because he is bound 
by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> - the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedents.<br><br>The
 Report likewise declared that the foreign authors, whose works were 
claimed to have been plagiarized, were not themselves the originators of
 the ideas cited in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the <i>Vinuya</i>
 Decision did not mention their names, it did attribute the passages to 
the original authors from whom these foreign authors borrowed the 
ideas.&nbsp; There was, thus, no intent on the part of Justice del Castillo 
to appropriate the ideas or to claim that these ideas originated from 
him; in short, he did not pass them off as his own.<br><br>Justice Antonio T. Carpio dissented from the Report, based on two grounds:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>the
 Court has no jurisdiction over the administrative case as it involves a
 sitting Supreme Court Justice, for alleged misconduct committed in 
office; and<br><br></li><li>the judge, when writing judicial decisions, 
must comply with the law on copyright and respect the moral right of the
 author to have the work copied attributed to him.</li></ol><br><center><b><i>My Position</i></b><br></center><br>I
 fully support the conclusions of the Ethics Committee.&nbsp; I likewise take
 exception to Justice Carpio's Dissenting Opinion, specifically on his 
position that the Court has no jurisdiction to discipline its Members as
 the only means to discipline them is through impeachment proceedings 
that the Congress has the sole prerogative to undertake. Impeachment, he
 declares, functions as the equivalent of administrative disciplinary 
proceedings.&nbsp; Since the Congress is given the exclusive power to 
initiate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> try, and decide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 all cases of impeachment, Justice Carpio posits that the Congress 
serves as the exclusive disciplining authority over all impeachable 
officers.&nbsp; He warns that for the Supreme Court to hear the present 
administrative disciplinary case would be to usurp this exclusive power 
of Congress.<br><br><b><i>Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court<br> to Discipline its Members</i></b><br><br>A
 given in the discipline of Members of the Supreme Court is that they 
can only be "removed from office" through impeachment, as provided under
 Article XI of the Constitution, on the specified grounds of <i>culpable
 violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, 
other high crimes, or betrayal of the public trust</i>. The purpose of 
impeachment and the constitutional interest sought is to protect the 
people and the State from official delinquencies and other malfeasances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp;
 The Constitution, however, is not a single-purpose document that 
focuses on one interest alone to the exclusion of related interests; 
impeachment was never intended by the Constitution to be the totality of
 the administrative actions or remedies that the public or the Court may
 take against an erring Justice of the Court. Other related 
constitutional interests exist touching on other facets of the Judiciary
 and public accountability.&nbsp; They are, by themselves, equally compelling
 and demanding of recognition.<br><br>Among the compelling interests 
that the Constitution zealously guards is judicial independence because 
it is basic to the meaning and purposes of the Judiciary.&nbsp; This interest
 permeates the provisions of Article VIII of the&nbsp; Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Another
 interest to consider is the need for judicial integrity - a term not 
expressly mentioned in the Article on the Judiciary (Article VIII), but 
is a basic concept found in Article XI (on Accountability of Public 
Officers) of the Constitution.&nbsp; It is important as this constitutional 
interest underlies the independent and responsible Judiciary that 
Article VIII establishes and protects.&nbsp; To be exact, it complements 
judicial independence as integrity and independence affect and support 
one another; only a Judiciary with integrity can be a truly independent 
Judiciary. Judicial integrity, too, directly relates to public trust and
 accountability that the Constitution seeks in the strongest terms.&nbsp; The
 same Article XI contains the impeachment provisions that provide for 
the removal of Justices of the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Notably, a common thread 
that runs through all the grounds for impeachment is the lack of 
integrity of the official impeached on these grounds.<br><br>Still 
another unavoidable consideration on impeachment and its limited grounds
 is that it cannot, by itself, suffice to protect the people and foster 
the public accountability that the Constitution speaks of.&nbsp; While it is a
 powerful weapon in the arsenal of public accountability and integrity, 
it is not a complete weapon that can address and fully achieve its 
protective purposes.&nbsp; As discussed more fully below, not all complaints 
and grievances can be subsumed under the defined constitutional grounds 
for impeachment.&nbsp; Members of the Court can commit other offenses not 
covered by the impeachable offenses, for which other offenses they 
should equally be held accountable. These other offenses must of course 
be administratively addressed elsewhere if they cannot be similarly 
addressed through impeachment; the people will not accept an 
interpretation that these are offenses that fell through the 
constitutional cracks and can no longer be administratively addressed.<br><br>These
 considerations, taken together, dictate against the position of Justice
 Carpio that the Congress alone, through impeachment and to the 
exclusion of this Court, can proceed against the Members of the Court.<br><br><b><i>Protection of Judicial Integrity</i></b><br><br>For
 the purpose of preserving judicial integrity, the Supreme Court has as 
much (and in fact, should have more) interest as the public or as any 
other branch of the government in overseeing the conduct of members of 
the Judiciary, including its own Members. This is precisely the reason 
for the Judiciary's Code of Judicial Conduct and the lawyers' Code of 
Professional Responsibility.&nbsp; Judicial integrity is not only a necessary
 element in the orderly and efficient administration of justice; it is 
almost literally the lifeblood&nbsp; of the Judiciary.&nbsp; A Judiciary, 
dissociated from integrity and the public trust that integrity brings, 
loses its rightful place in the constitutional democratic scheme that 
puts a premium on a reliable and respected third branch of government 
that would balance the powers of the other two branches.<br><br>To 
ensure the maintenance and enhancement of judicial integrity, the 
Constitution has given the Judiciary, mainly through the Supreme Court, a
 variety of powers.&nbsp; These powers necessarily begin with the power to 
admit and to discipline members of the bar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 who are officers of the courts and who have the broadest frontline 
interaction with the courts and with the public. Courts in general have 
the power to cite for contempt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 that proceeds, not only from the need to maintain orderly procedures, 
but also from the need to protect judicial integrity in the course of 
the courts' exercise of judicial power.&nbsp; The Supreme Court has the power
 to discipline and remove judges of lower courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 In this role, the Court hears administrative disciplinary cases against
 lower court judges for purposes of redress against erring judges and, 
more importantly, <b>to "[preserve] the integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system</b> and x x x [to safeguard] the bench and the public from those who are unfit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>As concrete legal basis, the Supreme Court is expressly granted the general power of administrative supervision over <i>all courts and the personnel thereof.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 By its plain terms, the power extends not only to the authority to 
supervise and discipline lower court judges but to exercise the same 
powers over the Members of the Court itself.&nbsp; This is the unavoidable 
meaning of this grant of authority if its main rationale - <i>i.e.</i>, 
to preserve judicial integrity - is to be given full effect.&nbsp; The 
Supreme Court must ensure that the integrity of the whole Judiciary, <i>its own Members included,</i>
 is maintained as any taint on any part of the Judiciary necessarily 
taints the whole.&nbsp; To state the obvious, a taint in or misconduct by any
 Member of the Supreme Court - <i>even if only whispered about</i> <i>for lack of concrete evidence and patriotic whistleblowers</i> - carries greater adverse impact than a similar event elsewhere in the Judiciary.<br><br>Independent
 of the grant of supervisory authority and at a more basic level, the 
Supreme Court cannot be expected to play its role in the constitutional 
democratic scheme solely on the basis of the Constitution's express 
grant of powers.&nbsp; Implied in these grants are the inherent powers that 
every entity endowed with life (even artificial life) and burdened with 
responsibilities can and must exercise if it is to survive.&nbsp; The Court 
cannot but have the <i>right to defend itself</i> to ensure that its integrity and that of the Judiciary it oversees are kept intact.&nbsp; <i>This
 is particularly true when its integrity is attacked or placed at risk 
by its very own Members - a situation that is not unknown in the history
 of the Court.</i>&nbsp; To be sure, judicial integrity cannot be achieved if
 the Court can police the ranks of the lower court judges but not its 
own ranks.&nbsp; From this perspective view, it is unthinkable that the 
Supreme Court can only watch helplessly - for the reason that the power 
to act is granted only to Congress under the terms of the Constitution -
 as its own Members prostitute its integrity as an institution.<br><br><b><i>Impeachment Grounds are<br> Limited</i></b><br><br>That
 an impeachment partakes of the nature of an administrative disciplinary
 proceeding confined to the defined and limited grounds of "culpable 
violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, 
other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 cannot be disputed.&nbsp; However, it cannot likewise be disputed that these
 grounds, as defined, refer only to those serious "offenses that strike 
at the very heart of the life of the nation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp;
 Thus, for "betrayal of public trust" to be a ground for impeachment, 
the "manner of commission must be of the same severity as `treason' and 
`bribery.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> With respect to members of the High Court, impeachment is considered "as a response to <b>serious</b> misuse of judicial power"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> no less equivalent to treason or bribery.<br><br>Directly
 implied from these established impeachment principles is that "removal 
from office (the imposable penalty upon impeachment and conviction) is 
not the price exacted for every incident of judicial misconduct."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp;
 Otherwise stated, that impeachment administratively addresses only 
serious offenses committed by impeachable officers cannot imply that the
 Constitution condones misdemeanors and misconduct that are not of equal
 gravity.<br><br>For, side by side with the constitutional provision on 
impeachment is the constitutional policy that "public office is a public
 trust" and that "public&nbsp; officers and employees must, at all times, be 
accountable to the people."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp;
 Even impeachable officials, despite the nature and level of their 
positions, must be administratively accountable for misconduct and 
misdemeanors that are of lesser gravity than the defined impeachable 
offenses. Only this approach and reconciled reading with the provision 
on impeachment can give full effect to the constitutional policy of 
accountability.&nbsp; If this were not the case, then the public would be 
left with no effective administrative recourse against Supreme Court 
Justices committing less than grave misconduct.&nbsp; One American writer, 
Brent D. Ward, writes on this point that:<br><br><blockquote><b>It would
 be a serious weakness in our system to place systematic judicial 
misconduct beyond the reach of any remedy save impeachment.&nbsp; There are 
limits beyond which no person - even a federal judge - should be allowed
 to go with impunity.</b>&nbsp; The courts themselves have the power and the 
duty to curtail the effect of repeated contrary and erratic actions of a
 judge that occur too frequently to permit effective appellate 
supervision in the run of cases.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>[The]
 Constitution does x x x shield [judges] from corrective action by other
 judges designed to ensure that the law is effectively administered. The
 appellate courts have the power to prevent action so obviously improper
 as to place it beyond established rules of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Adverse Effects of Expansive <br>View of Impeachment Grounds</i></b><br><br>If
 impeachment were to be the only administrative proceeding to hold 
Justices of this Court accountable, then the grounds for impeachment may
 arguably carry a definition beyond the traditionally grave or serious 
character these offenses have always carried.&nbsp; An expanded definition, 
however, is no different from the remedy of burning a house to kill a 
rat. While such definition in the long run may kill more rats or 
assuredly do away with a particularly obnoxious rat, it will at the same
 time threaten and adversely affect a more valuable constitutional 
interest - the independence of the Judiciary that allows magistrates to 
conscientiously undertake their duties, guided only by the dictates of 
the Constitution and the rule of law.<br><br>It needs no elaborate 
demonstration to show that the threat of impeachment for every perceived
 misconduct or misdemeanor would open Justices of the Court to harassment.&nbsp; A naughty effect - if administrative redress can only be 
secured from Congress to the exclusion of this Court under an expanded 
definition of impeachment grounds - is to encourage every litigant with a
 perceived grievance against a Justice of this Court to run to his 
congressman for the filing of an impeachment complaint.<br><br>Undoubtedly,
 this kind of scenario will be a continuing threat to judges and 
justices, with consequential adverse effects on the Judiciary, on 
inter-branch relationship, and on the respect the public may give the 
Judiciary, the Legislature, and even of the government itself.&nbsp; Worse, 
this kind of scenario may ultimately trivialize the impeachment process 
and is thus best avoided.<br><br>An expansive interpretation of the 
grounds for impeachment must also affect Congress which acts on 
impeachment complaints but whose main task under our structure of 
government is to legislate, not to police the Supreme Court and other 
impeachable officers.&nbsp; To say the least, a deluge of impeachment 
complaints may prove to be impractical for Congress because impeachment 
is both an arduous and a time consuming process that will surely divert
 congressional time and other resources from the principal function of 
lawmaking.<br><br><b><i>The US Practice</i></b><br><br>In the United States (<i>US</i>)
 federal courts, "the impeachment process has not been the only check on
 federal judges [who are removable through impeachment] who may have 
abused their independence, or the only assurance of their 
accountability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The US 
National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal has posited that 
there must be "a power in the judiciary to deal with certain kinds of 
misconduct [as this will further] both the smooth functioning of the 
judicial branch and the broad goal judicial independence."<br><br>Along this line, the US Congress created a system enforcing an internal judicial self-discipline through the <b>judicial councils</b>&nbsp; under their <i>Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 </i>(the <i>US 1980 Act</i>).&nbsp;
 The judicial council (composed of the federal judges within a specific 
judicial circuit) is considered as a "formal and credible supplement to 
the impeachment process for resolving complaint of misconduct or 
disability against federal judges."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp;
 The judicial council of a federal circuit, through the chief judge, is 
authorized to receive and to act on complaints about the conduct of&nbsp; 
judges who are removable only through impeachment.&nbsp; If there is merit to
 a complaint, the judicial council can "take appropriate action, which 
may include censure, reprimand, temporary suspension, and transfer of 
cases, <i>but not removal from office. </i> If the judicial council 
believes that it has uncovered grounds for impeachment, the council is 
empowered to report its findings to the Judicial Conference of the 
United States, which after an investigation, may report its findings to 
the House of Representatives."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Arguably,
 the existence of a judicial council as an additional or supplemental 
check on US federal judges is statutory and no equivalent statute has 
been enacted in our jurisdiction specifically establishing in our 
Supreme Court a system of internal judicial self-discipline.&nbsp; This 
argument, however, loses sight of the constitutional authority of our 
Supreme Court to govern the conduct of its members under its power of 
general administrative supervision over <i>all courts</i> - a power that
 the Philippine Constitution expressly grants to our Supreme Court to 
the exclusion of remedies outside of the Judiciary except only for 
impeachment. Interestingly, even in the US, the view has been taken that
 the enactment of a statute conferring disciplinary power to the Court 
over its own members may be unnecessary as the Supreme Court itself may 
assume this power. This is implied from the following recommendation of 
the US National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal which 
states:<br><br><blockquote>[I]t may be in the [US Supreme] Court's best 
interest, as contributing to the public's perception of accountability, 
to devise and adopt some type of formal procedure for the receipt and 
disposition of conduct and disability complaints.<br><br>The Commission 
recommends that the Supreme Court may wish to consider the adoption of 
policies and procedures for the filing and disposition fo complaints 
alleging misconduct against Justices of the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Note
 should be taken in these regards that the Philippine Supreme Court has 
already put in place various Codes governing ethical rules for the bar 
and for the Judiciary. The Code of Judicial Conduct applies to all 
members of the Judiciary, including the Members of the Supreme Court.&nbsp; 
The Code of Professional Responsibility applies to all lawyers, thus, 
necessarily to Members of the Court for whom membership in the bar is an
 essential qualification.&nbsp; The Court as well has codified the Internal 
Rules of the Supreme Court. A Rule on Whistleblowing is presently under 
consideration by the Court <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>What is crucial in the establishment of the judicial council system in the US is the implication that <b>no
 inherent incompatibility exists between the existence of Congress' 
power to impeach and the Supreme Court's power to discipline its own 
members</b>; the two powers can co-exist and, in fact, even supplement 
each other.&nbsp; The constitutionality of recognizing disciplinary power in 
the courts over their own impeachable members (as provided in the US 
1980 Act), <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Congress' power to remove the same 
officials by impeachment, has been addressed before the US Court of 
Appeals in the case of <i>McBryde v. Commission to Review Circuit Council Conduct and Disability Orders of the Judicial Conference of the US</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>Judge
 McBryde frames his separation of powers claim as whether the 
Constitution "allocates the power to discipline federal judges and, if 
so, to which branches of government." Finding that it allocates the 
power to Congress in the form of impeachment, he concludes that it 
excludes all other forms of discipline. But Judge McBryde's attempt to 
fudge the distinction between impeachment and discipline doesn't work. <b>The Constitution limits judgments for impeachment to removal from office and disqualification to hold office.</b> <b>It makes no mention of discipline generally.</b> The Supreme Court recently observed that it accepted the proposition that <b>"[w]hen
 a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes a
 negative of any other mode." But application of the maxim depends on 
the "thing to be done." Here the thing to be done by impeachment is 
removal and disqualification, not "discipline" of any sort.</b></blockquote><br>Thus,
 when the conduct of a member of the Supreme Court is improper but is 
not of such gravity to be considered as an impeachable offense, the 
Court - to protect its integrity - may address the misconduct through an
 administrative disciplinary case against the erring member.<br><br><b><i>Conclusion: Court can hear the case<br> against Justice del Castillo as an <br>Administrative Matter</i></b><br><br>What the impeachment provisions of the Constitution guarantee is simply the <b>right
 to be removed from office only through the process of impeachment and 
not by any other means; it does not preclude the imposition of 
disciplinary sanctions short of removal on the impeachable official.&nbsp; 
Impeachment is the sole means of removal, but it is certainly not the 
sole means of disciplining Members of the Supreme Court or, for that 
matter, public officials removable by impeachment.&nbsp; </b><br><br>Accordingly,
 I believe that the Court has the authority to hear the present 
administrative disciplinary case against Associate Justice Mariano del 
Castillo; in case of a finding of misconduct, it can impose penalties 
that are not the functional equivalent of removal or dismissal from 
service.&nbsp; If, in the exercise of its prerogative as interpreter of the 
Constitution, it determines that an act complained of falls within the 
defined grounds for impeachment, then the Court should say so and 
forthwith forward its recommendations to Congress as the body 
constitutionally mandated to act in impeachment cases.<br><br><b><i>Court's Interpretation of Plagiarism -&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>limited to its Concept as an Ethical <br>violation of Members of the Judiciary.</i></b><br><br>The
 dissatisfaction with the Court's October 12, 2010 Decision (resolving 
the plagiarism charge against Justice del Castillo or the <i>"plagiarism Decision"</i>) primarily lies with the Court's declaration that <b>malicious intent is a necessary element in committing plagiarism.&nbsp; </b>In the plagiarism Decision, the Court said:<br><br><blockquote>[P]lagiarism presupposes intent and a deliberate, conscious effort to steal another's work and pass it off as one's own.<br></blockquote><br>Why
 we deemed malicious intent as a necessary element for judicial 
plagiarism can be explained by our repeated pronouncement that:<br><br><blockquote>not
 every error or mistake committed by judges in the performance of their 
official duties renders them administratively liable. <b>In the absence 
of fraud, dishonesty or deliberate intent to do an injustice, acts done 
in their official capacity, even though erroneous, do not always 
constitute misconduct.</b><br><br>Only errors that are tainted with 
fraud, corruption or malice may be the subject of disciplinary action. 
For administrative liability to attach, respondent must be shown to have
 been moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred or some other motive. 
Indeed, judges may not be held administratively liable for any of their 
official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long as they acted in good 
faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>The term plagiarism does not have a precise statutory definition as it is not a matter covered by present Philippine statutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> What the Intellectual Property Code (Republic Act 8283)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 defines and punishes is "copyright infringement." However, these terms 
are not legally interchangeable. Laurie Stearns, copyright lawyer and 
author of the article "Copy Wrong: Plagiarism, Process, Property, and 
the Law" aptly observes the distinctions between the two in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>Plagiarism
 is not necessarily copyright infringement, nor is copyright 
infringement necessarily plagiarism. The two concepts diverge with 
respect to three main aspects of the offense: <b>copying, attribution and intent</b>.
 In some ways the concept of plagiarism broader than infringement, in 
that it can include the copying of ideas or of expression not protected 
by copyright, that would not constitute infringement and it can include 
copying of small amounts of material that would be disregarded under 
copyright law. In other ways the concept of infringement is broader, in 
that it can include both properly attributed copying and unintentional 
copying that would be excused from being called plagiarism.<br><br>The 
divergence between plagiarism's popular definition and copyright's 
statutory framework suggests an essential contradiction between what is 
at stake in plagiarism - the creative process - and what is at stake in 
copyright infringement - the creative result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Separately
 from these distinctions, the matter before the Court is Justice del 
Castillo's alleged plagiarism or failure to make attributions as an 
ethical violation, not a copyright violation under the Intellectual 
Property Code. Given these distinctions, I see no reason to quibble over
 the definition of plagiarism - a term that, in the absence of any 
statutory limitation, the Court can define and interpret for purposes of
 its administrative authority over all courts and the personnel thereof.<br><br>From
 the point of view of ethical rules, what are important are the intent 
in undertaking an act and the concepts of integrity, propriety, honesty 
and impartiality for purposes of dispensing justice by an independent 
Judiciary.&nbsp; It is in this sense, and in light of the nature of the 
present case as an administrative disciplinary charge against a Member 
of this Court, that the pronouncement of this Court on plagiarism and on
 the merits of the ethical charge should be understood.<br><br>In this light, I find it misplaced for Justice Sereno to describe the Court's Decision as:<br><br><blockquote>[creating]
 unimaginable problems for Philippine academia, which will from now on 
have to find a disciplinary response to plagiarism committed by students
 and researchers on the justification of the majority Decision.<br><br>It
 has also undermined the protection of copyrighted work by making 
available to plagiarists "lack of malicious intent" as a defense to a 
charge of violation of copy or economic rights of the copyright owner 
committed through lack of attribution.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Because the
 majority Decision has excused the lack of attribution to the 
complaining authors in the Vinuya decision to editorial errors and lack 
of malicious intent to appropriate â”€ and that therefore there was no 
plagiarism â”€ lack of intent to infringe copyright in the case of lack of
 attribution may now also become a defense, rendering the above legal 
provision meaningless. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </blockquote><br>When
 the Supreme Court acts on complaints against judges under its 
supervision and control, it acts as an administrator imposing discipline
 and not as a court passing upon justiciable controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; It is precisely for this reason that disciplinary cases are docketed as "Administrative Matters" or "A.M."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp;
 Hence, any interpretation by the Court of "plagiarism" is limited to 
this context and cannot be held to bind the academe in undertaking its 
educational functions, particularly its own&nbsp; power to define plagiarism 
in the educational context.&nbsp; It likewise cannot bind Congress in its 
role as the sole authority to determine what constitutes an impeachable 
offense, subject to what I stated above on the established scope of 
impeachable offenses and the power of the Court to act in grave abuse of
 discretion situations under the Constitution. Specifically, a finding 
by this Court that plagiarism was or was not committed cannot preclude 
Congress from determining whether the failure or omission to make an 
attribution, intentionally or unintentionally, amounts to a "betrayal of
 public trust."<br><br>For these reasons, I support the conclusion of 
the Ethics and Ethical Standards Committee that Justice Mariano C. del 
Castillo's attribution lapses did not involve any ethical violation. I 
vote for the approval of the Committee's Report and for the denial of 
the petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><b></b><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>A Fiduciary Theory of Jus Cogens</i> by Evan J.

A dispute settlement mechanism aims to secure a positive solution to a dispute. Thus, a solution mutually acceptable to the parties to a dispute is preferred. However, in the absence of a mutually agreed solution, the first objective is usually to secure the withdrawal of measures concerned. A measure is any internal act, whether a law, an administrative action, or a judicial decision of a member. </b><br><br><b>The DSB is the WTO organ that is mandated to administer the rules and procedures that govern the settlement of disputes. It is made up of the representatives of all the members of the WTO. Each member is entitled to one vote. </b><br><br><b>The DSB has the following powers and functions: (a) to establish panels, (b) to adopt or reject panel and Appellate Body reports, (c) to maintain surveillance of the implementation of rulings and recommendations, and (d) to authorize the suspension of concessions and other obligations. <u>It is understood that requests for conciliation and the use of the dispute settlement procedures should not be</u> viewed <u>as contentious acts. Members engage in</u> this <u>procedure to resolve disputes</u>.</b>&nbsp; [copied]<b>&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>If a measure adopted by a country (A) within its territory impinges on, for example, the exports of another country (B), the first step in dispute settlement is the filing of a request for consultation by the complainant. In this case, B is the complainant.&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>If B requests consultation with A, then A must consider the complaint of B. A must reply to the request within 10 days after its receipt and enter into consultations with B in good faith </b><b>within a period of 30 days from the date of the request, with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution. If A does not respond within 10 days, does not enter into consultations within a period of 30 days from the filing of the request, and if the consultation fails to settle a dispute within 60 days after the request for consultation, then B may proceed to request the establishment of a panel. </b><br><br><b>Good offices, conciliation, and mediation may be requested at any time by any party to a dispute. They may begin and be terminated at any time. Once they are terminated, the complaining party can then request the establishment of a panel.&nbsp; </b><br><br><b>If the complaining party so requests, a panel may be established by the DSB. <u>The function of the panel is to assist the DSB in discharging its responsibilities. Accordingly, a panel should make an objective assessment of the matter before it, including the facts of the case and the applicability and conformity of the measure with the relevant agreements.

Posner wrote:<br><br><blockquote>xxx Hence, settlement negotiations will fail, and litigation ensue, only if the minimum price that the plaintiff is willing to accept in compromise of his claim is greater than the maximum price the defendant is willing to pay in satisfaction of that claim.&nbsp; (At p. 435)</blockquote><br>Justice Sereno copied the above verbatim in her article entitled <i>Lawyers' Behavior and Judicial Decision-Making</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><i> </i>published in the Philippine Law Journal, without quotation marks or attribution to Judge Posner.&nbsp; Thus, she wrote:<br><br><blockquote>xxx <b>[S]ettlement negotiations will fail and litigation will ensue if the minimum price that plaintiff is willing to accept in compromise of his claim is greater than the maximum price that the defendant is willing to pay in satisfaction of that claim.&nbsp; </b>(At page 483)</blockquote><br>In other sections of the same article that Justice Sereno wrote, she either copied verbatim from Judge Posner or mimicked his ideas without attributing these to him. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Judge Posner wrote --<br><br>A somewhat more plausible case can be made that judges might slant their decisions in favour of powerful interest groups in order to increase the prospects of promotion to higher office, judicial or otherwise.&nbsp; xxx (At p. 416)<br><br>Justice Sereno mimicked --<br><br><b>The third is that the judge maximizes the prospects of his promotion to a higher office by slanting his decisions in favor of powerful interest groups</b>.

They need to answer to only two standards - diligence and honesty. By honesty here is meant that good faith attempt to attribute to the author his original words and analysis.<br><br>Even if a judge has to rely in large part on the drafts of his legal researchers, the work of a diligent and honest judge will never display the severe plagiarism evident in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision published under the name of Justice Mariano C. del Castillo. A judge will only find himself in the same predicament as Justice del Castillo if two situations coincide: (1) the judge wittingly or unwittingly entrusts a legal researcher with the task of drafting his judicial opinion, and the legal researcher decides to commit severe plagiarism; and (2) the judge: (a) does not read and study the draft decision himself; (b) even if he does read and study the same, the "red flags" that are self-evident in the draft decision completely escape him; or (c) despite having seen the red flags, he ignores them.<br><br>We use the words "severe plagiarism" here deliberately because not only were three (3) works of the four (4) complaining authors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> plagiarized in <i>Vinuya</i>, text from the following copyrighted works was copied without attribution as well: essays contributed by Robert McCorquodale and Phoebe Okowa to the book <i>International Law</i>, edited by Malcolm Evans; an article written by Mariana Salazar Albornoz, entitled <i>Legal Nature and Legal Consequences of Diplomatic Protection: Contemporary Challenges</i>; an article written by Elizabeth Prochaska, entitled <i>Testing the Limits of Diplomatic Protection: Khadr v. The Prime Minister of Canada</i>; a report by Larry Niksch, entitled <i>Japanese Military's Comfort Women</i>; and<i> </i>an article by James Ladino, entitled<i> Ianfu: No Comfort Yet for Korean Comfort Women and the Impact of House Resolution 121</i>. In addition, incorporated into <i>Vinuya</i> were excerpts from a decision of an international tribunal without any signal given to the reader that the words were not those of Justice del Castillo of the Philippine Supreme Court but the words of another tribunal. While there are views that a judge cannot be guilty of plagiarism for failure to recognize foreign decisions as source materials in one's judicial writing - as when Justice Antonio C. Carpio opines that a judge cannot be guilty on this score alone - it is beyond debate that there is a duty of care to attribute to these foreign and international judicial decisions properly, and that one should never present these materials as if they are one's own.<br><br>An estimate of the extent of the plagiarism in the Vinuya Decision has been made by my office. The best approximation available to us, using the "word count" feature of Microsoft Word, reveals that 52.9% of the words used in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision's discussion on international law, which begins in page 24 and continues to the end (2,869 out of 5,419 words), are copied without attribution from other works.<br><br>The <i>Vinuya</i> Decision, therefore, because of the severity of the plagiarism attending it, is the worst possible context for the Majority to draw, in its Decision dated 12 October 2010 and in its Resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration, the following conclusions:<br><br><ol><li> that plagiarism requires the element of "malicious intent";<br><br></li><li>that - calibrating its ruling in response to the outcry of the academic community after the Majority Decision was issued - the rules against plagiarism applicable to the academic community do not apply to judicial decisions;<br><br></li><li>that the standard of attribution applicable to judicial decisions is effectively, no standard at all - a judge cannot be guilty of plagiarism as understood by the academic world, and neither is he liable for copying without attribution, even from copyrighted materials;<br><br></li><li>that this lack of liability extends as well to benefit lawyers in the submission of their pleadings before courts; and<br><br></li><li>that on the whole, the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision is the product of hard, honest, original work.</li></ol><br>In the course of the resolution of the Motion for Reconsideration, I have found myself counter-accused of having copied the works of others without attribution. I have debunked each of these claims and lay them bare in this Dissent. I have even proven that it was one of my co-authored works that was copied without attribution being given to me and to my co-authors. The theory propounded against me is that I cannot conclude that the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision is partly a product of plagiarism unless I am willing to call myself a plagiarist as well. I emphasize, however, my original thesis - that a diligent and honest judge or researcher will never find himself to have plagiarized, even unwittingly, to the same extent that plagiarism occurred in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. Herein lies the safety of a researcher - a habit of trying to give recognition where recognition is due. Should any of my works, wherein I failed to make proper attribution, surface, I will do what I have recommended that the author of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision do: acknowledge the wrong, apologize to the wronged, and correct the work.&nbsp; See pages 58 to 75 herein for a discussion on the counter-accusations leveled against me.<br><br>Irrespective of the outcome of my analysis, let it be stated that this Dissent does not make any pronouncement regarding the jurisdiction of this Court over the complaint for plagiarism against Justice del Castillo. My esteemed colleague Justice Carpio is convinced that Congress is the sole disciplining authority of all impeachable officers, including Justices of the Supreme Court. He characterizes plagiarism as a betrayal of public trust, and thus, "impeachment by Congress takes the place of administrative disciplinary proceedings against impeachable officers as there is no other power that can administratively discipline impeachable officers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><b> </b><br><br><b><i>I.<u> The Flow of the Analysis in This Dissent</u></i></b><br><br><b><i>A. Parameters</i></b><br><br>To allay any concern from members of the judiciary, I have been very careful to underscore the limitations of my analysis of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. My Dissent of 12 October 2010 is very clear:<br><br><blockquote>In a certain sense, there should have been less incentive to plagiarize law review articles because the currency of judges is <i>stare decisis</i>. One wonders how the issue should have been treated had what was plagiarized been a court ruling, but that is not at issue here. <b>The analysis in this opinion is therefore confined to the peculiar situation of a judge who issues a decision that plagiarizes law review articles, not to his copying of precedents or parts of the pleadings of the parties to a case.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>To be categorical, a judge or legal researcher cannot be guilty for using doctrines that have been incorporated into the mainstream and are standard terms of trade. Neither is a judge required to use quotation marks or blockquotes every time there is a reference to allegations in the pleadings of parties, or when he is discussing legal arguments using already accepted legal doctrines. It is when he ventures into using the original words of others, especially those of legal scholars, that he must be particularly careful. He cannot write to pass off the words of others, especially those of others' pioneering works, as his own. To do so is dishonest. It has also been suggested that Justice del Castillo cannot be guilty of plagiarism as he never read the work of Mariana Salazar Albornoz. That argument is neither here nor there. At the very least, the words he copied were those of another in an important original analysis of the state of international law on rape.<br><br><b><i>B. Structure of the Technical Analysis in This Dissent</i></b><br><br>The structure and rigidity of the Technical Analysis in this Dissent is necessary to fulfill two purposes: (1) to enable the reader to examine whether I have scientific and objective basis to conclude that severe plagiarism characterizes the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision; and (2) to examine whether I am willing to subject my work to the same standards to which I have subjected the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision.<br><br>One interesting note. My professional record had been vetted by the Judicial and Bar Council prior to my appointment to this Court. My previous works - those of an academic and those of a pleader - are presently being, and, I expect will continue to be, thoroughly scrutinized. While those previous works form part of the basis of my appointment, inasmuch as they are proof of my competence and expertise, they cannot serve as a basis to determine whether I am now performing my duties as a judge satisfactorily. One can view the scrutiny as an unwarranted collateral attack on my record. This did not happen until my Dissent of 12 October 2010.<br><br>The first part of the Technical Analysis consists of new tables of comparison presenting more instances of plagiarism as they occur in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. Two of these tables deal with copied works that previously appeared in my earlier Dissent: <i>A Fiduciary Theory of Jus Cogens,</i> by Evan J. Criddle and Evan Fox-Decent, and <i>Breaking the Silence: Rape as an International Crime</i> by Mark Ellis; however, the entries for these tables present instances of plagiarism not discussed or presented in my Dissent of 12 October 2010. Following the tables are lists of violations of rules against plagiarism, each list item corresponding to one table entry.<br><br>Following the presentation of the tables, the process whereby plagiarism could have been committed in <i>Vinuya</i> is examined. The severe extent of plagiarism, which is already evident in the tables, is discussed further, followed by an analysis of the systematic commission of plagiarism in <i>Vinuya</i>.&nbsp; This analysis consists of the detailed dissection of specific parts of the <i>Vinuya</i> decision: the text of the body in pages 31-32, and the first paragraph of footnote 65. The research process purportedly used by the legal researcher of <i>Vinuya</i> is then broken down into separate steps that illustrate the decision points at which an honest and diligent researcher would have ensured that proper attribution to sources be given. This is then followed by a closer examination of the deletion of existing citations and the features of Microsoft Word relevant to the deletion of footnotes.<br><br><u><b><i>II. Technical Analysis of Plagiarism in </i></b><b>Vinuya</b></u><br><br><b><i>A. More Plagiarism</i></b><br><br>Below are <b>new tables of comparison</b> - excluding materials in tables already discussed in my earlier Dissent to the majority Decision in AM 10-7-17-SC - of excerpts from the Decision in <i>Vinuya </i>vis-a-vis text from one (1)&nbsp; book on international law, five (5) foreign law journal articles, and a copyrighted report of the United States Congressional Research Service. While the degree of seriousness of the offense of unattributed copying varies with the kind of material copied, the extent of the copying conveys the level of honesty or dishonesty of the work done with respect to the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. The extent of copying enumerated in these tables also renders incredible the claim of mechanical failure, as well as the alleged lack of intent on the part of the researcher to not give proper attribution.<br><br>The materials for comparison were first identified in the Motion for Reconsideration and in the letter of Dr. Peter B. Payoyo, a Filipino legal scholar residing in the Netherlands, addressed to the Chief Justice dated 28 October 2010. These excerpts were independently verified, and compared with the corresponding portions from the original works. In the course of independent verification, we came across three more unattributed copied works.<br><center><u><br></u></center></heinonline.org></judicial-discipline-reform.org></www.ajs.org><div style="text-align: center;"><www.ajs.org style="text-decoration: underline;" ethics="" pdfs="" sanctions.pdf=""><judicial-discipline-reform.org judicial-complaints="" 1993-report-removal.pdf=""><heinonline.org hol="" landingpage?collection="journals&amp;handle=<br"><b>TABLES OF COMPARISON</b></heinonline.org></judicial-discipline-reform.org></www.ajs.org><br><www.ajs.org ethics="" pdfs="" sanctions.pdf=""><judicial-discipline-reform.org judicial-complaints="" 1993-report-removal.pdf=""><heinonline.org hol="" landingpage?collection="journals&amp;handle=<br"></heinonline.org></judicial-discipline-reform.org></www.ajs.org></div><www.ajs.org ethics="" pdfs="" sanctions.pdf=""><judicial-discipline-reform.org judicial-complaints="" 1993-report-removal.pdf=""><heinonline.org hol="" landingpage?collection="journals&amp;handle=<br"><br>To aid an objective analysis of the extent and manner of the plagiarism committed in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision, below are tables of comparison that will compare three written works: (1) the plagiarized work; (2) the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision; and (3) the purported "original" source analyzed or cited by the concerned authors and by the <i>Vinuya </i>Decision. The left column pertains to the literary works allegedly plagiarized by the legal researcher in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. The middle column refers to the pertinent passage in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision that makes unattributed use of the copied work.&nbsp; According to the Majority Resolution, these citations made to original sources (e.g. to the international law cases being referenced to support a certain point) in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision are sufficient to refute the charges of non-attribution. To address this claim, I have chosen to add a third column to present the text of the source referred to in the nearest (location-wise and/or context-wise) citation or attribution made in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. This will allow us to determine whether the analysis, reference and/or collation of original sources were those of the allegedly plagiarized authors or are <i>Vinuya</i> originals. In addition, this three-column presentation will also allow us to examine the claim being made by Justice del Castillo that at least two of the authors whose works are allegedly plagiarized in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision themselves violated academic scholarship rules against plagiarism.<br><br><b>TABLE A</b>: Comparison of Evan J.

The same applies to the relationship between peremptory norms of general international law <i>(jus cogens) </i>and the establishment of the Court's jurisdiction: the fact that a dispute relates to compliance with a norm having such a character, which is assuredly the case with regard to the prohibition of genocide, cannot of itself provide a basis for the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain that dispute. Under the Court's Statute that jurisdiction is always based on the consent of the parties. <i>Source:</i> Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Dem. Rep. Congo v.

The Process of the Commission of Plagiarism in the </i></b><b>Vinuya <i>Decision</i></b><br><br>A careful reading of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision reveals that it is unlike other decisions issued by this Court, except perhaps for the case of <i>Ang Ladlad LGBT Party v. Commission on Elections</i>, which Justice del Castillo likewise penned. The footnotes in <i>Vinuya</i> read like those found in theses of international law scholars, where one discursive footnote can be so extensive as to occupy three-fourths of a page (see footnotes 62, 63, and 65)<i>. </i>An honest researcher for a Philippine judge, after painstakingly developing a perspective on an international legal issue by reading the works of scholars who have documented the debate, would deliberately refer to the works of such scholars, and not transform their works into his own.<br><br>Justice del Castillo's researcher not only contends that accidental deletion is the sole reason for the missing footnotes, but also that their office subsequently went over the Decision "sentence by sentence" and concluded that no plagiarism was committed at all. However, the rearrangement of the sentences lifted from the original work, the mimicking of the original work's use of footnotes, the subsequent back and forth copying and pasting of such footnotes - these acts belie mere negligence. The following analysis shows objective plagiarism viewed through three lenses: <b><i>extent</i></b>,<b><i> deliberateness</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> effect</i></b>.<br><br>The massiveness and frequency with which instances of unattributed copying occur in <i>Vinuya </i>highlight the <i>extent </i>of the plagiarism. Clever transpositions of excerpts to make them flow according to the researcher's transition phrases are clearly devices of a practiced plagiarist, which betray the <i>deliberateness</i> of every single act. The plagiarism in <i>Vinuya</i> will also be scrutinized on the basis of its <i>effect</i>, especially in light of its commission in a judicial decision. The rationale for such a thematic presentation will then be discussed in a succeeding section, which deals with evaluating plagiarism.<br><br><i>1. The extent of unattributed copying belies inadvertence.</i><br><br>In the tables outlined above, as well as in the analysis in my Dissent dated 12 October 2010, it can be seen that the researcher of Justice del Castillo failed to make the necessary attribution twenty-three (23) times in the body of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision; the works whose texts were used without attribution include several copyrighted journal articles, essays from a book on international law, and one congressional report of the United States. There were thirty-six (36) missing citations in the footnotes, including twelve (12) citations missing from footnote 65 alone. This adds up to a total of fifty-nine (59) missing citations. The sheer number of missing citations is related to the length and volume of the footnotes and discussions, some of which Justice del Castillo himself admitted to be unnecessary.<br><br>The quantity of text copied without attribution is most concentrated in pages 12 to 13, which deal with actions taken in the pursuit of justice for the comfort women, and in pages 24 to 32, which appear under the section heading <b><i>The Philippines is not under any international obligation to espouse petitioners' claims</i></b>. In the latter section, the discussion and analysis appearing on pages 24 (insofar as the section after the start of the international law discussion is concerned), 28 and 31 in particular would be significantly impaired were the unattributed portions of texts to be removed: there would be no words left in the instance of page 24; the entirety of the discursive footnote on page 28 would be reduced to one sentence and its attendant citations; three sentence fragments, and no footnotes, would remain on page 31.<br><br>In pages 24 to 32, out of a total of thirteen (13) discursive footnotes, eleven (11) of these are comprised wholly of material copied without attribution, and yet another one - footnote 69 - contains text that was copied without attribution as well. The writer of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision displayed meticulous attention to detail in reproducing the citations to international judicial decisions, publications, and other such references in these footnotes - citations that originally appeared in the copied works - but completely bypassed the copied works themselves, thereby appropriating the analysis, processing, and synthesizing of information, as well as the words, of the writers whose works were copied.<br><br>On its face, the sheer volume of portions copied, added to the frequency with which citations to the plagiarized works were omitted while care was taken to retain citations to the sources cited by the plagiarized works, reveal that the plagiarism committed cannot logically be anything other than deliberate.<br><br><b><i>2. Systematic commission of plagiarism demonstrates deliberateness.</i></b><br><br>In pages twelve (12) to thirteen (13) of <i>Vinuya</i>, sentences from the body of Ladino's article were interspersed with Ladino's footnotes, without a single attribution to Ladino (<i>please refer to Table G)</i>. Sentences from Ladino's article were copied into footnote 32 of Vinuya, while the immediately succeeding sentence was again copied to form part of the body of Vinuya. The cutting of sentences from Ladino's work and the patching together of these pieces to form a mishmash of sentences negate the defense of inadvertence, and give the reader the impression that the freshly crafted argument was an original creation.<br><br>The work of Criddle and Fox-Decent was subjected to a similar process. This process is dissected in the following list of instances ordered according to how they appear in pages 31 to 32 of the body of the Decision:<br><br><b><i>a.

The researcher can either save the articles in their entirety, or save the selections in one document. The researcher in <i>Vinuya</i> claimed that she did the latter and used the Microsoft Word program for this purpose.<br><br>b. If the researcher chose to save only pertinent selections, then ideally the attributions would have to be made at his point.<br><br>Now, this step is critical. I know of no software in the world, especially not Microsoft Word, that will generate the citation to the work of Ellis on its own, without the appropriate action of the user.&nbsp; An honest researcher would immediately copy and paste the citation references of Ellis into the copied portions, or type a reference or label in, even if it were only a short form placeholder of the proper citation. If she did neither, she may be sloppy, incompetent or downright dishonest.<br><br>During the deliberations of the Ethics Committee, the researcher explained this crucial step: "So I would cut and paste relevant portions, at least portions which I find relevant into what turns out to be a large manuscript which I can then whittle and edit and edit further."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Adhering to this account, there would be an additional step in the process:<br><br>Step 5<br><br>If an existing draft or "manuscript" has already been created, the next step would be to incorporate the selections from the articles into the draft. This is a second opportunity to ensure that the proper attributions are made. If the researcher is diligent, she would already have tried to follow the correct form as prescribed by the <i>Manual of Judicial Writing.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <br><br>If a "manuscript" or outline has already been formulated, then incorporating the selections would require her to be conscious that these ideas and arguments are not her own. The process ideally alerts any researcher that extraneous sources are being added. It allows her to make the following considerations: <i>Does this portion sufficiently discuss the historical context of a particular conclusion? Do I need this literature as support for my arguments? Am I including it to support my arguments, or merely to mimic the author's? </i>Corollarily, the researcher would initially assess if such argument made by the author is adequately supported as well. She would check the author's footnotes. In <i>Vinuya</i>, the copying of the footnotes was so extensive, such that it practically used the uncited works as blueprint for the Decision's footnotes.<br><br>4. The frequency of instances of missing citations and actions required for deletion betray deliberateness.<br><br>To purposefully input citations would require many key strokes and movements of the computer's "mouse." If the attributions had indeed been made already, then the deletions of such attributions would not simply happen without a specific sequence of key strokes and mouse movements. The researcher testified that the necessary attributions were made in the earlier drafts, but that in the process of cutting and pasting the various paragraphs, they were accidentally dropped. She makes it sound as if something like a long reference citation can just easily fall by the wayside. Not so.<br><br>The reference required under the <i>Manual of Judicial Writing</i> for the work of Ellis reads like this: "Mark Ellis, <i>Breaking the Silence: Rape as an International Crime</i>, 38 Case W. Res. J. Int'l L. 225 (2006-2007)."<br><br>The researcher in <i>Vinuya</i> explained that footnotes were deleted along with headings of certain portions, and with the deletion of the note reference mark in the body of the text, the citations in the document's footers disappeared also. For this scenario to happen with the same frequency as the number of missing citations, the following steps must have been followed:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>First movement:</b> Using hand and eye coordination, consciously move cursor to the location of target footnote and/or heading, using either the mouse or arrow keys.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Second movement:</b> Select the "note reference mark" by highlighting the target footnote number. Note that unlike in normal characters or texts wherein a single press of the "delete" or "backspace" button would suffice, a footnote number must be highlighted before it can be deleted. This means that either the particular footnote and/or heading must have been "double-clicked" or it must have been specifically highlighted by a precise horizontal motion of the cursor while pressing on a mouse button - both of which require two movements (either two "clicks", or a "click" and a "swipe").<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Third</b> movement: Press "delete" or "backspace" key.<br><br>Note that in the case wherein the note reference mark was not highlighted by a mouse movement, the "delete" or "backspace" key must have been pressed <i>twice</i>, as pressing it only once will merely highlight the note reference mark without deleting the same.<br><br>Hence, even accommodating the explanation given by the researcher, at least four movements must have been accomplished to delete one footnote or reference. Multiply this with the number of references that were "dropped" or "missing," and you have a situation wherein the researcher accomplished no less than two hundred thirty-six (236) deliberate steps to be able to drop the fifty-nine (59) citations that are missing in <i>Vinuya</i>. If by some chance the cursor happened to be at the precise location of the citations, and the citations were subsequently deleted by an accidental click of the mouse, this would still have necessitated a total of one hundred seventy seven (177) clicks. It is understandable if a researcher accidentally deleted one, two or even five footnotes. That a total of 59 footnotes were erased by mere accident is inconceivable.<br><br>To make a conservative estimate, we can deduct the number of times that a footnote number in the body of the Decision could simply have been deleted inadvertently. Our analysis indicates that this could have happened a third of the time, or an estimate of twenty times, when short footnotes containing <i>"supra"</i> or <i>"id." </i>could have been easily forgotten or omitted. This would still have yielded sixty deliberate steps or movements, and would alert the researcher either that: 1) too much of the body comprises ideas which are not his own, or 2) too many of the sources in his "main manuscript" were getting lost. Subsequently, if more than half of the attributions in the International Law discussion went missing, the simple recourse would have been either to review his or her first draft, or simply delete his lengthy discursive footnotes precisely because he cannot remember which articles he might have lifted them from.<br><br><b><i>On Microsoft Word features that alert the user to discrepancies in footnote deletions</i></b><br><br>The researcher took pains to deliberately cut and paste the original sources of the author, thereby making it appear that she was the one who collated and processed this material. What she should have done was simply to cite the author from whom she took the analysis and summarization of the said sources in the first place. The latter would have been the simple, straightforward, not to mention honest path. Instead, the effect is that the <i>Vinuya </i>Decision also appropriated the author's analysis. Actually, it would have been easier to cite the author's copied work considering the availability of short citation forms commonly used as reference tools in legal articles such as <i>"supra"</i> or <i>"id."</i><br><br>Microsoft Word may not have an automatic alarm each time a footnote or citation is deleted, but it does contain built-in features to help raise "red flags" to signal that a particular passage was copied, or is attached to a particular citation - if indeed such citation exists. For example, the researcher in <i>Vinuya</i>, in describing her own process of drafting the Decision, stated that portions containing footnotes from the first <i>Vinuya</i> draft were lifted and transformed into the contents of a separate footnote. In short, during revisions of the draft, substantial footnoted portions which used to be in the body were relegated to footnotes. This does not result, however, in the automatic erasure of the original footnotes within the new footnote. A simple recreation of this process reveals that this "footnote within a footnote" retains a number symbol in superscript, albeit one altered due to the redundancy in the functionality of "footnotes within footnotes." Any reasonably prudent researcher would thus be alerted to the fact that something was amiss with the citations in that particular selection because the footnote would have abnormal numeric superscripts. This glaring abnormality in itself is a warning.<br><br>Another notable feature is that when a cursor, as seen on the screen in an open document, is placed over a footnote reference mark, Microsoft Word automatically supplies that footnote's citation in a popup text box. The popup box hovers over the numerical superscript, unmistakably indicating the source.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In addition, no single action can cause a footnote to be deleted; once the cursor is beside it, either the "delete" or "backspace" key must be pressed <i>twice</i>, or it must be deliberately highlighted and then erased with a stroke of either the "delete" or the "backspace" key. This functionality of footnote deletion in Microsoft Word thus decreases the likelihood of footnotes being deleted without the knowledge or intention of the researcher.<br><br>As to the claim of the researcher that the footnotes in the headings were accidentally deleted, there was a failure on the part of the Ethics Committee to thoroughly investigate the matter when they relied on a presentation of what, according to the researcher, happened during her research for and drafting of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision. Instead of asking her to re-create the various situations of "inadvertent dropping," the Ethics Committee satisfied itself with a "before" and "after" Microsoft PowerPoint presentation which could not, by any stretch of the imagination, have recreated the whole process of researching and drafting that happened in <i>Vinuya</i> unless every step were to be frozen through screenshots using the "Print Screen" command in tandem with a common image management program. To simply present the "before" and "after" scenario through PowerPoint has no bearing on the reality of what happened. Had the Ethics Committee required that the presentation made before them be through recreation of the drafting process using Microsoft Word alone, without "priming the audience" through a "before" and "after" PowerPoint presentation, they would have seen the footnotes themselves behaving strangely, alerting the researcher that something was seriously wrong. The Committee would then have found incredible the claim that the accidental deletion of a footnote mark attached to a heading - and the subsequent transposition of text under that heading to another footnote - could have occurred without the researcher being reminded <i>that the text itself came from another source</i>. Proof of deliberate action is found in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision itself -&nbsp; the care with which the researcher included citations of the sources to which the authors of the copied works referred, while conveniently neglecting attribution to the copied works themselves.<br><br>It is therefore impossible to conclude that such gross plagiarism, consisting of failure to attribute to nine (9) copyrighted works, could have been the result of anything other than failure to observe the requirements of the standard of conduct demanded of a legal researcher. There is also no basis to conclude that there was no failure on the part of Justice del Castillo to meet the standard of supervision over his law clerk required of incumbent judges.<br><br>III. On Evaluating Plagiarism<br><br><b><i>A. Posner's Standards for Evaluating the Characterization of Incidents of Plagiarism</i></b><br><br>To be generous to my colleagues in this part of my analysis, I have referred to one of the scholars who hold the most liberal views on plagiarism, Judge Richard A. Posner. The three guideposts by which I structured my technical analysis of the instances of plagiarism in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision come from his breakdown of certain key issues in his work, <i>The Little Book of Plagiarism</i>. In his "cook's tour" of the key issues surrounding plagiarism, wherein he is more liberal than most academics in speaking of the sanctions the act may merit - he is against the criminalization of plagiarism, for instance, and believes it an act more suited to informal sanctions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> -&nbsp; Judge Posner characterizes plagiarism thus:<br><br>Plagiarism is a species of intellectual fraud. It consists of unauthorized copying that the copier claims (whether explicitly or implicitly, and whether deliberately or carelessly) is original with him and the claim causes the copier's audience to behave otherwise than it would if it knew the truth. This change in behavior, as when it takes the form of readers' buying the copier's book under the misapprehension that it is original, can harm both the person who is copied and the competitors of the copier. But there can be plagiarism without publication, as in the case of student plagiarism. The fraud is directed in the first instance at the teacher (assuming that the student bought rather than stole the paper that he copied). But its principal victims are the plagiarist's student competitors, who are analogous to authors who compete with a plagiarist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Posner then goes on to neatly sum up, in the form of three "keys," major considerations that need to be taken into account when evaluating an occurrence of plagiarism. His book's last paragraph reads:<br><br>In the course of my cook's tour of the principal issues that have to be addressed in order to form a thoughtful response to plagiarism in modern America, I have challenged its definition as "literary theft" and in its place emphasized<b> reliance, detectability, and the extent of the market for expressive works as keys to defining plagiarism and calibrating the different types of plagiarism by their gravity</b>. I have emphasized the variety of plagiarisms, argued for the adequacy of the existing, informal sanctions, pointed out that the "fair use" doctrine of copyright law should not protect a plagiarist, noted the analogy between plagiarism and trademark infringement (a clue to the entwinement of the modern concept of plagiarism with market values)-and warned would-be plagiarists that the continuing advance of digitization may soon trip them up. (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br>It is in this spirit that the three questions - of <i>extent,</i> an analogue of reliance, as extensive plagiarism correlates to the reliance of the text on the copied work; <i>deliberateness;</i> and <i>effect,</i> an analogue of what Posner called "extent of the market for expressive works", used here in the context of the effect of plagiarism in the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision - were put to the text being scrutinized. The first two questions have been discussed in preceding sections. To examine the effect, one must first make the distinction between the effect of copying a copyrighted work without attribution, and between the effect of copying without attribution a work in the public domain. Using these three guideposts, we can them come to a conclusion whether the plagiarism is relatively harmless and light or something severe and harmful. In the case of the <i>Vinuya</i> Decision, we have come to conclude that the plagiarism is severe; and because judicial decisions are valuable to the Philippine legal system, that the plagiarism harms this institution as well.<br><br><b><i>1. The distinction between the effect of appropriating copyrighted works and works in the public domain</i></b><br><br>The infringement of copyright necessitates a framework for characterizing the expression of ideas as <i>property.</i> It thus turns on a question of whether there exists resultant harm in a form which is economically quantifiable. Plagiarism, on the other hand, covers a much wider range of acts. In defining copyright infringement, Laurie Stearns points out how it is an offense independent from plagiarism, so that an action for violation of copyright - which may take on either a criminal and a civil aspect, or even both - <i>does not sufficiently remedy the broader injury inherent in plagiarism.</i><br><br><blockquote>Plagiarism is not necessarily copyright infringement, nor is copyright infringement necessarily plagiarism...In some ways the concept of plagiarism is broader than infringement, in that it can include the copying of ideas, or of expression not protected by copyright, that would not constitute infringement, and it can include the copying of small amounts of material that copyright law would disregard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Plagiarism, with its lack of attribution, severs the connection between the original author's name and the work. A plagiarist, by falsely claiming authorship of someone else's material, directly assaults the author's interest in receiving credit. In contrast, attribution is largely irrelevant to a claim of copyright infringement...infringement can occur even when a work is properly attributed if the copying is not authorized-for example, a pirated edition of a book produced by someone who does not own the publication rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>The recognition of plagiarism as an offense that can stand independently of copyright infringement allows a recognition that acts of plagiarism are subject to reproof irrespective of whether the work is copyrighted or not. In any case, the scenario presented before the Court is an administrative matter and deals with plagiarism, not infringement of copyright.<br><br><b><i>2. On judicial plagiarism and the sanctions therefor</i></b><br><br>The majority Resolution quotes from the <i>Judicial Opinion Writing Handbook</i> written by Joyce George - which I cited in my earlier Dissent - thusly:<br><br><blockquote>The implicit right of judges to use legal materials regarded as belonging to the public domain is not unique to the Philippines. As Joyce C. George, whom Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno cites in her dissenting opinion, observed in her Judicial Opinion Writing Handbook:<br><br><b> A judge writing to resolve a dispute, whether trial or appellate, is exempted from a charge of plagiarism even if ideas, words or phrases from a law review article, novel thoughts published in a legal periodical or language from a party's brief are used without giving attribution. Thus judges are free to use whatever sources they deem appropriate to resolve the matter before them, without fear or reprisal. This exemption applies to judicial writings intended to decide cases for two reasons: the judge is not writing a literary work and, more importantly, the purpose of the writing is to resolve a dispute. As a result, judges adjudicating cases are not subject to a claim of legal plagiarism.</b><br></blockquote><br>The use of this excerpt to justify the wholesale lifting of others' words without attribution as an "implicit right" is a serious misinterpretation of the discussion from which the excerpt was taken. George wrote the above-quoted passage in the context of a nuanced analysis of possible <i>sanctions</i> for judicial plagiarism, not in the context of the <i>existence</i> of plagiarism in judicial opinions. (I had candidly disclosed the existence of this liberal view even in my 12 October 2010 Dissent.) The sections preceding the text from which this passage was taken are, in fact, discussions of the following: ethical issues involving plagiarism in judicial writing, with regard to both the act of copying the work of another and the implications of plagiarism on the act of adjudication; types of judicial plagiarism, the means by which they may be committed, and the venues in and through which they can occur; and recent cases of judicial plagiarism.<br><br><b>In no wise does George imply that the judicial function confers upon judges the implicit right to use the writing of others without attribution. Neither does George conflate the possible lack of sanctions for plagiarism with the issue of whether a determination of judicial plagiarism can be made.</b> Rather, George is careful to make the distinction between the issue of whether judicial plagiarism was committed and the issue of whether a sanction can be imposed for an act of judicial plagiarism. In George's terminology, the latter issue may also be framed as a question of whether judicial plagiarism is "subject to a claim of legal [that is, actionable] plagiarism", and it has no bearing whatsoever on the former issue. Thus, George writes:<br><br><blockquote>The intentional representation of another person's words, thoughts, or ideas as one's own without giving attribution is plagiarism. "Judicial plagiarism" is the copying of words or ideas first written down by another judge, advocate, legal writer or commentator without giving credit to the originator of that work. It can include such things as a judge's copying of another's judges opinion, the adoption verbatim of an advocate's findings of fact and conclusions of law, the wholesale adoption of an advocate's brief, or the copying of a portion of a law review article and representing it as the judge's own thoughts. The lack of attribution makes this activity "judicial plagiarism," but without legal sanctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>Indeed, my previous Dissent stated that inasmuch as sanctions for judicial plagiarism are concerned, "there is no strictly prevailing consensus regarding the need or obligation to impose sanctions on judges who have committed judicial plagiarism." Yet the absence of a definite answer to the question of liability does not grant judges carte blanche to use the work of others without attribution, willy-nilly, in their judicial opinions. As George puts it, "the judge is ethically bound to give proper credit to law review articles, novel thoughts published in legal periodicals, newly handed down decisions, or even a persuasive case from another jurisdiction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Plainly, George is of the opinion that though a judge may not be held liable for an act of judicial plagiarism, he should still attribute.<br><br>A note about "intentional representation." A careful reading of George's writing on judicial plagiarism will make it clear that she does not consider "inadvertent" or "unintentional" plagiarism <i>not</i> plagiarism; indeed, she makes the distinction between "intentional" and "unintentional" plagiarism several times, treating <i>both</i> as types of plagiarism:<br><br><blockquote>Using another's language verbatim without using quotation marks or a block quote is intentional, as opposed to unintentional, plagiarism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>...<br><br>The lack of proper attribution may be unintentional and due to sloppy note taking, either by the law clerk or the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">...<br></div><br>Judicial plagiarism may also arise from the use of law clerks performing research and writing of draft decisions and who may not accurately reflect the source. The plagiarized material may be included within the draft resulting from the law clerk's poor research skills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">...<br></div><br>The commission of unintended judicial plagiarism is unethical, but it is not sanctionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The intentional representation of which George speaks, then, may be considered as the intent to represent a work as one's own - already embodied in claiming a work by, for instance, affixing one's name or byline to it - in which case the inadvertence, or lack thereof, by which an act of plagiarism was committed is irrelevant to a finding of plagiarism.<br><br>While George is perhaps not as exacting in her valuation of the penalties for&nbsp; plagiarism as others may be, she still emphasizes that her view on the exemption of judicial plagiarism from sanctions - among which she evidently counts social stigma, censure, and ostracism - does not negate the judge's ethical obligation to attribute. She writes:<br><br><blockquote>In conclusion, this author believes that a judicial writer cannot commit legal plagiarism because the purpose of his writing is not to create a literary work but to dispose of a dispute between parties. Even so, a judge is ethically bound to give proper credit to law review articles, novel thoughts published in legal periodicals, newly handed down decisions, or even a persuasive case from another jurisdiction. While the judge may unwittingly use the language of a source without attribution, it is not proper even though he may be relieved of the stigma of plagiarism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>As I wrote in my previous Dissent:<br><br><blockquote>In so fulfilling her obligations, it may become imperative for the judge to use "the legal reasoning and language [of others<i>e.g</i>. a supervising court or a law review article] for resolution of the dispute."<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[31]</span>Although these obligations of the judicial writer must be acknowledged, care should be taken to consider that said obligations do not negate the need for attribution so as to avoid the commission of judicial plagiarism. Nor do said obligations diminish the fact that judicial plagiarism "detracts directly from the legitimacy of the judge's ruling and indirectly from the judiciary's legitimacy"<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[32] </span>or that it falls far short of the high ethical standards to which judges must adhere<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[33]</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>It must not be forgotten, however, that George's view tends toward the very liberal. There are other writings, and actual instances of the imposition of sanctions, that reveal a more exacting view of the penalties merited by judicial plagiarism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><b> </b><br><br><b><i>B.

As the work is another's and used without attribution, the plagiarist derives the benefit of use form the plagiarized work without expending the requisite effort for the same - at a cost (as in the concept of "opportunity cost") to its author who could otherwise have gained credit for the work and whatever compensation for its use is deemed appropriate and necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>Allow me to analyze the allegations of Justice Robert C.

He would not then have presumed that I copied those sentences; rather, it might have struck him that more likely than not, it was the ADB echoing the thoughts of one or some of the authors in the reference list when it used those quoted sentences, and that the pool of authors being echoed by ADB includes me.

The notice on page 2 of the paper that is found in the asterisked footnote of the title reads:<br><br>This paper was <b>originally submitted in August 2001 as project report to the World Bank</b>.

The authors of the English-language works are all scholars on judicial reform, and they cite our work as one of the pioneering ones in terms of measuring the relationship between dysfunctions in the judicial system and the cost to doing business of such dysfunctions.

If this is the case, then it appears that in Justice Abad's view I should have written:&nbsp; "the following are the requirements provided for under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Bar Matter No. 803) for filing a complaint" and then used quotation marks every time reference to the law is made. Nothing can be more awkward than requiring such a tedious way of explaining the Rules of Court requirements. I have made no such comparable charge of violation against Justice del Castillo in the Dissent to the main Decision and I am not making any such claim of violation in my Dissent to the Resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration, because that would be a meaningless point.<br><br>Regarding the phrase allegedly coming from Professor Oppenheim on good offices and mediation, this is a trite, common, standard statement - with nothing original at all about it - that can be found in any international dispute settlement reference book, including those that discuss WTO dispute settlement systems. The phrase is a necessary, cut-and-dried statement on the use of good offices and mediation, which take place alongside the formal dispute settlement system in major international dispute settlement systems. The system is provided for expressly in Article 5.5 and 5.6 of the DSU.

The first is that the American judicial system have rules designed to minimize the possibilities of a judge maximizing his financial interest by receiving a bribe from a litigant of from acceding to a politically powerful interest group by making the rules work in such a manner as to create disincentives for the judge ruling in such a manner. The second, proceeding from the first is that the judge maximizes the interest of the group to which he belongs. If he belongs to the landowning class, he will generally favor landowners, and if he walks to work, he will generally favor pedestrians. The third is that the judge maximizes the prospects of his promotion to a higher office by slanting his decisions in favor of powerful interest groups. The last is that judges maximize their influence on society by imposing their values, tastes and preferences thereon. Depending on one's impressions and experiences (since there is no empirical data on which a more scientific conclusion can be reached on which of the above four theories are correct), we can see the relation of this utility-maximizing behavior on both our probability estimate function and <b>Posner's</b> precondition inequality for litigation.

Presumably judges, like the rest of us, seek to maximize a utility function that includes both monetary and nonmonetary elements (the latter including leisure, prestige, and power). As noted earlier, however, the rules of the judicial process have been carefully designed both to prevent the judge from receiving a monetary payoff from deciding a particular case one way or the other and to minimize the influence of politically effective interest groups on his decisions. To be sure, the effectiveness of these insulating rules is sometimes questioned. It is often argued, for example, that the judge who owns land will decide in favor of landowners, the judge who walks to work in favor of pedestrians, the judge who used to be a corporate lawyer in favor of corporations.... A somewhat more plausible case can be made that judges might slant their decisions in favor of powerful interest groups in order to increase the prospects of promotion to higher office, judicial or otherwise.... It would seem, therefore, that the explanation for judicial behavior must lie elsewhere than in pecuniary or political factors. That most judges are leisure maximizers is an assumption that will not survive even casual observation of judicial behavior.

The Role of the Judiciary in Society</i></b><br><br>On more than one occasion, this Court has referred to one of its functions as the symbolic or educative function, the competence to formulate guiding principles that may enlighten the bench and the bar, and the public in general.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It cannot now backpedal from the high standards inherent in the judicial role, or from the standards it has set for itself.<br><br>The need to cement ethical standards for judges and justices is intertwined with the democratic process. As Lebovits explained:<br><br><blockquote><b>The judiciary's power comes from its words alone-judges command no army and control no purse. In a democracy, judges have legitimacy only when their words deserve respect, and their words deserve respect only when those who utter them are ethical. Opinion writing is public writing of the highest order; people are affected not only by judicial opinions but also by how they are written. Therefore, judges and the opinions they write-opinions scrutinized by litigants, attorneys, other judges, and the public-are held, and must be held, to high ethical standards. Ethics must constrain every aspect of the judicial opinion.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Justice George Rose Smith once pointed to the democratic process as a reason to write opinions: "Above all else to expose the court's decision to public scrutiny, to nail it up on the wall for all to see. In no other way can it be known whether the law needs revision, whether the court is doing its job, whether a particular judge is competent." Justice Smith recognized that judges are not untouchable beings. Judges serve their audience. With this service comes the need for judges to be trusted. Writing opinions makes obtaining trust easier; it allows an often opaque judicial institution to become transparent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>Judges cannot evade the provisions in the Code of Judicial Conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A judge should participate in establishing, maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary will be preserved. The drafters of the <i>Model Code</i> were aware that to be effective, the judiciary must maintain legitimacy -and to maintain legitimacy, judges must live up to the <i>Model Code</i>'s moral standards when writing opinions. If the public is able to witness or infer from judges' writing that judges resolve disputes morally, the public will likewise be confident of judges' ability to resolve disputes fairly and justly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states that a judge should uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary. Rule 1.01 in particular states that a judge should be the embodiment of competence, integrity, and independence.<br><br>Canon 3 then focuses on the duty of honesty in the performance of official duties, as well as on the supervision of court personnel:<br><br>Rule 3.09. A judge should organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, and require at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity.<br><br>Rule 3.10. A judge should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against lawyers or court personnel for unprofessional conduct of which the judge may have become aware.<br><br>Paragraph 17 of the Code of Judicial Ethics<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> focuses on the writing of judicial opinions:<br><br><blockquote>In disposing of controversial cases, judges should indicate the reasons for their action in opinions showing that they have not disregarded or overlooked serious arguments of counsel. They should show their full understanding of the case, avoid the suspicion of arbitrary conclusion, <b>promote confidence in their intellectual integrity</b> and contribute useful precedents to the growth of the law. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Paragraph 31, "a summary of judicial obligations," contains a more general statement regarding the behavioral norms required of judges and justices alike, stating:<br><br><blockquote>A judge's conduct should be above reproach and in the discharge of his judicial duties, he should be conscientious, studious, thorough, courteous, patient, punctual, just, impartial, fearless of public clamor, and regardless of private influence should administer justice according to law and should deal with the patronage of the position as a public trust; and he should not allow outside matters or his private interests to interfere with the prompt and proper performance of his office.<br><br>That judges and justices alike are subject to higher standards by virtue of their office has been repeatedly pronounced by the Supreme Court:<br><br>Concerned with safeguarding the integrity of the judiciary, this Court has come down hard and wielded the rod of discipline against members of the judiciary who have fallen short of the exacting standards of judicial conduct. This is because a judge is the visible representation of the law and of justice. He must comport himself in a manner that his conduct must be free of a whiff of impropriety, not only with respect to the performance of his official duties but also as to his behavior outside his sala and as a private individual. His character must be able to withstand the most searching public scrutiny because the ethical principles and sense of propriety of a judge are essential to the preservation of the people's faith in the judicial system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, being the subject of constant public scrutiny, a judge should freely and willingly accept restrictions on conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> A judge should personify integrity and exemplify honest public service. The personal behavior of a judge, both in the performance of his official duties and in private life should be above suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Concerned with safeguarding the integrity of the judiciary, this Court has come down hard on erring judges and imposed the concomitant punishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>As held by the Court in <i>Teban Hardware and Auto Supply Co. v. Tapucar</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The personal and official actuations of every member of the Bench must be beyond reproach and above suspicion. The faith and confidence of the public in the administration of justice cannot be maintained if a Judge who dispenses it is not equipped with the cardinal judicial virtue of moral integrity, and if he obtusely continues to commit an affront to public decency. In fact, moral integrity is more than a virtue; it is a necessity in the Judiciary.</blockquote><br>The inherent value of judicial decisions goes beyond the resolution of dispute between two parties. From the perspective of the judge, he has fulfilled his minimum burden when he has disposed of the case. Yet from the perspective of the public, it is only through publicized decisions that the public experiences the nearest approximation of a democratic experience from the third branch of Government.<br><br><blockquote>Decisions and opinions of a court are of course matters of public concern or interest for these are the authorized expositions and interpretations of the laws, binding upon all citizens, of which every citizen is charged with knowledge. <b>Justice thus requires that all should have free access to the opinions of judges and justices, and it would be against sound public policy to prevent, suppress or keep the earliest knowledge of these from the public</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>The clearest manifestation of adherence to these standards is through a Justice's written opinions. In the democratic framework, it is the only way by which the public can check the performance of such public officer's obligations. Plagiarism in judicial opinions detracts directly from the legitimacy of the judge's ruling and indirectly from the judiciary's legitimacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It is objectionable not only because of its inherent capacity to harm, but the overarching damage it wreaks on the dignity of the Court as a whole.<br><br><b><i>The Court's Educative Function</i></b><br><br>The Court's first Decision in this case hinged on the difference between the academic publishing model on the one hand, and the judicial system on the other. It proceeded to conclude that courts are encouraged to cite "historical legal data, precedents, and related studies" in their decisions, so that "the judge is not expected to produce original scholarship in every respect."<br><br>This argument presents a narrower view of the role of the courts than what this country's history consistently reveals: the judiciary plays a more creative role than just traditional scholarship. No matter how hesitantly it assumes this duty and burden, the courts have become moral guideposts in the eyes of the public.<br><br><blockquote>Easily the most daunting task which confronts a newly appointed judge is how to write decisions. It is truly a formidable challenge considering the impact of a court's judgment reverberates throughout the community in which it is rendered, affecting issues of life, liberty, and property in ways that are more pervasive and penetrating than what usually appears on the surface - or under it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>The impact of judicial decisions has even been codified in paragraph 2 of the Canon of Judicial Ethics: "Every judge should at all times be alert in his rulings and in the conduct of the business of his court, so far as he can, to make it useful to litigants and to the community."<br><br>The error in the contention of the majority that judicial writing does not put a premium on originality is evident. In the words of Daniel Farber, <i>stare decisis</i> has become an oft-repeated catchphrase to justify an unfounded predisposition to repeating maxims and doctrines devoid of renewed evaluation.<br><br><blockquote>In reviewing the Court's work, we saw a fixation on verbal formulas; likewise, race scholarship frequently seems to suffer from a similar fixation on stylized rhetoric. Yet Holmes' adage defines the problem a bit too narrowly-suggesting that we mostly need less abstraction and more concreteness. This deficiency actually is part of the problem; we could surely benefit from more empirical research and sensitivity to concrete factual situations. Yet, the problem goes beyond that.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>The consistent resort to <i>stare decisis</i> fails to take into account that in the exercise of the Court's self-proclaimed symbolic function, its first accountability is to its audience: the public. Its duty of guiding the bench and the bar comes a close second.<br><br><blockquote>Consider first the judge. A key weakness of current Supreme Court opinions seems to be that judges have sometimes lost track of whom they are addressing or what they are trying to accomplish. Of course, they have no literal clients, but they seek to advance a set of values and perspectives that might serve as the basis for identifying metaphorical clients...The purpose, then, is to help the system work as well as possible according to its own norms and goals...<br><br>Often, the purpose is to guide other courts to advance the client's interests in their own decisions. In this respect, the important part of the opinion is that portion speaking to future cases-though as we have seen, judges sometimes fail to focus their energies there. Additionally, the opinion, if it is to elicit more than the most grudging obedience, must appeal to the values and goals of those judges as well as to the author's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <br><br><b>The Court seemingly views the issuance of opinions to be an end in itself, as if the text of the opinion had some autonomous value unrelated to its ability to communicate to an audience. At a deeper level, the intellectual flaw in the statutory-interpretation opinions is similar. The Court often treats statutes as free-standing texts, with little attention to their historical and social contexts or what their drafters were trying to achieve.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the value of ethical judicial writing vis-à-vis the role that courts are called upon to play cannot be underestimated.<br><br><blockquote>Worrying about the ethical status of judicial opinions seems pointless at first. Complaints about decisions and the opinions that explain them have been around as long as judges have been judging. As technology has lowered the cost of research, and of cutting and pasting earlier work, opinions often seem to be formal exercises that do not suggest deep judicial engagement. Other opinions do show the hand of a deeply engaged judge, though these can be worse than the cut-and-pasted kind. What then is to be gained by trying to make an ethical issue of judicial writing? ... Professor Llewellyn said it is in part because <b>the judicial office acts as "a subduer of self and self-will, as an engine to promote openness to listen and to understand, to quicken evenhandedness, patience, sustained effort to see and judge for All-of-Us</b>." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>The lessons taught our country by its singular experience in history has given rise to a more defined place for our courts. With the constitutional mandate that the Supreme Court alone can exercise judicial review, or promulgate rules and guidelines for the bench and the bar, or act as the arbiter between the two branches of government, it is all the more evident that standards for judicial behavior must be formulated. After all, "the most significant aspect of the court's work may lie in just this method and process of decision: by avoiding absolutes, by testing general maxims against concrete particulars, by deciding only in the context of specific controversies, by finding accommodations between polar principles, by holding itself open to the reconsideration of dogma, the court at its best, provides a symbol of reconciliation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>According to Paul Freund, the great fundamental guarantees of our Constitution are in fact, moral standards wrapped in legal commands. It is only fitting that the Court, in taking on the role of a public conscience, accept the fact that the people expect nothing less from it than the best of faith and effort in adhering to high ethical standards.<br><br>I affirm my response to the dispositive portion of the majority Decision in this case as stated in my Dissent of 12 October 2010, with the modification that more work of more authors must be appropriately acknowledged, apologies must be extended, and a more extensively corrected Corrigendum must be issued. Again, I make no pronouncement on liability, not only because the process was erroneously cut short by the majority when it refused to proceed to the next step of determining the duty of diligence that a judge has in supervising the work of his legal research, and whether, in this instance, Justice del Castillo discharged such duty, but also because of the view expressed by Justice Carpio that this Court had best leave the matter of clearing Justice del Castillo to Congress, the body designated by the Constitution for such matters. It seems now that the process of determining the degree of care required in this case may never be undertaken by this Court. One thing is certain, however: we cannot allow a heavily plagiarized Decision to remain in our casebooks - it must be corrected. The issues are very clear to the general public. A wrong must be righted, and this Court must move forward in the right direction.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Mark Ellis, <i>Breaking the Silence: Rape as an International </i>Crime, 38 Case W.
