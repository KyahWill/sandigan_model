				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Case</b><br></div><br>This is an appeal from the August 28, 2008 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CEB CR-H.C. No. 00731, which affirmed the April 3, 2007 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Criminal Case No. 1347 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 10 in Abuyog, Leyte. The RTC convicted accused Allan Gabrino of murder.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Facts</b><br></div><br>The charge against the accused stemmed from the following Information:<br><blockquote><br>That on or about the 30<sup>th</sup> day of December, 1993 in the Municipality of La Paz, Province of Leyte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and wound one JOSEPH BALANO with the use of bladed weapon locally known as pisaw which said accused had purposely provided himself, thereby causing and inflicting upon the said JOSEPH BALANO wounds on his body which caused his death shortly thereafter.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>On July 7, 2003, the arraignment was conducted. The accused, who was assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the offense charge. A mandatory pre-trial conference was done on October 1, 2003. Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>During the trial, the prosecution offered the testimonies of Bartolome Custodio (Bartolome), laborer and a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz, Leyte; and Ismael Moreto (Ismael), farmer and a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Mohon, Tanauan, Leyte. On the other hand, the defense presented Nestor Sarile (Nestor), Municipal Planner of La Paz, Leyte and a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz, Leyte; and the accused as witnesses.<br><br><center><b>The Prosecution's Version of Facts</b><br></center><br>The first witness, Bartolome, testified that he is a resident of <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz, Leyte for more than 30 years and he knows the accused as they were classmate from Grade 1 to Grade 5. He also testified that on certain occasions, the accused would spend the night at their house. He stated that he likewise knows Joseph Balano (Balano), the deceased, as he was a former resident of <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz Leyte, but had to transfer to <i>Barangay</i> Cogon, Tanauan, Leyte because of an insurgency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>He narrated that on December 30, 1993, he visited his uncle, Gorgonio Berones (Gorgonio) in <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz, Leyte with Balano. Upon arrival at the house of his uncle, he noticed that a certain Jom-jom and his friends, including the accused, were having a drinking session. Thirty minutes later, Jom-jom and his group left the vicinity. Bartolome and Balano stayed for less than an hour at the house of Bartolome's uncle, and left thereafter. On their way home, however, somebody suddenly sprang out from behind the coconut tree and stabbed Balano. As there was a bright moonlight at the time, and because of the two-arms-length distance between them, Bartolome easily recognized the assailant to be the accused. He even testified that he tried to calm the accused down. Bartolome further stated that he saw the accused stab Balano once, after which Balano ran away while being pursued by the accused. He stated that he asked the people for help in transporting Balano to the hospital but the latter died on the way there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The second witness, Ismael, testified that on December 30, 1993, he was in <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz, Leyte, working with Balano for the processing of copra of Guadalupe Balano. That night, he stayed at the house of Bartolome in the same <i>barangay</i>. He stated that while he was already at Bartolome's house at about 10:30 in the evening, he could not sleep yet as Bartolome and Balano were still out of the house looking for a helper. He, therefore, decided to go out of the house and upon going outside, he saw the accused suddenly stab Balano once with a <i>pisao</i> (small bolo or knife).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Fearing for his life, Ismael instantly went back to Bartolome's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Defense's Version of Facts</b><br></center><br>Nestor, the first witness for the defense, stated that on December 30, 1993 at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, he was in <i>Sitio</i> Siwala, <i>Barangay</i> Rizal, La Paz, Leyte, picking up passengers as a motorcycle driver for hire. Gorgonio was one of the passengers at that time who he brought to <i>Barangay</i> Mag-aso, La Paz, Leyte. When they arrived at the house of Gorgonio, the latter went inside to get money to pay for his fare. Consequently, Nestor waited in his tricycle outside of Gorgonio's house. During such time, Nestor saw four people going down the house: the accused, Jeffrey Erro (Jeffrey), Tap-ing Fernandez (Tap-ing), and Balano. According to Nestor's testimony, the accused went to the side of the house to urinate and while so doing, he saw Tap-ing throw something at the accused, which caused him to bleed, and then they ran away. Thereafter, Balano attacked the accused, and as they grappled, the former was stabbed by the latter on the chest. The accused ran away after the incident happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Quite differently, the accused narrated that on December 30, 1993 at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, he was at the house of Gorgonio having a conversation with Leny Berones and Luna Berones. After an hour had passed, Gorgonio arrived with Nestor, Tap-ing, Balano and a certain Eddie who all came from the fiesta in <i>Barangay</i> Siwala. The accused stated that he went outside of the house to urinate when Tap-ing threw a stone at him, which hit him on the forehead and caused him to fall down. And when he saw Balano rushing towards him with an ice pick, he immediately stabbed him and then ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted the accused. The dispositive portion of its April 3, 2007 Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused [Allan] Gabrino guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime as [charged], this Court hereby sentences accused to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, ordering the accused to indemnify the offended party the amount of Sixty Five Thousand Pesos (P65,000.00) and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In finding for the prosecution and convicting the accused of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), the RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the witnesses of the prosecution. The RTC found that treachery was employed by the accused in killing Balano. The RTC further held that the justifying circumstance of incomplete self-defense under Art. 11(1) of the RPC could not be applied in the present case as the element of unlawful aggression is absent.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On August 28, 2008, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC <i>in toto</i>. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the herein appealed Decision convicting appellant Allan Gabrino of the crime of murder and imposing on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua and the payment to the victim's heirs of civil indemnity in the amount of P65,000.00 is hereby AFFIRMED <i>in toto. </i><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Hence, this appeal is before Us, with accused-appellant maintaining that the trial court erred in convicting him of the crime of murder, despite the fact that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accused-appellant also alleges that assuming that he could be made liable for Balano's death, the CA and the RTC erred in appreciating the qualifying circumstance of treachery. Another issue that he raises is the alleged existence of the mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></div><br>We sustain the conviction of accused-appellant.<br><br><b>Factual findings of the RTC should be given <br>credence and should therefore be respected</b><br><br>In the instant case, while both the prosecution and the defense agree on the date when the incident occurred and the fact that accused-appellant stabbed Balano, they conflict with the rest of the facts. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the RTC to appreciate the facts during trial and determine which information carries weight. And in doing so, the RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, with which the CA thereafter concurred. Accordingly, the RTC adopted the version of the prosecution as the correct factual finding.<br><br>We agree with the RTC's factual determination as affirmed by the CA.<br><br>We have held time and again that "the trial court's assessment of the credibility of a witness is entitled to great weight, sometimes even with finality."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As We have reiterated in the recent <i>People v. Combate</i>, where there is no showing that the trial court overlooked or misinterpreted some material facts or that it gravely abused its discretion, then We do not disturb and interfere with its assessment of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This is clearly because the judge in the trial court was the one who personally heard the accused and the witnesses, and observed their demeanor as well as the manner in which they testified during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Accordingly, the trial court, or more particularly, the RTC in this case, is in a better position to assess and weigh the evidence presented during trial.<br><br>In the present case, in giving weight to the prosecution's testimonies, there is not a slight indication that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion, or that it overlooked any material fact. In fact, no allegation to that effect ever came from the defense. There is, therefore, no reason to disturb the findings of fact made by the RTC and its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. To reiterate this time-honored doctrine and well-entrenched principle, We quote from <i>People v. Robert Dinglasan</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In the matter of credibility of witnesses, we reiterate the familiar and well-entrenched rule that the factual findings of the trial court should be respected. <b>The judge a quo was in a better position to pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses, having personally heard them when they testified and observed their deportment and manner of testifying. </b>It is doctrinally settled that the evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses by the trial court is received on appeal with the highest respect, <b>because it had the direct opportunity to observe the witnesses on the stand and detect if they were telling the truth. This assessment is binding upon the appellate court in the absence of a clear showing that it was reached arbitrarily or that the trial court had plainly overlooked certain facts of substance or value that if considered might affect the result of the case</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis Ours.)<br></blockquote><br><b>Treachery was committed by accused-appellant </b><br><br><blockquote>Art. 248 of the RPC defines murder as follows:<br><br>ART. 248. <i>Murder.</i><i>¾</i>Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua, </i>to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. <b>With treachery</b>, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense, or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity;<br><br>2. In consideration of a price, reward, or promise;<br><br>3. By means of inundation, fire, poison, explosion, shipwreck, stranding of a vessel, derailment or assault upon a railroad, fall of an airship, by means of motor vehicles, or with the use of any other means involving great waste and ruin;<br><br>4. On occasion of any calamities enumerated in the preceding paragraph, or of an earthquake, eruption of a volcano, destructive cyclone, epidemic, or any other public calamity;<br><br>5. With evident premeditation;<br><br>6. With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person or corpse. (Emphasis Ours.)</blockquote><br>For a person to be convicted of the offense of murder, the prosecution must prove that: (1) the offender killed the victim; and (2) that the killing was committed with any of the attendant circumstances under Art. 248 of the RPC, such as treachery. Particularly, <i>People v. Leozar Dela Cruz </i>enumerates the elements of murder, thus:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That a person was killed.</li><li>That the accused killed him.</li><li>That the killing was attended by <i>any </i>of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Art. 248.</li><li>The killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>In this case, it is undoubted that accused-appellant was the person who stabbed Balano and caused his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> And this killing is neither parricide nor infanticide. The question, therefore, to be resolved in this case is whether the killing was attended by treachery that would justify accused-appellant's conviction of murder.<br><br>Treachery exists when "the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> What is important in ascertaining the existence of treachery is the fact that the attack was made swiftly, deliberately, unexpectedly, and without a warning, thus affording the unsuspecting victim <b>no chance<i> </i></b>to resist or escape the attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In <i>People v. Lobino</i>,<i> </i>We held that a sudden attack against an unarmed victim constitutes treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is clear accused-appellant employed treachery in stabbing and killing Balano.<br><br>Relevant to the finding of treachery is the testimony of Bartolome, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Will you please tell this Honorable Court what was that unusual incident that happen?

Obviously, the unsuspecting Balano did not have the opportunity to resist the attack when accused-appellant, without warning, suddenly sprang out from behind the coconut tree and stabbed him. This undoubtedly constitutes treachery. The fact that Balano was able to run after he was stabbed by accused-appellant does not negate the fact the treachery was committed. As We held in <i>Lobino</i>,<i> </i>that the victim was still able to run after the first blow does not obliterate the treachery that was employed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Clearly therefore, the RTC and the CA did not err in finding that treachery was committed. Accordingly, accused-appellant's conviction of murder is proper.<br><br><b>Evident premeditation was not established as an aggravating circumstance</b><br><br>According to Art. 14(3) of the RPC, an offense is aggravated when it is committed with evident premeditation. Evident premeditation is present when the following requisites concur:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime;<br><br>(2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his determination; and<br><br>(3) sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In this case, evident premeditation was not established. First, there is showing, much less an indication, that accused-appellant had taken advantage of a sufficient time to carefully plan the killing of Balano; or that a considerable time has lapsed enough for accused-appellant to reflect upon the consequences of his act but nevertheless clung to his predetermined and well-crafted plan. The prosecution was only able to establish the fact of accused-appellant's sudden stabbing of Balano after he hid behind the coconut tree. This fact only successfully establishes the qualifying circumstance of treachery but not the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.<br><br>In appreciating the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, it is indispensable that the fact of planning the crime be established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Particularly, "[i]t is indispensable to show how and when the plan to kill was hatched or how much time had elapsed before it was carried out."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Accordingly, when there is no evidence showing how and when the accused planned to killing and how much time elapsed before it was carried out, evident premeditation cannot prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In this case, the prosecution failed to establish how and when the plan to kill Balano was devised. As this has not been clearly shown, consequently, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance.<br><br><b>Incomplete self-defense cannot be made <br>as a justifying circumstance, because the <br>element of unlawful aggression is absent</b><br><br>Accused-appellant's claim of incomplete self-defense cannot prosper. Art. 69 in relation to Art. 11 of the RPC explains when incomplete self-defense is permissible as a privileged mitigating circumstance, thus:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 69. <i>Penalty to be imposed when the crime committed is not wholly excusable</i>.¾A penalty lower by one or two degrees than that prescribed by law shall be imposed if the deed is not wholly excusable by reason of the lack of some of the conditions required to justify the same or to exempt from criminal liability in the several cases mentioned in articles 11 and 12, provided that the majority of such conditions be present. The courts shall impose the penalty in the period which may be deemed proper, in view of the number and nature of the conditions of exemption present or lacking.<br><br>ART. 11. <i>Justifying circumstances.</i><i>¾</i>The following do not incur any criminal liability:<br><br>1. Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances occur:<br><br><i>First. </i>Unlawful aggression;<br><br><i>Second. </i>Reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it;<br><br><i>Third. </i>Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.</blockquote><br>In order that incomplete self-defense could prosper as a privileged mitigating circumstance, unlawful aggression must exist. In <i>People v. Manulit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>People v. Mortera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><i> </i>and <i>Mendoza</i><i> v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><i> </i>We reiterated the well-settled rule that unlawful aggression is an indispensable requisite in appreciating an incomplete self-defense. It is any one of the two other elements of self-defense that could be wanting in an incomplete self-defense, i.e., reasonable necessity of the means to employed to prevent or repel it; or lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself; but it can never be unlawful aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Unlawful aggression is defined as "an actual physical assault, or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury, upon a person. In case of threat, it must be offensive and strong, positively showing the wrongful intent to cause injury. It presupposes actual, sudden, unexpected or imminent danger--not merely threatening and intimidating action. It is present only when the one attacked faces real and immediate threat to one's life."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In granting the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete self-defense, the burden to prove the elements during trial is incumbent upon the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It, therefore, follows that accused-appellant must prove before the RTC that there was indeed an unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, Balano.<br><br>In this case, accused-appellant failed to demonstrate the existence of unlawful aggression that would warrant an incomplete self-defense. As properly pointed out by the RTC, the testimony of accused-appellant on cross-examination establishes this failure, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0"

foregoing testimony of accused-appellant himself, it is clear that there was no unlawful aggression on the part of Balano that would justify accused-appellant to stab him. To justify an incomplete self-defense, the unlawful aggression must come from the victim himself against the person who resorted to self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In this case, if there was any, the unlawful aggression came from Tap-ing, who was the one who threw a stone and hit accused-appellant. The mere fact that Balano was alleged to be approaching accused-appellant with an ice pick does not constitute a real and imminent threat to one's life sufficient to create an unlawful aggression. Unlawful aggression requires more than that. In <i>People v. Arnante</i>, as it is here, the "mere perception of an impending attack is not sufficient to constitute unlawful aggression."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In this case, there was not even any attempt on the part of Balano to strike or stab accused-appellant. If at all and assuming to be true, Balano's demeanor could be deemed as an intimidating attitude that is certainly short of the imminence that could give rise to the existence of unlawful aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> What is more, it was not him, but Tap-ing who had previously hit accused-appellant. Accused-appellant's own testimony also negates any intention on the part of Balano to cause him any harm. As he testified, even after he stabbed Balano, the latter never retaliated and struck back. Instead, he stabbed the coconut tree notwithstanding the fact that accused-appellant was within his reach. Certainly, nothing in the facts indicate any circumstance that could justify the stabbing and the ultimate taking of Balano's life. Accordingly, as We are not convinced that there was an unlawful aggression in this case on the part of the victim, Balano, an incomplete self-defense is wanting and accused-appellant's offense, therefore, cannot be mitigated.<br><br><b>Accused is liable for damages and interest </b><br><br>The penalty of murder under Art. 248 of the RPC is <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death. Considering that the offense committed in this case is murder and there being neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, the RTC was correct in imposing the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>It is now settled that as a general rule, the Court awards civil indemnity, as well as moral and exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> And We have held in <i>People v.
