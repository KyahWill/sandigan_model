				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In resolving this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, we rely on two legal precepts.&nbsp; First, inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses that do not relate to the elements of the offense are too inconsequential to warrant a reversal of the trial court's judgment of conviction.&nbsp; Second, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be substantiated with clear and convincing evidence; otherwise, same cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>On October 22, 2002, two Informations charging petitioner Radito Aurelio y Reyes @ Jack (petitioner) with violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.)

Calag, Jr. (Chief Inspector Calag) of Task Force Magpalakas of the Philippine National Police instructed SPO2 Julius Bacero (SPO2 Bacero) to verify a report of rampant selling of <i>shabu</i> in M. Vasquez Street, Barangay Harapin ang Bukas<i>, </i>Mandaluyong City.&nbsp; At the same time, Chief Inspector Calag also contacted his informant and directed the latter to gather data that would substantiate the report.&nbsp; After 45 minutes, the informant called up and confirmed the reported illegal trade of <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>SPO2 Bacero, together with PO1 Ronald Jacuba (PO1 Jacuba), then proceeded to the area to conduct police surveillance.&nbsp; The informant directed them to the house where the sale of <i>shabu</i> was being conducted.&nbsp; Thereafter, the police officers returned to the station and reported their findings to Chief Inspector Calag, who immediately formed a buy-bust team composed of said police officers and members of the Mayor's Action Command.&nbsp; SPO2 Bacero was designated as the poseur-buyer.<br><br>At around 4:30 in the afternoon that day, the buy-bust team proceeded to the house of the petitioner.&nbsp; SPO2 Bacero knocked on the door and petitioner opened it.&nbsp; When SPO2 Bacero said "<i>Pare iiskor ako ng piso,</i>" petitioner told him to wait and went back inside the house.&nbsp; Meanwhile, SPO2 Bacero used his mobile phone to give PO1 Jacuba a ring - their pre-arranged signal for PO1 Jacuba to get closer to the house of petitioner.&nbsp; After three minutes, the petitioner asked SPO2 Bacero to enter and gave him a small sachet containing white crystalline substance.&nbsp; In exchange, SPO2 Bacero paid petitioner with marked money.<br><br>Thereafter, PO1 Jacuba arrived and, together with SPO2 Bacero, arrested the petitioner.&nbsp; They apprised him of his constitutional rights and frisked him.&nbsp; They recovered the marked money and another plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance from petitioner.<br><br>The police officers brought petitioner to the Mandaluyong Medical Center for medical check-up then proceeded to the police station for blotter and interrogation. The two sachets containing white crystalline substance recovered from the petitioner were sealed and marked as "JB-1" and "JB-2".&nbsp; The case was then turned over to SPO1 Jaime Masilang of the Criminal Investigation Unit of Mandaluyong City for investigation and referral to appropriate offices. He endorsed the two sachets to the crime laboratory for examination.&nbsp; The results of the examination conducted by Police Inspector Armand De Vera (Police Inspector De Vera) on the contents of the sachets tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, also known as <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.<br><br><b><i>The Version of the Petitioner</i></b><br><br>Petitioner denied the allegations against him and presented a completely different scenario.&nbsp; He testified that in the late afternoon of October 17, 2002, he was watching television in the house of his neighbor which is about 20 meters from his house.&nbsp; He went out to buy cigarettes, but suddenly two men grabbed him and told him to proceed to his house.&nbsp; They went to his house and stayed there for 15 minutes until they were joined by three more persons.&nbsp; After that he was taken to an alley and ordered to board a vehicle that took them to the <i>barangay</i> hall.&nbsp; Ten minutes later he was brought to the City Hall of Mandaluyong where a police officer questioned him on an alleged <i>shabu</i> incident.<br><br>Petitioner was then taken to the office of Task Force Magpalakas, located at the lower level of the Mandaluyong City Hall.&nbsp; Thereat, he saw SPO2 Bacero for the first time, who demanded P30,000.00 for his liberty.&nbsp; Unable to produce the money, he was charged in separate criminal informations with allegedly selling and possessing <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>Petitioner's long-time neighbor, Julieta Dulia (Julieta) and his sister, Teresita Aurelio (Teresita), corroborated his testimony.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On March 2, 2005, the trial court rendered its Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> convicting petitioner for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A.

These inaccuracies consist of the following: (a) the information regarding petitioner's illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> was allegedly received by the superior of SPO2 Bacero but surprisingly, same was not entered in the police blotter; (b) the participation of SPO2 Bacero in the test-buy with the petitioner is not clear, because if it is true that the test-buy yielded positive result, then SPO2 Bacero should have immediately arrested the petitioner; (c) SPO2 Bacero vacillated in his declaration that he has personal knowledge regarding petitioner's illegal activities; (d) the testimonies of SPO2 Bacero and PO1 Jacuba regarding the surveillance on the petitioner contradict each other; (e) the length of time SPO2 Bacero waited for the petitioner to return with the <i>shabu </i>is incredulous and cannot be ascertained if it was three minutes or three seconds; and, (f) the testimonies of said police officers on how the buy-bust money was recovered also diametrically oppose each other.<br><br>After a thorough review of the inconsistencies mentioned by the petitioner, we find that they do not relate to the elements of the offenses committed.&nbsp; Rather, they tend to focus on minor and insignificant matters.&nbsp; These inconsistencies do not detract from the fact that the prosecution's key witness who conducted the entrapment, identified the petitioner as the same person who sold the dangerous drug to him and from whose possession another plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i> was recovered.<br><br>Inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses that refer to trivial and insignificant details do not destroy their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Moreover, minor inconsistencies serve to strengthen rather than diminish the prosecution's case as they tend to erase any suspicion that the testimonies have been rehearsed thereby negating any misgiving that the same were perjured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Testimonies of witnesses need only to corroborate each other on important and relevant details concerning the principal occurrence.

Teresita is the sister of the petitioner while Julieta has been his neighbor for the past 10 years.&nbsp; Thus, their testimonies are necessarily suspect, considering they are petitioner's sibling and friend respectively. The testimonies of Julieta and Teresita even contradict each other as Teresita declared that five malefactors entered their home while Julieta stated that only two men went with petitioner inside his house. This inconsistency further diminishes the credibility of petitioner's witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>To rebut the prosecution's overwhelming evidence, the petitioner asserts the defenses of denial and frame-up.&nbsp; He denies selling <i>shabu</i> to SPO2 Bacero and possessing a sachet that contained the same drug during the purported entrapment.&nbsp; He insists that the <i>shabu</i> was planted by the police officers and that they attempted to extort money from him in exchange for his freedom.<br><br>We view with disfavor the defenses of denial and frame-up.&nbsp; Like the defense of alibi, said defenses can easily be concocted and are common and standard defenses employed in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drug Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> For these defenses to prosper there must be clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, petitioner failed to adduce sufficient proof in support of his defenses.&nbsp; There is simply no evidence to bolster his defenses other than his self-serving assertions.&nbsp; Moreover, we note that the petitioner did not file any complaint for frame-up or extortion against the buy-bust team.&nbsp; Such inaction belies his claim of frame-up and that the police officers were extorting money from him.&nbsp; His allegations therefore are simply implausible.<br><br>In the absence of evidence of any ill-motive on the part of the police officers who apprehended the petitioner, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The presumption that official duty has been regularly performed was not overcome since there was no proof showing that SPO2 Bacero and PO1 Jacuba were impelled by improper motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; "There is, therefore, no basis to suspect the veracity of their testimonies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing circumstances, a reversal of the trial court's judgment, as affirmed by the CA, is unwarranted. The inconsistencies that may be found in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are too insignificant to negate the fact that the petitioner indeed committed the offenses for which he was convicted. Moreover, the positive and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses cannot be overturned by the petitioner's defenses of denial and frame-up, which we frown upon in the absence of clear and convincing evidence.<br><br><b><i>The Proper Penalty</i></b><br><br>Having been duly established by the prosecution's evidence that petitioner violated Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A.
