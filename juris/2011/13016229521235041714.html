				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>This is an appeal from the March 25, 2010 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00020, which affirmed the August 26, 2004 Decision in Criminal Case No. CB-02-195 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 37 in Caibiran, Naval, Biliran.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC convicted accused Jimmy Alverio (Alverio) of rape.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The charge against Alverio stemmed from the following Information:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of June, 2002, at about 2:00 o'clock early dawn, more or less, at [PPP],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, while [AAA] was on her way to her grandmother's house from the benefit dance, herein accused, a cousin of herein complainant, with lewd designs, and by means of force and intimidation, get hold of her arm and did then and there drag her to the back of the barangay hall, by holding her hair and forcibly laid her to the ground, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously poked her a short bladed weapon known as `pisao' forcibly took off her pants and panty and succeeded in having carnal knowledge with her against her will to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On July 3, 2003, Alverio, with the assistance of his counsel <i>de oficio</i>, was arraigned, and he pleaded "not guilty" to the charge against him. After the pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>During the trial, the prosecution offered the sole testimony of the private complainant. On the other hand, the defense presented accused Alverio, Henry Toledo (Toledo), and Lily Toledo as its witnesses.<br><br><center><b>The Prosecution's Version of Facts</b><br></center><br>In the afternoon of June 2, 2002, AAA, along with her friends Belen Sabanag (Sabanag) and Aileen Sinangote (Sinangote), went to the house of her grandmother to attend a dance event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> At around 8:30 in the evening, they proceeded to the dance hall because the dance would start at around 9 o'clock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> During the dance, Sabanag and Sinangote danced with Alverio but AAA did not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At 2 o'clock in the morning of June 3, 2002, AAA noticed that her friends were no longer at the dance so she decided to go home to her grandmother's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>As she was nearing the <i>barangay</i> hall, Alverio suddenly appeared and took hold of AAA. She tried to resist him but he was too strong and he managed to pull her away. AAA started to cry while she was being dragged towards the back of the <i>barangay</i> hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> There, Alverio held her hair, undressed her, and started to kiss her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> AAA kept on resisting and even punched Alverio after he kissed her, at which point, Alverio told her that it was painful and that he might retaliate if she continued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; This caused AAA to stop resisting and Alverio then proceeded to insert his penis in her vagina repeatedly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After having carnal knowledge with her, Alverio stood up and put on his clothes. He warned AAA that if she told anyone about what happened, he will kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> After threatening her, he left.<br><br>During this entire incident, Alverio was armed with a knife which he used to poke AAA's side.<br><br>Dazed, AAA could not muster enough strength to go home. She just sat on the road beside the <i>barangay</i> hall until 5 o'clock in the morning when her Uncle Intoy passed by. He brought her home to her parents but she did not tell him anything. Upon reaching home, AAA told her parents about what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></center><br>Alverio's defense, on the other hand, was confined to his denial of the accusation and an alibi, to wit:<br><br>Sometime around 7:30 in the evening of June 2, 2002, Alverio recalled that he was in the <i>barangay</i> chapel with his friend, Toledo, waiting for the dance to begin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The dance hall was just adjacent to the <i>barangay </i>chapel. At 8:30 in the evening, the dance started. He danced with some persons whose names he could no longer recall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> But he categorically remembered that he did not see AAA in the dance area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>At 12:00 midnight, Alverio and Toledo walked home to Toledo's house, where Alverio was staying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On their way home, they passed by the <i>barangay</i> hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Upon reaching home, they slept and woke up at 5:30 in the morning of June 3, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In his testimony, Alverio admitted that he and AAA are cousins, their mothers being sisters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>His testimony was corroborated by Toledo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and Toledo's mother, Lily Toledo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted Alverio. The dispositive portion of its August 26, 2004 Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused JIMMY ALVERIO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape. With no aggravating or mitigating circumstance, he is sentenced to the lesser penalty of reclusion perpetua; to indemnify [AAA] Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos; and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On appeal to the CA, Alverio disputed the trial court's finding of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. He argued that the presumption of innocence should prevail especially considering that the prosecution only had a single testimony to support the charge of rape.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></center><br>On March 25, 2010, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 37, Caibiran, Naval, Biliran in Criminal Case No. CB-02-195 convicting the accused-appellant is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that he is also hereby adjudged liable to pay the victim the amount of Php50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>His penalty of reclusion perpetua and the award of civil indemnity of Php50,000.00 stands.<br><br>Costs against the accused-appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>Alverio now comes before this Court with the lone assignment of error contending that "[t]he trial court gravely erred in finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>We sustain Alverio's conviction.<br><br>In his <i>Brief</i>, Alverio argues that the trial court should have taken the lone testimony of the complainant with caution and that the testimony should have been weighed carefully, taking into consideration the constitutional precept that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused must be presumed innocent unless the contrary is proved.<br><br>Alverio raises three (3) grounds in support of his argument. First, he assails the trial court for giving credence to the sole testimony of the victim. He claims that the prosecution should have presented other witnesses to corroborate the testimony of the victim. Second, he contends that the medical certificate presented as evidence was not testified to by the signatory himself and should therefore not be considered as corroborative evidence. Lastly, he claims that the trial court gravely erred in convicting him of the crime of rape for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>After a careful perusal of the records of this case, however, the Court is satisfied that the prosecution's evidence sufficiently established Alverio's guilt with moral certainty.<br><br>In <i>People v. Malate</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We reiterated the principles with which courts are guided in determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in rape cases, viz:<br><br><blockquote>x x x (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove the charge; (2) considering that, in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence of the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<br></blockquote><br>Moreover, in that same case, this Court held that "in cases involving the prosecution for forcible rape x x x corroboration of the victim's testimony is not a necessary condition to a conviction for rape where the victim's testimony is credible, or clear and convincing or sufficient to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As such, appellate courts generally do not disturb the findings of the trial court with regard to the assessment of the credibility of witnesses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the reason being that the trial court has the "unique opportunity to observe the witnesses first hand and note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> More importantly, courts generally give full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially one who is only a minor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The exceptions to this rule are when the trial court's findings of facts and conclusions are not supported by the evidence on record, or when certain facts of substance and value likely to change the outcome of the case have been overlooked by the lower court, or when the assailed decision is based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> However, this Court finds none of these exceptions present in the instant case.<br><br>The victim testified in a steadfast and straightforward manner, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

Thus, We find no reason to overturn the findings of the trial court.<br><br>In addition, Alverio submits that although the medical certificate was presented as evidence, its contents were never testified to by the signatory himself and, as such, cannot be considered as corroborative of the claim of the victim that she was raped.<br><br>Such argument, however, cannot prosper. Medical evidence is dispensable and merely corroborative in proving the crime of rape. Besides, a medical certificate is not even necessary to prove the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The gravamen of rape is carnal knowledge of a woman through force and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The elements needed to prove the crime of rape under paragraph 1(a) of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code are: (1) the offender is a man; (2) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (3) the act is accomplished by using force or intimidation. All these elements were sufficiently proved by the prosecution. The testimony of AAA overwhelmingly proves that Alverio raped her with the use of force and intimidation.<br><br>Furthermore, Alverio's defense of alibi cannot stand versus the positive identification of AAA. Nothing is more settled in criminal law jurisprudence than the rule that alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony and identification of the accused by the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, We find that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proving the guilt of Alverio beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>As to the award of damages, the CA was correct in awarding PhP 50,000 as moral damages without need of proof. However, in line with current jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> an additional award of PhP 30,000 as exemplary damages should likewise be given, as well as interest of six percent (6%) per annum on all damages awarded from the finality of judgment until fully paid.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The CA Decision in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00020 finding accused-appellant Jimmy Alverio guilty of the crime charged is <b>AFFIRMED </b>with<b> MODIFICATION</b>. As modified, the ruling of the trial court should read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused JIMMY ALVERIO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape. With no aggravating or mitigating circumstance, he is sentenced to the lesser penalty of reclusion perpetua; to pay [AAA] Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) as moral damages and Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages with interest of six percent (6%) per annum on all awards of damages from the finality of judgment until fully paid; and to pay the costs.</blockquote><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Del Castillo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perez, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 2-10.
