				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For resolution is the <u>Motion for Reconsideration and Clarification</u> of Daniel T. So (So) from the Court's Decision of April 14, 2010 in these consolidated cases which disposed as follows:<br><br>Per Raffle dated June 2, 2010.<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals Decision of April 18, 2008 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>. Food Fest is ORDERED to pay So liquidated damages in the amount equivalent to 25% of the total sum due and demandable. Further, <u>So is ORDERED to pay attorney's fees</u> in the amount equivalent to 25% of the total sum due and demandable. In all other respects, the decision is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>, (emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>After passing on the arguments raised in the Motion for Reconsideration, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb the Court's Decision. <br><br>Clarification is in order, however, respecting the second paragraph of the above-quoted dispositive portion of the Decision which <u>ordered So to pay attorney's fees</u> in the amount equivalent to 25% of the total sum due and demandable. The relevant portion of this Court's Decision - basis of the order reads: <br><br><blockquote>This Court notes that the appellate court did not award liquidated damages in contravention of the contract.&nbsp; <u>As for the appellate court's award of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees, the contractual stipulation should prevail</u>, (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The relevant portion of the <u>Lease Contract</u> between So and Food Fest provides: <br><br><blockquote>23.1. <u>Should LESSOR[-So] be compelled to seek judicial relief against LESSEE the latter shall, in addition to any other claim for damages pay</u> as liquidated damages <u>to LESSOR[-So]</u> an amount equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount due, but in no case less than P500.00: and an <u>attorney's fee</u> in the amount equivalent to 25% of the amount claimed but in no case less than P3,000.00 as well as all <u>expenses of litigation</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The general rule is that where there is a conflict between the dispositive portion or the <i>follo</i> and the body of the decision, the <i>fallo</i> controls. This rule rests on the theory that the <i>fallo</i> is the final order while the opinion in the body is merely a statement ordering nothing. However, where the inevitable conclusion from the body of the decision is so clear as to show that there was a mistake in the dispositive portion, the body of the decision will prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <br><br>Given the above-quoted portion of the Decision <i>vis-a-vis</i> the above quoted Lease Contract between the parties, it should be Food Fest Land, Inc., as lessee, not So, the lessor, who should be <b>ORDERED</b> to pay attorney's fees as stipulated in the contract. <br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the dispositive portion of the Court's Decision of April 14, 2010 is <i>AMENDED</i> to read as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals Decision of April 18, 2008 is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>. <br><br>Food Fest is ORDERED to pay So liquidated damages in the amount equivalent to 25% of the total sum due and demandable.&nbsp; Further, <u>Food Fest is ORDERED</u> to pay <u>So</u> attorney's fees in the amount equivalent to 25% of the total sum due and demandable. In all other respects, the decision is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br></blockquote><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Bersamin, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>Per raffle dated June2, 2010.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, p. 42<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Asian Center for Career and Employment System and Services, Inc. v.
