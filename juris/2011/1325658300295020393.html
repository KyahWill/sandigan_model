Maria Teresa Gemma Catacutan (Gemma) was charged before the RTC for Infringement under Section 155 in relation to Section 170 of Republic Act No. 8293 or the Intellectual Property Code.&nbsp; The accusatory portion of the Information reads:<br><br><blockquote>That sometime in September 25, 1998 and prior thereto at Sta. Cruz, Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then and there, knowingly, maliciously, unlawfully and feloniously engage in the distribution, sale, [and] offering for sale of counterfeit Marlboro cigarettes which had caused confusion, deceiving the public that such cigarettes [were] Marlboro cigarettes and those of the Telengtan Brothers and Sons, Inc., doing business under the style of La Suerte Cigar and Cigarettes Factory, the exclusive manufacturer of Marlboro Cigarette in the Philippines and that of Philip Morris Products, Inc. (PMP7) the registered owner and proprietor of the MARLBORO trademark together with the devices, including the famous-Root Device, to their damage and prejudice, without the accused seeking their permit or authority to manufacture and distribute the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>On August 1, 2000, Judge Rebecca G.

Alonzo Q. Ancheta, a senior law partner at Quasha Law Office, who testified that as the duly appointed Attorney-in-Fact of PMPI, he was in charge of the EIIB search operation in the subject premises.&nbsp; Atty. Ancheta said that while he was not personally present during the implementation of the search warrant, he sent Atty. Leonardo Salvador, who constantly reported the developments to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The facts, as succinctly summarized by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>On September 10, 1998, Jesse S. Lara, then Senior Investigator III at the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Unit of the Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau (EIIB), Department of Finance, received reliable information that counterfeit “Marlboro” cigarettes were being distributed and sold by two (2) Chinese nationals, Johnny Sia and Jessie Concepcion, in the areas of Tondo, Binondo, Sta. Cruz and Quiapo, Manila.&nbsp; A mission team formed by EIIB, including Lara, conducted surveillance operation to verify the report.&nbsp; EIIB agents Leonardo Villanueva and Jigo Madrigal did a&nbsp; “test-buy” on the different sari-sari stores of Manila located in Quiapo, Tondo, Sta. Cruz and Blumentritt areas and took samples of “Marlboro” cigarettes sold therein.&nbsp; During the surveillance, the container van delivering the “Marlboro” packed in black plastic bags was seen parked at 1677 Bulacan corner Hizon Streets, Sta. Cruz, Manila [(the subject premises)].&nbsp; Upon inquiry from the Barangay Chairman, they also learned that the place is owned by a certain Mr. Jackson Ong.<br><br>The EIIB team coordinated with officers of Philip Morris, Inc., owner of the trademark Marlboro Label in the Philippines duly registered with the Philippine Patents Office and subsequently with the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) since 1956.&nbsp; Initial examination made by Philip Morris, Inc. on those random sample purchases revealed that the cigarettes were indeed fake products unauthorized by the company.&nbsp; With official indorsement by the EIIB, Senior Investigator Lara filed an application for search warrant before the Regional Trial Court of Dasmariñas, Cavite, Branch 90.<br><br>On September 24, 1998, Executive Judge Dolores L. Español issued a search warrant after finding probable cause to believe that Mr. Jackson Ong has in his possession/control in the premises located at 1675-1677 Bulacan St. cor. M. Hizon St., Sta. Cruz, Manila, the following properties:<br><br><blockquote>“Substantial number of fake locally made and imported fake cigarettes bearing the Marlboro brand, together with the corresponding labels, cartons, boxes and other packaging as well as receipts, invoices and other documents relative to the purchase, sale, and distribution of the aforesaid fake Marlboro cigarettes.”</blockquote><br>On September 25, 1998, the EIIB team led by Senior Investigator Lara implemented the search warrant, together with SPO2 Rommel P. Sese of the Western Police District (WPD) as representative of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Barangay Chairman Ernesto Traje, Sr., Barangay Kagawad Vivian V. Rallonza and Atty. Leonardo P. Salvador who was sent by [Quasha Peña &amp; Nolasco Law Office,] the law firm engaged by Philip Morris, Inc.&nbsp; They proceeded to the subject premises but Jackson Ong, the alleged owner, was not there.&nbsp; It was accused, who is supposedly either the spouse or common-law wife of Jackson Ong, who entertained them.&nbsp; At first, accused refused to allow them entry into the premises but eventually the team was able to search the premises and found Marlboro cigarettes stocked in several boxes containing fifty (50) reams inside each box which were packed in black plastic sacks like in “balikbayan boxes.”&nbsp; The “Inventory” and “Certification In the Conduct of Search” were duly accomplished and signed by the members of the EIIB and the other representatives present during the actual search (SPO2 Sese, Jess Lara, Traje, Sr., Henry Mariano, Isidro Burgos and Atty. Salvador).&nbsp; Accused signed her name in the said documents as “Gemma Ong,” as the Owner/Representative, while a certain employee, Girlie Cantillo, also signed as witness.<br><br>On September 28, 1998, a Return of Search Warrant was submitted by the EIIB to the issuing court stating that the articles seized pursuant to the warrant were stored in the premises of the EIIB and requesting that EIIB be granted temporary custody of the goods.&nbsp; Acting on the Urgent Motion To Transfer Custody of Confiscated Articles filed by Philip Morris Products, Inc. (PMPI) of Virginia, U.S.A., Executive Judge Dolores L. Español ordered the custody of the seized goods transferred from EIIB to PMPI c/o Quasha Ancheta Peña and Nolasco Law Office, the Attorney-in-Fact of PMPI.&nbsp; Judge Español subsequently also issued an order dated October 15, 1998 authorizing PMPI to secure and take out samples of the unauthorized products from the confiscated cartons/boxes of Marlboro cigarettes which are stored at Four Winds Phils. Inc. warehouse located at No. 2241 Pasong Tamo Extension, Makati City under the direct and personal control and supervision of Sheriff IV Tomas C. Azurin.&nbsp; PMPI had earlier sought such order from the court for the purpose of laboratory analysis and scientific testing of the samples from the confiscated cigarettes.<br><br>On the basis of the results of the examination conducted by PMPI on the samples obtained from the confiscated boxes of cigarettes bearing the Marlboro brand, which confirmed the same to be unauthorized products and not genuine Marlboro cigarettes, the EIIB filed a case for Violation of Sections 155 and 168 in relation to Section 170 of Republic Act No. 8293 against Jackson Ong who is not an authorized distributor of Marlboro products in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>After the prosecution rested its case, the defense filed a Demurrer to Evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which the RTC denied on March 26, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; The defense moved for a reconsideration of this order but the same was denied on April 22, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Gemma, as the lone witness for the defense, then took the witness stand.&nbsp; She said that she is married to Co Yok Piao, a Chinese national, but she still uses her maiden name Catacutan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; She denied that she is the Gemma Ong accused in this case.&nbsp; She testified that she was arrested on August 4, 2000, without the arresting officers asking for her name.&nbsp; She said that when she pleaded to be released, she was instructed to post a cash bond, which she did in the amount of P12,000.00.&nbsp; Gemma averred that when she posted her bond and signed her certificate of arraignment, she did so under her real name Maria Teresa Gemma Catacutan, as opposed to the signatures in the Inventory and Certification in the Conduct of Search (search documents), which she denied signing.&nbsp; She claimed that she was not able to bring up her defense of mistaken identity early on as she did not know when the proper time to raise it was.&nbsp; She avowed that she was not interrogated by the police prior to her arrest, despite the two-year gap between it and the search of the subject premises.&nbsp; She alleged that she did not know Jackson Ong and that the prosecution witnesses, whom she first saw during her trial, couldn’t even point to her as the person present during the raid when they testified in court.&nbsp; Gemma further asseverated that while she could not remember where she was on September 25, 1998, she was sure that she was not at the subject premises on that date.&nbsp; Gemma presented her Identification Card issued by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) to show that she is a dentist by profession, although she claimed that she is a businessperson in practice.&nbsp; She said that she used to buy and sell gear fabrics, t-shirts, truck materials, and real estate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> under the business name “Fascinate Trading” based in Bulacan Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila, but that it had ceased operations in February 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Gemma denied ever having engaged in the manufacture and sale of any kind of cigarettes and claimed that she could not even distinguish between a fake and a genuine Marlboro cigarette.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On September 30, 2003, the RTC convicted Gemma of the crime as charged.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, this Court finds accused Gemma Catacutan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 155 in relation to Section 170 of Republic Act No. 8293 and hereby sentences her to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of two (2) years and to pay a fine of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos.<br><br>Accused is further directed to indemnify private complainant the sum of US$4,069.12 or its peso equivalent, as actual damages.<br><br>The records of the case as against Jackson Ong is hereby ordered archived pending his arrest.<br><br>With costs against accused Gemma Catacutan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>In resolving the case, the RTC narrowed down the issue to whether Gemma Catacutan was the same accused identified as Gemma Ong.&nbsp; The RTC answered this in the affirmative as it found Gemma’s defense of mistaken identity as untenable, especially since she claimed to be a professional.&nbsp; The RTC explained:<br><br><blockquote>Ranged against the positive and forthright declaration of the prosecution witnesses, the mere uncorroborated and self-serving denials of the accused cannot stand.&nbsp; (People vs. Hortaleza, 258 SCRA 201)<br><br>We note in disbelief that it was only in the hearing of November 26, 2001, that accused’[s] former lawyer manifested that accused is known as Gemma Catacutan never as Gemma Ong (tsn, November 26, 2001, p. 3) and as admitted by her, she never revealed her true identity when arrested, when she posted her bail bond and even during her arraignment.<br><br>She could have protested at the time of her arrest that they were arresting the wrong person but this she did not do.&nbsp; She proceeded to post a bond for her provisional liberty, hired a lawyer to defend her but failed to divulge the very information that could have led to an early dismissal of the case, if true.<br><br>Her pretensions of ignorance as to the proper stage of when to explain (tsn, May 26, 2003), p. 13 can hardly be given credit.&nbsp; A dentist by profession, it is utterly incredible that she remained meek all through-out her arrest and the posting of her bail bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC also unfurled the fact that while Gemma claimed to have never engaged in the sale and manufacture of Marlboro cigarettes, the address of her business “Fascinate Trading” is registered as 1677 Bulacan Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila, the same property raided by the EIIB that contained the counterfeit cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Gemma appealed the RTC’s decision to the Court of Appeals based on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE LOWER COURT GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN CONVICTING DR.

Ancheta, readily reveals that they concentrated on the facts and events leading up to the search and seizure of the contraband materials from the subject premises.&nbsp; They not only failed to mention Gemma Ong’s presence there, but they also failed to mention the other witnesses’ names and presence there as well.&nbsp; Although this might appear to be a mistake on the part of a known and established law firm like the Quasha Law Office, the firm immediately sought to rectify this by having the affidavits of Slagle, Atty. Ancheta, and Lara amended.<br><br>If it were true that Gemma was not at the subject premises at all on September 25, 1998, then she should have grabbed every chance to correct this notion and expose this mistake before she was arrested.&nbsp; She could have brought up her defense of mistaken identity or absence at the raid in the preliminary investigation conducted prior to the issuance of her warrant of arrest; but instead, she chose to ignore her subpoena and disregard the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Even then, Gemma had the opportunity to raise the fact that she was not Gemma Ong; not only during her arrest, but also during the posting of the cash bond for her bail, and more importantly, during her arraignment, <b>when she was asked if she understood the charges against her</b>.&nbsp; Gemma also knew that the Information was filed against her on the basis of the amended affidavits, thus, she could have filed a motion to quash the information before she entered her plea, or asked that a reinvestigation be conducted.&nbsp; However, all these Gemma failed to do.&nbsp; We agree with the RTC that it is highly unlikely that a person of her stature and educational attainment would be so meek and timid that she failed to protest against her being wrongly identified, accused, arrested, and potentially imprisoned.&nbsp; If what she says were true, she would not have agreed to post bail or to be arraigned without at the very least, bringing up the fact that she was not the Gemma Ong the police officers were looking for.&nbsp; In addition, her own lawyer, Atty. Maglinao, brought up the fact that she was not Gemma Ong, only for the purpose of correcting the Information, and not to contest it, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WITNESS ROGER SHERMAN SLAGLE UNDER THE SAME OATH FOR CONTINUATION OF DIRECT EXAMINATION BY:<br><br>ATTY. ERESE:<br><br>With the kind permission of the hon. court.<br><br>COURT: Proceed.<br><br>ATTY. MAGLINAO:<br><br>I would just want to be on record that my client, Gemma Catacutan has never been known as Gemma Ong because her real name is Gemma Catacutan.<br><br>COURT: Do you have any objection to the amendment of the information?<br><br>ATTY. MAGLINAO:<br><br>No, your Honor.&nbsp; May we request to correct the information from Gemma Ong to Gemma Catacutan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>Gemma further accuses the prosecution witnesses of falsely testifying and of perjuring themselves just so they can satisfy a big client like PMPI by showing that somebody had been arrested for counterfeiting its cigarettes.&nbsp; The crimes Gemma is imputing on these witnesses are serious crimes, and in the absence of concrete and convincing evidence, this Court could not believe her mere allegations that imply that these people would destroy someone’s life just so they can please a client, more so over mere cigarettes.&nbsp; In <i>Principio v. Hon. Barrientos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> we said:<br><br><blockquote>Bad faith is never presumed while good faith is always presumed and the chapter on Human Relations of the Civil Code directs every person, inter alia, to observe good faith, which springs from the fountain of good conscience.&nbsp; Therefore, he who claims bad faith must prove it.&nbsp; For one to be in bad faith, the same must be “evident.”&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>The prosecution witnesses, contrary to Gemma’s claim, had positively identified her as the person who initially refused the search team entrance, then later acquiesced to the search operations.&nbsp; Slagle explained that even though he mentioned Gemma only in his amended affidavit, he was sure that she was at the subject premises on the day that they searched it:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Testimony of Roger Sherman Slagle</span><br></div><br><blockquote>ATTY.
