Nos. 8921 and 8922, respectively, both situated at Talisay, Cebu, and Lot No. 1328-C covered by T.C.T. No. 24576 situated at Cebu City, for the amount of Thirty-One Thousand Four Hundred Thirty Pesos (P31,430.00). Thereafter, a Final Deed of Sale dated May 27, 1991 in favor of the Philippine National Bank was also issued and Transfer Certificate of Title No. 24576 for Lot 1328-C (corrected to 1323-C) was cancelled and a new certificate of title, TCT 119848 was issued in the name of PNB on August 26, 1991.<br><br>This prompted plaintiffs-appellees to file the instant complaint seeking the quieting of their supposed title to the subject properties, declaratory relief, cancellation of TCT and reconveyance with temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs alleged that the subsequent annotations on the titles are subject to the prior annotation of their liens and encumbrances. Plaintiffs further contended that the subsequent writs and processes annotated on the titles are all null and void for want of valid service upon RISCO and on them, as stockholders. They argued that the Final Deed of Sale and TCT No. 119848 are null and void as these were issued only after 28 years and that any right which PNB may have over the properties had long become stale.<br><br>Defendant PNB on the other hand countered that plaintiffs have no right of action for quieting of title since the order of the court directing the issuance of titles to PNB had already become final and executory and their validity cannot be attacked except in a direct proceeding for their annulment. Defendant further asserted that plaintiffs, as mere stockholders of RISCO do not have any legal or equitable right over the properties of the corporation. PNB posited that even if plaintiff's monetary lien had not expired, their only recourse was to require the reimbursement or refund of their contribution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, filed a Manifestation and Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on October 5, 1998.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court rendered the November 18, 1998 Decision, which ruled against PNB on the basis that there was an express trust created over the subject properties whereby RISCO was the trustee and the stockholders, Aznar,<i> et al.</i>, were the beneficiaries or the <i>cestui que trust</i>.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the said ruling reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Declaring the Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Board of Directors of RISCO approved on March 14, 1961 (Annex "E," Complaint) annotated on the titles to subject properties on May 15, 1962 as an express trust whereby RISCO was a mere trustee and the above-mentioned stockholders as beneficiaries being the true and lawful owners of Lots 3597, 7380 and 1323;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">b) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Declaring all the subsequent annotations of court writs and processes, to wit: Entry No. 7416-V-4-D.B., 7417-V-4-D.B., 7512-V-4-D.B., and 7513-V-4-D.B. in TCT No. 8921 for Lot 3597 and TCT No. 8922 for Lot 7380; Entry No. 1660-V-7-D.B., Entry No. 1661-V-7-D.B., Entry No. 1861-V-7-D.B., Entry No. 1862-V-7-D.B., Entry No. 4329-V-7-D.B., Entry No. 3761-V-7-D.B. and Entry No. 26522 v. 34, D.B. on TCT No. 24576 for Lot 1323-C, and all other subsequent annotations thereon in favor of third persons, as null and void;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">c) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Directing the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu and/or the Register of Deeds of Cebu City, as the case may be, to cancel all these annotations mentioned in paragraph b) above the titles;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">d) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Directing the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu to cancel and/or annul TCTs Nos. 8921 and 8922 in the name of RISCO, and to issue another titles in the names of the plaintiffs; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">e)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Directing Philippine National Bank to reconvey TCT No. 119848 in favor of the plaintiffs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote><br>PNB appealed the adverse ruling to the Court of Appeals which, in its September 29, 2005 Decision, set aside the judgment of the trial court. Although the Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that a judgment on the pleadings was proper, the appellate court opined that the monetary contributions made by Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, to RISCO can only be characterized as a loan secured by a lien on the subject lots, rather than an express trust.&nbsp; Thus, it directed PNB to pay Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, the amount of their contributions plus legal interest from the time of acquisition of the property until finality of judgment.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed Judgment is hereby SET ASIDE.<br><br>A new judgment is rendered ordering Philippine National Bank to pay plaintiffs-appellees the amount of their lien based on the <i>Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Board of Directors </i>duly annotated on the titles, plus legal interests from the time of appellants' acquisition of the subject properties until the finality of this judgment.<br><br>All other claims of the plaintiffs-appellees are hereby DISMISSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Both parties moved for reconsideration but these were denied by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Hence, each party filed with this Court their respective petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which were consolidated in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated October 2, 2006.<br><br>In PNB's petition, docketed as G.R.

No. 171805, PNB argues that a judgment on the pleadings was not proper because its Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which it filed during the trial court proceedings of this case, tendered genuine issues of fact since it did not only deny material allegations in Aznar, <i>et al.</i>'s Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> but also set up special and affirmative defenses.&nbsp; Furthermore, PNB maintains that, by virtue of the trial court's judgment on the pleadings, it was denied its right to present evidence and, therefore, it was denied due process.<br><br>The contention is meritorious.<br><br>The legal basis for rendering a judgment on the pleadings can be found in Section 1, Rule 34 of the Rules of Court which states that "[w]here an answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading, the court may, on motion of that party, direct judgment on such pleading. x x x."<br><br>Judgment on the pleadings is, therefore, based exclusively upon the allegations appearing in the pleadings of the parties and the annexes, if any, without consideration of any evidence <i>aliunde</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; However, when it appears that not all the material allegations of the complaint were admitted in the answer for some of them were either denied or disputed, and the defendant has set up certain special defenses which, if proven, would have the effect of nullifying plaintiff's main cause of action, judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the Court of Appeals justified the trial court's resort to a judgment on the pleadings in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>Perusal of the complaint, particularly, Paragraph 7 thereof reveals:<br><br><blockquote>"7. That in their desire to rehabilitate RISCO, the above-named stockholders contributed a total amount of PhP212,720.00 which was used in the purchase of the above-described parcels of land, which amount constituted liens and encumbrances on subject properties in favor of the above-named stockholders as annotated in the titles adverted to above, pursuant to the Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Board of Directors of RISCO approved on March 14, 1961, a copy of which is hereto attached as Annex "E".<br></blockquote><br>On the other hand, defendant in its Answer, admitted the aforequoted allegation with the qualification that the amount put up by the stockholders was "used as part payment" for the properties. Defendant further averred that plaintiff's liens and encumbrances annotated on the titles issued to RISCO constituted as "loan from the stockholders to pay part of the purchase price of the properties" and "was a personal obligation of RISCO and was thus not a claim adverse to the ownership rights of the corporation." With these averments, We do not find error on the part of the trial court in rendering a judgment on the pleadings. For one, the qualification made by defendant in its answer is not sufficient to controvert the allegations raised in the complaint. As to defendants' contention that the money contributed by plaintiffs was in fact a "loan" from the stockholders, reference can be made to the Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Board of Directors, from which plaintiffs-appellees anchored their complaint, in order to ascertain the true nature of their claim over the properties. Thus, the issues raised by the parties can be resolved on the basis of their respective pleadings and the annexes attached thereto and do not require further presentation of evidence <i>aliunde</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>However, a careful reading of Aznar, <i>et al.</i>'s Complaint and of PNB's Answer would reveal that both parties raised several claims and defenses, respectively, other than what was cited by the Court of Appeals, which requires the presentation of evidence for resolution, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td> <div align="CENTER">Complaint (Aznar, <i>et al.</i>) </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER">Answer (PNB) </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">11.

When the language of the contract is explicit leaving no doubt as to the intention of the drafters thereof, the courts may not read into it any other intention that would contradict its plain import.<br><br>The term <b>lien</b> as used in the Minutes is defined as <i>"a discharge on property usually for the payment of some debt or obligation. A lien is a qualified right or a proprietary interest which may be exercised over the property of another. It is a right which the law gives to have a debt satisfied out of a particular thing. It signifies a legal claim or charge on property; whether real or personal, as a <b>collateral or security</b> for the payment of some debt or obligation."</i> Hence, from the use of the word "lien" in the Minutes, We find that the money contributed by plaintiffs-appellees was in the nature of a loan, secured by their liens and interests duly annotated on the titles. The annotation of their lien serves only as collateral and does not in any way vest ownership of property to plaintiffs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>We are not persuaded by the contention of <i>Aznar</i>, <i>et al</i>., that the language of the subject Minutes created an express trust.<br><br>Trust is the right to the beneficial enjoyment of property, the legal title to which is vested in another.&nbsp; It is a fiduciary relationship that obliges the trustee to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiary.&nbsp; Trust relations between parties may either be express or implied.&nbsp; An express trust is created by the intention of the trustor or of the parties.&nbsp; An implied trust comes into being by operation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Express trusts, sometimes referred to as direct trusts, are intentionally created by the direct and positive acts of the settlor or the trustor - by some writing, deed, or will or oral declaration.&nbsp; It is created not necessarily by some written words, but by the direct and positive acts of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This is in consonance with Article 1444 of the Civil Code, which states that "[n]o particular words are required for the creation of an express trust, it being sufficient that a trust is clearly intended."<br><br>In other words, the creation of an express trust must be manifested with reasonable certainty and cannot be inferred from loose and vague declarations or from ambiguous circumstances susceptible of other interpretations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>No such reasonable certitude in the creation of an express trust obtains in the case at bar.&nbsp; In fact, a careful scrutiny of the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms used in the Minutes does not offer any indication that the parties thereto intended that Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, become beneficiaries under an express trust and that RISCO serve as trustor.<br><br>Indeed, we find that Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, have no right to ask for the quieting of title of the properties at issue because they have no legal and/or equitable rights over the properties that are derived from the previous registered owner which is RISCO, the pertinent provision of the law is Section 2 of the Corporation Code (<i>Batas Pambansa Blg. 68</i>), which states that "[a] corporation is an artificial being created by operation of law, having the right of succession and the powers, attributes and properties expressly authorized by law or incident to its existence."<br><br>As a consequence thereof, a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from those of its stockholders and other corporations to which it may be connected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, we had previously ruled in <i>Magsaysay-Labrador v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that the interest of the stockholders over the properties of the corporation is merely inchoate and therefore does not entitle them to intervene in litigation involving corporate property, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Here, the interest, if it exists at all, of petitioners-movants is indirect, contingent, remote, conjectural, consequential and collateral. At the very least, their interest is purely inchoate, or in sheer expectancy of a right in the management of the corporation and to share in the profits thereof and in the properties and assets thereof on dissolution, after payment of the corporate debts and obligations.<br><br>While a share of stock represents a proportionate or aliquot interest in the property of the corporation, it does not vest the owner thereof with any legal right or title to any of the property, his interest in the corporate property being equitable or beneficial in nature. Shareholders are in no legal sense the owners of corporate property, which is owned by the corporation as a distinct legal person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, there is no allegation, much less any proof, that the corporate existence of RISCO has ceased and the corporate property has been liquidated and distributed to the stockholders.&nbsp; The records only indicate that, as per Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated June 18, 1997, the SEC merely suspended RISCO's Certificate of Registration beginning on September 5, 1988 due to its non-submission of SEC required reports and its failure to operate for a continuous period of at least five years.<br><br>Verily, Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, who are stockholders of RISCO, cannot claim ownership over the properties at issue in this case on the strength of the Minutes which, at most, is merely evidence of a loan agreement between them and the company.&nbsp; There is no indication or even a suggestion that the ownership of said properties were transferred to them which would require no less that the said properties be registered under their names.&nbsp; For this reason, the complaint should be dismissed since Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, have no cause to seek a quieting of title over the subject properties.<br><br>At most, what Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, had was merely a right to be repaid the amount loaned to RISCO.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the right to seek repayment or reimbursement of their contributions used to purchase the subject properties is already barred by prescription.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court provides that when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that the action is already barred by the statute of limitations, the court shall dismiss the claim, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived. However, when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, or that the action is barred by a prior judgment or <b>by statute of limitations</b>, the court shall dismiss the claim. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>In <i>Feliciano v. Canoza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> we held:<br><br><blockquote>We have ruled that trial courts have authority and discretion to dismiss an action on the ground of prescription when the parties' pleadings or other facts on record show it to be indeed time-barred x x x; and it may do so on the basis of a motion to dismiss, or an answer which sets up such ground as an affirmative defense; or even if the ground is alleged after judgment on the merits, as in a motion for reconsideration; or even if the defense has not been asserted at all, as where no statement thereof is found in the pleadings, or where a defendant has been declared in default. <b>What is essential only, to repeat, is that the facts demonstrating the lapse of the prescriptive period, be otherwise sufficiently and satisfactorily apparent on the record; either in the averments of the plaintiffs complaint, or otherwise established by the evidence</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The pertinent Civil Code provision on prescription which is applicable to the issue at hand is Article 1144(1), to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The following actions must be brought within ten years from the time the right of action accrues:<br><ol><li><b>Upon a written contract</b>;<br></li><li>Upon an obligation created by law;<br></li><li>Upon a judgment. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Moreover, in <i>Nielson &amp; Co., Inc. v. Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><i> </i>we held that the term "written contract" includes the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors of a corporation, which minutes were adopted by the parties although not signed by them, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Coming now to the question of prescription raised by defendant Lepanto, it is contended by the latter that the period to be considered for the prescription of the claim regarding participation in the profits is only four years, because the modification of the sharing embodied in the management contract is merely verbal, no written document to that effect having been presented. This contention is untenable. The modification appears in the minutes of the special meeting of the Board of Directors of Lepanto held on August 21, 1940, it having been made upon the authority of its President, and in said minutes the terms of modification had been specified. This is sufficient to have the agreement considered, for the purpose of applying the statute of limitations, as a written contract even if the minutes were not signed by the parties (3 A.L.R., 2d, p. 831). It has been held that a writing containing the terms of a contract if adopted by two persons may constitute a contract in writing even if the same is not signed by either of the parties (3 A.L.R., 2d, pp. 812-813). Another authority says that an unsigned agreement the terms of which are embodied in a document unconditionally accepted by both parties is a written contract (Corbin on Contracts, Vol. I, p. 85).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Applied to the case at bar, the Minutes which was approved on March 14, 1961 is considered as a written contract between Aznar, <i>et al</i>., and RISCO for the reimbursement of the contributions of the former.&nbsp; As such, the former had a period of ten (10) years from 1961 within which to enforce the said written contract.&nbsp; However, it does not appear that Aznar, <i>et al</i>., filed any action for reimbursement or refund of their contributions against RISCO or even against PNB.&nbsp; Instead the suit that Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, brought before the trial court only on January 28, 1998 was one to quiet title over the properties purchased by RISCO with their contributions.&nbsp; It is unmistakable that their right of action to claim for refund or payment of their contributions had long prescribed.&nbsp; Thus, it was reversible error for the Court of Appeals to order PNB to pay Aznar, <i>et al.</i>, the amount of their liens based on the Minutes with legal interests from the time of PNB's acquisition of the subject properties.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, it is unnecessary for the Court to pass upon the other issues raised by the parties.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition of Aznar, <i>et al.</i>,<i> </i>in G.R.
