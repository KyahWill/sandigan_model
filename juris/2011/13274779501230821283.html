				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a special civil action <i>via certiorari</i> under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure from the <b>Decision</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the <b>Commission on Audit (COA) No. 2003-134</b> dated October 9, 2003, which denied the grant of rice allowance to employees of the National Electrification Administration (NEA) who were hired after June 30, 1989 (petitioners) and COA’s <b>Resolution </b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <b>No. 2005-010</b> dated February 24, 2005, which likewise denied petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>On July 1, 1989, Republic Act No. 6758 (the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989) took effect, Section 12 of which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 12. <b><i>Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation</i></b>. — All allowances, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM, shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein prescribed. <b>Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.</b><br><br>Existing additional compensation of any national government official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and shall be paid by the National Government.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote><br>Pursuant to its authority to implement Republic Act No. 6758 under Section 23 thereof, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on October 2, 1989 issued <b>Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10 (DBM-CCC No. 10)</b>, otherwise known as the “Implementing Rules and Regulations of&nbsp; R.A.

(Emphasis added.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>A group of NEA employees who were hired after October 31, 1989 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> claimed that they did not receive meal, rice, and children’s allowances. Thus, on July 23, 1999, they filed a special civil action for <i>mandamus</i> against NEA and its Board of Administrators before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 88, Quezon City, docketed as <b>SP. Civil Action No. Q-99-38275</b>, alleging violation of their right to the equal protection clause under the Constitution.<br><br>On December 15, 1999, the RTC rendered its Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in their favor, disposing of the case in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the petition is hereby GRANTED directing the respondent NEA, its Board of Administrators to forthwith settle the claims of the petitioners and other employees similarly situated and extend to them the benefits and allowances to which they are entitled but which until now they have been deprived of as enumerated under Section 5 of DBM CCC No. 10 and their inclusion in the Provident Funds Membership, retroactive from the date of their appointments up to the present or until their separation from the service. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><br>At the instance of the complainants, the Branch Clerk of Court of RTC Branch 88, Quezon City, Lily D.

Civil Action No. Q-99-38275 on February 22, 2000. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, the RTC issued a Notice of Garnishment against the funds of NEA with Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to the extent of P16,581,429.00. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>NEA questioned before the Court of Appeals the Orders of the lower court, and the case was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 62919</b>. On July 4, 2002, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> declaring null and void the December 11, 2000 Resolution as well as the January 8, 2001 Order of the RTC, and ordering the implementation of a writ of execution against the funds of NEA.&nbsp; Thus, NEA filed a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> with this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 154200.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the RTC held in abeyance the execution of its December 15, 1999 Decision pending resolution of this Court of the review on certiorari in <i>National Electrification Administration v. Morales</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On July 24, 2007, this Court reversed and set aside the Court of Appeals decision and described the subsequent events relating to the case in this manner <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>Meanwhile, in a letter dated June 28, 2000, former DBM Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno informed NEA Administrator Conrado M. Estrella III of the denial of the NEA request for a supplemental budget on the ground that the claims under R.A. No. 6758 which the RTC had ordered to be settled cannot be paid because Morales, <i>et al</i>. are not “incumbents of positions as of July 1, 1989 who are actually receiving and enjoying such benefits.”<br><br>Moreover, in an Indorsement dated March 23, 2000, the Commission on Audit (COA) advised NEA against making further payments in settlement of the claims of Morales, et al.&nbsp; Apparently, COA had already <b>passed upon claims similar</b> to those of Morales, et al. in its earlier “Decision No. 95-074” dated January 25, 1995.&nbsp; Portions of the Indorsement read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>This Office concurs with the above view. <b><i> The court may have exceeded its jurisdiction when it entertained the petition for the entitlement of the after-hired employees which had already been passed upon by this Commission in COA Decision No. 95-074 dated January 25, 1995</i></b>.&nbsp; There, it was held that: “the adverse action of this Commission sustaining the disallowance made by the Auditor, NEA, on the payment of fringe benefits granted to NEA employees <b>hired from July 1, 1989 to October 31, 1989</b> is hereby reconsidered.&nbsp; Accordingly, subject disallowance is lifted.”<br><br><b><i>Thus, employees hired after the extended date of October 31, 1989, pursuant to the above COA decision cannot defy that decision by filing a petition for mandamus in the lower court.&nbsp; Presidential Decree No. 1445 and the 1987 Constitution prescribe that the only mode for appeal from decisions of this Commission is on certiorari to the Supreme Court in the manner provided by law and the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Clearly, the lower court had no jurisdiction when it entertained the subject case of mandamus.&nbsp; And void decisions of the lower court can never attain finality, much less be executed. Moreover, COA was not made a party thereto, hence, it cannot be compelled to allow the payment of claims on the basis of the questioned decision.</i></b><br><br>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the auditor of NEA should post-audit the disbursement vouchers on the bases of this Commission's decision particularly the above-cited COA Decision No. 94-074 [sic] and existing rules and regulations, as if there is no decision of the court in the subject special civil action for mandamus.&nbsp; At the same time, management should be informed of the intention of this Office to question the validity of the court decision before the Supreme Court through the Office of the Solicitor General.<br></blockquote><br>Parenthetically, the records at hand do not indicate when Morales, et al. were appointed.&nbsp; Even the December <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>, 1999 RTC Decision is vague for it merely states that they were appointed after June 30, 1989, which could mean that they were appointed either before the cut-off date of October 31, 1989 or after.&nbsp; Thus, there is not enough basis for this Court to determine that the foregoing COA Decision No.&nbsp; 95-074 adversely affects Morales, et al..&nbsp; Moreover, the records do not show whether COA actually questioned the December 16, 1999 RTC Decision before this Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court ruled that respondents therein could not proceed against the funds of NEA “because the December <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>, 1999 RTC Decision sought to be satisfied is not a judgment for a specific sum of money susceptible of execution by garnishment; it is a special judgment requiring petitioners to settle the claims of <i>respondents in accordance with existing regulations of the COA.</i>” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The Court further held as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In its plain text, the December <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>, 1999 RTC Decision merely directs petitioners to “settle the claims of [respondents] and other employees similarly situated.” It does not require petitioners to pay a certain sum of money to respondents.&nbsp; The judgment is only for the performance of an act other than the payment of money, implementation of which is governed by Section 11, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which provides:<br><br>Section 11. <i> Execution of special judgments</i>. - When a judgment requires the performance of any act other than those mentioned in the two preceding sections, a certified copy of the judgment shall be attached to the writ of execution and shall be served by the officer upon the party against whom the same is rendered, or upon any other person required thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and such party or person may be punished for contempt if he disobeys such judgment.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Garnishment is proper only when the judgment to be enforced is&nbsp; one for payment of a sum of money.<br><br>The RTC exceeded the scope of its judgment when, in its February 22, 2000 Writ of Execution, it directed petitioners to “extend to [respondents] the benefits and allowances to which they are entitled but which until now they have been deprived of as enumerated under Sec. 5 of DBM CCC No. 10 and x x x to cause their inclusion in the Provident Fund Membership.” Worse, it countenanced the issuance of a notice of garnishment against the funds of petitioners with DBP to the extent of&nbsp; P16,581,429.00 even when no such amount was awarded in its December 16, 1999 Decision.<br><br>However, in its subsequent Orders dated May 17, 2000 and January 8, 2001, the RTC attempted to set matters right by directing the parties to now await the outcome of the legal processes for the settlement of respondents’ claims.<br><br>That is only right.<br><br><b>Without question, petitioner NEA is a GOCC -- a juridical personality separate and distinct from the government, with capacity to sue and be sued.&nbsp; As such GOCC, petitioner NEA cannot evade execution; its funds may be garnished or levied upon in satisfaction of a judgment rendered against it.&nbsp; However, before execution may proceed against it, a claim for payment of the judgment award must first be filed with the COA.</b><br><br>Under Commonwealth Act No. 327, as amended by Section 26 of P.D. No. 1445, <b>it is the COA which has primary jurisdiction to examine, audit and settle “all debts and claims of any sort” due from or owing the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries. With respect to money claims arising from the implementation of R.A. No. 6758, their allowance or disallowance is for COA to decide, subject only to the remedy of appeal by petition for <i>certiorar</i>i to this Court.<br><br>All told, the RTC acted prudently in halting implementation of the writ of execution to allow the parties recourse to the processes of the COA. It may be that the tenor of the March 23, 2000 Indorsement issued by COA already spells doom for respondents’ claims; but it is not for this Court to preempt the action of the COA on the post-audit to be conducted by it per its Indorsement dated March 23, 2000.</b><br><br>In fine, it was grave error for the CA to reverse the RTC and direct immediate implementation of the writ of execution through garnishment of the funds of petitioners,<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The July 4, 2002 Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; The Resolution dated December 11, 2000 and Order dated January 8, 2001 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 88, Quezon City in Special Civil Action No. Q-99-38275 are <b>REINSTATED</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>Meantime, the Civil Service Commission issued <b>Resolution No. 001295</b> dated June 1, 2001 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and interpreted Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>Material to the resolution of this instant request is <b>Section 12 of SSL</b> x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Commission, x x x is of the view that this provision of law does not imply that such other additional compensation not integrated into the salary rates shall not be received by employees appointed after July 1, 1989. The word “only” before the phrase “as of July 1, 1989” does not refer to incumbents but qualifies what additional compensation can be continued together with the qualifying words “<i>not integrated into the standardized rates shall continue to be authorized</i>.”&nbsp; <b>The correct interpretation therefore is that, additional compensation being received by employees not integrated into the standardized rates as of July 1, 1989 shall continue to be authorized and received/enjoyed by said employees, whether or not said employee was appointed prior to or after July 1, 1989</b>.<br><br>A different interpretation will result in the creation of two classes of employees, i.e., one class receiving less pay than another class for substantially equal work. Said interpretation will violate <b>Section 2 of the SSL</b> which provides, thus:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Additionally, this interpretation will also violate the constitutional precept that <i>no person shall be denied the equal protection of law</i> (<b>Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution</b>). Applying this precept the Supreme Court declared that “<i>equal protection of the law is against unde favor on an individual or class</i> (<b>Tiu vs. Court of Appeals</b>, GR No. 127410, January 20, 1999). <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>The Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), in response to the request of then NEA Administrator Manuel Luis S. Sanchez, issued on August 14, 2001 its <b>Opinion No. 157, s. 2001</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> declaring that the RTC decision, not having been appealed, had become the law of the case which must now be applied.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of such opinion reads:<br><br><blockquote>HON. MANUEL LUIS S. SANCHEZ<br>Administrator<br>National Electrification Administration<br>NEA Road, Diliman, Quezon City<br><br><blockquote><b>Re: Request for legal opinion on the propriety and applicability to NEA employees hired after July 1, 1989 of OGCC Opinion NO. 086, s. 2001</b><br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Pursuant to law, subject Decision became final and executory fifteen (15) days after its rendition, there being no appeal or motion for reconsideration filed in the interim, as certified to by Atty. Lily D. Labarda, Branch 88, Quezon City, on January 24, 2000.<br><br>The foregoing considered, this Office therefore cannot opine otherwise save to uphold the supremacy and finality of the aforequoted Decision of the Court on the matter. Its judgment is now <u>res judicata</u>, hence, the controlling legal rule, as far as Petitioners NEA employees are concerned, is that they must be extended the benefits and allowances “to which they are entitled but which until now they have been deprived of as enumerated under Section 5 of DBM CCC No. 101 x x x, retroactive from the date of their appointments up to the present or until their separation from the service.”&nbsp; This is the law of the case which must now be applied. At any rate, we have stated in OGCC Opinion No. 086, S. 2001 that even employees hired after July 1, 1989 may receive the subject benefits provided there is determination by the DBM that the same have not been actually integrated into their basic salaries.<br><br>Hence, your query is therefore answered in the affirmative. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Pursuant to the above opinion in its favor, the NEA Board of Administrators issued <b>Resolution No. 29</b> on <b>August 9, 2001</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> approving the entitlement to rice, medical, children, meal, and other related allowances to NEA employees hired after October 31, 1989, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and the payment of these benefits, chargeable to its Personnel Services Savings.&nbsp; This resolution was the outcome of the meeting of the NEA Board of Administrators on the same date, and reads:<br><br><blockquote><center><b><u>RESOLUTION NO. 29</u></b><br></center><br>x x x x<br><br>RESOLVED THEREFORE TO APPROVE, as it hereby approves, the entitlement to rice, medical, children, meal and other related allowances of NEA employees hired after October 31, 1989 and payment of these benefits;<br><br>RESOLVED FURTHER TO CONFIRM, as it hereby confirms, the initial appropriation and payment of One Million Six Hundred Forty Six Thousand One Hundred Twenty Seven Pesos and Thirty Centavos (P1,646,127.30) for this purpose chargeable against the Personnel Services Savings. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, NEA granted the questioned allowances to its employees who were not receiving these benefits/allowances, including rice allowance amounting to P1,865,811.84 covering the period January to August 2001. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>However, the resident auditor of COA, Carmelita M. Agullana (Agullana), did not allow the payment of rice allowance for the period January to August 2001 to NEA employees who were not incumbents as of June 30, 1989, under <b>Notice of Disallowance</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <b>No. 2001-004-101</b> dated September 6, 2001.&nbsp; Agullana indicated the “Facts and/or Reasons for Disallowance” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Payment of Rice Allowance for the period January, 2001 to August, 2001 to employees who were not incumbents as of June 30, 1989 not allowed pursuant to RA #6758 as implemented by Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10 prescribing the Rules and Regulations for the Implementation of the Revised Compensation and Position Classification System for Government-Owned and/or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Financial Institutions (GFIs) specifically Sections 5.4 and 5.5 thereof. x x x. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>NEA, through then Acting Administrator Francisco G. Silva, and assisted by counsel, appealed Agullana’s disallowance to the COA on September 27, 2001, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> arguing that the disallowance had no basis in law and in fact, and that the subject disbursement was anchored on a court decision that had become final and executory.<br><br>The COA denied the appeal from the disallowance in a <b>Decision</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated October 9, 2003 (<b>Decision No. 2003-134</b>).&nbsp; The COA stated that:<br><br><blockquote>The Director of x x x Corporate Audit Office II recommended the affirmance of the subject disallowance contending that Section 12 of Republic Act (RA) No. 6758 (Salary Standardization Law) x x x remains applicable on the matter since Department of Budget and Management-Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10, s. 1989 (DBM-CCC No. 10) was declared ineffective by the Supreme Court in the case of De Jesus, et al. vs. COA, et al. (G.R. No. 109023, August 13, 1998) due to its non-publication in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation. She pointed out that the alleged discriminatory effect and violation of the policy to provide equal pay for substantially equal work in the above-quoted provision have been sufficiently considered in Philippine Ports Authority vs. COA, 214 SCRA 653 and later confirmed in Philippine International Trading Corporation vs. COA, G.R. No. 132593, June 25, 1999, wherein the Supreme Court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>“x x x we must mention that this Court has confirmed in Philippine Ports Authority vs. Commission on Audit the legislative intent to protect incumbents who are receiving salaries and allowances over and above those authorized by RA 6758 to continue to receive the same even after RA 6758 took effect. In reserving the benefit to incumbents, the legislature has manifested its intent to gradually phase out this privilege without upsetting the policy of non-diminution of pay and consistent with the rule that laws should only be applied prospectively in the spirit of fair play.”</blockquote><br>She also conformed to the OGCC Opinion No. 52, s. 1999 dated March 22, 1999, edifying the implication of the De Jesus Case which enunciated thusly:<br><br><blockquote>“Notwithstanding the ruling in the De Jesus Case, the applicable law is still Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 which allows additional compensation being received by incumbents as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standard rates to continue. The recent nullification of DBM-CCC No. 10 applies favorably only to those incumbent employees (hired prior to July 1, 1989) and does not in any way change the position or situation of those employees hired after the cut-off date.

No. 6758, the DBM x x x issued on October 2, 1989, DBM-CCC No. 10. Section 5.5 of DBM-CCC No. 10 enumerated the various allowances/fringe benefits authorized to GOCCs/GFIs which are not to be integrated into the basic salary and allowed to be continued only for incumbents of positions as of June 30, 1989 who are authorized and actually receiving said allowances/benefits as of said date.

Undoubtedly, the petition in the guise of a case for mandamus is a money claim falling within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of this Commission. Noting the propensity of the lower courts in taking cognizance of cases filed by claimants in violation of such primary jurisdiction, the Supreme Court issued Administrative Circular 10-2000 dated October 23, 2000 enjoining judges of lower courts to exercise caution in order to prevent “possible circumvention of the rules and procedures of the Commission on Audit” and reiterating the basic rule that: “All money claims against the Government must be filed with the Commission on Audit which shall act upon it within sixty days. Rejection of the claim will authorize the claimant to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court on certiorari and in effect sue the State thereby.”<br><br>Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, when an administrative body is clothed with original and exclusive jurisdiction, courts are utterly without power and authority to exercise concurrently such jurisdiction. Accordingly, all the proceedings of the court in violation of that doctrine and all orders and decisions reached thereby are null and void. It will be noted in the cited Supreme Court Circular that money claims are cognizable by the COA and its decision is appealable only to the Supreme Court. The lower courts have nothing to do with such genus of transactions.<br><br>Anent the issue of entitlement to rice allowance by employees hired after June 30, 1989, this Commission is left with no option but to affirm the disallowance in the face of the explicit provisions of DBM-CCC No. 10. After its publication on March 9, 1999 in the Official Gazette, rice allowance was allowed only for incumbents as of July 1, 1989. Obviously, there is no violation of the equal protection clause as cited in the PITC case, <u>supra</u>, because whatever increments the incumbents are enjoying over those of non-incumbents are transitory, for the same law provides that such difference shall be deducted from the salary increase the former should receive under Section 17. Thus, the equalization or standardization of what the two categories of employees will be receiving in terms of benefits is ensured.<br><br>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the instant appeal is hereby DENIED and the disallowance in the total amount of P1,865,811.84 is accordingly affirmed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>We agree with the findings of the COA.<br><br>In <i>National Electrification Administration v.

COA, this Court held that PPA employees already receiving the RATA granted by LOI No. 97 should continue to receive them, provided they were already "incumbents" on or before July 1, 1989.</li><li>PITC v. COA held that in enacting RA 6758, Congress was adhering to the policy of non-diminution of existing pay. Hence, if a benefit was not yet existing when the law took effect on July 1, 1989, there was nothing to continue and no basis for applying the policy.</li><li>Neither would Cruz v. COA be applicable. In those cases, the COA arbitrarily set a specific date, October 31, 1989; RA 6758 had not made a distinction between those hired before and those after that date. In the present case, the law itself set July 1, 1989, as the date when employees should be "incumbents," because that was when RA 6758 took effect. It was not an arbitrarily chosen date; there was sufficient reason for setting it as the cutoff point. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Notwithstanding our ruling above, however, we take up as another matter the refund ordered by the COA on the rice subsidy that petitioners had already received.&nbsp; As regards the refund, we rule in favor of petitioners and will not require them to return the amounts anymore.<br><br>This is because, to begin with, the officials and administrators of NEA themselves had believed that their employees were entitled to the allowances, and this was covered by Resolution No. 29 of the NEA Board of Administrators.&nbsp; The petitioners thus received in good faith the rice subsidy together with other allowances provided in said Resolution.&nbsp; For reasons of equity and fairness, therefore, and considering their long wait for this matter to be resolved with finality, we will no longer require a refund from these public servants.<br><br>Our pronouncements on refund in De Jesus v.
