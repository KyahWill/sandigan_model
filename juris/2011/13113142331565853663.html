SP No. 91763. In its 26 November 2007 Decision, the Court of Appeals granted respondent Emerson B. Aquende's (Aquende) petition for annulment of judgment and declared the 26 November 1996 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Legazpi City, Branch 6 (trial court) void. In its 7 May 2008 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner Maximina A. Bulawan's<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Bulawan) motion for reconsideration.<br><br><u><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center></u><br>On 1 March 1995, Bulawan filed a complaint for annulment of title, reconveyance and damages against Lourdes Yap (Yap) and the Register of Deeds before the trial court docketed as Civil Case No. 9040.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Bulawan claimed that she is the owner of Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-153847 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 13733 having bought the property from its owners, brothers Santos and Francisco Yaptengco (Yaptengco brothers), who claimed to have inherited the property from Yap Chin Cun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Bulawan alleged that Yap claimed ownership of the same property and caused the issuance of TCT No. 40292 in Yap's name.<br><br>In her Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Yap clarified that she asserts ownership of Lot No. 1634-A of Psd-187165, which she claimed is the controlling subdivision survey for Lot No. 1634. Yap also mentioned that, in Civil Case No. 5064, the trial court already declared that Psd-153847 was simulated by the Yaptengco brothers and that their claim on Lot No. 1634-B was void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The trial court likewise adjudged Yap Chin Cun as the rightful owner of Lot No. 1634-B. Yap also stated that Lot No. 1634-B was sold by Yap Chin Cun to the Aquende family.<br><br>On 26 November 1996, the trial court ruled in favor of Bulawan. The trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, decision is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff (Bulawan) and against the defendant (Yap) declaring the plaintiff as the lawful owner and possesor of the property in question, particularly designated as Lot 1634-B of Plan Psd-153847.

On 20 July 2001, the Court of Appeals dismissed Yap's appeal.<br><br>On 7 February 2002, the trial court's 26 November 2006 Decision became final and executory per entry of judgment dated 20 July 2001. On 19 July 2002, the trial court issued a writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a letter dated 24 July 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Register of Deeds informed Aquende of the trial court's writ of execution and required Aquende to produce TCT No. 40067 so that a memorandum of the lien may be annotated on the title. On 25 July 2002, Aquende wrote a letter to the Register of Deeds questioning the trial court's writ of execution against his property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Aquende alleged that he was unaware of any litigation involving his property having received no summons or notice thereof, nor was he aware of any adverse claim as no notice of <i>lis</i><i> pendens</i> was inscribed on the title.<br><br>On 2 August 2002, Aquende filed a Third Party Claim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> against the writ of execution because it affected his property and, not being a party in Civil Case No. 9040, he argued that he is not bound by the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision. In a letter dated 5 August 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Clerk of Court said that a Third Party Claim was not the proper remedy because the sheriff did not levy upon or seize Aquende's property. Moreover, the property was not in the sheriff's possession and it was not about to be sold by virtue of the writ of execution.<br><br>Aquende then filed a Notice of Appearance with Third Party Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and prayed for the partial annulment of the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision, specifically the portion which ordered the cancellation of Psd-187165 as well as any other certificate of title issued pursuant to Psd-187165. Aquende also filed a Supplemental Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> where he reiterated that he was not a party in Civil Case No. 9040 and that since the action was <i>in personam</i> or <i>quasi in rem</i>, only the parties in the case are bound by the decision.<br><br>In its 19 February 2003 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the trial court denied Aquende's motions. According to the trial court, it had lost jurisdiction to modify its 26 November 1996 Decision when the Court of Appeals affirmed said decision.<br><br>Thereafter, Aquende filed a petition for annulment of judgment before the Court of Appeals on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Aquende alleged that he was deprived of his property without due process of law. Aquende argued that there was extrinsic fraud when Bulawan conveniently failed to implead him despite her knowledge of the existing title in his name and, thus, prevented him from participating in the proceedings and protecting his title. Aquende also alleged that Bulawan was in collusion with Judge Vladimir B. Brusola who, despite knowledge of the earlier decision in Civil Case No. 5064 on the ownership of Lot No. 1634-B and Aquende's interest over the property, ruled in favor of Bulawan. Aquende added that he is an indispensable party and the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over his person because he was not impleaded as a party in the case. Aquende also pointed out that the trial court went beyond the jurisdiction conferred by the allegations on the complaint because Bulawan did not pray for the cancellation of Psd-187165 and TCT No. 40067. Aquende likewise argued that a certificate of title should not be subject to collateral attack and it cannot be altered, modified or canceled except in direct proceedings in accordance with law.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Aquende. The 26 November 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated November 26, 1996 in Civil Case No. 9040 is hereby declared <b>NULL</b> and <b>VOID</b>. Transfer Certificate of Title No. 40067 registered in the name of petitioner Emerson B. Aquende and (LRC) Psd-187165 are hereby ordered <b>REINSTATED</b>.

The other division of the Court of Appeals was not given the opportunity to rule on the issue of Aquende being an indispensable party because that issue was not raised during the proceedings before the trial court and on appeal.<br><br>The Court of Appeals declared that Aquende was an indispensable party who was adversely affected by the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision. The Court of Appeals said that the trial court should have impleaded Aquende under Section 11, Rule 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the Rules of Court. Since jurisdiction was not properly acquired over Aquende, the Court of Appeals declared the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision void. According to the Court of Appeals, Aquende had no other recourse but to seek the nullification of the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision that unduly deprived him of his property.<br><br>The Court of Appeals added that the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision was void because the trial court failed to note that the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate and Partition, from where the Yaptengco brothers derived their ownership over Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-153847 allegedly as heirs of Yap Chin Cun and now being claimed by Bulawan, had already been declared void in Civil Case No. 5064.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Court of Appeals also said that a reading of Bulawan's complaint showed that the trial court had no jurisdiction to order the nullification of Psd-187165 and TCT No. 40067 because this was not one of the reliefs that Bulawan prayed for.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></center><br>Bulawan raises the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>The Former Third Division of the Court of Appeals decided contrary to existing laws and jurisprudence when it declared the Decision, dated 26 November 1996, in Civil Case No. 9040 null and void considering that a petition for annulment [of judgment] under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court is an equitable remedy which is available only under extraordinary circumstances.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The Former Third Division of the Court of Appeals decided contrary to law when it considered Respondent Emerson B. Aquende as an indispensable party in Civil Case No. 9040.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>The Former Third Division of the Court of Appeals sanctioned a departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings when it overturned a final and executory decision of another Division thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><u><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></u><br></center><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br><center><i>Petition for Annulment of Judgment </i><br><i>is</i><i> the Proper Remedy</i><br></center><br>Bulawan argues that the Court of Appeals erred in granting Aquende's petition for annulment of judgment in the absence of extrinsic fraud and the existence of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court. Bulawan adds that the Court of Appeals erred because it annulled a decision which had already been considered and affirmed by another division of the Court of Appeals. According to Bulawan, the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision is already final and had been fully executed.<br><br>In a petition for annulment of judgment, the judgment may be annulled on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Fraud is extrinsic where it prevents a party from having a trial or from presenting his entire case to the court, or where it operates upon matters pertaining not to the judgment itself but to the manner in which it is procured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The overriding consideration when extrinsic fraud is alleged is that the fraudulent scheme of the prevailing litigant prevented a party from having his day in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, lack of jurisdiction refers to either lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defending party or over the subject matter of the claim, and in either case the judgment or final order and resolution are void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Where the questioned judgment is annulled, either on the ground of extrinsic fraud or lack of jurisdiction, the same shall be set aside and considered void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In his petition for annulment of judgment, Aquende alleged that there was extrinsic fraud because he was prevented from protecting his title when Bulawan and the trial court failed to implead him as a party. Bulawan also maintained that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over his person and, therefore, its 26 November 1996 Decision is not binding on him. In its 26 November 2007 Decision, the Court of Appeals found merit in Aquende's petition and declared that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over Aquende, who was adversely affected by its 26 November 1996 Decision. We find no error in the findings of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Moreover, annulment of judgment is a remedy in law independent of the case where the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Consequently, an action for annulment of judgment may be availed of even if the judgment to be annulled had already been fully executed or implemented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err when it took cognizance of Aquende's petition for annulment of judgment and overturned the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision even if another division of the Court of Appeals had already affirmed it and it had already been executed.<br><br>The Court also notes that when the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision, it had not been given the occasion to rule on the issue of Aquende being an indispensable party and, if in the affirmative, whether the trial court properly acquired jurisdiction over his person. This question had not been raised before the trial court and earlier proceedings before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><center><i>Aquende</i><i> is a Proper Party to Sue </i><br><i>for</i><i> the Annulment of the Judgment</i><br></center><br>Bulawan argues that Aquende was not an indispensable party in Civil Case No. 9040 because the lot Aquende claims ownership of is different from the subject matter of the case. Bulawan clarifies that she claims ownership of Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-153847, while Aquende claims ownership of Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-187165. Bulawan argues that even if Aquende will be affected by the trial court's 26 November 1996 Decision, this will not make him an indispensable party.<br><br>Contrary to Bulawan's argument, it appears that Aquende's Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-187165 and Bulawan's Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-153847 actually refer to the same Lot No. 1634-B originally owned by Yap Chin Cun. Both Aquende and Bulawan trace their ownership of the property to Yap Chin Cun. Aquende maintains that he purchased the property from Yap Chin Cun, while Bulawan claims to have purchased the property from the Yaptengco brothers, who alleged that they inherited the property from Yap Chin Cun. However, as the Court of Appeals declared, the title of the Yaptengco brothers over Lot No. 1634-B of Psd-153847 had already been cancelled and they were forever enjoined not to disturb the right of ownership and possession of Yap Chin Cun.<br><br>Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court defines indispensable parties as parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action. An indispensable party is one whose interest will be affected by the court's action in the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> As such, they must be joined either as plaintiffs or as defendants. In <i>Arcelona</i><i> v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we said:<br><br><blockquote>The general rule with reference to the making of parties in a civil action requires, of course, the joinder of all necessary parties where possible, and the joinder of all indispensable parties under any and all conditions, their presence being a sine qua non for the exercise of judicial power. It is precisely "when an indispensable party is not before the court (that) the action should be dismissed." The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote><br>During the proceedings before the trial court, the answers of Yap<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and the Register of Deeds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> should have prompted the trial court to inquire further whether there were other indispensable parties who were not impleaded. The trial court should have taken the initiative to implead Aquende as defendant or to order Bulawan to do so as mandated under Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The burden to implead or to order the impleading of indispensable parties is placed on Bulawan and on the trial court, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>However, even if Aquende were not an indispensable party, he could still file a petition for annulment of judgment. We have consistently held that a person need not be a party to the judgment sought to be annulled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> What is essential is that he can prove his allegation that the judgment was obtained by the use of fraud and collusion and that he would be adversely affected thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals that Bulawan obtained a favorable judgment from the trial court by the use of fraud. Bulawan prevented Aquende from presenting his case before the trial court and from protecting his title over his property. We also agree with the Court of Appeals that the 26 November 1996 Decision adversely affected Aquende as he was deprived of his property without due process.<br><br>Moreover, a person who was not impleaded in the complaint cannot be bound by the decision rendered therein, for no man shall be affected by a proceeding in which he is a stranger.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In <i>National Housing Authority v. Evangelista</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> we said:<br><br><blockquote>In this case, it is undisputed that respondent was never made a party to Civil Case No. Q-91-10071. It is basic that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by judgment rendered by the court. Yet, the assailed paragraph 3 of the trial court's decision decreed that "(A)ny transfers, assignment, sale or mortgage of whatever nature of the parcel of land subject of this case made by defendant Luisito Sarte or his/her agents or assigns before or during the pendency of the instant case are hereby declared null and void, together with any transfer certificates of title issued in connection with the aforesaid transactions by the Register of Deeds of Quezon City who is likewise ordered to cancel or cause the cancellation of such TCTs." Respondent is adversely affected by such judgment, as he was the subsequent purchaser of the subject property from Sarte, and title was already transferred to him. <b>It will be the height of inequity to allow respondent's title to be nullified without being given the opportunity to present any evidence in support of his ostensible ownership of the property. Much more, it is tantamount to a violation of the constitutional guarantee that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law.</b> Clearly, the trial court's judgment is void insofar as paragraph 3 of its dispositive portion is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Likewise, Aquende was never made a party in Civil Case No. 9040. Yet, the trial court ordered the cancellation of Psd-187165 and any other certificate of title issued pursuant to Psd-187165, including Aquende's TCT No. 40067. Aquende was adversely affected by such judgment as his title was cancelled without giving him the opportunity to present his evidence to prove his ownership of the property.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
