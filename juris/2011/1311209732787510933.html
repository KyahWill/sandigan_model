Aside from the very clear provisions of Article 223 of the Labor Code and of Section 6, Rule VI of the NLRC Rules of Procedure on the matter, the discretion to reduce the appeal bond rests upon the NLRC and only in justifiable and meritorious cases.&nbsp; And since petitioner failed to justify its claim to a reduction of the appeal bond, the NLRC properly denied its motion.<br><br>Respondents likewise assert that petitioner has already lost its right to appeal considering that same was not perfected when it failed to put up the required appeal bond within the time prescribed by the NLRC.&nbsp; Because of this, the Labor Arbiter's Decision became final and executory and, hence, the NLRC did not err in not touching upon the merits of the appeal.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the Memorandum <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> filed by respondent Solano, she informs this Court that upon verification from the SEC, petitioner was placed under liquidation as early as 2002. This can further be deduced from the September 1, 2003 Order <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the SEC designating Atty. Francis Carlo D. Taparan as its liquidator and from the February 13, 2007 letter <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of SEC Secretary C.A. Gerard M. Lukban, which quoted excerpts from the minutes of the April 13, 2005 SEC Meeting designating him as petitioner's new liquidator. In view of these, respondents argue that petitioner's claim of receivership has already lost significance and therefore has become moot and academic.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>There is merit in the petition.<br><br><i>Posting of bond is indispensable to the <br>perfection of an appeal in cases involving<br> monetary awards from the Decision of <br>the Labor Arbiter.</i><br><br>Article 223 of the Labor Code provides in part:<br><br><blockquote>Article 223. <i>Appeal.</i> - Decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>In case of a judgment involving a monetary award, an appeal by the employer may be perfected only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond </b>issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the Commission<b> in the amount equivalent to the monetary award in the judgment appealed from.&nbsp; </b>(Emphasis supplied.)<br><br>x x x x.</blockquote><br>While pertinent portions of Sections 4 and 6, Rule VI of the Revised Rules of Procedure of the NLRC read:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 4. REQUISITES FOR PERFECTION OF APPEAL - a) The appeal shall be: 1) filed within the reglementary period provided in Section 1 of this Rule; 2) verified by the appellant himself in accordance with Section 4, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, as amended; 3) in the form of a memorandum of appeal which shall state the grounds relied upon and the arguments in support thereof, the relief prayed for, and with a statement of the date the appellant received the appealed decision, resolution or order; 4) in three (3) legibly typewritten or printed copies; and 5) accompanied by i) proof of payment of the required appeal fee; <b>ii) posting of a cash or surety bond as provided in Section 6 of this Rule</b>; iii) a certificate of non-forum shopping; and iv) proof of service upon the other parties.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SECTION 6.

Court of Appeals,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> this Court held, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Under the Rules, appeals involving monetary awards are perfected only upon compliance with the following mandatory requisites, namely: (1) payment of the appeal fees; (2) filing of the memorandum of appeal; and (3) <b>payment of the required cash or surety bond.</b><br><br>The posting of a bond is indispensable to the perfection of an appeal in cases involving monetary awards from the decision of the labor arbiter.&nbsp; The intention of the lawmakers to make the bond a mandatory requisite for the perfection of an appeal by the employer is clearly expressed in the provision that an appeal by the employer may be perfected `only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond.'&nbsp; The word `only' in Article 223 of the Labor Code makes it unmistakably plain that the lawmakers intended the posting of a cash or surety bond by the employer to be the essential and exclusive means by which an employer's appeal may be perfected. The word `may' refers to the perfection of an appeal as optional on the part of the defeated party, but not to the compulsory posting of an appeal bond, if he desires to appeal.&nbsp; The meaning and the intention of the legislature in enacting a statute must be determined from the language employed; and where there is no ambiguity in the words used, then there is no room for construction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote><br><i>When the amount of bond may be reduced.</i><br><br>Notably, however, under Section 6, Rule VI of the NLRC's&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Rules of Procedure, the bond may be reduced albeit only on meritorious grounds and upon posting of a partial bond in a reasonable amount in relation to the monetary award.&nbsp; Suffice it to state that while said Rules "allows the Commission to reduce the amount of the bond, the exercise of the authority is not a matter of right on the part of the movant, but lies within the sound discretion of the NLRC upon a showing of meritorious grounds." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In <i>Nicol v. Footjoy Industrial Corporation,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court reviewed the jurisprudence <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> respecting the bond requirement for perfecting appeal and summarized the guidelines under which the NLRC must exercise its discretion in considering an appellant's motion for reduction of bond, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he bond requirement on appeals involving monetary awards has been and may be relaxed in meritorious cases.&nbsp; These cases include instances in which (1) there was substantial compliance with the Rules, (2) surrounding facts and circumstances constitute meritorious grounds to reduce the bond, (3) a liberal interpretation of the requirement of an appeal bond would serve the desired objective of resolving controversies on the merits, or (4) the appellants, at the very least, exhibited their willingness and/or good faith by posting a partial bond during the reglementary period.<br><br>Conversely the reduction of the bond is not warranted when no meritorious ground is shown to justify the same; the appellant absolutely failed to comply with the requirement of posting a bond, even if partial; or when the circumstances show the employer's unwillingness to ensure the satisfaction of its workers' valid claims. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i>The NLRC is not precluded from conducting a preliminary determination of the merit or lack of merit of a motion to reduce bond.</i><br><br>In <i>Nicol</i>, the Labor Arbiter ordered the employer to pay the employees monetary award in the total amount of P51,956,314.00. When the employer appealed to the NLRC, it claimed that it was in dire financial condition and thus moved to reduce the bond to P10 million, for which it posted a surety bond.&nbsp; The NLRC however denied the motion and required the employer to file an additional bond of P41,956,314.00.&nbsp; Failing to do so, the NLRC dismissed the employer's appeal for non-perfection thereof.<br><br>On appeal, the CA held that the NLRC should have determined the merit of employer's grounds for the reduction of its appeal bond through the reception of evidence instead of requiring it to put up a bond in the equivalent amount of the award without regard to its reasons and arguments, and without determining for itself what amount would be reasonable under the circumstances.&nbsp; Hence, it directed the NLRC to consider the employer's motion to reduce bond after receiving evidence thereon, and upon a timely posting of the required reasonable supersedeas bond, to give due course to the appeal and to determine the merits of the case.<br><br>When the case reached this Court, we affirmed the CA's ruling that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in denying the motion to reduce bond peremptorily without considering the evidence presented.&nbsp; We further ruled, <i>viz</i>::<br><br><blockquote>[T]he NLRC was not precluded from making a preliminary determination of their [the employer] financial capability to post the required bond, without necessarily passing upon the merits.&nbsp; Since the intention is merely to give the NLRC an idea of the justification for the reduced bond, the evidence for the purpose would necessarily be less than the evidence required for a ruling on the merits.<br><br>Indeed, it only bears stressing that the NLRC is not precluded from receiving evidence on appeal as technical rules of evidence are not binding in labor cases.&nbsp; On the contrary, the Labor Code explicitly mandates it to `use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><i>The NLRC erred in not considering the merit or <br>lack of merit of petitioner's Motion to Reduce Bond.</i><br><br>Petitioner attached to its Motion to Reduce Bond the SEC Orders dated August 23, 1999 and May 23, 2000. The Order of August 23, 1999 is a Cease and Desist Order which, among others, prohibited the officers and agents of petitioner from withdrawing from its trust funds or from making any disposition thereof and, ordered the freeze of all its assets and properties.&nbsp; On the other hand, the May 23, 2000 Order reads in part that:<br><br><blockquote>In view of the voluntary request for receivership of the University Plans, Inc. (UPI), after being found to have a Trust Fund and Capital Deficiency, unable to pay the same despite its commitment to pay, and pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 902-A, as amended, <b>University Plans, Inc. is therefore, placed under the management and control of a RECEIVER</b> x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>From the said SEC Orders, it is unmistakable that petitioner was under receivership.&nbsp; And from the tenor and contents of said Orders, it is possible that petitioner has no liquid asset which it could use to post the required amount of bond.&nbsp; Also, it is quite understandable that because of petitioner's financial state, it cannot raise the amount of more than P3 million within a period of 10 days from receipt of the Labor Arbiter's judgment.<br><br>However, the NLRC ignored petitioner's allegations and instead remained adamant that since the amount of bond is fixed by law, petitioner must post an additional bond of more than P3 million.&nbsp; This, to us, is an utter disregard of the provision of the Labor Code and of the NLRC Revised Rules of Procedure allowing the reduction of bond in meritorious cases.&nbsp; While the NLRC tried to correct this error in its March 21, 2003 Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> by further explaining that it was not persuaded by petitioner's alleged incapability of posting the required amount of bond for failure to submit financial statement, list of sources of income and other details with respect to the alleged receivership, we still find the hasty denial of the motion to reduce bond not proper.<br><br>Notwithstanding petitioner's failure to submit its financial statement and list of sources of income and to give more details relative to its receivership, it was nevertheless able to show through the abovementioned SEC Orders that it was indeed under a state of receivership.&nbsp; This should have been sufficient reason for the NLRC to not outrightly deny petitioner's motion.&nbsp; As to the lacking documents and details on the receivership, it is true that they are needed by the NLRC in determining petitioner's capacity to post the required amount of bond.&nbsp; However, their absence should not lead to the outright denial of the motion since as earlier discussed, the NLRC is not precluded from conducting a preliminary determination on the merit or lack of merit of a motion to reduce bond. Here, considering the clear showing of petitioner's state of receivership, the NLRC should have conducted such preliminary determination and therein require the submission of said documents and other necessary evidence before proceeding to resolve the subject motion.&nbsp; After all, the present case falls under those cases where the bond requirement on appeal may be relaxed considering that (1) there was substantial compliance with the Rules; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (2) the surrounding facts and circumstances constitute meritorious grounds to reduce the bond; and (3) the petitioner, at the very least, exhibited its willingness and/or good faith by posting a partial bond during the reglementary period.&nbsp; Also, such a procedure would be in keeping with the Labor Code's mandate to `use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all in the interest of due process.' <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> We thus find error on the part of the NLRC when it denied petitioner's Motion to Reduce Bond and likewise on the part of the CA when it affirmed said denial.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, a remand of this case to the NLRC for the conduct of preliminary determination of the merit or lack of merit of petitioner's Motion to Reduce Bond is proper.&nbsp; In so doing, the NLRC is also reminded to consider respondent Solano's allegation that petitioner is now under liquidation and to receive evidence thereon so that it may judiciously resolve the Motion to Reduce Bond.&nbsp; As regards the issues relating to the substantial merits of the case, we shall leave the same to the NLRC.&nbsp; This is because should the NLRC eventually find the Motion to Reduce Bond meritorious, it shall give due course to the appeal upon the timely posting of a reasonable amount of&nbsp; supersedeas bond it deems appropriate under the circumstances, and shall then proceed to determine the merits of the case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
