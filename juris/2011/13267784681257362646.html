However, almost two years passed without the parties complying with the said Order.<br><br>Consequently, in an Order <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated October 11, 2000, the RTC dismissed the case for failure of the parties to comply for an unreasonable length of time.&nbsp; The dismissal, however, was set aside in an Order <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated February 12, 2003 in consideration of petitioner’s payment of ten percent (10%) of respondent’s claim.&nbsp; The parties were then given 15 days from notice within which to submit their compromise agreement, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which was subsequently extended for 30 days from notice. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Despite the extensions, however, no compromise agreement was filed in court.

The payment of the full amount of the docket fee is <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span> for the perfection of an appeal. The court acquires jurisdiction over the case only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fees.<br><br>Verily, the requirement of an appeal fee is not a mere technicality of law or procedure but an essential requirement without which the decision appealed from would become final and executory as if no appeal was filed at all. Thus, if We allow belated payment as prayed for and reinstate the instant appeal, it will have the effect of withholding the finality of the judgment or order appealed from.<br><br>Procedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party’s substantive rights. Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not proportionate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed.<br><br>In his Motion for Reconsideration, appellant has not shown weighty and persuasive reasons to compel Us to exercise Our discretion of suspending the strict adherence to the Rules. Other than his flimsy excuse that the ground in the Court’s Resolution is merely technical, appellant has miserably failed to proffer a convincing justification for [his] procedural error. Thus, appellant failed to justify why the Rules should be relaxed and [why] the equitable consideration of the Court should be exercised in his situation as an exception to the strict implementation of the Rules.<br><br>IN VIEW THEREOF, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED and the Resolution dated April 12, 2005 MAINTAINED.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioner comes before this Court by way of Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari </span>raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">A.<br></div><br>WHETHER X X X THE DISMISSAL OF THE TRIAL COURT [WAS] PROPER.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">B.<br></div><br>WHETHER X X X THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN APPLYING STRICTLY THE RULES ON DOCKET FEES. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The pivotal issue is whether the CA was correct in strictly applying the rules on the payment of docket fees.<br><br>Petitioner acknowledges the mandatory nature of the rule that docket and other lawful fees must be paid in full within the prescribed period for an appeal to be perfected.&nbsp; However, he asserts that the broader interest of justice and the desired objective of deciding the case on the merits call for leniency in the application of the rules.&nbsp; Hence, he must be given an opportunity to air his cause without the constraints of technicalities. Petitioner contends that the CA should apply the pronouncement of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yambao v. Court of Appeals</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> relaxing the policy of strict adherence to the rule regarding appeal fees if justifiable reason for the non-payment of the correct amount of docket fees within the prescribed period is shown.&nbsp; He further contends that his act of attaching the payment for the fees to his Motion for Reconsideration shows his intention and willingness to comply with the rules.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our Ruling</span><br></div><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Payment of full docket fees within the <br>prescribed period for taking an appeal <br>is mandatory.</span><br><br>It is well-established that “[t]he right to appeal is a statutory privilege and must be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; “Thus, one who seeks to avail of the right to appeal must strictly comply with the requirements of the rules, and failure to do so leads to the loss of the right to appeal.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The applicable rule for appeals from judgments issued by the RTC in the exercise of its original jurisdiction is Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, Section 4 of which provides:<br><blockquote><br>Section 4.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Appellate court docket and other lawful fees.</span> - Within the period for taking an appeal, the appellant shall pay to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from, the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees. Proof of payment of said fees shall be transmitted to the appellate court together with the original record or the record on appeal.<br></blockquote><br>The Rules also provide that failure of the appellant to pay the docket and other lawful fees is a ground for dismissal of the appeal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Court has consistently ruled in a number of cases that the payment of the full amount of docket fees within the prescribed period is both mandatory and jurisdictional. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; It is a condition <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span> for the appeal to be perfected and only then can a court acquire jurisdiction over the case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; The requirement of an appeal fee is not a mere technicality of law or procedure and should not be undermined except for the most persuasive of reasons.&nbsp; Non-observance would be tantamount to no appeal being filed thereby rendering the challenged decision, resolution or order final and executory.<br><br>Admittedly, this rule is not without recognized qualifications. The Court has declared that in appealed cases, failure to pay the appellate court docket fee within the prescribed period warrants only discretionary as opposed to automatic dismissal of the appeal and that the court shall exercise its power to dismiss in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play and with great deal of circumspection considering all attendant circumstances. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the justifications presented by petitioner for the non-payment of the docket fees are oversight and the lack of advice from his counsel. Unfortunately, the reasons presented are neither convincing nor adequate to merit leniency.&nbsp; Petitioner submits that he only found out about the requirement to pay the docket fees when he received the CA Resolution denying his appeal on April 22, 2005 or three days short of one year from filing of the said appeal.&nbsp; This Court finds this not to be logically true to human experience.&nbsp; It is unusual for petitioner’s counsel not to advice him of the required docket fees.&nbsp; More often than not, counsels are aware of the docket fees required to be paid to the courts, and will ask clients for the said amount prior to filing pleadings in court. This is so because counsels are not expected to shoulder or advance payment for their clients.&nbsp; Assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that petitioner’s counsel did not inform him of the requirement to pay the docket fees to perfect the appeal, what we find incredible is that petitioner apparently failed to communicate with his counsel after the filing of said appeal.&nbsp; This Court has repeatedly held that “litigants, represented by counsel, should not expect that all they need to do is sit back, relax and await the outcome of their case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; “It is the duty of a party-litigant to be in contact with his counsel from time to time in order to be informed of the progress of his case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the counsel’s negligence binds petitioner and, for that reason alone the loss of his remedy was caused by his own negligence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, a relaxation of the rule cannot be granted. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; The bitter consequence of such grave inadvertence is to render the trial court’s order final and executory. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court notes that petitioner only attempted to perfect his appeal on May 6, 2005 by appending the postal money orders to his Motion for Reconsideration, or one year and nine days too late. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; By that time, the challenged<br><br>Order has long become final and no longer open to an appeal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Petitioner’s reliance on the policy espoused in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yambao</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> is likewise unavailing. The pertinent portion relied on by petitioner reads:<br><br><blockquote>Thus, the appellate court may extend the time for the payment of the docket fees if appellant is able to show that there is a justifiable reason for his failure to pay the <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">correct </span>amount of docket fees within the prescribed period, like fraud, accident, mistake, excusable negligence, or a similar supervening casualty, without fault on the part of the appellant. x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>Clearly, the case applies to a situation where payment of the docket fees was made albeit incomplete. In the instant case, no payment was made by petitioner at all.&nbsp; Even assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that <span style="font-style: italic;">Yambao </span>is applicable to petitioner’s case, still, the Court sees no justifiable reason to allow this Court to relax the strict application of the Rules.<br><br>Likewise assuming for the sake of argument that consideration be given to petitioner’s willingness to comply with the rules since he attached postal money orders to his motion for reconsideration, the broader interest of justice will still not be served if petitioner’s appeal is reinstated.&nbsp; On one hand, petitioner calls for leniency to enable him to establish his case.&nbsp; On the other hand is respondent, which has been embroiled in a decades-long waiting game.&nbsp; The long-running dispute could be recapped thus: (1) petitioner’s predecessor-in-interest, Thelma, obtained a loan from respondent secured by a Real Estate Mortgage on the subject property; (2) Thelma was unable to pay the loan thereby causing foreclosure of the Real Estate Mortgage; (3) petitioner filed his civil action to question the validity of the public auction sale only on October 27, 1993 or 10 years after the sale was conducted; and, (4)&nbsp; from the time of the consolidation of title in the name of respondent in 1984 until the present, spouses De la Cruz have been in possession of the foreclosed property.<br><br>Petitioner and his sister Ruth Julian de la Cruz (Ruth) know that their mother Thelma has already lost ownership rights to the property in question when the latter defaulted in her payment to respondent and none of her successors-in-interest redeemed the property within the prescribed period.&nbsp; This is the reason why Ruth and her husband offered to purchase the property from respondent.&nbsp; However, when the said spouses De la Cruz defaulted in their payment, they refused to surrender the property to respondent.&nbsp; For his part, petitioner reinforces such refusal to surrender by questioning the validity of the public auction sale.<br><br>Now petitioner comes before this Court praying for leniency in the interest of justice. It must be stressed, however, that it is only when persuasive reasons exist that the Rules may be relaxed to spare a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the prescribed procedure. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the Court finds that petitioner is under no threat of suffering an injustice.&nbsp; On the contrary, it will be the height of injustice if the Court accords petitioner leniency and reinstates his appeal as this would mean further waiting on the part of the respondent which has long been deprived of its right to possess the property it owns.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
