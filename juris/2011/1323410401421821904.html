Garcia averred that the GSIS RFP was part and parcel of the compensation package that GSIS may provide for its personnel, by virtue of the powers granted to its Board of Trustees under Section 41(m) and (n) of Republic Act No. 8291.&nbsp; Garcia said that the appeal process would commence only upon GSIS's receipt of the particulars of the disallowances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, Garcia requested Dimagiba to withdraw the notices of disallowance "in the interest of industrial peace in the GSIS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Without responding to Garcia's August 27, 2001 Memorandum, Dimagiba issued the following Notices of Disallowance on the grounds that:<br><br><blockquote>Pursuant to legal opinion of the General Counsel dated August 7, 2001, Board Resolution No. 360 dated Nov. 21, 2000 as amended by No. 6 dated Jan. 16, 2001 approving the Employees Loyalty Incentive Plan (ELIP) is null and void for being directly in conflict with Section 28(b) of CA No. 186 as amended by RA 4968 which bars the creation of supplemental retirement scheme and of Section 41 (n) of RA 8291 which speaks of an early retirement plan or financial assistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Notices of Disallowance dated September 19, 2001</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></div>&nbsp; <table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="CENTER"><b>Notice of Disallowance No./Period covered:</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER"><b>Payee</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER"><b>Amount Disallowed</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER"><b>Persons Liable:</b> <br> Board of Trustees; Lourdes Patag (SVP),<br>&nbsp; Gloria Caedo (VP-SIAMS II), the payee,<br>&nbsp; and the following officers: </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"> <p>2001-01-412/ <br> December 2000 </p> </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Marina Santamaria </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">P6,895,545.84 </div></td> <td rowspan="2" valign="MIDDLE"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Richard Martinez Lea M.

Time and again, it has been held that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence -- <i>interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi</i>.&nbsp; Thus, if diverse statutes relate to the same thing, they ought to be taken into consideration in construing any one of them, as it is an established rule of law that all acts in <i>pari materia</i> are to be taken together, as if they were one law.&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br>While Republic Act No. 8291 speaks of an <b>early retirement incentive plan</b> <b>or financial assistance</b> for the GSIS employees, Commonwealth Act No. 186 as amended by the Teves Retirement Law talks about <b>insurance or retirement plans other than our existing retirement laws</b>.&nbsp; In other words, what the Teves Retirement Law contemplates and prohibits are <b>separate</b> retirement or insurance plans.&nbsp; In fact, the very same provision declared inoperative or abolished all supplementary retirement or pension plans.<br><br><b><i>The GSIS Retirement/Financial<br> </i></b> <b><i>Plan is Null and Void </i></b><br><br>It is true that under Section 41(n) of Republic Act No. 8291, GSIS is expressly granted the power to adopt a retirement plan and/or financial assistance for its employees, but a closer look at the provision readily shows that this power is not absolute.&nbsp; It is qualified by the words "early," "incentive," and "for the purpose of retirement."&nbsp; The retirement plan must be an <b>early</b> retirement <b>incentive</b> plan and such early retirement incentive plan or financial assistance must be <b>for the purpose of retirement</b>.<br><br>According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary, "early" means "occurring before the expected or usual time," while "incentive" means "serving to encourage, rouse, or move to action," or "something that constitutes a motive or spur."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>It is clear from the foregoing that Section 41(n) of Republic Act No. 8291 contemplates a situation wherein GSIS, due to a reorganization, a streamlining of its organization, or some other circumstance, which calls for the termination of some of its employees, must design a plan to encourage, induce, or motivate these employees, who are <b>not yet qualified</b> for either optional or compulsory retirement under our laws, to instead voluntarily retire.&nbsp; This is the very reason why under the law, the retirement plan to be adopted is in reality an incentive scheme to encourage the employees to retire before their retirement age.<br><br>The above interpretation applies equally to the phrase "financial assistance," which, contrary to the petitioners' assertion, should not be read independently of the purpose of an early retirement incentive plan.&nbsp; Under the doctrine of <i>noscitur a sociis</i>, the construction of a particular word or phrase, which is in itself ambiguous, or is equally susceptible of various meanings, may be made clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is found or with which it is associated.&nbsp; In other words, the obscurity or doubt of the word or phrase may be reviewed by reference to associated words.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the phrase "financial assistance," in light of the preceding words with which it is associated, should also be construed as an incentive scheme to induce employees to retire early or as an assistance plan to be given to employees retiring earlier than their retirement age.<br><br>Such is not the case with the GSIS RFP.&nbsp; Its very objective, "[t]o motivate and reward employees for meritorious, faithful, and satisfactory service,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> contradicts the nature of an <b>early retirement incentive plan, or a financial assistance plan</b>, which involves a substantial amount that is given to motivate employees to retire <i>early</i>. Instead, it falls exactly within the purpose of a <b>retirement benefit</b>, which is a form of reward for an employee's loyalty and <i>lengthy</i> service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> in order to help him or her enjoy the remaining years of his life.<br><br>Furthermore, to be able to apply for the GSIS RFP, one must be qualified to retire under Republic Act No. 660 or Republic Act No. 8291, or must have previously retired under our existing retirement laws.&nbsp; This only means that the employees covered by the GSIS RFP were those who were already eligible to retire or had already retired.&nbsp; Certainly, this is not included in the scope of "an early retirement incentive plan or financial assistance for the purpose of retirement."<br><br>The fact that GSIS changed the name from "Employees Loyalty Incentive Plan" to "Retirement/Financial Plan" does not change its essential nature.&nbsp; A perusal of the plan shows that its purpose is not to encourage GSIS's employees to retire before their retirement age, but to augment the retirement benefits they would receive under our present laws. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <b>Without a doubt, the GSIS RFP is a supplementary retirement plan, which is prohibited by the Teves Retirement Law.</b><br><br><i>Conte v.

Under SSS Resolution No. 56, those who retire under Republic Act No. 660 would be given a "financial assistance" equivalent in amount to the difference between what a retiree would have received under Republic Act No. 1616, less what he was entitled to under Republic Act No. 660.&nbsp; COA disallowed in audit all claims for financial assistance under SSS Resolution No. 56 for being similar to those separate retirement plans or incentive/separation pay plans adopted by other government corporate agencies, which resulted in the increase of benefits beyond what was allowed under existing retirement laws.&nbsp; This Court sustained COA's disallowance and held that SSS Resolution No. 56 constituted a supplementary retirement plan proscribed by Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Republic Act No. 4968. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The petitioners argue that <i>Conte</i> finds no application in this case, since SSS had no authority under its charter to adopt such a resolution, unlike the GSIS, which was cloaked with authority to issue the questioned resolutions. Furthermore, petitioners argue that Republic Act No. 8291 became effective in 1997, which was after this Court had already decided the <i>Conte</i> case.<br><br>We find no merit in the petitioners' arguments.&nbsp; The laws have not changed, and the doctrine in <i>Conte</i> has not been overturned or abandoned. The fact that Republic Act No. 8291 was approved and enacted after <i>Conte</i> is of no moment, as what was interpreted in <i>Conte</i> was the provision in the Teves Retirement Law in issue here.&nbsp; Moreover, we have already discussed above how such provision has neither been repealed nor modified by Section 41(n) of Republic Act No. 8291.&nbsp; Thus, it is just fitting that we find guidance in the application and interpretation of Section 28(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended by Republic Act No. 4968, from the <i>Conte</i> case.<br><br>As we have held in that case:<br><br><blockquote>Section 28(b) [of C.A.

It was intended for employees who were already eligible to retire under existing retirement laws.&nbsp; While the GSIS may have been clothed with authority to adopt an early retirement or financial assistance plan, such authority was limited by the very law it was seeking to implement.<br><br>Borrowing this Court's words in the <i>Conte </i>case, "it is beyond cavil that [the GSIS Retirement/Financial Plan] contravenes [Section 28(b) of C.A. No. 186 as amended by R.A.

We gave the rationale for this as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Such would run counter to the policy of this Court against double compensation for exactly the same services.&nbsp; More important, it would be in violation of the first paragraph of Section 8 of Article IX-B of the Constitution, which proscribes additional, double, or indirect compensation.&nbsp; Said provision reads:<br><blockquote>No elective or appointive public officer or employee shall receive additional, double, or indirect compensation, unless specifically authorized by law... .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Our ruling therein is likewise applicable in this case.&nbsp; To credit the years of service of GSIS retirees in their previous government office into the computation of their retirement benefits under the GSIS RFP, notwithstanding the fact that they had received or had been receiving the retirement benefits under the applicable retirement law they retired in, would be to countenance double compensation for exactly the same services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>To emphasize COA's "distaste"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> for the huge retirement benefits of GSIS's board members, officers, and employees, who are already receiving significantly higher salaries than their counterparts in other government agencies, COA illustrated the glaring discrepancy between what a GSIS employee would get under the GSIS RFP, and what a mere GSIS member would get under applicable retirement laws:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="text-decoration: underline;">GSIS EMPLOYEE vs GSIS MEMBER not covered by [GSIS RFP]</i><br></div><br><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>GSIS EMPLOYEE</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>SALARY GRADE</b> </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>GSIS MEMBER</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">GSIS Vice-President </div></td> <td style="text-align: center;"> 27 </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Director III </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">46.36895 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Length of Service </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">46.36895 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">P110,775.00 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Basic Salary </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">P25,223.00 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">65 years old </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Age at Retirement </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">65 years old </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">August 21, 2001 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Date of Retirement </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">August 21, 2001 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">April 8, 1954 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">First Day in Govt Service </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">April 8, 1954 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">April 8, 1954 </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">First Day in GSIS/Other office </div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">April 8, 1954 </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">BENEFITS UNDER DIFFERENT MODES OF RETIREMENT<br></div><br><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="3"> <div align="CENTER"><b>[GSIS Employee]</b> </div></td> <td colspan="4"><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;

While it is true that a better compensation package will not only attract more competent and capable individuals to work in GSIS, but will also ensure that they remain loyal and faithful therein, this has already been addressed by the GSIS employees' exemption from Republic Act No. 678 or the Salary Standardization Law (SSL), under Sec. 43(d) of Republic Act No. 8291.&nbsp; As shown in the above tables, the salary of a GSIS employee is much higher compared to his counterpart in another government agency.&nbsp; This remains to be true even with the recent increase of the salaries in the SSL.<br><br>The petitioners also question COA's authority to nullify the resolutions involved in this case.&nbsp; It must be remembered that none of the COA decisions nullified the Board Resolutions adopted by GSIS's Board of Trustees.&nbsp; What the COA decisions affirmed were the disallowances made by GSIS's own Corporate Auditor, Dimagiba.&nbsp; It is irrelevant that COA, in its decisions, touched upon issues not brought before it, or that it referred to its general counsel's opinion on the GSIS RFP, as these were done only to reinforce COA's position.&nbsp; They have no bearing upon the weight of COA's decisions, which are based upon our existing laws and jurisprudence.<br><br>As for Dimagiba, while she may have relied on the opinion of COA's legal counsel to support the disallowances she had made, it is worthy to note that she had already informed Garcia of the GSIS RFP's illegality even before she sought COA's opinion on the matter.&nbsp; Moreover, neither Dimagiba's nor COA's confidence in the opinion of COA's general counsel could be faulted, as under Presidential Decree No. 1445, or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, one of the responsibilities of COA's legal office is to interpret pertinent laws and auditing rules and regulations, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 11.&nbsp; <i>The Legal Office</i>. -The Legal Office shall be charged with the following responsibilities:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Perform advisory and consultative functions and render legal services with respect to the performance of the functions of the Commission and the interpretation of pertinent laws and auditing rules and regulations; x x x.</div></blockquote><br>In view of the above, we can hardly impute grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of respondents COA, Escarda, and Dimagiba, for disallowing in audit the portion of retirement benefits in excess of what is allowed under our existing retirement laws.&nbsp; On the contrary, they acted with caution, diligence, and vigilance in the exercise of their duties, especially since what was involved were huge amounts of money imbued with public interest, since GSIS's funds come from the contributions of its members.&nbsp; Thus, GSIS's business is to keep in trust the money belonging to its members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> who are not limited to its own employees.<br><br><b><i>The Payees are Liable for the </i></b> <b><i>Return of the<br> Disallowed Benefits </i></b> <b><i>Under the GSIS RFP </i></b><br><br>The petitioners claim that GSIS's Board of Trustees cannot be held liable as they were acting pursuant to a valid law when they adopted the GSIS RFP.&nbsp; The petitioners also argue that the implementation of the GSIS RFP was merely ministerial, thus the GSIS officers held accountable under the Notices of Disallowance should not be held responsible and accountable for the allocation and release of the benefits under the GSIS RFP.<br><br>This Court agrees that only the payees should be held liable for the return of the disallowed amounts under the GSIS RFP.<br><br>Although it is true that as early as December 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Dimagiba already questioned the legality of the GSIS RFP, it was only in August 2001 when GSIS received COA's opinion on the matter.&nbsp; Moreover, COA first decided the issue only in 2002.<br><br>While the Board of Trustees believed they had the authority and power to adopt the GSIS RFP, the officers on the other hand believed that they were implementing a valid resolution.&nbsp; As we said in <i>Buscaino</i> <i>v.
