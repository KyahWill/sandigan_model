Africa, Manuel H. Nieto, Jr., Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Ferdinand R.

The petitioner alleged, inter alia, that the respondents illegally manipulated the purchase of the major shareholdings of Cable and Wireless Limited in Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (<i>ETPI</i>), which shareholdings respondents Jose Africa and Manuel Nieto, Jr. held for themselves and, through their holdings and the corporations they organized, beneficially for respondents Ferdinand E.

Later, the registered ETPI stockholders convened a special stockholders meeting wherein another set of board of directors was elected. As a result, two sets of ETPI board and officers were elected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Africa, as an ETPI stockholder, filed a petition for certiorari, with prayer for a temporary restraining order/preliminary injunction with the Sandiganbayan (<span style="font-weight: bold;">docketed as Civil Case No. 0130</span>), seeking to nullify the August 5, 1991 and August 9, 1991 Orders of the PCGG.&nbsp; These Orders directed Africa:<br><br><blockquote>[T]o account for his sequestered shares in ETPI and to cease and desist from exercising voting rights on the sequestered shares in the special stockholders’ meeting to be held on August 12, 1991, from representing himself as a director, officer, employee or agent of ETPI, and from participating, directly or indirectly[,] in the management of ETPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>During the pendency of Africa’s petition, Civil Case No. 0130, Africa filed a motion with the Sandiganbayan, alleging that since January 29, 1988 the PCGG had been “illegally ‘exercising’ the rights of stockholders of ETPI,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> especially in the election of the members of the board of directors. Africa prayed for the issuance of an order for the “calling and holding of [ETPI] annual stockholders meeting for 1992 under the [c]ourt’s control and supervision and prescribed guidelines.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In its November 13, 1992 resolution, the Sandiganbayan favored Africa’s motion in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is ordered that an annual stockholders meeting of the [ETPI], for 1992 be held on Friday, November 27, 1992, at 2:00 o’clock in the afternoon, at the ETPI Board Room, Telecoms Plaza, 7<sup>th</sup> Floor, 316 Gil J.

No. 107789), the PCGG filed with this Court a “Very Urgent Petition for Authority to Hold Special Stockholders’ Meeting for [the] Sole Purpose of Increasing [ETPI’s] Authorized Capital Stock” (<i>Urgent Petition</i>). In our May 7, 1996 Resolution, we referred this Urgent Petition to the Sandiganbayan for reception of evidence and <i>immediate</i> resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Sandiganbayan included the Urgent Petition in Civil Case No. 0130</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the proceedings to resolve the Urgent Petition, the testimony of Mr. Maurice V. Bane (former director and treasurer-in-trust of ETPI) was taken– at the petitioner’s instance and after serving notice of the deposition-taking on the respondents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> – on October 23 and 24, 1996 by way of deposition upon oral examination (<i>Bane deposition</i>) before Consul General Ernesto Castro of the Philippine Embassy in London, England.<br><br>Invoking Section 1, Rule 24 (of the old Rules of Court), purportedly allowing the petitioner to depose Bane <span style="font-weight: bold;">without leave of court, i.e., as a matter of right after the defendants have filed their answer</span>, the notice stated that “[t]he purpose of the deposition is for [Bane] to identify and testify on the facts set forth in his affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> x x x so as to prove the ownership issue in favor of [the petitioner] and/or establish the <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> factual foundation for sequestration of [ETPI’s] Class A stock in support of the [Urgent Petition].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The notice also states that the petitioner shall use the Bane deposition “in evidence… in the main case of Civil Case No. 0009.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> On the scheduled deposition date, only Africa was present and he cross-examined Bane.<br><br>On December 13, 1996, the Sandiganbayan resolved the Urgent Petition by granting authority to the PCGG (i) “to cause the holding of a special stockholders’ meeting of ETPI for the sole purpose of increasing ETPI’s authorized capital stock” and (ii) “to vote therein the sequestered Class ‘A’ shares of stock.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, a special stockholders meeting was held, as previously scheduled, on March 17, 1997 and the increase in ETPI’s authorized capital stock was “unanimously approved.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> From this ruling, Africa went to this Court via a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> docketed as <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 147214 (<span style="font-style: italic;">Africa’s petition</span>).</span><br><br>We jointly resolved the PCGG’s and Africa’s petitions, and ruled:<br><br><blockquote>This Court notes that, like in Africa’s motion to hold a stockholders meeting (to elect a board of directors), the Sandiganbayan, in the PCGG’s petition to hold a stockholders meeting (to amend the articles of incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock), again failed to apply the two-tiered test. On such determination hinges the validity of the votes cast by the PCGG in the stockholders meeting of March 17, 1997. This lapse by the Sandiganbayan leaves this Court with no other choice but to remand these questions to it for proper determination.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>WHEREFORE, this Court Resolved to REFER the petitions at bar to the Sandiganbayan for reception of evidence to determine whether there is a prima facie evidence showing that the sequestered shares in question are ill-gotten and there is an imminent danger of dissipation to entitle the PCGG to vote them in a stockholders meeting to elect the ETPI Board of Directors and to amend the ETPI Articles of Incorporation for the sole purpose of increasing the authorized capital stock of ETPI.</blockquote><br>The Sandiganbayan shall render a decision thereon within sixty (60) days from receipt of this Resolution and in conformity herewith.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">II.

The duty of the Court is mandatory and in those cases where it is discretionary, the initiative is upon the Court. Such being the case, the Court finds the Urgent Motion and/or Request for Judicial Notice as something which need not be acted upon as the same is considered redundant.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">On the matter of the [Bane deposition], [its] admission is done through the ordinary formal offer of exhibits wherein the defendant is given ample opportunity to raise objection on grounds provided by law.</span> Definitely, it is not under Article (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) 129 on judicial notice. [Emphasis ours]<br></blockquote><br>On November 6, 2000 and on several dates thereafter, the respondents separately filed their respective demurrers to evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> On the other hand, the petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the 2000 resolution, but was rebuffed by the Sandiganbayan in its April 3, 2001 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">(2001 resolution).</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IIc. <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Admit Supplemental Offer of</span></span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Evidence (Re: Deposition of Maurice Bane)</span><br><br>On November 16, 2001, the petitioner filed its 3<sup>rd</sup> Motion, seeking once more the admission of the Bane deposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> On February 7, 2002 (pending resolution of the respondents’ demurrers to evidence),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><span style="font-weight: bold;"> the Sandiganbayan promulgated the assailed 2002 resolution</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">denying the petitioner’s 3<sup>rd </sup>motion.</span> The Sandiganbayan ruled:<br><br><blockquote>But in the court’s view, it is not really a question of whether or not plaintiff has already rested its case as to obviate the further presentation of evidence. It is not even a question of whether the non-appearing defendants are deemed to have waived their right to cross-examine Bane as to qualify the admission of the deposition sans such cross-examination. Indeed, We do not see any need to dwell on these matters in view of this Court’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> rendered on April 1, 1998 which already denied the introduction in evidence of Bane’s deposition and<b> which has become final in view of plaintiff’s failure to file any motion for reconsideration or appeal within the 15-day reglementary period</b>. Rightly or wrongly, the resolution stands and for this court to grant plaintiff’s motion at this point in time would in effect sanction plaintiff’s disregard for the rules of procedure. Plaintiff has slept on its rights for almost two years and it was only in February of 2000 that it sought to rectify its ineptitude by filing a motion to reopen its case as to enable it to introduce and offer Bane’s deposition as additional evidence, or in the alternative for the court to take judicial notice of the allegations of the deposition. But how can such a motion be granted when it has been resolved as early as 1998 that the deposition is inadmissible. Without plaintiff having moved for reconsideration within the reglementary period, <b>the resolution has attained finality </b>and its effect cannot be undone by the simple expedient of filing a motion, which though purporting to be a novel motion, is <b>in reality a motion for reconsideration of this court’s 1998 ruling</b>. [emphases ours]</blockquote><br>The resolution triggered the filing of the present petition.<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE PETITION</span><br></div><br>The petitioner filed the present petition claiming that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;

thus, the petitioner’s failure to question this 1998 resolution could not have given it a character of “finality” so long as the main case remains pending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> On this basis, the petitioner concludes that the Sandiganbayan’s denial of its 3<sup>rd</sup> motion was plainly tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>On the issue of the Sandiganbayan’s refusal (in its 2002 resolution) either to take judicial notice of or to admit the Bane deposition as part of its evidence, the petitioner asserts that Civil Case No. 0130 (where the Bane deposition was originally taken, introduced and admitted in evidence) is but a “child” of the “parent” case, Civil Case No. 0009; under this relationship, evidence offered and admitted in any of the “children” cases should be considered as evidence in the “parent” case.<br><br>Lastly, the petitioner claims that given the crucial importance of the Bane deposition, the Sandiganbayan should not have denied its admission on “flimsy grounds,” considering that:<br><ol><li>It was also already stated in the notice (of the taking of the Bane deposition) t<span style="font-weight: bold;">hat it would be used as evidence in Civil Case No. 0009.</span>&nbsp; Notices having been duly served on all the parties concerned, they must accordingly be deemed to have <span style="font-weight: bold;">waived </span>their right to cross-examine the witness when they failed to show up.<br><br></li><li>The Bane deposition was a very <span style="font-weight: bold;">vital</span> cog in the case of the petitioner relative to its allegation that the respondents’ interest in ETPI and related firms properly belongs to the government.<br><br></li><li>The non-inclusion of the Bane deposition in the petitioner’s formal offer of evidence was obviously <span style="font-weight: bold;">excusable</span> considering the period that had lapsed from the time the case was filed and the voluminous records that the present case has generated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></li></ol><br><center style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">THE RESPONDENTS’ COMMENTS<br>and THE PETITIONER’S REPLY</center><br><br>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">respondents’ Comments</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (filed in compliance with our Resolution of April 10, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>), they claim that the present petition was filed out of time - <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, beyond the 60-day reglementary period prescribed under Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This assertion proceeds from the view that the petitioner’s 3<sup>rd</sup> motion, being a mere rehash of similar motions earlier filed by the petitioner, likewise simply assails the Sandiganbayan’s 1998 resolution.&nbsp; Along the same line, they posit that the petitioner’s 3<sup>rd</sup> motion actually partakes of a proscribed third motion for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan’s 1998 resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> They likewise assert, on the assumption that the 1998 resolution is interlocutory in character, that the petitioner’s failure to contest the resolution by way of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>within the proper period gave the 1998 resolution a character of “finality.”<br><br>The respondents further claim that after a party <i>has rested its case</i>, the admission of a supplemental offer of evidence requires the reopening of the case at the discretion of the trial court; the Sandiganbayan simply exercised its sound discretion in refusing to reopen the case since the evidence sought to be admitted was “within the knowledge of the [petitioner] and available to [it] before [it] rested its case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; The respondents also advert to the belated filing of the petitioner’s 3<sup>rd</sup> motion – <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, after the respondents had filed their respective demurrers to evidence.<br><br>On the petitioner’s claim of waiver, the respondents assert that they have not waived their right to cross-examine the deponent; the Sandiganbayan recognized this right in its 1998 resolution and the petitioner never questioned this recognition. They also assert that the allegations in the Bane deposition cannot be a proper subject of judicial notice under Rule 129 of the Rules of Court. The respondents lastly submit that the Bane deposition is inadmissible in evidence because the petitioner failed to comply with the requisites for admission under Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In its <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reply</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the petitioner defends the timeliness of the present petition by arguing that a party may opt to wait out and collect a pattern of questionable acts before resorting to the extraordinary remedy of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>. The petitioner stresses that it filed the 3<sup>rd</sup> motion precisely because of the Sandiganbayan’s 2000 resolution, which held that the admission of the Bane deposition should be done through the ordinary formal offer of evidence. Thus, the Sandiganbayan seriously erred in considering the petitioner’s 3rd motion as a proscribed motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; The petitioner generally submits that the dictates of substantial justice should have guided the Sandiganbayan to rule otherwise.<br><br>The petitioner also clarifies that it has not yet rested its case although it has filed a formal offer of evidence.

If the order or resolution, however, merely resolves incidental matters and leaves something more to be done to resolve the merits of the case, the order is interlocutory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and the aggrieved party’s remedy is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65.&nbsp; Jurisprudence pointedly holds that:<br><br><blockquote>As distinguished from a final order which disposes of the subject matter in its entirety or terminates a particular proceeding or action, leaving nothing else to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined by the court, an interlocutory order does not dispose of a case completely, but leaves something more to be adjudicated upon. The term “final” judgment or order signifies a judgment or an order which disposes of the case as to all the parties, reserving no further questions or directions for future determination.<br><br>On the other hand, a court order is merely interlocutory in character if it leaves substantial proceedings yet to be had in connection with the controversy.&nbsp; It does not end the task of the court in adjudicating the parties’ contentions and determining their rights and liabilities as against each other.&nbsp; In this sense, it is basically <span style="font-weight: bold;">provisional in its application</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Under these guidelines, we agree with the petitioner that the 1998 resolution is interlocutory.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan’s denial of the petitioner’s 1st motion through the 1998 Resolution came at a time when the petitioner had not even concluded the presentation of its evidence. Plainly, the denial of the motion did not resolve the merits of the case, as something still had to be done to achieve this end.<br><br>We clarify, too, that an interlocutory order remains under the control of the court until the case is finally resolved on the merits. The court may therefore modify or rescind the order upon sufficient grounds shown at any time before final judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; In this light, the Sandiganbayan’s 1998 resolution – which merely denied the adoption of the Bane deposition as part of the evidence in Civil Case No. 0009 – could not have attained finality (in the manner that a decision or final order resolving the case on the merits does) despite the petitioner’s failure to move for its reconsideration or to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">I (b).

This is a fatal defect in the petitioner’s case.<br><br>Although the denial of the petitioner’s first motion did not necessitate an immediate recourse to the corrective writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari,</span> the denial of the 2<sup>nd</sup> motion dictated a different course of action. The petitioner’s non-observance of the proper procedure for the admission of the Bane deposition, while seemingly innocuous, carried fatal implications for its case.&nbsp; Having been rebuffed on its first attempt to have the Bane deposition adopted in Civil Case No. 0009, and without seeking reconsideration of the denial, the petitioner presented its other pieces of evidence and eventually rested its case. This time, the petitioner forgot about the Bane deposition and so failed to include that piece of evidence in its formal offer of evidence.<br><br>More than two years later, the petitioner again tried to squeeze in the Bane deposition into its case. In resolving the petitioner’s motion for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan’s 2000 resolution, the Sandiganbayan held that the Bane deposition has “become part and parcel” of Civil Case No. 0009. This pronouncement has obscured the real status of the Bane deposition as evidence (considering that, earlier, the Sandiganbayan already denied the petitioner’s attempt to adopt the Bane deposition as evidence in Civil Case No. 0009 for the deponent cannot be cross-examined in court). Nevertheless, the Sandiganbayan <span style="font-style: italic;">ultimately denied</span> the petitioner’s motion to reopen the case. Having judicially admitted the resting of its case, the petitioner should have already questioned the denial of its 2nd motion by way of<span style="font-style: italic;"> certiorari,</span> since the denial of its attempt to reopen the case effectively foreclosed all avenues available to it for the consideration of the Bane deposition. Instead of doing so, however, t<span style="font-weight: bold;">he petitioner allowed the 60-day reglementary period, under Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, to lapse</span>, and proceeded to file its 3rd motion.<br><br>Significantly, the petitioner changed its legal position in its 3<sup>rd</sup> motion by denying having rested its case and insisting on the introduction of the Bane deposition. Rebuffed once more, the petitioner filed the present petition, inviting our attention to the Sandiganbayan’s resolutions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> which allegedly gave it “mixed signals.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> By pointing to these resolutions, ironically, even the petitioner impliedly recognized that they were then already ripe for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>.

Having been <span style="font-style: italic;">ultimately</span> denied by the court, the petitioner could not have been prevented from taking the proper remedy notwithstanding any perceived ambiguity in the resolutions.<br><br>On the other end, though, there was nothing intrinsically objectionable in the petitioner’s motion to reopen its case before the court ruled on its formal offer of evidence. The Rules of Court does not prohibit a party from requesting the court to allow it to present additional evidence even after it has rested its case. Any such opportunity, however, for the ultimate purpose of the admission of additional evidence is already addressed to the <span style="font-style: italic;">sound discretion of the court</span>.&nbsp; It is from the prism of the exercise of this discretion that the Sandiganbayan’s refusal to reopen the case (for the purpose of introducing, “marking and offering” additional evidence) should be viewed.&nbsp; We can declare this Sandiganbayan action invalid if it had acted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">III.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The Sandiganbayan gravely abused its <br>discretion in ultimately refusing to reopen <br>the case for the purpose of introducing and <br>admitting in evidence the Bane deposition</span></span><br><br>The basis for a motion to reopen a case to introduce further evidence is Section 5, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5.

While the general rule is rightly recognized, the Code of Civil Procedure authorizes the judge “for special reasons,” to change the order of the trial, and "for good reason, in the furtherance of justice," to permit the parties “to offer evidence upon their original case.” These exceptions are made stronger when one considers the character of registration proceedings and the fact that where so many parties are involved, and action is taken quickly and abruptly, conformity with precise legal rules should not always be expected. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Even at the risk of violating legal <span style="font-style: italic;">formulæ,</span> an opportunity should be given to parties to submit additional corroborative evidence in support of their claims of title, if the ends of justice so require.</span> (emphases ours)<br></blockquote><br>In his commentaries, Chief Justice Moran had this to say:<br><br><blockquote>However, the court for good reasons, may, in the furtherance of justice, permit the parties to offer evidence upon their original case, and its ruling will not be disturbed where no abuse of discretion appears, Generally, <span style="font-weight: bold;">additional evidence </span>is allowed when x x x;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> but it may be properly disallowed where it was withheld deliberately and without justification</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote><br>The weight of the exception is also recognized in foreign jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Under these guidelines, we hold that the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the case</span>.

We note that there is nothing that would even suggest that the Sandiganbayan in fact intended a merger of causes of action, parties and evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> To be sure, there would have been no need for a motion to adopt (which did not remain unopposed) the testimonies in the incident cases had a merger actually resulted from the order of consolidation, for in that case, the Sandiganbayan can already take judicial notice of the same.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Significantly, even the petitioner itself <span style="font-style: italic;">viewed</span> consolidation, at most, to be merely a consolidation for trial</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Accordingly, despite the consolidation in 1993, the petitioner acceded to the Sandiganbayan’s 1998 Resolution (which denied the petitioner’s 1<sup>st</sup> Motion on the ground that the witnesses, whose testimony in the incident cases is sought to be adopted, “are not available for cross-examination in” the Sandiganbayan) <span style="font-style: italic;">by presenting these other witnesses again in the main case, so that the respondents can cross-examine them</span>.<br><br>These considerations run counter to the conclusion that the Sandiganbayan’s order of consolidation had actually resulted in the complete merger of the incident cases with the main case, in the <span style="font-style: italic;">sense of actual consolidation</span>, and that the parties in these consolidated cases had (at least constructively) been aware of and had allowed actual consolidation without objection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Considering, too, that the consolidated actions were originally independent of one another and the fact that in the present case the party respondents to Civil Case No. 0009 (an action for reconveyance, accounting, restitution and damages) are not parties to Civil Case No. 0130 (a special civil action filed by an ETPI stockholder involving a corporate squabble within ETPI), the conclusion that the Sandiganbayan in fact intended an <span style="font-style: italic;">actual consolidation </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>, together with the parties affected,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> acted towards that end - where the actions become fused and unidentifiable from one another and where the evidence appreciated in one action is also appreciated in another action – must find support in the proceedings held below. This is particularly true in a case with the magnitude and complexity of the present case. Otherwise, to impose upon the respondents the effects of an actual consolidation (which find no clear support in the provisions of the Rules of Court, jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> and even in the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan itself and despite the aforementioned considerations) results in an outright deprivation of the petitioner’s right to due process.

While a f<span style="font-style: italic;">ormer testimony or deposition</span> appears under the Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule, the classification of former testimony or deposition as an admissible hearsay is not universally conceded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> A fundamental characteristic of hearsay evidence is the adverse party’s lack of opportunity to cross-examine the out-of-court declarant. However, Section 47, Rule 130 explicitly requires, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia,</span> for the admissibility of a former <span style="font-style: italic;">testimony or deposition</span> that the adverse party must have had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness or the deponent in the prior proceeding.<br><br>This opportunity to cross-examine though is not the ordinary cross-examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> afforded an adverse party in usual trials regarding “matters stated in the direct examination or connected therewith.” Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court contemplates a different kind of cross-examination, whether actual or a mere opportunity, whose adequacy depends on the requisite identity of issues in the former case or proceeding and in the present case where the former testimony or deposition is sought to be introduced.<br><br>Section 47, Rule 130 requires that the issues involved in both cases must, at least, be substantially the same; otherwise, there is no basis in saying that the former statement was - or would have been - sufficiently tested by cross-examination or by an opportunity to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (The requirement of similarity though does not mean that all the issues in the two proceedings should be the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Although some issues may not be the same in the two actions, the admissibility of a former testimony on an issue which is similar in both actions cannot be questioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup>)<br><br>These considerations, among others, make Section 47, Rule 130 a distinct rule on evidence and therefore should not be confused with the general provisions on deposition under Rule 23 of the Rules of Court. In other words, even if the petitioner complies with Rule 23 of the Rules of Court on the use of depositions, the observance of Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court cannot simply be avoided or disregarded.<br><br>Undisputably, the Sandiganbayan relied on the Bane deposition, taken in Civil Case No. 0130, for purposes of this very same case.

The aching question is whether the petitioner complied with the latter rule.<br><br>Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court lays down the following requisites for the <span style="font-style: italic;">admission</span> of a testimony or deposition given at a former case or proceeding.<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; The testimony or deposition of a witness deceased or otherwise unable to testify;<br>2.&nbsp; The testimony was given in a former case or proceeding, judicial or administrative;<br>3.&nbsp; Involving the same parties;<br>4.&nbsp; Relating to the same matter;<br>5.&nbsp; The adverse party having had the opportunity to cross-examine him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup></blockquote><br>The reasons for the admissibility of testimony or deposition taken at a former trial or proceeding are the necessity for the testimony and its trustworthiness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup>&nbsp; However, before the <span style="font-style: italic;">former testimony or deposition</span> can be introduced in evidence, <span style="font-style: italic;">the proponent must first lay the proper predicate </span>therefor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> i.e.</span>, the party must establish the basis for the admission of the Bane deposition in the realm of admissible evidence.&nbsp; This basis is the prior issue that we must now examine and resolve.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">IV (c). Unavailability of witness</span><br><br>For the admission of <span style="font-style: italic;">a former testimony or deposition, </span>Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court simply requires,<span style="font-style: italic;"> inter alia, </span>that the witness or deponent be “<span style="font-style: italic;">deceased or unable to testify.</span>” On the other hand, in using a deposition that was taken <span style="font-style: italic;">during the pendency of an action</span>, Section 4, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court provides several grounds that will justify dispensing with the actual testimony of the deponent in open court and specifies, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, the circumstances of the deponent’s inability to attend or testify, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(3) that the witness is <span style="font-weight: bold;">unable</span> to attend or <span style="font-weight: bold;">testify</span> because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment[.] [emphases ours]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The phrase “unable to testify” appearing in both Rule 23 and Rule 130 of the Rules of Court refers to a physical inability to appear at the witness stand and to give a testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Hence notwithstanding the deletion of the phrase “out of the Philippines,” which previously appeared in Section 47, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, <span style="font-style: italic;">absence from jurisdiction</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> - the petitioner’s excuse for the non-presentation of Bane in open court - may still constitute inability to testify under the same rule.

For purposes of the <span style="font-style: italic;">present</span> case (Civil Case No. 0009), however, the Sandiganbayan would have no basis to presume, and neither can or should we, that the previous condition, which previously allowed the use of the deposition, remains and would thereby justify the use of the same deposition in <span style="font-style: italic;">another case or proceeding,</span> even if the other case or proceeding is before the same court.

While Africa and the respondents are all ETPI stockholders, this commonality does not establish at all any privity between them for purposes of binding the latter to the acts or omissions of the former respecting the cross-examination of the deponent.

For this reason, courts are given ample powers to forbid discovery which is intended not as an aid to litigation, but merely to annoy, embarrass or oppress either the deponent or the adverse party, or both.&nbsp; (emphasis ours)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>In the present case, not only did the Sandiganbayan fail to rule on respondent Enrile’s Opposition (which is equally applicable to his co-respondents), it also failed to provide even the bare minimum “safeguards for the protection of,” (more so) <span style="font-style: italic;">non-parties</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> and to ensure that these safeguards are firmly maintained. Instead, the Sandiganbayan simply bought the petitioner’s assertion (that the taking of Bane deposition is a matter of right) and treated the lingering concerns – e.g., reasonability of the notice; and the non-party status of the respondents in Civil Case No. 0130 - at whose incident (docketed as G.R.

To reiterate, although the Sandiganbayan considered the Bane deposition in resolving Civil Case No. 0130, its action was premised on Africa’s status as a party in that case where the Bane deposition was taken.<br><br>Corollarily, the idea of privity also permeates Rule 23 of the Rules of Court through its Section 5 which provides:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Effect of substitution of parties.</span> — Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken; and, when an action has been dismissed and another action involving the same subject is afterward brought between t<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">he same parties or their representatives or successors in interest</span>, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken therefor. [italics and underscoring ours]<br></blockquote><br>In light of these considerations, we reject the petitioner’s claim that the respondents waived their right to cross-examination when they failed to attend the taking of the Bane deposition. Incidentally, the respondents’ vigorous insistence on their right to cross-examine the deponent speaks loudly that they never intended any waiver of this right.<br><br>Interestingly, the petitioner’s notice of the deposition-taking relied on Rule 23 of the Rules of Court. Section 15 of this rule reads:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Deposition upon oral examination; notice; time and place</span>. — A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examination shall give reasonable <span style="font-style: italic;">notice in writing to every other <span style="font-weight: bold;">party to the action</span>.</span> The notice shall state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group to which he belongs. On motion of any party upon whom the notice is served, the court may for cause shown enlarge or shorten the time.</blockquote><br>Under this provision, we do not believe that the petitioner could reasonably expect that the individual notices it sent to the respondents would be sufficient to bind them to the conduct of the then opponent’s (Africa’s) cross-examination since, to begin with, they were not even parties to the action.&nbsp; Additionally, we observe that in the notice of the deposition taking, conspicuously absent was any indication sufficient to forewarn the notified persons that their inexcusable failure to appear at the deposition taking would amount to a waiver of their right of cross-examination, without prejudice to the right of the respondents to raise their objections at the appropriate time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> We would be treading on dangerous grounds indeed were we to hold that <span style="font-weight: bold;">one not a party to an action, <span style="font-style: italic;">and neither in privity nor in substantial identity of interest </span>with any of the parties in the same action, can be bound by the action or omission of the latter, by the mere expedient of a notice</span>. Thus, we cannot simply deduce a resultant waiver from the respondents’ mere failure to attend the deposition-taking despite notice sent by the petitioner.<br><br>Lastly, we see no reason why the Bane deposition could not have been taken earlier in Civil Case No. 0009 – the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">principal action</span> where it was sought to be introduced – while Bane was still here in the Philippines. We note in this regard that the Philippines was no longer under the Marcos administration and had returned to normal democratic processes when Civil Case No. 0009 was filed. I<span style="font-style: italic;">n fact, the petitioner’s notice itself states that the “purpose of the deposition is for Mr. Maurice Bane to identify and testify on the facts set forth in his Affidavit,” which Mr. Bane had long executed in 1991 in Makati, Metro Manila</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Clearly, a deposition could then have been taken - without compromising the respondents’ right to cross-examine a witness against them - considering that the principal purpose of the deposition is chiefly a mode of discovery. These, to our mind, are avoidable omissions that, when added to the deficient handling of the present matter, add up to the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">gross deficiencies of the petitioner </span>in the handling of Civil Case No. 0009.<br><br>After failing to take Bane’s deposition in 1991 and in view of the peculiar circumstances of this case, the least that the petitioner could have done was to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">move</span> for the taking of the Bane deposition and proceed with the deposition immediately upon securing a favorable ruling thereon. On that occasion, where the respondents would have a chance to be heard, the respondents cannot avoid a resultant waiver of their right of cross-examination if they still fail to appear at the deposition-taking. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fundamental fairness dictates this course of action.</span> It must be stressed that not only were the respondents non-parties to Civil Case No. 0130, they likewise have no interest in Africa’s <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>petition asserting his right as an ETPI stockholder.<br><br>Setting aside the petitioner’s flip-flopping on its own representations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> this Court can only express dismay on why the petitioner had to let Bane leave the Philippines before taking his deposition despite having knowledge already of the substance of what he would testify on. Considering that the testimony of Bane is allegedly a “vital cog” in the petitioner’s case against the respondents, the Court is left to wonder why the petitioner had to take the deposition <span style="font-style: italic;">in an incident</span> case (instead of the main case) <span style="font-style: italic;">at a time when it became the technical</span> right of the petitioner to do so.<br><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">V.&nbsp; The petitioner cannot rely on principle of judicial notice</span><br><br>The petitioner also claims that since the Bane deposition had already been previously introduced and admitted in Civil Case No. 0130, then the Sandiganbayan should have taken judicial notice of the Bane deposition as part of its evidence.<br><br>Judicial notice is the cognizance of certain facts that judges may properly take and act on without proof because these facts are already known to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> Put differently, it is the assumption by a court of a fact without need of further traditional evidentiary support.

The petitioner itself admits that the present case has generated a lot of cases, which, in all likelihood, involve issues of varying complexity. If we follow the logic of the petitioner’s argument, we would be espousing judicial confusion by indiscriminately allowing the admission of evidence in one case, which was presumably found competent and relevant in another case, simply based on the supposed lineage of the cases. It is the duty of the petitioner, as a party-litigant, to properly lay before the court the evidence it relies upon in support of the relief it seeks, instead of imposing that same duty on the court. We invite the petitioner’s attention to our prefatory pronouncement in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lopez v. Sandiganbayan</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Down the oft-trodden path in our judicial system, by common sense, tradition and the law, the Judge in trying a case sees only with judicial eyes as he ought to know nothing about the facts of the case, except those which have been adduced judicially in evidence.

(underlining added)</blockquote><br>In light of this thrust, a discussion refuting the modified dissent is in order.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">First:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Contents of the Bane deposition not an Issue.</span>&nbsp; The dissent perfectly identified what is at issue in this case – <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">admissibility</span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> of the Bane deposition</span>. Admissibility is concerned with the competence <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> relevance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> of the evidence, whose admission is sought. While the dissent quoted at length the Bane deposition, it may not be amiss to point out that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the relevance of the Bane deposition</span> (or, to adopt the dissent’s characterization, whether “Maurice V. Bane is a vital witness”) is not an issue here unless it can be established <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span> that the Bane deposition is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">competent evidence</span>.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Misrepresentation of Cited Authority</span>. The dissent insists that “in Philippine Jurisprudence, the consolidation of cases merges the different actions into one and the rights of the parties are adjudicated in a single judgment,” citing Vicente J. Francisco. In our discussion on consolidation, we footnoted the following in response to the dissent’s position, which we will restate here for emphasis:<br><br><blockquote>In the 1966 edition of Vicente J. Francisco’s Revised Rules of Court, Francisco wrote:<br><br>The effect of consolidation of actions is to unite and merge all of the different actions consolidated into a single action, in the same manner as if the different causes of actions involved had originally been joined in a single action, and the order of consolidation, if made by a court of competent jurisdiction, is binding upon all the parties to the different actions until it is vacated or set aside. After the consolidation there can be no further proceedings in the separate actions, which are by virtue of the consolidation discontinued and superseded by a single action, which should be entitled in such manner as the court may direct, and all subsequent proceedings therein be conducted and the rights of the parties adjudicated in a single action (1 C.J.S., 113, pp. 1371-1372).<br><br>At the very beginning of the discussion on consolidation of actions in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Corpus Juris Secundum,</span> the following caveat appears:<br><br>The term consolidation is used in three different senses. First, where several actions are combined into one and lose their separate identity and become a single action in which a single judgment is rendered; second, where all except one of several actions are stayed until one is tried, in which case the judgment in the one is conclusive as to the others; third, where several actions are ordered to be tried together but each retains its separate character and requires the entry of a separate judgment. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The failure to distinguish between these methods of procedure, which are entirely distinct, the two latter, strictly speaking, not being consolidation, a fact which has not always been noted, has caused some confusion and conflict in the cases.</span> (1 C.J.S., 107, pp. 1341-1342) (Emphasis added).<br><br>In defining the term “consolidation of actions,” <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francisco provided a colatilla that the term “consolidation” is used in three different senses</span>, citing 1 C.J.S. 1341 and 1 Am. Jur. 477 (<span style="font-style: italic;">Francisco, Revised Rules of Court, </span>p. 348).<br></blockquote><br>From the foregoing, it is clear that the dissent appears to have quoted Francisco’s statement out of context. As it is, the issue of the effect of consolidation on evidence is at most an unsettled matter that requires the approach we did in the majority’s discussion on consolidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Third:</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Misappreciation of the Purpose of Consolidation</span>.</span> The dissent then turns to the purpose of consolidation – to “expeditiously settle the interwoven issues involved in the consolidated cases” and “the simplification of the proceedings.” It argues that this can only be achieved if the repetition of the same evidence is dispensed with.<br><br>It is unfortunate that the dissent refuses to recognize the fact that since consolidation is primarily addressed to the court concerned to aid it in dispatching its official business, it would be in keeping with the orderly trial procedure if the court should have a say on what consolidation would actually bring<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> (<span style="font-style: italic;">especially</span> where several cases are involved which have become relatively complex). In the present case, there is nothing in the proceedings below that would suggest that the Sandiganbayan or the parties themselves (the petitioner and the respondents) had in mind a consolidation <span style="font-style: italic;">beyond</span> joint hearing or trial. Why should this Court – which is not a trial court – impose a purported effect that has no factual or legal grounds?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fourth</span>:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Due Process Consideration</span>. The dissent argues that even if the consolidation only resulted in a joint hearing or trial, the “respondents are still bound by the Bane deposition considering that they were given notice of the deposition-taking.” <span style="font-weight: bold;">The issue here boils down to one of due process</span> – the fundamental reason why a hearsay statement (not subjected to the rigor of cross-examination) is generally excluded in the realm of admissible evidence –&nbsp; especially when read in light of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">general rule</span> that depositions are <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span> meant as substitute for the actual testimony, in open court, of a party or witness.<br><br>Respondent Enrile had a pending Opposition to the notice of deposition-taking (questioning the reasonableness thereof – an issue applicable to the rest of the respondents) which the Sandiganbayan failed to rule on. To make the Sandiganbayan’s omission worse, the Sandiganbayan blindly relied on the petitioner’s assertion that the deposition-taking was a matter of right and, thus, failed to address the consequences and/or issues that may arise from the apparently innocuous statement of the petitioner (that it intends to use the Bane deposition in Civil Case No. 0009, where only the respondents, and not Africa, are the parties).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> There is simply the absence of “due” in due process.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Fifth</span>:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Misstatement of the Sandiganbayan’s Action.</span> The dissent repeatedly misstates that the Sandiganbayan “granted” the request for the deposition-taking.&nbsp; For emphasis, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sandiganbayan did not “grant” the request</span> since the petitioner staunchly asserted that the deposition-taking was a <span style="font-style: italic;">matter of right</span>.&nbsp; No one can deny the complexity of the issues that these consolidated cases have reached.&nbsp; Considering the consolidation of cases of this nature, t<span style="font-weight: bold;">he most minimum of fairness demands upon the petitioner to <span style="font-style: italic;">move</span> for the taking of the Bane deposition and for the Sandiganbayan to make a ruling thereon</span> (including the opposition filed by respondent Enrile which equally applies to his co-respondents). The burgeoning omission and failures that have prevailed in this case cannot be cured by this Court without itself being guilty of violating the constitutional guarantee of due process.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Sixth:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues Posed and Resolved Go Beyond Technicalities.</span> The above conclusions, contrary to the petitioner’s claim, are not only matters of technicality.&nbsp; Admittedly, rules of procedure involve technicality, to which we have applied the liberality that technical rules deserve.&nbsp; But the resolution of the issues raised goes beyond pure or mere technicalities as the preceding discussions show. They involve issues of due process and basic unfairness to the respondents, particularly to respondent Enrile, who is portrayed in the Bane deposition to be acting in behalf of the Marcoses so that these shares should be deemed to be those of the Marcoses. They involved, too, principles upon which our rules of procedure are founded and which we cannot disregard without flirting with the violation of guaranteed substantive rights and without risking the disorder that these rules have sought to avert in the course of their evolution.<br><br>In the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> deliberations of December 6, 2011, the Court failed to arrive at a conclusive decision because of a tie vote (7-7, with one Justice taking no part).

First, where several actions are combined into one and lose their separate identity and become a single action in which a single judgment is rendered; second, where all except one of several actions are stayed until one is tried, in which case the judgment in the one is conclusive as to the others; third, where several actions are ordered to be tried together but each retains its separate character and requires the entry of a separate judgment. The failure to distinguish between these methods of procedure, which are entirely distinct, the two latter, strictly speaking, not being consolidation, a fact which has not always been noted, has caused some confusion and conflict in the cases. (1 C.J.S., 107, pp. 1341-1342) (Emphasis added).</blockquote><br>In defining the term “consolidation of actions,” Francisco provided a colatilla that the term “consolidation” is used in three different senses, citing 1 C.J.S. 1341 and 1 Am. Jur. 477 (Francisco, Revised Rules of Court, p. 348).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> The respondents vigorously opposed the petitioner’s motion to adopt the testimony of, among others, Maurice Bane, and the Sandiganbayan ruled in favor of the respondents, without the petitioner questioning this development until after two years later.

Among the defendants in the main Civil Case No. 0009, only Victor Africa appeared during the taking of the deposition.<br><br>On 22 January 1998, petitioner filed a motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> praying that it be allowed to adopt the testimonies of several of its witnesses in incidental Civil Case Nos. 0048, 0050, 0130 and 0146, including the deposition of Maurice V. Bane, as its evidence in the main case, Civil Case No. 0009. On 1 April 1998, the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution, denying in part the motion as regards the adoption of the testimony on oral deposition of Maurice V. Bane (and Rolando Gapud) as part of petitioner’s evidence in Civil Case No. 0009, “for the reason that said deponents according to the plaintiff, are not available for cross examination in this Court by the defendants.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 14 December 1999, petitioner made its <i>Formal Offer of Evidence </i>consisting of Exhibits “A” to “XX-27.” However, through oversight, petitioner failed to include among its exhibits the deposition of Maurice V. Bane. Thus, in its <i>Urgent Motion And/Or Request for Judicial Notice</i> dated 21 February 2000, petitioner prayed that it be allowed to introduce as additional evidence the deposition of Maurice V. Bane, or in the alternative, for the Sandiganbayan to take judicial notice of the facts established by the said deposition. On 21 August 2000, the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution denying petitioner’s motion. The Resolution stated:<br><br><blockquote>Allegedly the deposition of Maurice V. Bane was introduced as PCGG’s evidence in Civil Case No. 0130 (in relation to G.R. No. 107789) which is an incident of and consolidated with the above-entitled case in connection with PCGG’s “Very Urgent Petition for Authority to Hold Special Stockholders Meeting for the Purpose of Increasing ETPI’s Authorized Capital Stock” and the said deposition of Maurice V. Bane is now a part and parcel of the record of this main case.<br><br>Judicial notice is found under Rule 129 which is titled “What Need Not Be Proved.” Apparently, this provision refers to the Court’s duty to consider admissions made by the parties in the pleadings, or in the course of the trial or other proceedings in resolving cases before it. The duty of the Court is mandatory and in those cases where it is discretionary, the initiative is upon the Court. Such being the case, the Court finds the Urgent Motion and/or Request for judicial notice as something which need not be acted upon as the same is considered redundant.<br><br>On the matter of the deposition of Maurice V. Bane, the admission of the same is done through the ordinary formal offer of exhibits wherein the defendant is given ample opportunity to raise objection on grounds provided by law. Definitely, it is not under Article 129 on judicial notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which the Sandiganbayan denied in a Resolution issued on 3 April 2001. The Resolution stated:<br><br><blockquote>In the subject Resolution [issued on 21 August 2000], this Court ruled 
that the Urgent Motion and/or Request for Judicial Notice was something 
that need not be acted upon as the same was already<b> considered 
redundant, the deposition of Bane, having become part and parcel of the 
record of this main case since Civil Case No. 0130 is an incident to the
 same.<br><br></b>This Court further held that the admission of same is done through ordinary formal offer of exhibits wherein defendant is given ample opportunity to raise objection on grounds provided by law, and not under Rule 129 on judicial notice.<br><br>WHEREFORE, there being no other issue which merit consideration of this Court, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10 ]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>On 16 November 2001, petitioner filed a <i>Motion to Admit Supplemental Offer of Evidence (Re: Deposition of Maurice V. Bane)</i>, seeking once again the admission of the deposition. On 7 February 2002, the Sandiganbayan promulgated the assailed Resolution, denying petitioner’s motion. The Sandiganbayan ruled:<br><br><blockquote>The only issue that the court is actually called upon to address in the pending incident is whether or not We should allow plaintiff-movant’s <i>Supplemental Offer of Evidence</i> consisting of the deposition of Maurice V. Bane.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Defendants’ <i>Opposition</i> to the pending incident as well as plaintiff’s Reply to the <i>Opposition</i> gave various reasons why the motion should or should not be granted. But in the court’s view, it is not really a question of whether or not plaintiff has already rested its case as to obviate the further presentation of evidence. It is not even a question of whether the non-appearing defendants are deemed to have waived their right to cross-examine Bane as to qualify the admission of the deposition sans such cross-examination. Indeed, We do not see any need to dwell on these matters in view of this court’s Resolution rendered in April 1, 1998 which already denied the introduction in evidence of Bane’s deposition and which has become final in view of plaintiff’s failure to file any motion for reconsideration or appeal within the 15-day reglementary period. Rightly or wrongly, the resolution stands and for this court to grant plaintiff’s motion at this point in time would in effect sanction plaintiff’s disregard for the rules of procedure. Plaintiff has slept on its rights for almost two years and it was only in February of 2000 that it sought to rectify its ineptitude by filing a motion to reopen its case as to enable it to introduce and offer Bane’s deposition as additional evidence, or in the alternative for the court to take judicial notice of the allegations of the deposition. But how can such a motion be granted when it has been resolved as early as 1998 that the deposition is inadmissible. Without plaintiff having moved for reconsideration within the reglementary period, the resolution has attained finality and its effect cannot be undone by the simple expedient of filing a motion, which though purporting to be a novel motion, is in reality a motion for reconsideration of this court’s 1998 ruling. Hence, the subsequent motions, including the present incident are deemed moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, this petition for certiorari.<br><br>I vote to grant the petition.<br><br>It is important to note that the <i>Second Amended Notice to Take Deposition of Mr. Maurice V. Bane Upon Oral Examination</i>, filed on 25 September 1996, was <b>after</b> the consolidation of Civil Case No. 0130 with the main case, Civil Case No. 0009, through the Sandiganbayan Resolution dated 12 April 1993. This is evident in the caption of the notice, thus:<br><br><blockquote><center>REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES<br><br>SANDIGANBAYAN<br>MANILA<br><br><u>Third Division</u></center><br><br>Republic of the Philippines,<br><div style="margin-left: 120px;">Plaintiff,<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 280px;">CIVIL CASE NO. 0009<br></div>&nbsp; -versus-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Incident Case No. 0130<br><div style="margin-left: 280px;">and G.R.

Africa, one of the defendants in Civil Case No. 0009, has been substituted by his heirs, including his son Victor Africa. Thus, Justice Brion's statement that Victor Africa is “plainly not a party to Civil Case No. 0009”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> is misleading. Although Victor Africa was not originally impleaded in Civil Case No. 0009, Victor Africa became one of the substitute defendants in Civil Case No. 0009 upon the demise of Jose L. Africa. In fact, Victor Africa, as substitute defendant in Civil Case No. 0009, has filed with the Sandiganbayan several pleadings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and his <i>Offer of Evidence</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>All the defendants of Civil Case No. 0009 were given notice of the scheduled testimony by oral deposition of Maurice V.

No. 107789 as well as in the main case of Civil Case No. 0009</u>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Since notices have been duly served on all the defendants, those who failed to show up at the deposition-taking are deemed to have waived their right to appear and cross-examine the deponent. Indeed, under Section 4, Rule 23 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the deposition “<b>may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof</b>.” Section 4, Rule 23 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. Use of depositions. – At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding,<b> any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof</b>, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:<br><br>(a) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as witness;<br><br>(b) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of the taking of the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent of a public or private corporation, partnership, or association which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose;<br><br>(c) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: (1) that the witness is dead; or (2) <b>that the witness resides at a distance more than one hundred (100) kilometers from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the Philippines</b>, unless it appears that his absence was procured by the party offering the deposition; or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or (5) upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used; and<br><br>(d) if only part of the deposition is offered in evidence by a party, the adverse party may require him to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Granting that among the defendants in the main Civil Case No. 0009, only Victor Africa is a party to the incident Civil Case No. 0130, still all the other defendants in Civil Case No. 0009 were given notice of the scheduled deposition-taking. The reason why all the defendants were given notice of the said deposition-taking was because at that time, Civil Case No. 0130 was already consolidated with Civil Case No. 0009 and as emphasized in the second amended notice, “<b><u>[t]he deposition of said witness shall be used in evidence in Incident Case No. 0130-G.R.

Justice Brion emphasizes that despite the consolidation, the two cases remain distinct and separate from each other, such that a mere notice of deposition taking, even if under the expressed intent of using the testimony in evidence in the main case, cannot automatically bind the private respondents who were not previously heard thereon.<br><br>In his modified draft Decision, Justice Brion posits that the consolidation of Civil Case No. 0009 with several incident cases including Civil Case No. 0130 is merely a “consolidation for trial.” On page 31 of the modified Draft Decision, a “consolidation for trial,” as defined in American jurisprudence is:<br><br><blockquote>Where several actions are ordered to be tried together but each retains its separate character and requires entry of a separate judgment. This type of consolidation does not merge the suits into a single action, or cause the parties to one action to be parties to the other.</blockquote><br>In this kind of consolidation, the cases are merely tried together but a decision is rendered separately in each case.<br><br>In Philippine jurisprudence, <b><i>the consolidation of cases merges the different actions into one and the rights of the parties are adjudicated in a single judgment,</i></b> thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>The effect of consolidation of actions is to unite and merge all of the different actions consolidated into a single action, in the same manner as if the different causes of action involved had originally been joined in a single action</b>, and the order of consolidation, if made by a court of competent jurisdiction, is binding upon all the parties to the different actions until it is vacated or set aside. <b>After the consolidation there can be no further proceedings in the separate actions, which are by virtue of the consolidation discontinued and superseded by a single action, which should be entitled in such manner as the court may direct, and all subsequent proceedings therein be conducted and the rights of the parties adjudicated in a single action</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Indeed, when consolidated cases are appealed to the Supreme Court or when the Court orders consolidation of cases, the Justice to whom the consolidated cases are assigned renders a single decision, adjudicating all the rights of the parties in the consolidated cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Chief Justice assigns the consolidated cases to the Member-in-Charge to whom the case having the lower or lowest docket number has been raffled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The 12 April 1993 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan ordered the consolidation of the incidental cases, including Civil Case No. 0130, with the main case, Civil Case No. 0009. <b>Unlike a mere order of a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions, the consolidation of actions merges the different actions into one single action</b>.

Similarly, in <i>Domdom v.

The Court held:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Teston v. Development Bank of the Philippines</i>, the Court laid down the requisites for the consolidation of cases, <i>viz</i>:<br><br>“A court may order several actions pending before it to be tried together where they arise from <b><u>the same act, event or transaction, involve the same or like issues, and depend largely or substantially on the same evidence</u></b>, <i>provided</i> that the court has jurisdiction over the cases to be consolidated and that a joint trial will not give one party an undue advantage or prejudice the substantive rights of the parties.”<br><br>The rule allowing consolidation is designed to avoid multiplicity of suits, to guard against oppression or abuse, to prevent delays, to clear congested dockets, and to simplify the work of the trial court – in short, the attainment of justice with the least expense and vexation to the parties-litigants.<br><br>x x x<br><br>In the present case, it would be more in keeping with law and equity if all the cases filed against petitioner were consolidated with that having the lowest docket number pending with the Third Division of the Sandiganbayan. The only notable differences in these cases lie in the date of the transaction, the entity transacted with and the amount involved. The charge and core element are the same – estafa through falsification of documents based on alleged overstatements of claims for miscellaneous and extraordinary expenses. Notably, the main witness is also the same – Hilconeda P. Abril.<br><br>It need not be underscored that consolidation of cases, when proper, results in the simplification of proceedings which saves time, the resources of the parties and the courts and the abbreviation of trial. It contributes to the swift dispensation of justice, and is in accord with the aim of affording the parties a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their cases before the courts. Above all, consolidation avoids the possibility of rendering conflicting decisions in two or more cases which would otherwise require a single judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)</blockquote><br>In this case, Maurice V. Bane is a vital witness in the main Civil Case No. 0009 and the incidental Civil Case No. 0130. In fact, as pointed out by Justice Brion, in petitioner's Pre-Trial Brief dated 30 August 1996, petitioner offered to present Maurice V. Bane as one of the witnesses in the main Civil Case No. 0009. Thus, when petitioner filed on 25 September 1996 its <i>Second Amended Notice to Take Deposition of Mr. Maurice V. Bane Upon Oral Examination</i>, in Civil Case No. 0009 in connection with Incident Case No. 0130 and G.R. No. 107789, petitioner emphasized that “<b><u>[t]he deposition of said witness shall be used in evidence in Incident Case No. 0130-G.R. No. 10779 as well as in the main case of Civil Case No. 0009</u></b>.” In fact, all the respondents were given the chance to be heard considering that all the defendants of Civil Case No. 0009 were given notice of the scheduled testimony by oral deposition of Maurice V. Bane, which was taken on 23 and 24 October 1996. This is very clear from petitioner’s <i>Second Amended Notice to Take Deposition of Mr. Maurice V. Bane Upon Oral Examination,</i> filed on 25 September 1996, in Civil Case No. 0009 in connection with Incident Case No. 0130 and G.R.

(Underscoring in the original; boldfacing supplied)</blockquote><br>In his modified draft Decision, Justice Brion maintains that respondents' notice of the taking of the Bane deposition is insufficient waiver of their right to appear and cross-examine the deponent when they failed to show up at the deposition-taking. Justice Brion insists that respondents “cannot be bound by the taking of the Bane deposition without the consequent impairment of their right to cross-examine.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>I disagree. The 12 April 1993 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan, ordering the consolidation of the incidental cases, including Civil Case No. 0130, with the main case, Civil Case No. 0009, effectively merged the different actions into one single action. The consolidation of the cases was meant to expeditiously settle the interwoven issues involved in the consolidated cases. The simplification of the proceedings with the aim of affording the parties a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their cases before the courts can be achieved when repetition of the same evidence or presentation of identical witnesses is dispensed with. This means that evidence, such as depositions, taken after the consolidation is admissible in all the actions consolidated whenever relevant or material. In this case, since the notice and the deposition-taking was after the consolidation of Civil Case No. 0130 with the main case, Civil Case No. 0009, the deposition could be admitted as evidence in the consolidated cases. This Court has even held in<i> Yu, Sr. v. Basilio G. Magno Construction and Development Enterprises, Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that in consolidated cases, “[t]he evidence in each case effectively became the evidence of both, and there ceased to exist any need for the deciding judge to take judicial notice of the evidence presented in each case.” Besides, even assuming that the 12 April 1993 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan merely ordered a joint hearing or a “consolidation for trial,” private respondents are still bound by the Bane deposition considering that they were given notice of the deposition-taking. The evidence adduced in a joint trial binds all the parties. Otherwise, what would be the point of holding a joint trial if common witnesses have to be presented again in each of the cases and the same evidence offered again and again? Precisely, a joint trial aims to prevent repetition of the same or common evidence and to spare the common witnesses from the unnecessary inconvenience of testifying on the same issues in separate proceedings if the cases were not jointly tried. To rule otherwise is to frustrate the purpose of a joint trial which is to prevent delay and save unnecessary costs and expense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In <i>Tan v. Lim</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court even allowed evidence that has not been formally offered in a case which was jointly heard with another case because evidence offered during the joint hearing was deemed evidence for both cases which were jointly heard. The Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>It may be true that Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules directs the court to consider no evidence which has not been formally offered and that under Section 35, documentary evidence is offered after presentation of testimonial evidence. However, a liberal interpretation of these Rules would have convinced the trial court that a separate formal offer of evidence in Civil Case No. 6518 was superfluous because not only was an offer of evidence made in Civil Case No. 6521 that was being jointly heard by the trial court, counsel for Jose Renato Lim had already declared he was adopting these evidences for Civil Case No. 6518. The trial court itself stated that it would freely utilize in one case evidence adduced in the other only to later abandon this posture. Jose Renato Lim testified in Civil Case No. 6518. The trial court should have at least considered his testimony since at the time it was made, the Rules provided that testimonial evidence is deemed offered at the time the witness is called to testify. Rules of procedure should not be applied in a very rigid, technical case as they are devised chiefly to secure and not defeat substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Furthermore, Justice Brion posits that in determining the admissibility of the Bane deposition, not only Section 4, Rule 23 must be considered but also Section 47, Rule 130. The said provisions read:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. [Rule 23] Use of depositions. – At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, <b>any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof</b>, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:<br><br>(a) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as witness;<br><br>(b) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time of the taking of the deposition was an officer, director, or managing agent of a public or private corporation, partnership, or association which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose;<br><br>(c) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: (1) that the witness is dead; or (2) <b>that the witness resides at a distance more than one hundred (100) kilometers from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the Philippines, </b>unless it appears that his absence was procured by the party offering the deposition; or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or (5) upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used; and<br><br>(d) if only part of the deposition is offered in evidence by a party, the adverse party may require him to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part introduced, and any party may introduce any other parts.<br><br>Sec. 47. [Rule 130] <i>Testimony or deposition at a former proceeding</i>. – The testimony or deposition of a witness deceased or unable to testify, <b>given in a former case or proceeding</b>, judicial or administrative, involving the same parties and subject matter, may be given in evidence against the adverse party who had the opportunity to cross-examine him. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In my opinion, Section 47, Rule 130 does not apply in this case since the Bane deposition was not taken in a former case or proceeding. The records show that the <b>Bane deposition was taken when the cases were already consolidated.</b> Clearly, there is no “former proceeding” to speak of which would require the application of Section 47, Rule 130. <b>The Bane deposition was taken in CIVIL CASE NO. 0009 (Incident Case No. 0130 and G.R. No. 107789)</b>. In fact, in the <i>Second Amended Notice to Take Deposition of Mr. Maurice V. Bane Upon Oral Examination</i>, filed on 25 September 1996, the title of the case was “REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, Plaintiff, versus JOSE L. AFRICA, ET AL., Defendants” with case number “CIVIL CASE NO. 0009 (Incident Case No. 0130 and G.R. No. 107789).” Thus, Justice Brion’s reliance on Section 47, Rule 130 is misplaced. Besides, even if Section 47 is applicable, the Bane deposition may still be given in evidence against the respondents since all of them were given notice of the deposition, and thus had the opportunity to cross-examine the deponent had they participated in the deposition-taking. Since notices have been duly served on all the respondents, those who failed to show up at the deposition-taking are deemed to have waived their right to appear and cross-examine the deponent.<br><br>In this case, the Sandiganbayan granted the request for the taking of the deposition of Maurice V. Bane, who was Executive Vice-President and Treasurer of ETPI from 1974 until his retirement in 1987.32 In October 1996, during the deposition-taking, Maurice V. Bane was already 72 years old and residing at 1 Ecton Hall, Church Way, Ecton, Northants (England).33 Clearly, under Section 4(c)(2) of Rule 23,34 the deposition of Maurice V. Bane can be used as direct evidence. In fact, in its Resolutions issued on 21 August 2000 and 3 April 2001, the Sandiganbayan stated that the deposition of Maurice V. Bane has “<b>become part and parcel of the record of this main case (Civil Case No. 0009) since Civil Case No. 0130 is an incident to the same</b>.”<br><br>A cursory reading of the Bane deposition, which took two days to complete and covers 211 pages of the transcript of record of the proceedings and the testimony, reveals that it is a critical and vital evidence in the case of petitioner against private respondents with regard to its allegation in Civil Case No. 0009 that private respondents’ shareholdings in ETPI were illegally purchased and rightly belongs to the Government.<br><br>The testimony of the witness, Maurice V. Bane, was offered for the following purposes:<br><br><blockquote>[I]n general the testimony is offered to prove that the Class A stockholdings in Eastern Telecommunications Philippines Inc, or “Eastern” for short, otherwise referred to as the Filipino 60% equity, is ill gotten in nature; that the actual and/or beneficial owner of said shares was the late President Ferdinand Marcos; and that accordingly, said shares are subject to reversion and/or forfeiture in favor of the Plaintiff Republic of the Philippines in this case. Specifically, the testimony is offered to establish the environmental facts and attendant circumstances surrounding the formation and organization of Eastern in 1974; that there was duress and/or compulsion exerted upon Cable &amp; Wireless and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Eastern Extension Australasia Telegraph Company, of which the witness was the then General Manager in the Philippines, such that Cable &amp; Wireless and Eastern Extension Australasia were forced or compelled to give up their legitimate business activities in the Philippines which was 100% British owned in favor of Eastern, which was to be newly organized as a 60/40 Filipino company, with 40% being for the account of the company of the witness, Mr. Bane.<br><br>In short, the witness will establish in these proceedings that President Marcos and/or his emissaries or parties acting on his behalf gave the witness only two possible options which was: (1) a 40% equity in the company to be newly organized, which is Eastern in exchange for surrendering all of the assets and franchise of Eastern Extension Australasia; or 100% of nothing, meaning that if the witness and his company refused to give up their legitimate business in the Philippines then Marcos made it clear that there will be no more Eastern Extension Australasia that would be operating in the Philippines.<br><br>Lastly, the testimony is offered to prove the ownership issue that is involved in this case in favor of the Plaintiff, and also support the pending petition of Eastern Telecoms to increase its authorized capital stock from the present 250 million pesos to 4 billion pesos by allowing the PCGG to vote the sequestered Class A stock in the company. Hence, the testimony will establish the prima facie factual foundation for maintaining the sequestration of the Class A stock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>In the deposition of Maurice V.

Further meetings took place to finalize the details but Africa later informed us that they could not raise the required amount. As a compromise, he suggested that the new corporation raise a bank loan from which ‘C&amp;W’ could be paid. While we were not happy with this arrangement, we resigned ourselves to the fact that we would have to accede. It was agreed that stockholders' contribution would be five million pesos (P5,000,000.00) plus a bank loan of seven million pesos (P7,000,000.00) to cover asset payment and working capital. Africa then advised that they could only raise one million pesos (P1,000,000.00) and ‘C&amp;W’ could loan them two million pesos (P2,000,000.00).

The satellite earth station had been constructed and the Tropo had gone in, but there was still a very large demand for circuits. We therefore devised a plan to put underseas cables, telephone cables, from the Philippines to Japan, from the Philippines to Hong Kong, Philippines to Singapore and then latterly Philippines to Taiwan. For that we obviously needed approvals right at the top, because we were, in effect, in competition with PLDT. PLDT were really dragging their heels in development, perhaps because of lack of financing or whatever. So we saw an opportunity to perhaps establish Eastern as a major player in the Philippines telecommunications. I therefore drafted a letter which was – what is the word I'm looking for perhaps – which was fine tuned perhaps is the best word, by Attorney Jose Africa. And this set out Eastern's plans for development of submarine cable systems and everything else, and we asked at the bottom of the letter for Presidential approval. And this letter was signed by Ambassador Nieto; it was taken to Malacañang and it was signed, written across the top of the page, I think the words were just “Approved, President Marcos” so we received approval, direct approval from President Marcos to proceed with the implementation of this very big cable project. It meant to say that we had bypassed the national telecommunications commission under whose authority this would normally have been submitted, but knowing as we did that with PLDT's opposition we probably wouldn't have got it through the NTC.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">So it was President Marcos himself who gave the approval for Eastern to undertake the construction of these submarine cables that you mentioned?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That's correct, yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And can you tell us the significance of that designation, what happened to Eastern because it got this project?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Well, by putting in the submarine cable systems, since we were financing them, we had to have the approval of, of course, the distant administration – in this case Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, so one of the benefits that accrued from this was that we became a telephone correspondent to these countries. After all, these cables were very high capacity. I think to Hong Kong they were 1380 telephone circuits, to Japan 960 telephone circuits, so that what it did it was for the great benefit of the Philippines. We used the phrase in the letter “to make the Philippines the hub of telecommunications in South East Asia,” which we hoped we were going to do and I think to a large extent we did do. The ultimate benefit to Eastern was quite considerable, it enormously increased cash flow and of course from that we financed the cables.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bane, you stated that you were with Eastern for 21 years?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That's correct, yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">21 continuous years.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">With EEATC and with Eastern.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bane, were there other stockholders of Class A during this 21 year period?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The only changes that I was aware of that were made was that Attorney Jose Africa pointed out to me, after the incorporation, that they wanted to put some of the stock, or they would put some of the stock in the name of various companies.

Bane was the Executive Vice-President and Treasurer of ETPI from 1974 until his retirement in 1987. Maurice V. Bane had personal knowledge of and involvement in the circumstances leading to the formation of ETPI in 1974, which is crucial to petitioner’s allegation that private respondents’ interest in ETPI rightfully belongs to the Government. To dismiss the Bane deposition as inadmissible based on the tenuous ground that there was no “actual consolidation” of cases is to disregard the obvious fact that the Bane deposition was taken in <b>CIVIL CASE NO. 0009 (Incident Case No. 0130 and G.R.

Bane, petitioner thereafter filed an urgent motion praying that it be allowed to introduce as additional evidence the deposition of Maurice V. Bane.

Many companies and consortiums, including “EEATC” bidded for the contract. Then President Marcos finally awarded the contract together with the franchise to the Philippines Overseas Telecommunications Corp. (“POTC”) which at that time was relatively unknown in the international communications industry. The prime movers of “POTC” were Messrs. Potenciano Ilusorio, Honorio Poblador, Manuel H. Nieto, Jr. and Roberto S. Benedicto, who were all known Marcos associates. This group became very much a part of the Philippines telecommunications scene.<br><br>4. “EEATC” forged a partnership with “POTC” for the establishment of a tropospheric<br><br>scatter system communications with Taiwan. A franchise, Oceanic Wireless Network, Inc. was purchased and all government approvals were obtained by Messrs. Nieto and Ilusorio. The system was installed and during its inauguration, the principal guests were President and Mrs. Marcos, showing perhaps the political influence of Nieto and Ilusorio.<br><br>5. When President Marcos declared Martial Law in September 1972, it was clear that his grip on the country was virtually complete. “C&amp;W” was fully aware of its uneasy tenure in the Philippines. In March 1973, then Secretary of National Defense Juan Ponce Enrile called us to a conference at Camp Crame. I attended the said meeting together with the representatives of RCA and Globe Mackay. Secretary Enrile firmly told us that we had until July, 1974 to organize ourselves into 60/40 corporations with Filipino majority ownership and, if we did not comply, the Government would take the necessary action.<br><br>6. I pointed out that “EEATC” was not covered by the Laurel-Langley Act since we were a British corporation with a fully constitutional franchise. Secretary Enrile said that if we did not comply with his directive, there would be no more “EEATC”;<br><br>7. While we might have legal and valid grounds to contest the directive, under the prevailing martial law restrictions we had little recourse but to comply. After considering all economic and political factors, it was felt that some form of partnership with the POTC group would be the most advantageous option;<br><br>8. Prior to the above, discussions had been held with Ilusorio and Poblador, who then appeared in charge of POTC – discussions were generally unsatisfactory since it was quite hard to pin Ilusorio down and we gained the impression that they wanted us to give them their participation in “EEATC” with minimal monetary consideration in return for political protection;<br><br>9. In approximately April/May 1973, rapid changes took place in POTC. Ilusorio and Poblador appeared to have lost their control in POTC and Nieto emerged as the controlling figure. We learned much later that this was upon the instructions of President Marcos. Thus, discussions concerning “EEATC” were continued with Nieto;<br><br>10. The time factor was important with July 1974 over the horizon and it was agreed to call a meeting with the accounting group of SyCip, Gorres and Velayo as intermediary. At the said meeting, we found that Atty. Jose Africa was the main representative of Nieto/POTC. He had previously not seemed a major figure in the group although he had attended several board meetings of Oceanic Wireless. Africa quickly spelt out the rules – that they were interested in the proposition and that we were to deal only with the DAN group (composed of Roberto Benedicto, Jose Africa and Manuel Nieto, Jr.). We were informed that this was at the express wish of President Marcos who had appointed their group to control the telecommunications interests;<br><br>11. Negotiations were thereafter commenced with Mr. Eduardo M. Villanueva of SGV as intermediary, David West and W. H. Davies were the major “C&amp;W” participants. We also requested Atty. Luciano Salazar Law Office to represent us on legal matters;<br><br>12. The figure eventually negotiated for the assets (net book value only and no good will) was Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) on the basis of which the BAN group will put up Six Million Pesos (P6,000,000.00). Further meetings took place to finalize the details but Africa later informed us that they could not raise the required amount. As a compromise, he suggested that the new corporation raise a bank loan from which “C&amp;W” could be paid. While we were not happy with this arrangement, we resigned ourselves to the fact that we would have to accede. It was agreed that stockholders' contribution would be Five Million Pesos (P5,000,000.00) plus a bank loan of Seven Million Pesos (P7,000,000.00) to cover asset payment and working capital. Africa then advised that they could only raise One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) and “C&amp;W” could loan them Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00). Again, we were unhappy but again we complied;<br><br>13. All the necessary documents, articles, by-laws and stockholders agreements were drawn up by the Salazar Law Office. Of particular delicacy was the issue of franchise. It was decided that the old franchise should be retained in all detail but this was to be transferred to a new company to be called Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. Atty. Salazar drafted the Presidential Decree for the transfer of the franchise. The draft was personally delivered to Nieto who committed to secure President Marcos' approval and signature. True enough, Marcos signed the P.D. Drafted by Atty. Salazar in its entirety, without any revision or amendment. This was convincing evidence of the political power and influence of the BAN group;<br><br>14. After complying with all the registration requirements and other government regulations, “ETPI” commenced to fully operate as a telecommunications company under its new franchise in August 1974;<br><br>15. I am executing this affidavit to attest to the truth of the foregoing facts in order to elucidate on the events and circumstances that led to the transfer of the assets and franchise of “EEATC” in favor of “ETPI” and the emergence of BAN group thereat.<br><br>Affiant further sayeth naught.<br><br>09 January 1991, Makati, Metro Manila.<br><br>(signed)<br>MAURICE V.
