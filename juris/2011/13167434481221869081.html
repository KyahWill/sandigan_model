Neither was she able to deny under oath the genuineness and due execution of the receipt dated February 18, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the <i>fallo</i> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the petition for review is hereby <b>GRANTED. </b>The decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Cebu City is <b>REVERSED </b>and the judgment of Municipal Trial Court in Cities Branch 5, Cebu City is <b>REINSTATED</b>.&nbsp;

(2) the existence of a contract of sale; and (3) respondent's entitlement to attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner contends that the filing of the Petition for Review with the CA on June 1, 2004 was beyond the reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Records show that respondent received a copy of the RTC Decision on March 25, 2004, filed a Motion for Reconsideration on April 12, 2004 since April 9 and 10 were holidays and April 11, 2004 was a Sunday, and received a copy of the RTC Order denying his Motion for Reconsideration on May 27, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, he only had one day left from May 27, 2004 within which to file a Petition for Review with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioner likewise denies the existence of a contract of sale, insisting that the laptop was not sold to her but was given as a security for respondent's debt.&nbsp; To prove that there was no contract of sale, petitioner calls attention to respondent's failure to present a written contract of sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; She claims that under the Statute of Frauds, a contract of sale to be enforceable must be in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; She also imputes error on the part of the CA in giving weight and credence to the receipt dated February 18, 2002 and the demand letter dated July 29, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; She claims that the receipt dated February 18, 2002, which she denies having written, is not an actionable document; thus, there was no need for her to deny under oath its genuineness and due execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, she claims that her denial of the receipt of the demand letter dated July 29, 2002 shifted the burden upon respondent to prove that the letter was indeed received by her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; As to the attorney's fees and litigation expenses, petitioner contends that these were not discussed in the MTCC Decision but were only stated in the dispositive portion and that the amount of P5,000.00 is excessive considering that it is 70% of the principal amount claimed by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, argues that his Petition for Review was timely filed with the CA because he has 15 days from receipt of the RTC Order dated May 13, 2004 within which to file a Petition for Review with the CA under Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent defends the ruling of the CA by arguing that the receipt dated February 18, 2002 is an actionable document, and thus, petitioner's failure to deny under oath its genuineness and due execution constitutes an admission thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In addition, petitioner's denial of the receipt of the demand letter dated July 29, 2002 cannot overcome the presumption that the said letter was received in the regular course of mail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Respondent likewise points out that the Statute of Frauds does not apply in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Finally, respondent claims that the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses are not excessive and that the factual and legal bases of the award were stated in the body of MTCC Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><b><i>The Petition for Review was<br> timely filed with the CA</i></b><br><br>To standardize the appeal periods and afford litigants fair opportunity to appeal their cases, we ruled in <i>Neypes v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that litigants must be given a fresh period of 15 days within which to appeal, counted from receipt of the order dismissing a motion for a new trial or motion for reconsideration under Rules 40, 41, 42, 43 and 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; This ruling, as we have said in <i>Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. v. Homena-Valencia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> retroactively applies even to cases pending prior to the promulgation of <i>Neypes</i> on September 14, 2005, there being no vested rights in the rules of procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Since the instant case was pending in the CA at the time <i>Neypes</i> was promulgated, respondent is entitled to a fresh period of 15 days, counted from May 27, 2004, the date respondent received the RTC Order dated May 13, 2004 denying his motion for reconsideration of the RTC Decision dated March 19, 2004 or until June 11, 2004, within which to file his Petition for Review with the CA.&nbsp; Thus, we find that when he filed the Petition for Review with the CA on June 1, 2004, his period to appeal had not yet lapsed.<br><br><b><i>There was a contract of sale between the parties</i></b><br><br>As to whether there was a contract of sale between the parties, we hold that there was, and the absence of a written contract of sale does not mean otherwise.&nbsp; A contract of sale is perfected the moment the parties agree upon the object of the sale, the price, and the terms of payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Once perfected, the parties are bound by it whether the contract is verbal or in writing because no form is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Contrary to the view of petitioner, the Statute of Frauds does not apply in the present case as this provision applies only to executory, and not to completed, executed or partially executed contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the contract of sale had been partially executed because the possession of the laptop was already transferred to petitioner and the partial payments had been made by her.&nbsp; Thus, the absence of a written contract is not fatal to respondent's case. Respondent only needed to show by a preponderance of evidence that there was an oral contract of sale, which he did by submitting in evidence his own affidavit, the affidavit of his witness Dy, the receipt dated February 18, 2002 and the demand letter dated July 29, 2002.<br><br>As regards the receipt dated February 18, 2002, we agree with petitioner that it is not an actionable document.&nbsp; Hence, there was no need for her to deny its genuineness and due execution under oath. Nonetheless, we find no error on the part of the CA in giving full weight and credence to it since it corroborates the testimonies of respondent and his witness Dy that there was an oral contract of sale between the parties.<br><br>With regard to petitioner's denial of the receipt of the demand letter dated July 29, 2002, we believe that this did not overturn the presumption of regularity that the letter was delivered and received by the addressee in the regular course of the mail considering that respondent was able to present the postmaster's certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> stating that the letter was indeed sent to the address of petitioner.&nbsp; Bare denial of receipt of a mail cannot prevail over the certification of the postmaster, whose official duty is to send notices of registered mail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>As we see it then, the evidence submitted by respondent weigh more than petitioner's bare denials. Other than her denials, no other evidence was submitted by petitioner to prove that the laptop was not sold but was only given as security for respondent's loan.&nbsp; What adds doubt to her story is the fact that from the first week of March 2002, the time she allegedly decided not to buy the laptop, up to the time the instant case was filed against her, she did not exert any effort to recover from respondent the payment of the alleged loan.&nbsp; Her inaction leads us to conclude that the alleged loan was a mere afterthought.<br><br>All told, no error can be attributed to the CA in finding that there was a contract of sale between the parties<br><br><b><i>The award for attorney's fees and <br>litigation expenses was proper</i></b><br><br>Neither do we find any error in the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<br><br>Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the Civil Code enumerates the legal grounds which justify or warrant the grant of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, among which is when the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to incur expenses to protect his interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; The reason for the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses, however, must be set forth in the decision of the court and not in the dispositive portion only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In this case, the factual and legal bases for the award were set forth in the body of the MTCC Decision dated June 2, 2003, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x As the defendant refused to satisfy plaintiff's just and valid claim,&nbsp; the latter was compelled to litigate and engage the services of counsel to protect his interest and in the process, incurred litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>The award of attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00 is also reasonable and not excessive considering that this case, a simple collection of a measly sum of P7,000.00, has dragged for almost a decade and even had to reach this Court only because petitioner refused to pay. The fact that it is 70% of the principal amount claimed is of no moment as the amount of attorney's fees is discretionary upon the court as long as it is reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Finally, although not raised as an issue, we find it necessary to modify the legal interest rate imposed on the principal amount claimed.&nbsp; Since the claim involves an obligation arising from a contract of sale and not a loan or forbearance of money, the interest rate should be six percent (6%) per annum of the amount claimed from July 29, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; The interest rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, however, shall apply from the finality of judgment until the total amount awarded is fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED. </b> The assailed October 26, 2005 Decision and May 22, 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
