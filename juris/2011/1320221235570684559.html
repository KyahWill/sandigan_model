No. 9136, otherwise known as the <i>Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001</i> (EPIRA). Also assailed is Rule 33 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the EPIRA.<br><br>The facts of the case are as follows:<br><br>On June 8, 2001, the EPIRA was enacted by Congress with the goal of restructuring the electric power industry and privatization of the assets of the National Power Corporation (NPC).<br><br>Pursuant to Section 48<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the EPIRA, a new National Power Board of Directors (NPB) was created.

Declaring National Power Board Resolution Nos. 2002-124 and 2002-125 and its Annex "B" Null and Void, the fact [that] it was done with extraordinary haste and in secrecy without the able participation of the Napocor Employees Consolidated Union (NECU) to represent all career civil service employees on issues affecting their rights to due process, equity, security of tenure, social benefits accrued to them, and as well as the disclosure of public transaction provisions of the 1987 Constitution because during its proceeding the National Power Board had acted with grave abuse of discretion and disregarding constitutional and statutory injunctions on removal of public servants and non-diminution of social benefits accrued to separated employees, thus, amounting to excess of jurisdiction;<br><br>2. Striking down Section 11, Section 48 and Section 52 of RA 9136 (EPIRA) for being violative of Section 13, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution and, therefore, unconstitutional;<br><br>3. Striking Section 34 of RA 9136 (EPIRA) for being exorbitant display of State Power and was not premised on the welfare of the FILIPINO PEOPLE or principle of <b><i><u>salus populi est suprema lex</u></i></b>;<br><br>4. Striking down Section 38 for RA 9136 (EPIRA) for being a prelude to <b><i><u>Charter Change</u></i></b> without a valid referendum for ratification of the entire voter citizens of the Philippine Republic;<br><br>5. Striking down all other provisions of RA 9136 (EPIRA) found repugnant to the 1987 Constitution;<br><br>6. Striking down all provisions of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the EPIRA found repugnant to the 1987 Constitution;<br><br>7. Striking down Section 63 of RA 9136 (EPIRA) for classifying such provisions in the same vein with Proclamation No. 50 used against MWSS employees and its failure to classify which condition comes first whether the restructuring effecting total reorganization of the electric power industry making NPC financially viable or the privatization of NPC assets where manpower reduction or sweeping/lay-off or termination of career civil service employees follows the disposal of NPC assets. This is a clear case of violation of the <i>EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE</i>, therefore, unconstitutional;<br><br>8. Striking down Rule 33 of the Implementing Rules [and] Regulations (IRR) for disregarding the constitutional and statutory injunction on arbitrary removal of career civil service employees; and<br><br>9. For such other reliefs deemed equitable with justice and fairness to more than EIGHT THOUSAND (8,000) EMPLOYEES of the National Power Corporation (NPC) whose fate lies in the sound disposition of the Honorable Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In addition, petitioner also filed a supplemental petition for <i>mandamus</i> praying for his reinstatement.<br><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>Before anything else, this Court shall first tackle whether it was proper for petitioner to directly question the constitutionality of the EPIRA before this Court.<br><br>Section 5(1) and (2), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution provides that:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>1. Exercise <i>original jurisdiction over cases</i> affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and over <i>petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and habeas corpus</i>.<br><br>2. Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm <i>on appeal or certiorari</i>, as the law or the rules of court may provide, final judgments and orders of lower courts in:<br><br><blockquote>(a) All cases in which the <i>constitutionality or validity</i> of any treaty, international or executive agreement, <i>law</i>, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, this Court's jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus</i>, <i>quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i>, while concurrent with that of the Regional Trial Courts and the Court of Appeals, does not give litigants unrestrained freedom of choice of forum from which to seek such relief. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The determination of whether the assailed law and its implementing rules and regulations contravene the Constitution is within the jurisdiction of regular courts. The Constitution vests the power of judicial review or the power to declare a law, treaty, international or executive agreement, presidential decree, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation in the courts, including the Regional Trial Courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It has long been established that this Court will not entertain direct resort to it unless the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts, or where exceptional and compelling circumstances justify availment of a remedy within and call for the exercise of our primary jurisdiction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, herein petition should already be dismissed at the outset; however, since similar petitions have already been resolved by this Court tackling the validity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, as well as the constitutionality of certain provisions of the EPIRA, this Court shall disregard the procedural defect.<br><br><b>Validity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125</b><br><br>The main issue raised by petitioner deals with the validity of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125.<br><br>In <i>NPC Drivers and Mechanics Association (NPC DAMA) v. National Power Corporation (NPC)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> this Court had already ruled that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void and of no legal effect.<br><br><i>NPC Drivers</i> involved a special civil action for Injunction seeking to enjoin the implementation of the same assailed NPB Resolutions. Petitioners therein put in issue the fact that the NPB Resolutions were not concluded by a duly constituted Board of Directors since no quorum in accordance with Section 48 of the EPIRA existed. In addition, petitioners therein argued that the assailed NPB Resolutions cannot be given legal effect as it failed to comply with Section 47 of the EPIRA which required the endorsement of the Joint Congressional Power Commission and the President of the Philippines. Ruling in favor of petitioners therein, this Court ruled that NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void and of no legal effect for failure to comply with Section 48 of the EPIRA, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with petitioners. In enumerating under Section 48 those who shall compose the National Power Board of Directors, the legislature has vested upon these persons the power to exercise their judgment and discretion in running the affairs of the NPC. Discretion may be defined as "the act or the liberty to decide according to the principles of justice and one's ideas of what is right and proper under the circumstances, without willfulness or favor. Discretion, when applied to public functionaries, means a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially in certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgment and conscience, uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of others. It is to be presumed that in naming the respective department heads as members of the board of directors, the legislature chose these secretaries of the various executive departments on the basis of their personal qualifications and acumen which made them eligible to occupy their present positions as department heads. Thus, the department secretaries cannot delegate their duties as members of the NPB, much less their power to vote and approve board resolutions, because it is their personal judgment that must be exercised in the fulfilment of such responsibility.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the case at bar, it is not difficult to comprehend that in approving NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125, it is the representatives of the secretaries of the different executive departments and not the secretaries themselves who exercised judgment in passing the assailed Resolution, as shown by the fact that it is the signatures of the respective representatives that are affixed to the questioned Resolutions. This, to our mind, violates the duty imposed upon the specifically enumerated department heads to employ their own sound discretion in exercising the corporate powers of the NPC. Evidently, the votes cast by these mere representatives in favor of the adoption of the said Resolutions must not be considered in determining whether or not the necessary number of votes was garnered in order that the assailed Resolutions may be validly enacted. Hence, there being only three valid votes cast out of the nine board members, namely those of DOE Secretary Vincent S. Perez, Jr.; Department of Budget and Management Secretary Emilia T. Boncodin; and NPC OIC-President Rolando S. Quilala, <b>NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 are void and are of no legal effect</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>However, a supervening event occurred in <i>NPC Drivers </i>when<i> </i>it was brought to this Court's attention that NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was promulgated on September 14, 2007 confirming and adopting the principles and guidelines enunciated in NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125.<br><br>On December 2, 2009, this Court promulgated a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> clarifying the amount due the individual employees of NPC in view of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55. In said Resolution, this Court clarified the exact date of the legal termination of each class of NPC employees, thus:<br><br><blockquote>From all these, it is clear that our ruling, pursuant to NPB Resolution No. 2002-124, covers all employees of the NPC and not only the 16 employees as contended by the NPC. However, as regards their right to reinstatement, or separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, pursuant to a validly approved Separation Program, plus backwages, wage adjustments, and other benefits, the same shall be computed from the date of legal termination as stated in NPC Circular No. 2003-09, to wit:<br><br>a) The legal termination of <b>key officials</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, the Corporate Secretary, Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents who were appointed under NP Board Resolution No. 2003-12, shall be at the close of office hours of <b>January 31, 2003</b>.<br><br>b) The legal termination of personnel who availed of the <b>early leavers' scheme</b> shall be on the <b>last day of service</b> in NPC but <b>not beyond January 15, 2003.</b><br><br>c) The legal termination of personnel who were <b>no longer employed in NPC after June 26, 2001</b> shall be the date of <b>actual separation</b> in NPC.<br><br>d) For <b>all other NPC personnel</b>, their legal termination shall be at the close of office hours/shift schedule of <b>February 28, 2003</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br>As to the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, this Court ruled that the same will have a prospective effect, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>What then is the effect of the approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007? The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55, supposedly by a majority of the National Power Board as designated by law, that adopted, confirmed and approved the contents of NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 will have a <b>prospective effect</b>, not a retroactive effect. The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 cannot ratify and validate NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 as to make the termination of the services of all NPC personnel/employees on 31 January 2003 valid, because said resolutions were void.<br><br><b>The approval of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 on 14 September 2007 means that the services of all NPC employees have been legally terminated on this date.</b> All separation pay and other benefits to be received by said employees will be deemed cut on this date. The computation thereof shall, therefore, be from the date of their illegal termination pursuant to NPB Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 as clarified by NPB Resolution No. 2003-11 and NPC Resolution No. 2003-09 up to 14 September 2007. Although the validity of NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 has not yet been passed upon by the Court, same has to be given effect because NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 enjoys the presumption of regularity of official acts. The presumption of regularity of official acts may be rebutted by affirmative evidence of irregularity or failure to perform a duty. <b>Thus, until and unless there is clear and convincing evidence that rebuts this presumption, we have no option but to rule that said resolution is valid and effective as of 14 September 2007.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, this Court concluded that the computation of the amounts due the employees who were terminated and/or separated as a result of, or pursuant to, the nullified NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 shall be from their date of illegal termination up to September 14, 2007 when NPB Resolution No. 2007-55 was issued.<br><br>Thus, the resolution of the validity of NPB Board Resolutions No. 2002-124 and No. 2002-125 is, therefore, moot and academic in view of the Court's pronouncements in <i>NPC Drivers</i>.<br><br>Anent the question of the constitutionality of Section 63 of RA 9136, as well as Rule 33 of the IRR, this Court finds that the same is without merit.<br><br>A reorganization involves the reduction of personnel, consolidation of offices, or abolition thereof by reason of economy or redundancy of functions. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It could result in the loss of one's position through removal or abolition of an office. However, for a reorganization for the purpose of economy or to make the bureaucracy more efficient to be valid, it must pass the test of good faith; otherwise, it is void <i>ab initio</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It is undisputed that NPC was in financial distress and the solution found by Congress was to pursue a policy towards its privatization. The privatization of NPC necessarily demanded the restructuring of its operations. To carry out the purpose, there was a need to terminate employees and re-hire some depending on the manpower requirements of the privatized companies. The privatization and restructuring of the NPC was, therefore, done in good faith as its primary purpose was for economy and to make the bureaucracy more efficient.<br><br>In <i>Freedom from Debt Coalition v. Energy Regulatory Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><i> </i>this Court discussed why there was a need for a shift towards the privatization and restructuring of the electric power industry, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>One of the landmark pieces of legislation enacted by Congress in recent years is the EPIRA. It established a new policy, legal structure and regulatory framework for the electric power industry.<br><br>The new thrust is to tap private capital for the expansion and improvement of the industry as the large government debt and the highly capital-intensive character of the industry itself have long been acknowledged as the critical constraints to the program. To attract private investment, largely foreign, the jaded structure of the industry had to be addressed. While the generation and transmission sectors were centralized and monopolistic, the distribution side was fragmented with over 130 utilities, mostly small and uneconomic. The pervasive flaws have caused a low utilization of existing generation capacity; extremely high and uncompetitive power rates; poor quality of service to consumers; dismal to forgettable performance of the government power sector; high system losses; and an inability to develop a clear strategy for overcoming these shortcomings.<br><br>Thus, the EPIRA provides a framework for the restructuring of the industry, including the privatization of the assets of the National Power Corporation (NPC), the transition to a competitive structure, and the delineation of the roles of various government agencies and the private entities. The law ordains the division of the industry into four (4) distinct sectors, namely: generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Corollarily, the NPC generating plants have to be privatized and its transmission business spun off and privatized thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner argues that bad faith is clearly manifested as the reorganization has an eye to replace current favorite less competent appointees. In addition, petitioner contends that qualifications and behavioral aspect were being set aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Section 2 of R.A. No. 6656<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> cites certain circumstances showing bad faith in the removal of employees as a result of any reorganization, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. No officer or employee in the career service shall be removed except for a valid cause and after due notice and hearing. A valid cause for removal exist when, pursuant to a <i>bona fide</i> reorganization, a position has been abolished or rendered redundant or there is a need to merge, divide, or consolidate positions in order to meet the exigencies of the service, or other lawful causes allowed by the Civil Service Law. The existence of any or some of the following circumstances may be considered as evidence of bad faith in the removals made as a result of the reorganization, giving rise to a claim for reinstatement or reappointment by an aggrieved party:<br><br>a) Where there is a significant increase in the number of positions in the new staffing pattern of the department or agency concerned;<br>b) Where an office is abolished and another performing substantially the same functions is created;<br>c) Where incumbents are replaced by those less qualified in terms of status of appointment, performance and merit;<br>d) Where there is a reclassification of offices in the department or agency concerned and the reclassified offices perform substantially the same functions as the original offices; and<br>e) Where the removal violates the order of separation provided in Section 3 hereof.</blockquote><br>The Solicitor General, however, argues that petitioner has not shown any circumstance to prove that the restructuring of NPC was done in bad faith. We agree.<br><br>Petitioner's allegation that the reorganization was merely undertaken to accommodate new appointees is at most speculative and bereft of any evidence on record. It is settled that bad faith must be duly proved and not merely presumed. It must be proved by clear and convincing evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which is absent in the case at bar.<br><br>In addition, petitioner has no legal or vested right to be reinstated as Section 63 of the EPIRA as well as Section 5, Rule 33 of the IRR clearly state that the displaced or separated personnel as a result of the privatization, if qualified, shall be given preference in the hiring of the manpower requirements of the privatized companies. Clearly, the law only speaks of preference and by no stretch of the imagination can the same amount to a legal right to the position. Undoubtedly, not all the terminated employees will be re-hired by the selection committee as the manpower requirement of the privatized companies will be different. As correctly observed by the Solicitor General, the selection of employees for purposes of re-hiring them necessarily entails the exercise of discretion or judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Such being the case, petitioner, cannot, by way of mandamus, compel the selection committee to include him in the re-hired employees, more so, since there is no evidence showing that said committee acted with grave abuse of discretion or that the re-hired employees were merely accommodated and not qualified.<br><br><b>Validity of Sections 11, 48, and 52 of RA 9136</b><br><br>Petitioner argues that Sections 11,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 48,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and 52<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the EPIRA are unconstitutional for violating Section 13, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>Section 13, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 13. The President, Vice-President, the <i>Members of the Cabinet</i>, and their deputies or assistants <i>shall not</i>, unless otherwise provided in this Constitution, <i>hold any other office</i> or employment during their tenure. They shall not, during said tenure, directly or indirectly practice any other profession, participate in any business, or be financially interested in any contract with, or in any franchise, or special privilege granted by the Government or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries. They shall strictly avoid conflict of interest in the conduct of their office.<br><br>x x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> this Court explained that the prohibition contained in Section 13, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution does not apply to posts occupied by the Executive officials specified therein without additional compensation in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity as provided by law and as required by the primary function of said official's office, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The prohibition against holding dual or multiple offices or employment under Section 13, Article VII of the Constitution must not, however, be construed as applying to posts occupied by the Executive officials specified therein without additional compensation in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity as provided by law and as <i>required</i>&nbsp; by the primary functions of said officials' office. The reason is that these posts do not comprise "any other office" within the contemplation of the constitutional prohibition but are properly an imposition of additional duties and functions on said officials. To characterize these posts otherwise would lead to absurd consequences, among which are: The President of the Philippines cannot chair the National Security Council reorganized under Executive Order No. 115 (December 24, 1986). Neither can the Vice-President, the Executive Secretary, and the Secretaries of National Defence, Justice, Labor and Employment and Local Government sit in this Council, which would then have no reason to exist for lack of a chairperson and members. The respective undersecretaries and assistant secretaries, would also be prohibited.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The term "primary" used to describe "functions" refers to the order of importance and thus means chief or principal function. The term is not restricted to the singular but may refer to the plural. The additional duties must not only be closely related to, but must be required by the official's primary functions. Examples of designations to positions by virtue of one's primary functions are the Secretaries of Finance and Budget, sitting as members of the Monetary Board, and the Secretary of Transportation and Communications, acting as Chairman of the Maritime Industry Authority and the Civil Aeronautics Board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>The designation of the members of the Cabinet to form the NPB does not violate the prohibition contained in our Constitution as the privatization and restructuring of the electric power industry involves the close coordination and policy determination of various government agencies. Section 2 of the EPIRA clearly shows that the policy toward privatization would involve financial, budgetary and environmental concerns as well as coordination with local government units, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2. <i>Declaration of Policy. - </i>It is hereby declared the policy of the State:<br><br><blockquote>(a) To ensure and accelerate the total electrification of the country;<br>(b) To ensure the quality, reliability, security and affordability of the supply of electric power;<br>(c) To ensure transparent and reasonable prices of electricity in a regime of free and fair competition and full public accountability to achieve greater operational and economic efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of Philippine products in the global market;<br>(d) To enhance the inflow of private capital and broaden the ownership base of the power generation, transmission and distribution sectors;<br>(e) To ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of public and private sector entities<br>in the process of restructuring the electric power industry;<br>(f) To protect the public interest as it is affected by the rates and services of electric utilities and other providers of electric power;<br>(g) To assure socially and environmentally compatible energy sources and infrastructure;<br>(h) To promote the utilization of indigenous and new and renewable energy resources in power generation in order to reduce dependence on imported energy;<br>(i) To provide for an orderly and transparent privatization of the assets and liabilities of the National Power Corporation (NPC);<br>(j) To establish a strong and purely independent regulatory body and system to ensure consumer protection and enhance the competitive operation of the electricity market; and<br>(k) To encourage the efficient use of energy and other modalities of demand side management.</blockquote></blockquote><br>As can be gleaned from the foregoing enumeration, the restructuring of the electric power industry inherently involves the participation of various government agencies. In <i>Civil Liberties,</i> this Court explained that mandating additional duties and functions to Cabinet members which are not inconsistent with those already prescribed by their offices or appointments by virtue of their special knowledge, expertise and skill in their respective executive offices, is a practice long-recognized in many jurisdictions. It is a practice justified by the demands of efficiency, policy direction, continuity and coordination among the different offices in the Executive Branch in the discharge of its multifarious tasks of executing and implementing laws affecting national interest and general welfare and delivering basic services to the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The production and supply of energy is undoubtedly one of national interest and is a basic commodity expected by the people. This Court, therefore, finds the designation of the respective members of the Cabinet, as <i>ex-officio</i> members of the NPB, valid.<br><br>This Court is not unmindful, however, that Section 48 of the EPIRA is not categorical in proclaiming that the concerned Cabinet secretaries compose the NPB Board only in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity. It is only in Section 52 creating the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) that they are so designated in an <i>ex-officio</i> capacity. Sections 4 and 6 of the EPIRA provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 4. TRANSCO Board of Directors.</b><br><br>All the powers of the TRANSCO shall be vested in and exercised by a Board of Directors.

Designation connotes an imposition of additional duties, usually by law, upon a person already in the public service by virtue of an earlier appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Designation does not entail payment of additional benefits or grant upon the person so designated the right to claim the salary attached to the position. Without an appointment, a designation does not entitle the officer to receive the salary of the position. The legal basis of an employee's right to claim the salary attached thereto is a duly issued and approved appointment to the position, and not a mere designation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Hence, Congress specifically intended that the position of member of the Board of NPB shall be <i>ex-officio </i>or automatically attached to the respective offices of the members<i> </i>composing the board. It is clear from the wordings of the law that it was the intention of Congress that the subject posts will be adjunct to the respective offices of the official designated to such posts.<br><br>The foregoing discussion, notwithstanding, the concerned officials should not receive any additional compensation pursuant to their designation as ruled in <i>Civil Liberties</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The <i>ex-officio</i> position being actually and in legal contemplation part of the principal office, it follows that the official concerned has no right to receive additional compensation for his services in the said position. The reason is that these services are already paid for and covered by the compensation attached to his principal office. It should be obvious that if, say, the Secretary of Finance attends a meeting of the Monetary Board as an <i>ex-officio</i> member thereof, he is actually and in legal contemplation performing the primary function of his principal office in defining policy in monetary and banking matters, which come under the jurisdiction of his department. For such attendance, therefore, he is not entitled to collect any extra compensation, whether it be in the form of a per diem or an honorarium or an allowance, or some other such euphemism. By whatever name it is designated, such additional compensation is prohibited by the Constitution.<br></blockquote><br>In relation thereto, Section 14 of the EPIRA provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 14. <i>Board Per Diems and Allowances. - </i>The members of the Board shall receive per diem for each regular or special meeting of the board actually attended by them and, upon approval of the Secretary of the Department of Finance, such other allowances as the Board may prescribe.</blockquote><br>Section 14 relates to Section 11 which sets the composition of the TRANSCO Board naming the Secretary of the Department of Finance as the <i>ex officio </i>Chairman of the Board. The other members of the TRANSCO Board include the Secretary of the Department of Energy and the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. However, considering the constitutional prohibition, it is clear that such emoluments or additional compensation to be received by the members of the NPB do not apply and should not be received by those covered by the constitutional prohibition, <i>i.e.,</i> the Cabinet secretaries. It is to be noted that three of the members of the NPB are to be appointed by the President, who would be representing the interests of those in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, who may be entitled to such honorarium or allowance if they do not fall within the constitutional prohibition.<br><br>Hence, the said cabinet officials cannot receive any form of additional compensation by way of per diems and allowances. Moreover, any amount received by them in their capacity as members of the Board of Directors should be reimbursed to the government, since they are prohibited from collecting additional compensation by the Constitution.<br><br>These interpretations are consistent with the fundamental rule of statutory construction that a statute is to be read in a manner that would breathe life into it, rather than defeat it, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and is supported by the criteria in cases of this nature that all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>Constitutionality of Section 34</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <b>of the EPIRA</b><br><br>The Constitutionality of Section 34 of the EPIRA has already been passed upon by this Court in <i>Gerochi v.

Holding that E.O. 111 was a curative law intended to widen worker's access to the Government for redress of grievances, we held,"...the Executive Order vests in Regional Directors jurisdiction, '[t]he provisions of Article 217 of this Code to the contrary notwithstanding,' it would have rendered such a proviso - and the amendment itself - useless to say that they (Regional Directors) retained the self-same restricted powers, despite such an amendment. It is fundamental that a statute is to be read in a manner that would breathe life into it, rather than defeat it." (See also <i>Philtread Workers Union v. Confessor</i>, G.R.

The law granted the Philippine Tourism authority the right to expropriate 282 hectares of land to establish a resort complex notwithstanding the claim that certificates of land transfer and emancipation patents had already been issued to them thereby making the lands expropriated within the coverage of the land reform area under Presidential Decree No. 2, and that the agrarian reform program occupies a higher level in the order of priorities than other State policies like those relating to the health and physical well-being of the people, and that property already taken for public use may not be taken for another public use. We held that, "(t)he petitioners have failed to overcome the burden of anyone trying to strike down a statute or decree whose avowed purpose is the legislative perception of the public good. A statute has in its favor the presumption of validity. All reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a law. The courts will not set aside a law as violative of the Constitution except in a clear case (<i>People v. Vera</i>, 65 Phil. 56). And in the absence of factual findings or evidence to rebut the presumption of validity, the presumption prevails (<i>Ermita-Malate Hotel, etc. v. Mayor of Manila</i>, 20 SCRA 849; <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i>, 22 SCRA 424)."<br><br>In the same manner, we upheld in <i>Dumlao v. COMELEC</i> (G.R. No. L-52245, January 22, 1980, 95 SCRA 392) the first paragraph of Section 4 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 52 providing that any retired elective provincial, city or municipal official, who has received payment of the retirement benefits and who shall have been 65 years of age at the commencement of the term of office to which he seeks to be elected is disqualified to run for the same elective local office from which he has retired. Invoking the need for the emergence of younger blood in local politics, we affirmed that the constitutional guarantee is not violated by a reasonable classification based upon substantial distinctions, where the classification is germane to the purpose of the law and applies to all those belonging to the same class.
