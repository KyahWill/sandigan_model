SP No. 102799.<br><br>In CA-G.R. SP No. 98307 and CA-G.R. SP No. 101421, the appellate court dissolved the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 81, in Civil Case No. Q-07-59545, restraining the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage constituted by Spouses George R. Tan and Susan L. Tan (hereafter referred to as Spouses Tan) in favor of Banco De Oro Unibank, Inc. (BDO). The CA concluded that the issuance of the writ was unfounded and unsubstantiated.&nbsp; In CA-G.R. SP No. 102799, the CA found that the bond set by the RTC was grossly insufficient to cover all the damages which BDO might sustain by reason of the injunction if the court should finally decide that Spouses Tan were not entitled to the writ. It thus remanded the case to the RTC for the determination of the proper injunction bond which should not be less than P32 Million.<br><br>After the filing of the Reply to BDO's Comment in G.R. No. 188792 and while awaiting BDO's Comment on the petition in G.R. Nos. 190677-78 and Spouses Tan's Comment on the petition in G.R. Nos. 190699-700, BDO moved for extension of time to file the appropriate pleading in view of the settlement of the consolidated cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On December 16, 2010, Spouses Tan and BDO filed a Joint Manifestation and Motion to Dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> alleging that they have come to an agreement for the amicable resolution of their respective claims to avoid the inconvenience of litigation. Attached to the motion are the Compromise Agreement executed by the parties and a copy of the RTC decision approving the agreement. The Compromise Agreement reads:<br><br><blockquote><u><center>COMPROMISE AGREEMENT</center></u><br><br>This Agreement, which shall supplement <i>Memorandum of Agreement </i>dated 27 May 2010, is made and executed this _____ day of _______ 2010, by and between:<br><br><blockquote>SPOUSES GEORGE R. TAN AND SUSAN L. TAN, Filipinos, of legal age, residing at 42 Ifugao St., La Vista Subd., Brgy. Pansol, Quezon City, hereinafter referred to as "Spouses Tan";<br><br><center>- and -<br></center><br>BANCO DE ORO UNIBANK, INC., a banking corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, with office address at 10/F BDO Corporate&nbsp; Center South Tower, Makati Avenue corner H.V.
