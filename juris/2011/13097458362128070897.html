Nos.<br> 125078 and 125598</u></i></b><br><br>In accordance with the above Memorandum and Order, a total of 336&nbsp; plaintiffs from General Santos City (the petitioners in G.R. No. 125078, hereinafter referred to as NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>) filed a <b>Joint Complaint</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in the RTC of General Santos City on August 10, 1995.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 5617.&nbsp; Named as defendants therein were: Shell Oil Co. (SHELL); Dow Chemical Co. (DOW); Occidental Chemical Corp. (OCCIDENTAL); Dole Food Co., Inc., Dole Fresh Fruit Co., Standard Fruit Co., Standard Fruit and Steamship Co. (hereinafter collectively referred to as DOLE); Chiquita Brands, Inc. and Chiquita Brands International, Inc. (CHIQUITA); Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A. and Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co. (hereinafter collectively referred to as DEL MONTE); Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd.; Ameribrom, Inc.; Bromine Compounds, Ltd.; and Amvac Chemical Corp. (The aforementioned defendants are hereinafter collectively referred to as defendant companies.)<br><br>Navida, <i>et al.,</i> prayed for the payment of damages in view of the illnesses and injuries to the reproductive systems which they allegedly suffered because of their exposure to DBCP.&nbsp; They claimed, among others, that they were exposed to this chemical during the early 1970's up to the early 1980's when they used the same in the banana plantations where they worked at; and/or when they resided within the agricultural area where such chemical was used.&nbsp; Navida, <i>et al.</i>, claimed that their illnesses and injuries were due to the fault or negligence of each of the defendant companies in that they produced, sold and/or otherwise put into the stream of commerce DBCP-containing products.&nbsp; According to NAVIDA, <i>et al</i>., they were allowed to be exposed to the said products, which the defendant companies knew, or ought to have known, were highly injurious to the former's health and well-being.<br><br>Instead of answering the complaint, most of the defendant companies respectively filed their Motions for Bill of Particulars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; During the pendency of the motions, on March 13, 1996, NAVIDA, <i>et al</i>., filed an <b>Amended Joint Complaint</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> excluding Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd., Ameribrom, Inc., Bromine Compounds, Ltd. and Amvac Chemical Corp. as party defendants.<br><br>Again, the remaining defendant companies filed their various Motions for Bill of Particulars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; On May 15, 1996, DOW filed an Answer with Counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On May 20, 1996, without resolving the motions filed by the parties, the RTC of General Santos City issued an <b>Order</b> dismissing the complaint.&nbsp; First, the trial court determined that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>THE COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES<br> FILED WITH THE REGIONAL TRIAL <br>COURT SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR<br> LACK OF JURISDICTION<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The substance of the cause of action as stated in the complaint against the defendant foreign companies cites activity on their part which took place abroad and had occurred outside and beyond the territorial domain of the Philippines.&nbsp; These acts of defendants cited in the complaint included the manufacture of pesticides, their packaging in containers, their distribution through sale or other disposition, resulting in their becoming part of the stream of commerce.<br><br>Accordingly, the subject matter stated in the complaint and which is uniquely particular to the present case, consisted of activity or course of conduct engaged in by foreign defendants outside Philippine territory, hence, outside and beyond the jurisdiction of Philippine Courts, including the present Regional Trial Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>Second, the RTC of General Santos City declared that the tort alleged by Navida, <i>et al.</i>, in their complaint is a tort category that is not recognized in Philippine laws.&nbsp; Said the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>THE TORT ASSERTED IN THE <br>PRESENT COMPLAINT AGAINST <br>DEFENDANT FOREIGN COMPANIES<br> IS NOT WITHIN THE SUBJECT MATTER<br> JURISDICTION OF THE REGIONAL<br>TRIAL COURT, BECAUSE IT IS NOT<br> A TORT CATEGORY WITHIN THE <br>PURVIEW OF THE PHILIPPINE LAW<br><br>The specific tort asserted against defendant foreign companies in the present complaint is product liability tort.&nbsp; When the averments in the present complaint are examined in terms of the particular categories of tort recognized in the Philippine Civil Code, it becomes stark clear that such averments describe and identify the category of specific tort known as <u>product liability</u> tort.&nbsp; This is necessarily so, because it is the <u>product</u> manufactured by defendant foreign companies, which is asserted to be the proximate cause of the damages sustained by the plaintiff workers, and the liability of the defendant foreign companies, is premised on being the <u>manufacturer</u> of the pesticides.<br><br>It is clear, therefore, that the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction over the present case, if and only if the Civil Code of the Philippines, or a suppletory special law prescribes a product liability tort, inclusive of and comprehending the specific tort described in the complaint of the plaintiff workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Third, the RTC of General Santos City adjudged that Navida, <i>et al.</i>, were coerced into submitting their case to the Philippine courts, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>FILING OF CASES IN THE PHILIPPINES <br>- COERCED AND ANOMALOUS<br><br>The Court views that the plaintiffs did not freely choose to file the instant action, but rather were coerced to do so, merely to comply with the U.S. District Court's Order dated July 11, 1995, and in order to keep open to the plaintiffs the opportunity to return to the U.S. District Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Fourth, the trial court ascribed little significance to the voluntary appearance of the defendant companies therein, thus:<br><br><blockquote>THE DEFENDANTS' SUBMISSION TO <br>JURISDICTION IS CONDITIONAL AS<br> IT IS ILLUSORY<br><br>Defendants have appointed their agents authorized to accept service of summons/processes in the Philippines pursuant to the agreement in the U.S. court that defendants will voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of this court. While it is true that this court acquires jurisdiction over persons of the defendants through their voluntary appearance, it appears that such voluntary appearance of the defendants in this case is conditional.&nbsp; Thus in the "Defendants' Amended Agreement Regarding Conditions of Dismissal for Forum Non Conveniens" (Annex to the Complaint) filed with the U.S. District Court, defendants declared that "(t)he authority of each designated representative to accept service of process will become effective upon final dismissal of these actions by the Court".&nbsp; The decision of the U.S. District Court dismissing the case is not yet final and executory since both the plaintiffs and defendants appealed therefrom (par. 3(h), 3(i), Amended Complaint).&nbsp; Consequently, since the authority of the agent of the defendants in the Philippines is conditioned on the final adjudication of the case pending with the U.S. courts, the acquisition of jurisdiction by this court over the persons of the defendants is also conditional.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>The appointment of agents by the defendants, being subject to a suspensive condition, thus produces no legal effect and is ineffective at the moment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Fifth, the RTC of General Santos City ruled that the act of NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, of filing the case in the Philippine courts violated the rules on forum shopping and <i>litis pendencia</i>.&nbsp; The trial court expounded:<br><br><blockquote>THE JURISDICTION FROWNS UPON <br>AND PROHIBITS FORUM SHOPPING<br><br>This court frowns upon the fact that the parties herein are both vigorously pursuing their appeal of the decision of the U.S. District court dismissing the case filed thereat.&nbsp; To allow the parties to litigate in this court when they are actively pursuing the same cases in another forum, violates the rule on `forum shopping' so abhorred in this jurisdiction.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>THE FILING OF THE CASE IN U.S. <br>DIVESTED THIS COURT OF ITS OWN <br>JURISDICTION<br><br>Moreover, the filing of the case in the U.S. courts divested this court of its own jurisdiction.&nbsp; This court takes note that the U.S. District Court did not decline jurisdiction over the cause of action.&nbsp; The case was dismissed on the ground of <u>forum non conveniens</u>, which is really a matter of venue.&nbsp; By taking cognizance of the case, the U.S. District Court has, in essence, concurrent jurisdiction with this court over the subject matter of this case.&nbsp; It is settled that initial acquisition of jurisdiction divests another of its own jurisdiction. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>THIS CASE IS BARRED BY THE RULE <br>OF "<i>LITIS PENDENCIA</i>"<br><br>Furthermore, the case filed in the U.S. court involves the same parties, same rights and interests, as in this case.&nbsp; There exists <i>litis pendencia</i> since there are two cases involving the same parties and interests.&nbsp; The court would like to emphasize that in accordance with the rule on <i>litis pendencia</i> x x x; the subsequent case must be dismissed.&nbsp; Applying the foregoing [precept] to the case-at-bar, this court concludes that since the case between the parties in the U.S. is still pending, then this case is barred by the rule on "<i>litis pendencia</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In fine, the trial court held that:<br><br><blockquote>It behooves this Court, then to dismiss this case. For to continue with these proceedings, would be violative of the constitutional provision on the Bill of Rights guaranteeing speedy disposition of cases (Ref. Sec. 16, Article III, Constitution).&nbsp; The court has no other choice.&nbsp; To insist on further proceedings with this case, as it is now presented, might accord this court a charming appearance.&nbsp; But the same insistence would actually thwart the very ends of justice which it seeks to achieve.<br><br>This evaluation and action is made not on account of but rather with due consideration to the fact that the dismissal of this case does not necessarily deprive the parties - especially the plaintiffs - of their possible remedies.&nbsp; The court is cognizant that the Federal Court may resume proceedings of that earlier case between the herein parties involving the same acts or omissions as in this case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, this case is now considered DISMISSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On June 4, 1996, the RTC of General Santos City likewise issued an <b>Order</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dismissing DOW's Answer with Counterclaim.<br><br>CHIQUITA, DEL MONTE and SHELL each filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the RTC Order dated May 20, 1996, while DOW filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the RTC Order dated June 4, 1996.

Likewise, the alleged legal opinions cited in the newspaper reports were taken judicial notice of, without any notice to the parties.&nbsp; DOLE, however, opines that the dismissal of Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96 was proper, given that plaintiff claimants merely prosecuted the cases with the sole intent of securing a dismissal of the actions for the purpose of convincing the U.S. Federal District Court to re-assume jurisdiction over the cases.<br><br>In a similar vein, CHIQUITA argues that the courts <i>a quo</i> had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the cases filed before them.&nbsp; The Amended Joint-Complaints sought approximately P2.7 million in damages for each plaintiff claimant, which amount falls within the jurisdiction of the RTC.&nbsp; CHIQUITA avers that the pertinent matter is the place of the alleged exposure to DBCP, not the place of manufacture, packaging, distribution, sale, <i>etc</i>., of the said chemical.&nbsp; This is in consonance with the <i>lex loci delicti commisi</i> theory in determining the <i>situs</i> of a tort, which states that the law of the place where the alleged wrong was committed will govern the action.&nbsp; CHIQUITA and the other defendant companies also submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the RTC by making voluntary appearances and seeking for affirmative reliefs during the course of the proceedings.&nbsp; None of the defendant companies ever objected to the exercise of jurisdiction by the courts<i> a quo</i> over their persons.&nbsp; CHIQUITA, thus, prays for the remand of Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96 to the RTC of General Santos City and the RTC of Davao City, respectively.<br><br><b><i><u>The RTC of General Santos City and the<br> RTC of Davao City have jurisdiction over <br>Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96, <br>respectively </u></i></b><br><br>The rule is settled that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and is determined by the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought, irrespective of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to all or some of the claims asserted therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Once vested by law, on a particular court or body, the jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action cannot be dislodged by anybody other than by the legislature through the enactment of a law.<br><br>At the time of the filing of the complaints, the jurisdiction of the RTC in civil cases under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691, was:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 19. <i>Jurisdiction in civil cases</i>. - Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(8)&nbsp; In all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs or the value of the property in controversy exceeds One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) or, in such other cases in Metro Manila, where the demand, exclusive of the abovementioned items exceeds Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Corollary thereto, Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 09-94, states:<br><br><blockquote>2.&nbsp; The exclusion of the term "damages of whatever kind" in determining the jurisdictional amount under Section 19 (8) and Section 33 (1) of B.P.

The jurisdiction of the court cannot be made to depend upon the defenses set up in the answer or upon the motion to dismiss, for otherwise, the question of jurisdiction would almost entirely depend upon the defendants.&nbsp; What determines the jurisdiction of the court is the nature of the action pleaded as appearing from the allegations in the complaint.&nbsp; The averments therein and the character of the relief sought are the ones to be consulted.<br><br>Clearly then, the acts and/or omissions attributed to the defendant companies constitute a quasi-delict which is the basis for the claim for damages filed by NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, with individual claims of approximately P2.7 million for each plaintiff claimant, which obviously falls within the purview of the civil action jurisdiction of the RTCs.<br><br>Moreover, the injuries and illnesses, which NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, allegedly suffered resulted from their exposure to DBCP while they were employed in the banana plantations located in the Philippines or while they were residing within the agricultural areas also located in the Philippines.&nbsp; The factual allegations in the Amended Joint-Complaints all point to their cause of action, which undeniably <b>occurred in the Philippines</b>.&nbsp; The RTC of General Santos City and the RTC of Davao City obviously have reasonable basis to assume jurisdiction over the cases.<br><br>It is, therefore, error on the part of the courts <i>a quo</i> when they dismissed the cases on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the mistaken assumption that the cause of action narrated by NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, took place abroad and had occurred outside and beyond&nbsp;

In <i>personal </i>civil actions, such as claims for payment of damages, the Rules of Court allow the action to be commenced and tried in the appropriate court, where any of the plaintiffs or defendants resides, or in the case of a non-resident defendant, where he may be found, at the election of the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In a very real sense, most of the evidence required to prove the claims of NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, are available only in the Philippines.&nbsp;

Third, the testimonial and documentary evidence from important witnesses, such as doctors, co-workers, family members and other members of the community, would be easier to gather in the Philippines.&nbsp; Considering the great number of plaintiff claimants involved in this case, it is not far-fetched to assume that voluminous records are involved in the presentation of evidence to support the claim of plaintiff claimants.&nbsp; Thus, these additional factors, coupled with the fact that the alleged cause of action of NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, against the defendant companies for damages <b>occurred in the Philippines</b>, demonstrate that, apart from the RTC of General Santos City and the RTC of Davao City having jurisdiction over the subject matter in the instant civil cases, they are, indeed, the convenient fora for trying these cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>The RTC of General Santos City and the <br>RTC of Davao City validly acquired <br>jurisdiction over the persons of all the<br> defendant companies</u></i></b><br><br>It is well to stress again that none of the parties claims that the courts <i>a quo</i> lack jurisdiction over the cases filed before them.&nbsp;

In this connection, all the defendant companies designated and authorized representatives to receive summons and to represent them in the proceedings before the courts <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; All the defendant companies submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the courts <i>a quo</i> by making several voluntary appearances, by praying for various affirmative reliefs, and by actively participating during the course of the proceedings below.<br><br>In line herewith, this Court, in <i>Meat Packing Corporation of the Philippines v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> held that jurisdiction over the person of the defendant in civil cases is acquired either by his voluntary appearance in court and his submission to its authority or by service of summons.&nbsp; Furthermore, the active participation of a party in the proceedings is tantamount to an invocation of the court's jurisdiction and a willingness to abide by the resolution of the case, and will bar said party from later on impugning the court or body's jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Thus, the RTC of General Santos City and the RTC of Davao City have validly acquired jurisdiction over the persons of the defendant companies, as well as over the subject matter of the instant case.&nbsp; What is more, this jurisdiction, which has been acquired and has been vested on the courts <i>a quo,</i> continues until the termination of the proceedings.<br><br>It may also be pertinently stressed that "jurisdiction" is different from the "exercise of jurisdiction." Jurisdiction refers to the authority to decide a case, not the orders or the decision rendered therein.&nbsp; Accordingly, where a court has jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants and the subject matter, as in the case of the courts <i>a quo</i>, the decision on all questions arising therefrom is but an exercise of such jurisdiction.&nbsp; Any error that the court may commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction is merely an error of judgment, which does not affect its authority to decide the case, much less divest the court of the jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Plaintiffs' purported bad faith in <br>filing the subject civil cases in <br>Philippine courts</u></i></b><br><br>Anent the insinuation by DOLE that the plaintiff claimants filed their cases in bad faith merely to procure a dismissal of the same and to allow them to return to the forum of their choice, this Court finds such argument much too speculative to deserve any merit.<br><br>It must be remembered that this Court does not rule on allegations that are unsupported by evidence on record.&nbsp; This Court does not rule on allegations which are manifestly conjectural, as these may not exist at all.&nbsp; This Court deals with facts, not fancies; on realities, not appearances.&nbsp; When this Court acts on appearances instead of realities, justice and law will be short-lived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; This is especially true with respect to allegations of bad faith, in line with the basic rule that good faith is always presumed and bad faith must be proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In sum, considering the fact that the RTC of General Santos City and the RTC of Davao City have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the amended complaints filed by NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, and that the courts <i>a quo</i> have also acquired jurisdiction over the persons of all the defendant companies, it therefore, behooves this Court to order the remand of Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96 to the RTC of General Santos City and the RTC of Davao City, respectively.<br><br><b><i><u>On the issue of the dropping of DOW, <br>OCCIDENTAL and SHELL as <br>respondents in view of their amicable<br> settlement with NAVIDA, et al., <br>and ABELLA, et al.</u> </i></b><br><br>NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, are further praying that DOW, OCCIDENTAL and SHELL be dropped as respondents in G.R. Nos. 125078 and 126654, as well as in Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96.&nbsp; The non-settling defendants allegedly manifested that they intended to file their cross-claims against their co-defendants who entered into compromise agreements.&nbsp; NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, argue that the non-settling defendants did not aver any cross-claim in their answers to the complaint and that they subsequently sought to amend their answers to plead their cross-claims only after the settlement between the plaintiff claimants and DOW, OCCIDENTAL, and SHELL were executed.&nbsp; NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, therefore, assert that the cross-claims are already barred.<br><br>In their Memoranda, CHIQUITA and DOLE are opposing the above motion of NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, since the latter's Amended Complaints cited several instances of tortious conduct that were allegedly committed jointly and severally by the defendant companies.&nbsp; This solidary obligation on the part of all the defendants allegedly gives any co-defendant the statutory right to proceed against the other co-defendants for the payment of their respective shares.&nbsp; Should the subject motion of NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, be granted, and the Court subsequently orders the remand of the action to the trial court for continuance, CHIQUITA and DOLE would allegedly be deprived of their right to prosecute their cross-claims against their other co-defendants.&nbsp; Moreover, a third party complaint or a separate trial, according to CHIQUITA, would only unduly delay and complicate the proceedings.&nbsp; CHIQUITA and DOLE similarly insist that the motion of NAVIDA, <i>et al.</i>, and ABELLA, <i>et al.</i>, to drop DOW, SHELL and OCCIDENTAL as respondents in G.R. Nos. 125078 and 126654, as well as in Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96, be denied.<br><br>Incidentally, on April 2, 2007, after the parties have submitted their respective memoranda, DEL MONTE filed a Manifestation and Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> before the Court, stating that similar settlement agreements were allegedly executed by the plaintiff claimants with DEL MONTE and CHIQUITA sometime in 1999.&nbsp; Purportedly included in the agreements were Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96.&nbsp; Attached to the said manifestation were copies of the Compromise Settlement, Indemnity, and Hold Harmless Agreement between DEL MONTE and the settling plaintiffs, as well as the Release in Full executed by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; DEL MONTE specified therein that there were "only four (4) plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 5617 who are claiming against the Del Monte parties"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and that the latter have executed amicable settlements which completely satisfied any claims against DEL MONTE.&nbsp; In accordance with the alleged compromise agreements with the four plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 5617, DEL MONTE sought the dismissal of the Amended Joint-Complaint in the said civil case.&nbsp; Furthermore, in view of the above settlement agreements with ABELLA, <i>et al</i>., in Civil Case No. 24,251-96, DEL MONTE stated that it no longer wished to pursue its petition in G.R.

However, in subsequent developments, DEL MONTE and CHIQUITA supposedly reached their own amicable settlements with the plaintiff claimants, but DEL MONTE qualified that it entered into a settlement agreement with only four of the plaintiff claimants in Civil Case No. 5617. These four plaintiff claimants were allegedly the only ones who were asserting claims against DEL MONTE.&nbsp; However, the said allegation of DEL MONTE was simply stipulated in their Compromise Settlement, Indemnity, and Hold Harmless Agreement and its truth could not be verified with certainty based on the records elevated to this Court.&nbsp; Significantly, the 336 plaintiff claimants in Civil Case No. 5617 jointly filed a complaint without individually specifying their claims against DEL MONTE or any of the other defendant companies.&nbsp; Furthermore, not one plaintiff claimant filed a motion for the removal of either DEL MONTE or CHIQUITA as defendants in Civil Case Nos. 5617 and 24,251-96.<br><br>There is, thus, a primary need to establish who the specific parties to the alleged compromise agreements are, as well as their corresponding rights and obligations therein.&nbsp; For this purpose, the courts <i>a quo</i> may require the presentation of additional evidence from the parties. Thereafter, on the basis of the records of the cases at bar and the additional evidence submitted by the parties, if any, the trial courts can then determine who among the defendants may be dropped from the said cases.<br><br>It is true that, under Article 2194 of the Civil Code, the responsibility of two or more persons who are liable for the same quasi-delict is solidary.&nbsp; A solidary obligation is one in which each of the debtors is liable for the entire obligation, and each of the creditors is entitled to demand the satisfaction of the whole obligation from any or all of the debtors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In solidary obligations, the paying debtor's right of reimbursement is provided for under Article 1217 of the Civil Code, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 1217.
