No. 188296 is a petition for injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> with prayer for issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction. <i>Barangay</i> Captain Beda Torrecampo (Torrecampo) of <i>Barangay</i><i> Matandang Balara</i>, Quezon City, in his capacity as taxpayer and on behalf of his barangay constituents and eight million Metro Manila residents, filed the present petition against respondents Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) and Diosdado Jose M. Allado (Allado) in his official capacity as Administrator, and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and Hermogenes Ebdane (Ebdane) in his official capacity as Secretary. Torrecampo sought to enjoin respondents from implementing the Circumferential Road 5 (C-5) Extension Project over Lot Nos. 42-B-2-A, 42-A-6 and 42-A-4 (subject lots),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> all of which are owned by the MWSS.

Torrecampo insisted that the RIPADA area, consisting of Pook Ricarte, Pook Polaris and Pook Dagohoy, located in <i>Barangay</i> University of the Philippines (UP), Diliman, Quezon City, is a better alternative to subject lots.<br><br>Torrecampo filed the present petition on 1 July 2009, the very next day after the DPWH's entry. We considered the allegations and the issues in the petition and required respondents to comment thereon. We also issued a status quo order, effective from 1 July 2009 and continuing until further orders. We set the urgent application for ex-parte temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction for hearing on 6 July 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Pertinent portions of the resolution which summarized the hearing read:<br><br><blockquote>Atty. Alfredo L. Villamor, Jr. avers that the instant petition for injunction seeks to enjoin the implementation of the DPWH C-5 Road Extension Project to connect the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) to the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), alleging that the project would result to grave injustice and irreparable injury to petitioner and the eight million residents of Metro Manila considering that the impending DPWH road project includes the portion known as "Tandang Sora Section" located within petitioner's barangay, underneath which are the aqueducts supplying water to eight million residents of Metro Manila, which aqueducts might be damaged and thus imperil and disrupt water supply to all Metro Manila residents; that the petition raises the fundamental right to health under Sec. 15, Art. II of the 1987 Constitution; and that this petition for injunction has to be filed directly with the Supreme Court rather than with the lower court, pursuant to Section 3 of R.A. 8975 "An Act to Ensure the Expeditious Implementation and Completion of Government Infrastructure Projects by Prohibiting Lower Courts from Issuing Temporary Restraining Orders, Preliminary Injunctions or Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions, Providing Penalties for Violations."<br><br>Assistant Solicitor General Eric Remegio Panga, lead counsel for respondent DPWH, asserts among others, that petitioner's case does not fall within the exception cited in R.A. 8975 and that under the principle of hierarchy of courts, the petition should have been filed with the Regional Trial Court. Said counsel likewise clarified that the proposed C-5 Road Expansion Project shall not be undertaken pending completion by the DPWH of studies and tests on the safety concerns, including the determination of the existence and actual location of the aqueducts in the area.<br><br>Atty. Alberto C. Agra for respondent MWSS finds as premature the filing of the petition for injunction as there is yet no road expansion project to be implemented; that the project as conceived has yet to pass prior review by the MWSS after submission by the DPWH of a detailed study as to actual engineering design and actual tests for the conduct of any construction work; that the entry of DPWH in the area is to conduct study on the soil and on the location of the aqueducts; and that under the premises, there is yet no justiciable controversy as alleged by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>After the respective counsels presented their arguments and answered queries from the members of the Court, we resolved to require all parties to submit their memoranda within ten days from the hearing. We also deliberated on the prayer for a temporary restraining order, and resolved to lift the status quo order of 1 July 2009 considering that no grave injustice or irreparable injury would arise.<br><br>In their memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the MWSS and Allado, through the OGCC, explained the purpose of the MWSS and its participation in the C-5 Road Extension Project. Under Republic Act No. 6234 (the MWSS Charter), the MWSS owns and has jurisdiction, supervision and control over all waterworks and sewerage systems within the development path of the expanding Metro Manila area, Rizal province, and a portion of Cavite province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The MWSS installed three sub-terrain aqueducts that connect raw water from the La Mesa Dam to the Balara Filtration Plant located in <i>Barangay</i><i> Matandang Balara</i>, Diliman, Quezon City. Portions of these aqueducts are located underneath Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City, and are buried in varying depths because of the uneven surface of Quezon City's landscape.<br><br>Presidential Proclamation No. 1395 (PP 1395), issued by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on 25 September 2007, declared and reserved certain parcels of land of the RIPADA area for two purposes:<br><br><blockquote>1. As an access highway for the new road alignment of the C-5 [Road] Extension Project that will connect the NLEX and SLEX with an area of THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY (37,820) SQUARE METERS, more or less.<br><br>2.

Lot 42-C-8-B has an area of 37,820 square meters, while Lot 42-C-8-C has an area of 46,563 square meters. PP 1395 directed the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), under the direct supervision of the Office of the President, to coordinate with DPWH for detailed engineering plans and designs for the access highway as well as with the Land Registration Authority and Land Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for a comprehensive development plan for housing facilities for the affected families in the areas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> At the time of issuance of PP 1395, MWSS did not have any participation in the C-5 Extension Project.<br><br>On 3 December 2007, then MMDA Chairperson Bayani F. Fernando (Chairperson Fernando) wrote to then MWSS Administrator Lorenzo H. Jamora and proposed the utilization of certain MWSS properties for constructing Medium Rise Buildings (MRBs) for the affected families who will be displaced by the C-5 Road Extension Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Board of Trustees of the MWSS, in a meeting held on 19 June 2008, resolved to uphold the position of the MWSS management that the MWSS could not accede to Chairperson Fernando's request.

A portion of Tandang Sora road, from Magsaysay Avenue to Damayan Road, will be widened to attain a 30-meter road width, allowing three lanes per direction. The road-widening aspect of the above-mentioned portion of the project affects Lots 42-A-4 and 42-B-2-A of the MWSS. A portion of Lot 42-B-2-A was occupied by the Capitol Hills Golf &amp; Country Club until the early part of July 2009, when the MWSS allowed DPWH's entry pursuant to Board Resolution No. 2009-052.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></div><br>Torrecampo raises only one issue: Whether respondents should be enjoined from commencing with and implementing the C-5 Road Extension Project along Tandang Sora Road, affecting MWSS' properties. Torrecampo argues that (1) he has the legal standing to file the present suit; (2) only the Supreme Court may issue a restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against government projects, according to the exception in Section 3 of R.A. 8975; (3) the present suit is not premature; and (4) the implementation of the C-5 Road Extension Project violates and defeats the purpose of R.A. 8975 unless it is enjoined.<br><br>The MWSS seeks the dismissal of Torrecampo's petition on the following grounds: (1) the petition does not present a justiciable matter that requires the Court to exercise its power of judicial review; (2) the petition failed to allege Torrecampo's right that warrants the issuance of an injunction under R.A. 8975; and (3) Torrecampo failed to exhaust administrative remedies.<br><br>The DPWH also limits the issue to Torrecampo's entitlement to an injunctive writ. The DPWH argues that: (1) Torrecampo violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts; (2) MWSS did not object to DPWH's proposed project on the alleged ground that the project would destroy the aqueducts; (3) there is no credible proof that the project is implemented in the RIPADA area; (4) the alignment in the RIPADA area is more difficult to undertake compared to the DPWH alignment; (5) the petition cannot be a valid class suit because Torrecampo failed to show proof that he represents the interest of eight million residents of Metro Manila; (6) the petition is not a valid taxpayer's suit as there is yet no project to speak of; (7) the DPWH's determination of the location of the project in accordance with its specialized skills and technical expertise should be accorded with finality and respect; (8) Torrecampo is not entitled to the issuance of an injunctive writ; and (9) Torrecampo has no cause of action.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The petition must fail.

The possibility of judicial interference, as well as the speculative nature of the present petition, was clearly shown during the oral arguments:<br><br><blockquote>JUSTICE CARPIO:<br><br>Ok, so, is it the province of this Court to tell the DPWH that [it] should construct the road not in the Ripada area but here in the Tandang Sora area.

Agra:<br><br>x x x<br><br>MWSS Board of Trustees, mindful of its mandate under its Charter, issued Resolution No. 2009-052 on March 12, 2009. The MWSS Board resolved to allow the use by the Department of Public Works and Highways of the MWSS Balara, La Mesa aqueducts' Right of Way for the implementation of the Katipunan-Tandang Sora segment circumferential road [extension] project. However, as pointed out by counsel, the implementation of the Resolution, is subject to two conditions precedent: (1) prior review by management of MWSS of the road construction design, and (2) opinion from the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel approving the use of the Right of Way. To date, the conditions have not been complied with, simply because no road construction design has been prepared and submitted to the MWSS management for consideration. The objective, therefore, of the entry into the MWSS property last week is two (2) fold. First, the purpose of the entry is to fence off, clear, segregate and secure the property in order that DPWH can conduct the necessary complete study and detailed design of the proposed road extension project. The study includes test pitting and geo-technical profiling. The results of the study will show the condition and location of the aqueducts, the condition and classification of the soil, the requirements to protect the aqueducts, assuming that the detailed design is approved by the MWSS. Second reason, the entry is simply an act of the ownership of the MWSS over its property along Tandang Sora. The lease contract with Capitol Golf expired in 2005. And therefore, with or without the road extension project, the property should be fenced off. In sum, no approval of the road extension project has been made by the MWSS since no study has been submitted to it.<br><br>MWSS recognizes the existence of two plans concerning the extension of the C-5. The other plan referred to in the petition as the better alternative is being pursued by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. The proposed road shall traverse Pook Ricarte, Pook Polaris and Dagohoy, which is referred to as the Ripada, within the University of the Philippines. An integral part of the project per Proclamation 1395, is the proposed construction of medium-rise buildings within the University of the Philippines. Therefore, Your Honors, under Proclamation 1395, MWSS has no role, there is no aqueduct that would be affected by this proposed project under Proclamation No. 1395. However, in a proposed proclamation which would effectively amend Proclamation No. 1395, the proposed relocation site of the bonafide residents of the University of the Philippines shall be within MWSS property along Tandang Sora. This is the subject of the petition. The letter of Administrator Diosdado Allado dated June 20, 2008, which is attached to the petition as Annex "B," was written in connection with the proposed proclamation not in connection with Proclamation No. 1395. The proposed proclamation again pertains to the proposed relocation of UP residents within the MWSS property, in connection with the proposed C-5 project being carried out by MMDA. The first paragraph of the letter was conveniently omitted by petitioner in his discussion. Because the first paragraph of the letter puts into context the objections of the MWSS. What petitioner projects is that the objections of the MWSS pertains to the road extension project while in truth and in fact the letter referred, signed by Mr. Allado, the Administrator of the MWSS, refers to the objections not on the the proposed road widening project, but on the proposed housing project. The objections of the MWSS of any disruption or any disturbance on the aqueducts are confined to the proposed construction of medium-rise buildings that will be constructed on top of the aqueducts. Thus, MWSS is not objecting to any proposed extension road project on top of the aqueducts. At this point MWSS cannot object or concur with any road project since no comprehensive study has been made and has been submitted to the MWSS for its approval.<br><br>Further, it would be erroneous to automatically assume that any road above the aqueducts would necessarily impair or compromise the integrity of the aqueducts. At present, as pointed out by the Office of the Solicitor General, there are portions of the aqueducts which are under Commonwealth Avenue, Luzon Avenue and Tandang Sora. The aqueducts to this day are intact and serve the water needs of the 8 million residents of Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>The determination of where, as between two possible routes, to construct a road extension is obviously not within the province of this Court. Such determination belongs to the Executive branch. Moreover, in this case the DPWH still has to conduct the proper study to determine whether a road can be safely constructed on land beneath which runs the aqueducts. Without such study, the MWSS, which owns the land, cannot decide whether to allow the DPWH to construct the road. Absent such DPWH study and MWSS decision, no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction can be alleged against or attributed to respondents warranting the exercise of this Court's extraordinary certiorari power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Indeed, for the above reason alone, Torrecampo's petition must fail.

In summarizing the definition of the term, "political question," Justice Concepcion wrote: "In short, the term `political question' connotes, in legal parlance, what it means in ordinary parlance, namely, a question of policy. In other words, in the language of Corpus Juris Secundum, it refers to `those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be <i>decided by the people</i> in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which <i>full discretionary authority</i> has been delegated to the Legislature or executive branch of the Government.' It is concerned with issues dependent upon the <i>wisdom,</i> not legality, of a particular measure."
