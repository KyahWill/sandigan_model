				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For Review before this Court is the Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 00271, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 29 February 2008, finding accused Felipe Mirandilla, Jr., (Mirandilla) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of special complex crime of kidnapping with rape; four counts of rape; and, one count of rape through sexual assault.<br><br>Mirandilla is now asking this Court to acquit him. He contends that he could not have kidnapped and raped the victim, AAA, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> whom he claims to be his live-in partner. The records, however, reveal with moral certainty his guilt. Accordingly, We modify the CA Decision and find him guilty of the special complex crime of kidnapping and illegal detention with rape.<br><br><center><u><b>THE FACTS</b></u><br></center><br><center><b>AAA narrated her 39-day ordeal in the hands of Mirandilla.</b><br></center><br>It was 2 December 2000, eve of the <i>fiesta </i>in <i>Barangay</i> San Francisco, Legazpi City. At the plaza, AAA was dancing with her elder sister, BBB. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>AAA went out of the dancing hall to buy candies in a nearby store. While making her way back through the crowd, a man grabbed her hand, his arm wrapped her shoulders, with a knife's point thrust at her right side. She will come to know the man's name at the police station, after her escape, to be Felipe Mirandilla, Jr. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; He told her not to move or ask for help. Another man joined and went beside her, while two others stayed at her back, one of whom had a gun. They slipped through the unsuspecting crowd, walked farther as the deafening music faded into soft sounds. After a four-hour walk through the grassy fields, they reached the Mayon International Hotel, where they boarded a waiting tricycle. Upon passing the Albay Cathedral, the others alighted, leaving AAA alone with Mirandilla who after receiving a gun from a companion, drove the tricycle farther away and into the darkness. Minutes later, they reached the <i>Gallera de Legazpi</i> in Rawis. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Mirandilla dragged AAA out of the tricycle and pushed her inside a concrete house. At gunpoint he ordered her to remove her pants. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> When she defied him, he slapped her and hit her arms with a gun, forced his hands inside her pants, into her panty, and reaching her vagina, slipped his three fingers and rotated them inside. The pain weakened her. He forcibly pulled her pants down and lifting her legs, pushed and pulled his penis inside. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> "<i>Sayang ka</i>," she heard him whisper at her, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> as she succumbed to pain and exhaustion.<br><br>When AAA woke up the following morning, she found herself alone. She cried for help, shouting until her throat dried. But no one heard her. No rescue came.<br><br>At around midnight, Mirandilla arrived together with his gang. Pointing a gun at AAA, he ordered her to open her mouth; she sheepishly obeyed. He forced his penis inside her mouth, pulling through her hair with his left hand and slapping her with his right. After satisfying his lust, he dragged her into the tricycle and drove to Bogtong, Legazpi. At the road's side, Mirandilla pushed her against a reclining tree, gagged her mouth with cloth, punched her arm, thigh, and lap, and pulled up her over-sized shirt. Her underwear was gone. Then she felt Mirandilla's penis inside her vagina. A little while, a companion warned Mirandilla to move out. And they drove away. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>They reached a nipa hut and AAA was thrown inside. Her mouth was again covered with cloth. Mirandilla, with a gun aimed at her point blank, grabbed her shirt, forced her legs open, and again inserted his penis into her vagina. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The following evening, Mirandilla and his gang<i> </i>brought AAA to Guinobatan, where she suffered the same fate. They repeatedly detained her at daytime, moved her back and forth from one place to another on the following nights, first to Bonga, then back to Guinobatan, where she was locked up in a cell-type house and was raped repeatedly on the grassy field right outside her cell, then to Camalig, where they caged her in a small house in the middle of a rice field. She was allegedly raped 27 times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>One afternoon, in Guinobatan, AAA succeeded in opening the door of her cell. Seeing that Mirandilla and his companions were busy playing cards, she rushed outside and ran, crossed a river, got drenched, and continued running. She rested for awhile, hiding behind a rock; she walked through the fields and stayed out of people's sight for two nights. Finally, she found a road and followed its path, leading her to the house of Evelyn Guevarra who brought her to the police station. It was 11 January 2001. AAA was in foul smell, starving and sleepless. Evelyn Guevarra gave her a bath and the police gave her food. When the police presented to her pictures of suspected criminals, she recognized the man's face - she was certain it was him. He was Felipe Mirandilla, Jr., the police told her. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The following morning, accompanied by the police, AAA submitted herself to Dr. Sarah Vasquez, Legazpi City's Health Officer for medical examination. The doctor discovered hymenal lacerations in different positions of her hymen, indicative of sexual intercourse. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Foul smelling pus also oozed from her vagina - AAA had contracted gonorrhoea. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><center><b>Mirandilla denied the charges against him. This is his version.</b><br></center><br>Mirandilla first met AAA on 3 October 2000. By stroke of fate, they bumped into each other at the Albay Park where AAA, wearing a school uniform, approached him. They had a short chat. They were neighbors in <i>Barangay</i> San Francisco until Mirandilla left his wife and daughter there for good. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Two days later, Mirandilla and AAA met again at the park. He started courting her, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and, after five days, as AAA celebrated her 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, they became lovers. Mirandilla was then 33 years old.<br><br>Immediately, Mirandilla and AAA had sex nightly in their friends' houses and in cheap motels. On 24 October 2000, after Mirandilla went to his mother's house in Kilikao, they met again at the park, at their usual meeting place, in front of the park's comfort room, near Arlene Moret, a cigarette vendor who also served as the CR's guard. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They decided to elope and live as a couple. They found an abandoned house in Rawis, at the back of <i>Gallera de Legazpi. </i>Emilio Mendoza who owned the house, rented it to them for P1,500.00. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They lived there from 28 October until 11 December 2000. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> From 12 December 2000 until 11 January 2001, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Mirandilla and AAA stayed in Rogelio Marcellana's house, at the resettlement Site in Banquerohan, Legazpi City.<br><br>Mirandilla and AAA's nightly sexual intimacy continued, with abstentions only during AAA's menstrual periods, the last of which she had on 7 December 2000. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In late December, however, Mirandilla, who just arrived home after visiting his mother in Kilikao, saw AAA soaked in blood, moaning in excruciating stomach pain. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; AAA had abortion - an inference he drew upon seeing the cover of pills lying beside AAA. Mirandilla claimed that AAA bled for days until she left him in January 2001 after quarrelling for days. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Mirandilla, however, had a second version of this crucial event. He claimed that AAA missed her menstruation in December 2000 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and that he would not have known she had an abortion had she not confessed it to him. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>THE RTC RULING</b></u><br></center><br>Mirandilla was charged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Legazpi City, Branch 5, with kidnapping with rape (Crim. Case No. 9278), four counts of rape (Crim. Case Nos. 9274 to 9277), and rape through sexual assault (Crim. Case No. 9279).<br><br>The RTC, in its decision dated 1 July 2004, convicted Mirandilla of kidnapping, four counts of rape, and one count of rape through sexual assault with this finding:<br><br><blockquote>This Court has arrived at the factual conclusion that Felipe Mirandilla, Jr., in the company of three others [conferrers], kidnapped AAA in <i>Barangay</i> xxx, City of xxx, on or on about midnight of December 2, 2000 or early morning of December 3, 2000, held her in detention for thirty-nine days in separate cells situated in the City of xxx; xxx; and xxx. Felipe Mirandilla, Jr., carnally abused her while holding a gun and/or a knife for twenty seven times, employing force and intimidation. The twenty seven sexual intercourses were eventually perpetrated between the City of xxx and the towns of xxx and xxx. At least once, Felipe Mirandilla, Jr., put his penis inside the mouth of AAA against her will while employing intimidation, threats, and force. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><u><b>THE COURT OF APPEALS RULING</b></u></center><br><br>On review, the CA affirmed with modification the RTC ruling, convicting Mirandilla. It found him guilty of the special complex crime of kidnapping with rape (instead of kidnapping as the RTC ruled), four counts of rape, and one count of rape by sexual assault. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> It rejected Mirandilla's defense that he and AAA were live-in partners and that their sexual encounters were consensual. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It noted that Mirandilla failed to adduce any evidence or any credible witness to sustain his defense. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>Mirandilla repeats his allegations that the prosecution's lone witness, AAA, was not a credible witness and that he and AAA were live-in partners whose intimacy they expressed in consensual sex.<br><br><center><u><b>OUR RULING</b></u><br></center><br><b><i>We find Mirandilla guilty of the special complex crime of kidnapping and illegal detention with rape.</i></b><br><br>Mirandilla admitted in open court to have had sexual intercourse with AAA, which happened almost nightly during their cohabitation. He contended that they were live-in partners, entangled in a whirlwind romance, which intimacy they expressed in countless passionate sex, which headed ironically to separation mainly because of AAA's intentional abortion of their first child to be - a betrayal in its gravest form which he found hard to forgive.<br><br>In stark contrast to Mirandilla's tale of a love affair, is AAA's claim of her horrific ordeal and her flight to freedom after 39 days in captivity during which Mirandilla raped her 27 times.<br><br><center><i>First Issue:</i><br><br><i>Credibility of Prosecution Witness</i><br></center><br>Jurisprudence is consistent that for testimonial evidence to be believed, it must not only come from a credible witness but must be credible in itself - tested by human experience, observation, common knowledge and accepted conduct that has evolved through the years. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><i>Daggers v. Van Dyck</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> illuminates:<br><br><blockquote>Evidence to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but it must be credible in itself - such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.&nbsp; We have no test of the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation, and experience.&nbsp; Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br><i>First,</i> the trial judge, who had the opportunity of observing AAA's manner and demeanour on the witness stand, was convinced of her credibility: "AAA appeared to be a simple and truthful woman, whose testimony was consistent, steady and firm, free from any material and serious contradictions." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The court continued:<br><br><blockquote>The record nowhere yields any evidence of ill motive on the part of AAA to influence her in fabricating criminal charges against Felipe Mirandilla, Jr. The absence of ill motive enhances the standing of AAA as a witness.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>When AAA testified in court, she was sobbing. While she was facing Felipe Mirandilla, Jr., to positively identify him in open court, she was crying. Felipe Mirandilla Jr.'s response was to smile. AAA was a picture of a woman who was gravely harmed, craving for justice. x x x. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br><i>Second,</i> the trial court found AAA's testimony to be credible in itself. AAA's ordeal was entered into the police blotter immediately after her escape, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> negating opportunity for concoction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> While in Mirandilla's company, none of her parents, brothers, sisters, relatives, classmates, or anyone who knew her, visited, saw, or talked to her. None of them knew her whereabouts. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> AAA's testimony was corroborated by Dr. Sarah Vasquez, Legazpi City's Health Officer, who discovered the presence not only of hymenal lacerations but also gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted disease.<br><br>More importantly, AAA remained consistent in the midst of gruelling cross examination. The defense lawyer tried to impeach her testimony, but failed to do so.<br><br>The Court of Appeals confirmed AAA's credibility in affirming the RTC decision.<br><br>We emphasize that a trial court's assessment of a witness' credibility, when affirmed by the CA, is even conclusive and binding, if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight or influence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; This is so because of the judicial experience that trial courts are in a better position to decide the question of credibility, having heard the witnesses themselves and having observed firsthand their deportment and manner of testifying under gruelling examination. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Estioca v. People,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we held:<br><br><blockquote>In resolving issues pertaining to the credibility of the witnesses, this Court is guided by the following principles: (1) the reviewing court will not disturb the findings of the lower courts, unless there is a showing that it overlooked or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that may affect the result of the case; (2) the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect and even finality, as it had the opportunity to examine their demeanour when they testified on the witness stand; and (3) a witness who testifies in a clear, positive and convincing manner is a credible witness. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><i>Second Issue</i><br><br><i>"Sweetheart Theory" not Proven</i><br></center><br>Accused's bare invocation of sweetheart theory cannot alone, stand. To be credible, it must be corroborated by documentary, testimonial, or other evidence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Usually, these are letters, notes, photos, mementos, or credible testimonies of those who know the lovers. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The sweetheart theory as a defense, however, necessarily admits carnal knowledge, the first element of rape. Effectively, it leaves the prosecution the burden to prove only force or intimidation, the coupling element of rape. Love, is not a license for lust. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This admission makes the sweetheart theory more difficult to defend, for it is not only an affirmative defense that needs convincing proof; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> after the prosecution has successfully established a <i>prima facie</i> case, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the burden of evidence is shifted to the accused, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> who has to adduce evidence that the intercourse was consensual. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>A <i>prima facie</i> case arises when the party having the burden of proof has produced evidence sufficient to support a finding and adjudication for him of the issue in litigation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Burden of evidence is "that logical necessity which rests on a party at any particular time during the trial to create a <i>prima facie</i> case in his favour <b>or to overthrow one when created against him."</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Mirandilla with his version of facts as narrated above attempted to meet the prosecution's <i>prima facie</i> case. To corroborate it, he presented his mother, Alicia Mirandilla; his relatives, Rogelio Marcellana and Emilio Mendoza; and, his friend Arlene Moret.<br><br>Arlene Moret, the cigarette vendor who also served as the CR's guard, testified that on 30 October 2000, AAA and Mirandilla arrived together at the park. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> They approached her and chatted with her. On cross examination, she claimed otherwise: Mirandilla arrived alone two hours earlier, chatting with her first, before AAA finally came. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> She also claimed meeting the couple for the first time on 30 October 2000, only to contradict herself on cross examination with the version that she met them previously, three times at least, in the previous month. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> On the other hand, Mirandilla claimed first meeting AAA on 3 October 2000 at the park. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The accused's mother, Alicia Mirandilla, testified meeting her son only once, and living in Kilikao only after his imprisonment. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This contradicted Mirandilla's claim that he visited his mother several times in Kilikao, from October 2000 until January 2001. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Even Mirandilla contradicted himself. His claim that he saw AAA soaked in blood, agonizing in pain, with the abortifacient pills' cover lying nearby, cannot be reconciled with his other claim that he came to know AAA's abortion only through the latter's admission. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Taken individually and as a whole, the defense witnesses' testimonies contradicted each other and flip-flopped on materials facts, constraining this Court to infer that they concocted stories in a desperate attempt to exonerate the accused.<br><br>As a rule, self-contradictions and contradictory statement of witnesses should be reconciled, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> it being true that such is possible since a witness is not expected to give error-free testimony considering the lapse of time and the treachery of human memory. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> But, this principle, learned from lessons of human experience, applies only to minor or trivial matters - innocent lapses that do not affect witness' credibility. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> They do not apply to self-contradictions on material facts. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Where these contradictions cannot be reconciled, the Court has to reject the testimonies, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and apply the maxim, <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.</i> Thus,<br><br><blockquote>To completely disregard all the testimony of a witness based on the maxim <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus,</i> testimony must have been false as to a material point, and the witness must have a conscious and deliberate intention to falsify a material point. In other words, its requirements, which must concur, are the following: (1) that the false testimony is as to one or more material points; and (2) that there should be a conscious and deliberate intention to falsity. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><i>Crimes and Punishment</i><br></center><br>An appeal in criminal case opens the entire case for review on any question, including one not raised by the parties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This was our pronouncement in the 1902 landmark case of <i>U.S. v. Abijan,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><i> </i>which is now embodied in Section 11, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court:<br><br><blockquote>SEC 11. <i>Scope of Judgment.</i> - The Court of Appeals may reverse, affirm, or modify the judgment <b>and increase or reduce the penalty imposed by the trial court,</b> remand the case to the Regional Trial Court for new trial or retrial, or dismiss the case. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The reason behind this rule is that when an accused appeals from the sentence of the trial court, he waives the constitutional safeguard against double jeopardy and throws the whole case open to the review of the appellate court, which is then called upon to render such judgment as law and justice dictate, whether favorable or unfavorable to the appellant. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, the six informations charged Mirandilla with kidnapping and serious illegal detention with rape (Crim. Case No. 9278), four counts of rape (Crim. Case Nos. 9274-75-76-77), and one count of rape through sexual assault (Crim. Case No. 9279).<br><br>The accusatory portion of the information in Criminal Case No. 9278 alleged that Mirandilla kidnapped AAA and seriously and illegally detained her for more than three days during which time he had carnal knowledge of her, against her will. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the CA in finding Mirandilla guilty of the special complex crime of kidnapping with rape, instead of simple kidnapping as the RTC ruled. It was the RTC, no less, which found that Mirandilla kidnapped AAA, held her in detention for 39 days and carnally abused her while holding a gun and/or a knife. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code states that:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 266-A. Rape, <i>When and How Committed. </i>- Rape is committed -<br><br><ol><li>By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>Through force, threat or intimidation; xxx.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person.</li></ol></blockquote><br>AAA was able to prove each element of rape committed under Article 266-A, par. 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, that (1) Mirandilla had carnal knowledge of her; (2) through force, threat, or intimidation. She was also able to prove each element of rape by sexual assault under Article 266-A, par. 2 of the Revised Penal Code: (1) Mirandilla inserted his penis into her mouth; (2) through force, threat, or intimidation.<br><br>Likewise, kidnapping and serious illegal detention is provided for under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code:<br><br><blockquote><b>Article 267. </b><i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention.</i> - Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death;<br><br>1. If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than three days. xxx<br></blockquote>An imminent Spanish commentator explained:<br><br><blockquote><i>la detención, la prición, la privación de la libertad de una persona, en cualquier forma y por cualquier medio ó por cualquier tiempo en virtud de la cual resulte interrumpido el libre ejercicio de su actividad."</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Emphatically, the last paragraph of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> states that when the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is <b>raped,</b> or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, <b>the maximum penalty shall be imposed.</b> This provision gives rise to a <b>special complex crime</b>. As the Court explained in <i>People v. Larrañaga,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> this arises where the law provides a single penalty for two or more component offenses. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Notably, however, no matter how many rapes had been committed in the special complex crime of kidnapping with rape, the resultant crime is only one kidnapping with rape. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This is because these composite acts are regarded as a single indivisible offense as in fact R.A. No. 7659 punishes these acts with only one single penalty. In a way, R.A. 7659 depreciated the seriousness of rape because no matter how many times the victim was raped, like in the present case, there is only one crime committed - the special complex crime of kidnapping with rape.<br><br>However, for the crime of kidnapping with rape, as in this case, the offender should not have taken the victim with lewd designs, otherwise, it would be complex crime of forcible abduction with rape. In <i>People v. Garcia,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> we explained that if the taking was by forcible abduction and the woman was raped several times, the crimes committed is one complex crime of forcible abduction with rape, in as much as the forcible abduction was only necessary for the first rape; and each of the other counts of rape constitutes distinct and separate count of rape. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>It having been established that Mirandilla's act was kidnapping and serious illegal detention (not forcible abduction) and on the occasion thereof, he raped AAA several times, We hold that Mirandilla is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of <b>kidnapping and serious illegal detention with rape</b>, warranting the penalty of death. However, in view of R.A.

Thus, in <i>People v. Quiachon</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> the Court pronounced that even if the penalty of death is not to be imposed because of R.A. No. 9346, the civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> of P75,000.00 still applies because this indemnity is <b>not dependent on the actual imposition of death,</b> <b>but on the fact that qualifying circumstances warranting the penalty of death attended the commission of the offense.</b> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><b> </b>As explained in <i>People v. Salome</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> while R.A.

This move of dispensing evidence to prove moral damage in rape cases, traces its origin in <i>People v. Prades,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> where we held that:<br><br><blockquote>The Court has also resolved that in crimes of rape, such as that under consideration, <b>moral damages</b> <b>may additionally be awarded to the victim in the criminal proceeding, in such amount as the Court deems just, without the need for pleading or proof of the basis thereof as has heretofore been the practice.</b> Indeed, the conventional requirement of <i>allegata et probata</i> in civil procedure and for essentially civil cases should be dispensed with in criminal prosecutions for rape with the civil aspect included therein, since no appropriate pleadings are filed wherein such allegations can be made. (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Corollarily, the fact that complainant has suffered the trauma of mental, physical and psychological sufferings which constitute the bases for moral damages <b>are too obvious to still require the recital thereof at the trial by the victim, </b>since the Court itself even assumes and acknowledges such agony on her part as a gauge of her credibility.&nbsp; What exists by necessary implication as being ineludibly present in the case need not go through superfluity of still being proven through a testimonial charade.
