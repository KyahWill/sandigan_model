Under no stretch of legal hermeneutics can it be contended that these funds were lost through abandonment or negligence without petitioner's knowledge as to put the loss within a merely culpable category. <b><u>From the contention of either party, the misappropriation was intentional and not through negligence.</u>&nbsp; </b><br><br>Besides, even on the putative assumption that the evidence against petitioner yielded a case of malversation by negligence but the information was for intentional malversation, under the circumstances of this case his conviction under the first mode of misappropriation would still be in order.

The <i>dolo</i> or the <i>culpa</i> present in the offense is only a modality in the perpetration of the felony. <b><u>Even if the mode charged differs from the mode proved, the same offense of malversation is involved and conviction thereof is proper.</u></b> A possible exception would be when the mode of commission alleged in the particulars of the indictment is so far removed from the ultimate categorization of the crime that it may be said due process was denied by deluding the accused into an erroneous comprehension of the charge against him.
