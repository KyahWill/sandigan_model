				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">Before this Court is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated June 23, 2009, which affirmed the resolution dated August 26, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Appeals Committee, sustaining the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated April 10, 2008 of the DTI Adjudication Officer (Adjudication Officer).
<p></p><p>The facts, as quoted by the CA from the Adjudication Officer’s findings, are as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>DTI-NCR’s records show that numerous administrative complaints have
 been filed against Aowa Electronic Philippines, Inc. by different 
consumers, or a total of at least two hundred and seventy-three (273) 
from the year 2001 until 2007. The facts narrated in the said complaints
 consistently contain a common thread, as follows:  </p>
</blockquote>

<ul><li>A target customer is approached by Aowa’s representatives, usually
 in a mall and informs the former that he/she has won a gift or is to 
receive some giveaways. In certain cases, when the target customer 
expresses interest in the said “gift” or giveaway, Aowa’s 
representatives then verbally reveal that the same can only be claimed 
or received upon purchase of an additional product or products, which 
are represented to be of high quality. However, consumer complainants 
allege that such products are substantially priced. <br>
  </li><li>An initial gift is offered to the target customer, and upon 
acceptance, the customer is invited to [Aowa’s] store/outlet. It is at 
that point that the customer is informed that he/she has qualified for a
 raffle draw or contest, entitling them to claim an additional “gift.” 
In the same manner, such additional gift can be received only upon the 
purchase of additional products, also represented to be of high quality,
 and sometimes similarly alleged to be substantially charged. <br>
  </li><li>[In] the course of enticing the target customer to purchase the 
additional product, they are physically surrounded by Aowa’s 
representatives, otherwise known to many as “ganging up” o[n] customers.
 <br>
  </li><li>Although the customer is required to purchase an additional 
product to claim the offered “gift/s,” this is not disclosed during the 
initial stages of the sales pitch. The revelation is only done when the 
target customer is being surrounded by Aowa’s representatives within its
 showroom/store/outlet.
  
	In some cases, when customers state that they are short of cash, 
[Aowa’s] representatives urge said customers to use their credit card or
 to withdraw from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). There are even 
instances where [Aowa’s] representatives accompany a customer to his/her
 residence, where the latter can produce their (sic) means of payment.
  
    <br>
    <br>
  In view thereof, DTI-NCR filed a Formal Charge against AOWA for 
violation of Articles 50 and 52 of the Consumer Act of the Philippines, 
praying that a Cease and Desist Order be issued, and [an] administrative
 fine be imposed, and other reliefs or remedies be granted as may be 
just and equitable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></li></ul>
The CA further narrates:

<blockquote>
  <p>When asked to Answer, AOWA denied having violated the provisions of
 the Consumer Act. A notice of preliminary conference was thereafter 
issued, giving the parties to find (sic) ways and means to expedite the 
proceedings, but the scheduled preliminary conference had to be 
terminated, as the proposal to enter into a plea bargain agreement did 
not ensue. As a consequence thereof, both parties were required to 
submit their respective position papers.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, a Preventive Measure Order (PMO) was issued by the DTI 
in order to prohibit AOWA from continuing with the act complained of 
until such time that a sale promotion permit is secured or obtained from
 the DTI.</p>
  <p> In their position paper, AOWA vehemently denied committing any 
violation of the provisions of the Consumer Act as it does not employ 
the marketing scheme described in the formal charge. AOWA argued that 
the mere filing of the consumer complaint does not prove outright that 
an offense has been committed by it, meaning that it is not a conclusive
 proof that it is violating the law it is charged of. It stressed that 
all of the consumer complaints against it have not prospered, as the 
cases have been amicably settled. In addition, majority of the consumer 
complaints which served as basis for the filing of the formal charge are
 already deemed barred by prescription. As far as it is concerned 
therefore, AOWA claims that the complaint[s are] based on mere 
assumption and not on established facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

On April 10, 2008, after considering the arguments of petitioner Aowa 
Electronic Philippines, Inc. (Aowa) and respondent DTI-National Capital 
Region (NCR), the Adjudication Officer found that the complaints against
 Aowa continued to increase despite its claims of amicable settlement. 
He also found that Aowa submitted no proof of such amicable settlement. 
Based on the numerous complaints against Aowa, the Adjudication Officer 
held that the DTI had sufficiently established <i><i>prima facie</i></i>
 evidence against Aowa for violation of the applicable provisions of 
Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7394, or the Consumer Act of the Philippines 
(the Consumer Act), and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). 
Furthermore, the Adjudication Officer highlighted that Aowa failed to 
secure any Sales Promotion Permit from the DTI for Aowa’s alleged 
promotional sales. Thus, he ruled:

<blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, and by virtue of the 
power and mandate vested in this Department, to promote and encourage 
fair, honest and equitable relations among parties in consumer 
transactions and protect the consumer against deceptive, unfair and 
unconscionable sales act or practices, [Aowa] is hereby declared liable 
under the Consumer Act of the Philippines and the Rules and Regulations 
Implementing the same.
  
As a consequence thereof, it is hereby ordered, that –</p>
  <p> a) 	[Aowa] must permanently cease and desist from operating its  business in all its stores/outlets nationwide;</p>
  <p>b) 	[Aowa’s] Certificates of Business Name Registration for all its
 stores/outlets applying the sales scheme in question be cancelled;</p>
  <p>c) 	[Aowa’s] application for the registration of the same or 
another business name be withheld by DTI if the nature thereof is the 
same as that mentioned in this case;</p>
  <p>d) 	[Aowa] must pay and/or refund to those who filed administrative
 complaint[s] with any DTI Office, the amount of money paid in 
consideration for the purchase of products sold in [Aowa’s] 
stores/outlets as a precondition to the claim of the gift/reward 
promised to be given to said complainants[; and]</p>
  <p>e) 	[Aowa] must pay a one time Administrative Fine of Three Hundred
 Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00), Philippine currency, either in cash or in
 the form of Company or Manager’s check, at the DTI Cashier’s Office, 
4th Floor, Trade and Industry Building, 361 Sen. Gil Puyat Ave., Makati 
City.</p>
  <p>Let a copy of this Decision be furnished to all Heads of DTI 
Provincial and Area Offices who are hereby directed to disseminate 
copies hereof to the Heads of Business Permit Bureau/Division of the 
different municipalities or cities within their respective jurisdictions
 for their appropriate action.</p>
  </blockquote><p style="margin-left: 40px;">SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>


  <p>Aggrieved, Aowa sought recourse from the DTI Appeals Committee, ascribing grave abuse of discretion to the Adjudication Officer.
  
</p>
  <p>On August 26, 2008, the DTI Appeals Committee dismissed Aowa’s 
appeal and sustained the Adjudication Officer’s decision. It held that 
the techniques and schemes employed by Aowa were fraudulent, as they 
were being used as a bait to lure customers into buying its products. 
The DTI Appeals Committee noted that Aowa’s act of giving gifts and 
prizes to its prospective customers in order to entice the latter to 
enter Aowa’s store and to purchase its products is a common thread in 
every complaint lodged against Aowa before the DTI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
  <p>Unperturbed, Aowa filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule
 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure before the CA. On June 23, 2009, the
 CA affirmed the findings and ruling of the DTI Appeals Committee. The 
CA heavily relied on the findings of the Adjudication Officer and the 
DTI Appeals Committee, showing that Aowa committed acts of 
misrepresentation against its customers, clearly violative of the 
Consumer Act. Likewise, the CA affirmed the lower agencies’ findings 
that Aowa indeed did not secure any Sales Promotion Permit for its 
promotional sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
  <p>Unyielding, Aowa filed its motion for reconsideration, which the CA, however, denied in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated September 29, 2009.</p>
  <p>Hence, this petition based on the following grounds: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[I.] WITH DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY 
ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT BASIS IN THE FILING OF THE 
FORMAL CHARGE AGAINST HEREIN PETITIONER NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT 
THE SAID FORMAL CHARGE WAS MERELY BASED ON CONSUMER COMPLAINTS WHICH 
HAVE ALL BEEN AMICABLY SETTLED AND DISMISSED. MOREOVER, THE HEREIN 
RESPONDENT DOES NOT HAVE ANY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
SURROUNDING ALL THE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THE PETITIONER[;]
  
[II.] </p>
    <p>WITH DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED 
WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE HARSH AND EXCESSIVE DECISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
TRADE AND INDUSTRY, APPEALS COMMITTEE ORDERING THE HEREIN PETITIONER TO 
PERMANENTLY CEASE AND DESIST FROM OPERATING ITS BUSINESS AND IN ADDITION
 TO PAY THE MAXIMUM FINE PROVIDED UNDER THE LAW NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT
 THAT THE FORMAL CHARGE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ANY CONCRETE, SUFFICIENT AND
 CONVINCING EVIDENCE[; AND]</p>
    <p>[III.] WITH DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY 
ERRED IN ITS RULING THAT THE ASSAILED RESOLUTION’S ORDER MAY BE ENFORCED
 NATIONWIDE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE COMPLAINT PERTAINS TO CASES IN THE
 NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION ONLY[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

  <p>Aowa claims that the complaints filed against it merely pertain to 
cases in the NCR, hence, there was no basis for the DTI to presume that 
the alleged offenses committed by petitioner are likewise practiced in 
other places in the country; that DTI never denied Aowa’s averment that 
the cases filed against it by customers were already and actually 
settled; that the mere filing of numerous complaints does not prove 
outright that an offense has been committed; and that the complaints 
were based on mere assumptions and not on established facts. Moreover, 
Aowa’s act of amicably settling the cases with the consumer-complainants
 manifests Aowa’s good faith and fair dealing with its patrons, not 
commensurate with the penalty of closure and the maximum fine imposed by
 the DTI. Finally, Aowa denies that it committed fraud and/or deceit in 
violation of the Consumer Act. Good faith must always be presumed. Aowa 
postulates that like other companies, its sales personnel are employed 
to convince potential customers to purchase the products they are 
selling, inclusive of enthusiasm in sales talk and overzealousness which
 cannot and should not be considered as deceit. Customers in this case 
were never deprived of their prerogative to refuse the offer of the 
sales agents of Aowa, as the terms and conditions of the sale were fully
 explained to all of its customers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
  <p>
    
On the other hand, the DTI, through the Office of the Solicitor General 
(OSG), claims that there is sufficient basis for the filing of the 
formal charge against petitioner; that through Assistant Secretary Ma. 
Theresa L. Pelayo, acting as Regional Caretaker, it filed the formal 
charge against Aowa based on the numerous complaints filed against the 
latter and pursuant to Article 159<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the Consumer Act; that said complaints constituted <i>prima facie</i>
 violation of the Consumer Act; that, as such, Aowa has the burden to 
overcome the presumption by proof to the contrary; and that Aowa, 
however, failed to discharge the said burden. The OSG argues that, 
contrary to Aowa’s assertion, the amicable settlement allegedly entered 
by Aowa and its consumer-complainants is not a ground for the dismissal 
of the formal charge because Aowa, despite respondent’s issuance of a 
Preventive Measure Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
(PMO) on July 31, 2009, continues to enter and engage in the same acts 
and/or transactions complained of. Consonant with the findings of the 
lower agencies and the CA, the OSG asseverates that Aowa, after it was 
afforded its right to due process, was correctly found liable for 
violation of the Consumer Act through misrepresentation, and for its 
failure to secure any Sales Promotion Permit from the DTI. Moreover, the
 directive of the Adjudication Officer of closure and imposition of the 
maximum fine of P300,000.00 is in accordance with law and its IRR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p>
  <p>Correlatively, Aowa assailed the validity of the PMO with the 
Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 143, docketed as Civil
 Case No. 09-723. The RTC, however, dismissed the case for lack of 
jurisdiction. Unyielding, in a Petition for Prohibition, Aowa went to 
the CA which, in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 dated October 27, 2009, dismissed Aowa’s case for its failure to file 
the petition within the prescribed period. The said CA Resolution became
 final and executory on January 28, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p>
  <p>In a Manifestation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
the counsel of Aowa intimated that Aowa no longer intends to file a 
reply to the OSG’s Comment, on the ground that the discussions made 
therein had already been addressed in the instant Petition. Counsel, 
however, also intimated that Aowa left its known office address without 
informing him of the location of its new office.</p>
  <p>The sole issue in this case is whether or not the CA committed any 
reversible error in affirming the findings and ruling of the 
Adjudication Officer and the DTI Appeals Committee.</p>
  <p>The Petition is bereft of merit.</p>
  <p>Contrary to Aowa’s postulations, the DTI has the authority and the 
mandate to act upon the complaints filed against Aowa. Article 2 of the 
Consumer Act clearly sets forth the policy of the State on consumer 
protection, viz.: </p>
  <blockquote>ART 2. <i>Declaration of Basic Policy</i>. — It is the 
policy of the State to protect the interests of the consumer, promote 
his general welfare and to establish standards of conduct for business 
and industry. Towards this end, the State shall implement measures to 
achieve the following objectives:


<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">protection against hazards to health and safety; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> protection against deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts and practices; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">c) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">provision of information and education to facilitate sound choice and the proper exercise of rights by the consumer; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> provision of adequate rights and means of redress; and </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">e) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">involvement of consumer representatives in the formulation of social and economic policies.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>


</blockquote>
  <p>This policy is reiterated in Article 48 of the Consumer Act, which provides that “<i>the
 State shall promote and encourage fair, honest and equitable relations 
among parties in consumer transactions and protect the consumer against 
deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts or practices</i>.” 
Verily, as espoused by the OSG, the DTI validly invoked Article 159 of 
the Consumer Act in order to effectuate this policy of the State by 
filing a formal charge against Aowa. It is indubitable that the DTI is 
tasked to protect the consumer against deceptive, unfair, and 
unconscionable sales, acts, or practices, as defined in Articles 50 and 
52 of the Consumer Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p>
  <p>
    
The law is clear. Articles 50 and 52 of the Consumer Act provide:
    
</p>
  <blockquote>ART. 50. <i>Prohibition Against Deceptive Sales Acts or Practices</i>.
 — A deceptive act or practice by a seller or supplier in connection 
with a consumer transaction violates this Act whether it occurs before, 
during or after the transaction. An act or practice shall be deemed 
deceptive whenever the producer, manufacturer, supplier or seller, 
through concealment, false representation [or] fraudulent manipulation, 
induces a consumer to enter into a sales or lease transaction of any 
consumer product or service.

Without limiting the scope of the above paragraph, the act or practice 
of a seller or supplier is deceptive when it represents that:

<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">a

ART. 52. <i>Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice</i>. — An 
unfair or unconscionable sales act or practice by a seller or supplier 
in connection with a consumer transaction violates this Chapter whether 
it occurs before, during or after the consumer transaction. An act or 
practice shall be deemed unfair or unconscionable whenever the producer,
 manufacturer, distributor, supplier or seller, by taking advantage of 
the consumer's physical or mental infirmity, ignorance, illiteracy, lack
 of time or the general conditions of the environment or surroundings, 
induces the consumer to enter into a sales or lease transaction grossly 
inimical to the interests of the consumer or grossly one-sided in favor 
of the producer, manufacturer, distributor, supplier or seller.

In determining whether an act or practice is unfair and unconscionable, 
the following circumstances shall be considered:

<blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">

</blockquote>

</blockquote>
It cannot be gainsaid that the DTI acted on the basis of about 273 
consumer complaints against Aowa, averring a common and viral scheme in 
carrying out its business to the prejudice of consumers. Complaints — 
filed by consumers residing not only within the NCR but also in the 
provinces<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> -continued to be 
filed even after the formal charge and the issuance of the PMO. In this 
regard, we quote with affirmation and accord respect to the factual 
findings of the CA, to wit:

<blockquote>[Aowa], in employing the sales scheme described by customers
 in their complaints in order to entice customers to purchase [its] 
products clearly violated Article 52 of the Consumer Act of the 
Philippines. As found by public respondent DTI whose findings We 
heretofore adopt:

<blockquote>“It is undisputed that the techniques/scheme employed by 
[Aowa] were fraudulently (sic) considering that the same were being used
 as a bait to lure customers into buying it products. [Aowa’s] customary
 act of giving gifts and the so called prizes to its prospective 
customers in order to entice them to enter the store outlet and later 
convincing (sic) them to purchase the products [it is] selling are (sic)
 but common trends (sic) that occurred in every complaint lodged against
 [Aowa] before the DTI-NCR and regional offices. In such manner, it is 
evident that the said scheme is actually the means by which [Aowa] 
operates its business. Simply, it is intrinsically connected to the 
business itself of and had [Aowa] not employed those techniques, 
customers would not have transacted with it.”
</blockquote>
In doing so, [Aowa], as seller, through its representatives stationed 
usually in malls, entice consumers into purchasing their products by 
taking advantage of the latter’s physical or mental infirmity, 
ignorance, illiteracy, lack of time or the general conditions of the 
environment or surroundings. This is done by misrepresenting to the 
consumer that he/she has won a gift or is to receive some giveaways when
 in truth, these gifts can only be claimed or received upon purchase of 
an additional product or products, again misrepresented by [Aowa to] be 
of high quality. This is how [Aowa] operates its business, and not 
simply as a means of promotional sale. The act sought to be avoided and 
punished under the Consumer Act has clearly been committed by Aowa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>

<p>By reason of the special knowledge and expertise of the DTI over 
matters falling under its jurisdiction, it is in a better position to 
pass judgment on the issues, and its findings of fact in that regard, 
especially when affirmed by the CA, are generally accorded respect, if 
not finality, by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 Furthermore, Aowa failed to refute DTI’s finding that it did not secure
 any permit for its alleged promotional sales. In sum, Aowa failed to 
show any reversible error on the part of the CA in affirming the ruling 
of the DTI as to warrant the modification much less the reversal of its 
assailed decision.
  
</p>
<p>A final note.</p>
<p>In these trying times when fly-by-night establishments and syndicates
 proliferate all over the country, lurking and waiting to prey on 
innocent consumers, and ganging up on them like a pack of wolves with 
their sugar-coated sales talk and false representations disguised as 
“overzealous marketing strategies,” it is the mandated duty of the 
Government, through its various agencies like the DTI, to be wary and 
ready to protect each and every consumer. To allow or even tolerate the 
marketing schemes such as these, under the pretext of promotional sales 
in contravention of the law and its existing rules and regulations, 
would result in consumers being robbed in broad daylight of their hard 
earned money. This Court shall not countenance these pernicious acts at 
the expense of consumers. </p>
