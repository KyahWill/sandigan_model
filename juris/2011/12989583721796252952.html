				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The subject of this present appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 24 April 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented the testimony of its lone witness, Police Officer 3 Eusebio Lowaton, Jr. (PO3 Lowaton), of the Special Anti Illegal Drug-Special Operation Task Force (SAID-SOTF), Makati City.<br><br>The facts of the case as culled from the records and testimony of PO3 Lowaton are as follows:<br><br>On 25 September 2006, the Makati Anti-Drug Abuse Council (MADAC) operatives, together with an informant, came to the office of SAID-SOTF, Makati City, where PO3 Lowaton was one of the police officers assigned thereat, and reported that appellant was involved in the illegal sale of <i>marijuana</i> in Kalayaan Avenue, <i>Barangay</i> Singkamas, Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On the basis thereof, the SAID-SOTF, Makati City, formed a team to conduct a buy-bust operation to verify if appellant was, indeed, involved in the illegal sale of <i>marijuana</i> in the above-mentioned place.&nbsp; The buy-bust team through one of its members, PO3 Lowaton, prepared a Pre-Operational Report/Coordination Sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and sent the same to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).&nbsp; In response thereto, PDEA sent a Certificate of Coordination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to confirm that the buy-bust team of SAID-SOTF, Makati City, had made the necessary coordination with their office in connection with the conduct of its anti-drug operations against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>After a complete coordination with PDEA, the briefing of the members of the buy-bust team followed, wherein PO3 Lowaton was designated as <i>poseur</i>-buyer.&nbsp; He was also given two Fifty Peso bills<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> marked money in the total amount of P100.00, bearing Serial Nos. FR 485129 and CY 532084, respectively, with markings "ATS" on the upper right portion of the serial number of each bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the buy-bust team, together with the informant, proceeded to the target area in Kalayaan Avenue, <i>Barangay</i> Singkamas, Makati City.&nbsp; Upon arrival thereat, the buy-bust team waited for the appellant and soon after, the latter arrived after a few minutes.&nbsp; Subsequently, PO3 Lowaton and the informant walked towards the direction of the appellant. The informant then approached appellant and introduced to him PO3 Lowaton as someone interested in buying <i>marijuana</i>.&nbsp; Appellant asked PO3 Lowaton as to the amount of <i>marijuana</i> that he wanted to buy to which the latter replied that he would be buying P100.00 worth of <i>marijuana</i>.&nbsp; Appellant immediately took one plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> from his pocket that corresponds to the amount agreed upon and handed the same to PO3 Lowaton.&nbsp; The latter, in turn, handed the two marked Fifty Peso bills to appellant as payment for the purchased item.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Upon the consummation of the sale, PO3 Lowaton executed their pre-arranged signal by holding appellant's right hand.&nbsp; At this juncture, the other members of the buy-bust team who were in the vicinity of the target area came in to help PO3 Lowaton, who at that moment had already introduced himself as a police officer, in arresting appellant.&nbsp; Appellant was arrested at around 3:15 p.m.&nbsp; PO3 Lowaton informed appellant of the cause of his arrest and of his constitutional rights. While frisking the appellant, however, PO3 Lowaton recovered from the former two more plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i>.&nbsp; Subsequently, PO3 Lowaton marked the one plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> sold to him by appellant with his initials "EBL." He likewise marked the two other plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> that he recovered from appellant as "EBL-1" and "EBL-2."&nbsp; The seized items from appellant were also inventoried at the place where appellant was arrested and in his presence, as evidenced by an Acknowledgment Receipt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated 25 September 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After appellant's arrest, he was brought to the office of SAID-SOTF, Makati City.&nbsp; The three plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> that has been previously marked were photographed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and sent to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory for examination.&nbsp; The examination conducted on the aforesaid specimen, <i>i.e.</i>, three plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i>, yielded positive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> results to the tests for the presence of <i>marijuana</i>, a dangerous drug, as evidenced by a Physical Science Report No. D-659-06S.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Also, after the completion of the buy-bust operation, an after operation report or the so-called "Spot Report"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> was prepared and sent to PDEA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>After PO3 Lowaton's testimony, the parties agreed and stipulated that the testimony of Jeffrey Abellana, one of MADAC operatives, would be that he was a member of the back up team that assisted in the arrest of appellant. The prosecution, thus, decided to dispense with his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The defense, on the other hand, presented appellant as their sole witness and offered a different version of what transpired on the day of his arrest.<br><br>Appellant narrated that on 25 September 2006, at around 12:00 noon, he was sleeping inside his house located at 4041 Kalayaan Street, <i>Barangay</i> Singkamas, Makati City, when suddenly he was awakened by three persons, who introduced themselves as MADAC operatives.&nbsp; These MADAC operatives were looking for a certain Richard.&nbsp; Upon asking them the reason why they were looking for Richard inside his house and at the same time telling them that he was not the person they were looking for, the MADAC operatives simply told him to just go with them peacefully.&nbsp; Without offering any resistance, appellant went with the MADAC operatives.&nbsp; The latter brought him to their office where he was asked to reveal the whereabouts of Richard to which the appellant replied that he does not know the person they were looking for.&nbsp; At this juncture, the MADAC operatives told him that if he will not reveal the whereabouts of Richard, then, they will charge him with possession of <i>marijuana</i> that they were carrying at that moment.&nbsp; Thereafter, he was detained at their office for about eight to nine days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Appellant further stated that when the MADAC operatives brought him out of the detention cell, he was subsequently brought inside a building where there was a fiscal.&nbsp; The latter then informed him that he was charged with the crime of illegal sale and possession of <i>marijuana</i> in violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165.&nbsp; Appellant, however, denied the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>After all the documentary and testimonial evidence offered by both parties were meticulously evaluated, the trial court concluded that all the elements of the offenses charged against appellant were satisfactorily proven by the prosecution.&nbsp; Thus, in its Decision dated 8 December 2006, the trial court held appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. The trial court disposed of the case as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it appearing that the guilt of [appellant] MARK LESTER DE LA ROSA <i>y</i> SUELLO was proven beyond reasonable doubt, as principal, with no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, for violation [of] Section[s] 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, he is hereby sentenced:<br><br><blockquote>1.

More so, the alleged buy-bust operation was conducted without any prior surveillance.&nbsp; Appellant likewise maintains that his arrest was tainted with irregularity as there was an evident violation of Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165.&nbsp; By reason of the foregoing, appellant insists that his constitutional right to presumption of innocence remains because there is reasonable doubt that calls for his acquittal.<br><br>After a painstaking review of the records, this Court affirms appellant's conviction for violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br>In every prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, like <i>marijuana</i>, the following elements must be sufficiently proved to sustain a conviction therefor: (1) the identity of the buyer, as well as the seller, the object and consideration of the sale; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; <b>What is material is proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the dangerous drugs seized as evidence</b>.&nbsp; We reiterate the meaning of the term <i>corpus delicti</i> which is the actual commission by someone of the particular crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The <b>commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs</b>, <b>like <i>marijuana</i>, requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction, which happens the moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller</b>.&nbsp; Settled is the rule that as long as the police officer went through the operation as a buyer and his offer was accepted by appellant and the dangerous drugs delivered to the former; <b>the crime is considered consummated by the delivery of the goods</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, this Court is fully convinced that the prosecution has adequately and satisfactorily proved all the aforesaid elements of illegal sale of <i>marijuana</i>.<br><br>Appellant, who was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i>, was positively identified by PO3 Lowaton, who acted as the <i>poseur</i>-buyer, as the same person who sold the one plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> to him weighing 3.02 grams for a consideration of P100.00.&nbsp; Such one plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> was presented in court, which PO3 Lowaton identified to be the same object sold to him by appellant.&nbsp; He further stated that the markings "EBL" found on the said object were his initials, which he placed thereon at the time the appellant was arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; PO3 Lowaton similarly identified in court the recovered marked money from the appellant that consists of two Fifty Peso bills in the total amount of P100.00 with markings "ATS" on the upper right portion of the serial number of each bill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>More so, the testimony of PO3 Lowaton clearly established in detail how his transaction with appellant happened starting from the moment their informant introduced him to appellant as someone interested in buying his stuff from the time appellant handed him the one plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> and, in turn, he handed appellant the two Fifty Peso bills marked money for a total amount of P100.00 that consummated the sale transaction between him and appellant.&nbsp; PO3 Lowaton caused the one plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> to be examined at the PNP Crime Laboratory. The item weighing 3.02 grams was tested positive for <i>marijuana</i> as evidenced by Physical Science Report No. D-659-06S prepared by Engineer Richard Allan B. Mangalip, Forensic Chemical Officer/Chief, Physical Science Section of the PNP Crime Laboratory-Southern Police District Crime Laboratory Office.<br><br>Thus, it is already beyond question that appellant's guilt for the crime of illegal sale of <i>marijuana</i>, a dangerous drug, in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 was proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Appellant's contention that PO3 Lowaton's testimony was not credible for no person in his right mind would boldly sell prohibited drugs in broad daylight and in a public place deserves scant consideration.<br><br>This Court has consistently pronounced that drug pushers sell their prohibited articles to any prospective customer, be he a stranger or not, <b>in private, as well as in public places, even in the daytime</b>.&nbsp; Indeed, drug pushers have become increasingly daring, dangerous and, worse, openly defiant of the law.&nbsp; <b>Hence, what matters is not the existing familiarity between the buyer and the seller or the time and venue of the sale, but the fact of agreement and the acts constituting sale and delivery of the prohibited drugs</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the alleged contradiction and inconsistency pointed to by appellant in the testimony of PO3 Lowaton as regards the pre-arranged signal agreed upon by the buy-bust team is only minor, trivial, immaterial, and does not in any way affect the credibility of PO3 Lowaton's testimony, since his testimony clearly and categorically established the sale of <i>marijuana</i>.&nbsp; Such minor inconsistency referring to the details of the sale of <i>marijuana</i> may be considered as badges of truth rather than of falsehood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Nicolas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this Court held that the employment of a pre-arranged signal, or the lack of it, is <b>not indispensable in a buy-bust operation</b>. <b>What determines if there was, indeed, a sale of dangerous drugs is proof of the concurrence of all the elements of the offense</b>.&nbsp; With more reason that a mere inconsistency thereof does not and will not affect the credibility of the prosecution witness so long as all the elements of the offense have been established with certainty.<br><br>That no test buy was conducted before the arrest is of no moment for there is no rigid or textbook method of conducting buy-bust operations.&nbsp; For the same reason, <b>the absence of evidence of a prior surveillance does not affect the regularity of a buy-bust operation, especially when, like in this case, the buy-bust team members were accompanied to the scene by their informant</b>.&nbsp; The Court will not pretend to establish on a <i>priori</i> basis what detailed acts police authorities might credibly undertake and carry out in their entrapment operations.&nbsp; The selection of appropriate and effective means of entrapping drug traffickers is best left to the discretion of police authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>For illegal <em>possession</em><i> </i>of a dangerous drug, like <i>marijuana</i>, it must be shown that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>All the aforesaid elements were clearly established by the prosecution. As an incident to his lawful arrest resulting from the buy-bust operation, appellant was similarly found to have in his possession two more plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> with a total weight of 5.60 grams, the same kind of dangerous drug he was caught selling in <i>flagrante delicto</i>.&nbsp; The said two plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> was also presented in court, which PO3 Lowatan identified to be the same objects recovered from appellant while he was being frisked on the occasion of his arrest for illegally selling <i>marijuana</i>. PO3 Lowaton likewise explained that the markings "EBL-1" and "EBL-2" written on the two plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> were his initials and the same were done by him.<br><br>Further, the record is bereft of any evidence that would show that appellant had the legal authority to possess the two plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> recovered from him.&nbsp; This Court held in a <i>catena</i> of cases that a mere possession of a regulated drug <i>per se</i> constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i> sufficient to convict an accused absent a satisfactory explanation of such possession - the <i>onus probandi</i> is shifted to the accused, to explain the absence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>With that, appellant's guilt for the crime of illegal possession of <i>marijuana</i>, a dangerous drug, in clear violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, was also proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>As a last ditch effort, appellant claims that his arrest was tainted with irregularity as the seized items were not photographed in accordance with the provisions of Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165, thus, an evident violation thereof.&nbsp; The said argument is baseless.<br><br>Section 21, paragraph 1, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 21.</b><i> Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and</b> <b>photograph the same in the presence of the accused </b>or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, <b>or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official </b>who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;&nbsp; [Emphasis supplied].</blockquote><br>The aforesaid provision is implemented by Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 9165, viz.:<br><br><blockquote>(a) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official</b> who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: <b>Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved</b> by the apprehending officer/team, shall <b>not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody</b> over said items.&nbsp; [Emphasis supplied].<br></blockquote><br>The afore-quoted Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR of Republic Act No. 9165, offers some flexibility in complying with the express requirements.

The manner by which the initial contact was made, whether or not through an informant, the offer to purchase the drug, the payment of the "buy-bust" money, and the delivery of the illegal drug, whether to the informant alone or the police officer, must be the subject of strict scrutiny by courts to insure that law-abiding citizens are not unlawfully induced to commit an offense.&nbsp; Criminals must be caught but not at all cost.&nbsp; At the same time, however, examining the conduct of the police should not disable courts into ignoring the accused's predisposition to commit the crime.&nbsp; If there is overwhelming evidence of habitual delinquency, recidivism or plain criminal proclivity, then this must also be considered.&nbsp; Courts should look at all factors to determine the predisposition of an accused to commit an offense in so far as they are relevant to determine the validity of the defense of inducement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote><br>As aptly observed by both the trial court and the appellate court:<br><br><blockquote>We find the testimony of the poseur-buyer, [PO3 Lowaton] clear and credible.&nbsp; He recounted in full detail how the deal was set by the informant, the actual exchange of the plastic sachet of <i>marijuana</i> and the [marked money] consisting of two (2) [F]ifty [P]eso bills, and the apprehension of the [appellant] [and the incidental recovery of two more plastic sachets of <i>marijuana</i> in his possession].&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>The totality of evidence presented is convincing and points to appellant as being engaged in the sale of the illegal drugs.
