No. N-27523). On January 4, 1966, said court issued an order declaring as abandoned the reserved oppositions of Jose T. Velasquez and Pablo Velasquez.&nbsp; Thereafter, the case proceeded to trial.<br><br>Meanwhile, on July 29, 1965, Jose T. Velasquez (Velasquez) filed an application for registration of title over six lots denominated as Lots 7 and 9 of Psu-80886, Ap-5538, and Lots 1, 7, 9 and 11 of Psu-56007 Amd., Ap-11135, situated at Almanza, Las Piñas, Rizal, in LRC Case No. N-5416, LRC Rec. No. N-28735, before the same court.<br><br>On January 31, 1966, the CFI rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in LRC Case No. N-5053 declaring Gregorio to be the absolute owner of Lots 1, 2, 3 and 4 described in Plan Psu-204785.

On November 23, 1966, the CFI issued an Order in LRC Case Nos. N-5053 and N-5416 declaring that the application of Velasquez be given due course insofar as Lots 1 and 7 of Ap-11135 which are identical to Lots 1 to 4, Plan Psu-204785, and the January 31, 1966 decision in LRC Case No. N-5053 in favor of Gregorio respecting the same lots as null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; On December 6, 1966, Decree Nos.

Gregorio appealed to the CA (CA-G.R. No. 56015-R, entitled <i>"Emilio Gregorio v. Spouses Luciana and Corpus Parami and the Register of Deeds of Rizal"</i>) which reversed the CFI.&nbsp; In its decision dated February 7, 1978, the CA declared the aforesaid deed of sale null and void, and ordered the cancellation of certificate of title (No. 38433) in the name of the Paramis and issuance of an OCT in favor of Gregorio covering Lots 1, 3 and 4, Plan Pasu-204785.&nbsp; On November 20, 1979, the court in the same case issued an order declaring the children (Ana, Paz, Carmen, Remedios and Rolando, all surnamed Gregorio) of the deceased Emilio Gregorio "as his compulsory heirs to substitute the said plaintiff."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Pursuant to the said decision, OCT No. 9587 in the name of Emilio Gregorio was cancelled and a new certificate of title, TCT No. S-91911 in favor of his heirs was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In a Report dated September 12, 1984, the LRA informed the CFI in LRC Case No. N-5416 that compliance with the July 30, 1971 CA decision in CA-G.R.

Villanueva opined that the issuance of TCT Nos. 107727, 107728 and 107729 covering Lots 1, 3 and 4 of Psu-204785, "placed TCT No. S-91911, as <i>deemed cancelled</i>, inasmuch as the latter certificate of title covers one and the same parcels of land" and hence TCT No. S-91911 should not anymore be subject of any transactions.<br><br>The CFI initially withdrew its Order dated August 14, 1989 but eventually reinstated the same and ordered the Register of Deeds to annotate the Deed of Conveyance at the back of TCT No. S-91911 within 24 hours upon receipt of the order.&nbsp; Said directive was reiterated by the CFI on June 7, 1991.&nbsp; On June 26, 1991, the court authorized the subdivision of Lot 1, Psu-204785 and directed the Register of Deeds to issue separate titles in favor of plaintiffs Trinidad and Fajardo.

No. L-34239-40 which dismissed petitioner's appeal from the July 30, 1971 CA Decision in CA-G.R.

Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by the CA.<br><br>Hence, this petition alleging that the CA erred in (a) declaring TCT No. T-8129 as defective based on a mere clerical error despite acknowledgment of its issuance resulting from a final determination by this Court of the validity of Emilio Gregorio's claim over the subject property, and (b) affirming the validity of private respondent's TCT No. T-27380 despite the clear nullity of its mother title (OCT No. 9587) which was issued pending the appeal filed by Velasquez from the decision of the appellate court in CA-G.R. No. 40739-40-R to this Court.<br><br>Petitioner reiterates that an error was made on the entries in TCT No. 107729. Instead of providing that said title, as well as TCT Nos. 107727 and 107728 issued in the name of the Heirs of Emilio Gregorio, emanated from the application for registration of Emilio Gregorio in LRC Case No. N-5053, LRC Rec. No. N-27523 pursuant to the Order of the RTC in LRC Case Nos. N-5416 and N-5053, the Register of Deeds of Pasay City annotated on the face of said titles that these were derived from Jose T. Velasquez's OCT No. 5678 under Decree No. N-111862. Petitioner laments that deplorable situation of the legitimate successor of the winning litigant holding a title wrongly annotated to have been derived from the voided title of the loser in the case.&nbsp; The winning party was then given a title registered as derived from the title he fought so hard to set aside.&nbsp; Moreover, there is no logic in the appellate court's conclusion that petitioner's title traces its origin to a mother title already voided, when in fact it is undisputed that TCT No. 107729 was issued pursuant to the March 21, 1986 order of the RTC of Pasig in LRC Case Nos. N-5416 and N-5053 implementing the final and executory February 8, 1984 decision of this Court in G.R. Nos. L-34239-40 denying Velasquez's appeal.<br><br>Petitioner further claims that it is a buyer in good faith who had no knowledge of any defect in the title of his predecessor-in-interest.&nbsp; It paid the purchase price and acquired its title long before it discovered the right to compensation of private respondent through the Officer's Deed of Conveyance.<br><br>Finally, petitioner argues that the issuance of OCT No. 9587 during the pendency of Velasquez's appeal to this Court renders said title null and void <i>ab initio, </i>citing the ruling in <i>Director of Lands v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>.&nbsp; Since OCT No. 9587 is a nullity, it follows that its derivative title, private respondent's TCT No. T-27380, is likewise a nullity.<br><br>Private respondent counters that petitioner's assertion of the existence of clerical errors in the annotations of the entries in TCT No. 8129 is, at the very least, an admission that said title is indeed defective.&nbsp; Obviously, petitioner may not file a petition to quiet its title and at the same time seek, in the same proceeding, the corrections of the entries therein.<br><br>As to the issue of premature issuance of OCT No. 9587, private respondent points out that the decision in LRC Case No. N-5053 dated January 31, 1966 as a consequence of which Decree of Registration No. 141990 was issued, has already attained finality even before Velasquez sought the annulment of the award in favor of Emilio Gregorio utilizing the Report of the Commissioner of Land Registration dated September 16, 1966, to the effect, among others, that a portion of the land awarded in his favor overlapped with that adjudicated to Gregorio. Hence, the prohibition mentioned in the case of <i>Director of Lands v. Reyes (supra)</i> has no application to the case at bar, and therefore could not serve as basis to nullify OCT No. 9587, the mother title of TCT No. T-27380 in the name of private respondent.<br><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>Quieting of title is a common law remedy for the removal of any cloud, doubt, or uncertainty affecting title to real property.&nbsp; In an action for quieting of title, the plaintiffs must show not only that there is a cloud or contrary interest over the subject real property, but that they have a valid title to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The court is tasked to determine the respective rights of the complainant and the other claimants, not only to place things in their proper places, and to make the claimant, who has no rights to said immovable, respect and not disturb the one so entitled, but also for the benefit of both, so that whoever has the right will see every cloud of doubt over the property dissipated, and he can thereafter fearlessly introduce the improvements he may desire, as well as use, and even abuse the property as he deems fit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Petitioner anchors its claim over the disputed lot on TCT No. T-8129&nbsp; issued on&nbsp; February 20, 1989 which is a transfer from TCT No. 107729 in the name of the Heirs of Emilio Gregorio, from whom it bought the property in January 1989.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, private respondent acquired the same land by virtue of the Officer's Deed of Conveyance dated August 15, 1989 executed in their favor pursuant to the final judgment in Civil Case No. 35305 of the RTC of Pasig, Branch 164 and was issued TCT No. T-27380 in his name on December12, 1991.<br><br>In <i>Degollacion v.

N-5053 and N-5416 in which Gregorio prevailed.&nbsp; Consequently, the lower courts upheld the title of private respondent which alone can be traced to the original certificate in the name of Emilio Gregorio (OCT No. 9578).<br><br>Petitioner, however, asserts that the entries in his TCT contain errors and insists that TCT Nos. 107729, 4635 and T-8129 actually emanated from the application for registration of Emilio Gregorio in LRC Case No. N-5053, LRC Record No. N-27523 pursuant to the Order of the Regional Trial Court in LRC Case Nos. N-5053 and N-5416, as in fact TCT No. 107729 were issued along with TCT Nos. 107727 and 107728 covering two other lots also in the name of the Heirs of Emilio Gregorio by way of implementing the final judgment of said court in the case between Gregorio and Velasquez, as affirmed by the CA and this Court.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>TCT No. 107729 in the name of the heirs of Emilio Gregorio issued on April 29, 1986, on its face showed badges of irregularity in its issuance.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the technical description stated that it covers a portion of Lot 1, plan Psu-204785, <i>LRC Case No. N-5416</i> instead of N-5053.&nbsp; Second, the decree number and date of issuance, as well as OCT number clearly indicate that the original decree pertained to Velasquez and not Gregorio. Third, the name of the registered owner in the original certificate is not Velasquez or Gregorio but "Delta Motor Corp." And fourth, the certificate from which TCT No. 107729 was supposedly a transfer should have been the OCT (of Gregorio) and not those unfamiliar TCT numbers indicated therein. The annotations regarding the supposed original registration of TCT No. 107729 read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>IT IS FURTHER CERTIFIED that said land was originally registered on the&nbsp;&nbsp; <u style="font-weight: bold;">12<sup>th</sup></u><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; day of&nbsp; <u style="font-weight: bold;">December</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; in the year nineteen hundred and&nbsp;&nbsp; sixty-six in the Registration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of&nbsp; Rizal Volume <u>A-69</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; page <u>78</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; as Original Certificate of Title No.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u style="font-weight: bold;">5678</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; pursuant to Decree No. <u style="font-weight: bold;">N-111862</u>&nbsp; issued in L.R.C. _____________ Record No.&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>N-28735</u>&nbsp; Case No. <u>N-5416</u>&nbsp; in the name of <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Delta Motor Corp</span>. .<br><br>This certificate is <span style="font-weight: bold;">a transfer from </span><u style="font-weight: bold;">Transfer</u><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; </span><u style="font-weight: bold;">27737/A/T-145-A&nbsp; S-8722/T-41</u><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> which is cancelled by virtue hereof in so far as the above-described land is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>The foregoing errors are not mere typographical as petitioner claims,&nbsp; but serious discrepancies in the registration process.&nbsp; In fact, it is not far-fetched that the erroneous entries could have been intended to create the impression that TCT No. 107729 was a separate and distinct title from the previously issued TCT No. S-91911 even if they pertain to one and the same lot adjudicated to Emilio Gregorio.&nbsp; Such conclusion is reinforced by the unexplained inaction or failure of the heirs of Gregorio to rectify the alleged errors in their title before selling the property to petitioner.&nbsp; The heirs of Gregorio knew that their TCT No. S-91911 bore encumbrances in favor of third parties, notably the notice of pending litigation (<i>Lis Pendens</i>) involving the property covered by said title before the CFI of Pasig, Metro Manila in Civil Case No. 35305, which Trinidad caused to be annotated thereon. The issuance of a new certificate with exactly identical entries as that of TCT No. S-91911 (as to its original registration) would mean that the aforesaid annotations had to be carried over to such new certificate. Strangely, it is TCT No. 107729 which RD Alejandro R.Villanueva upheld in his February 5, 1989 Report notwithstanding its later issuance and the glaring errors in the entries of its original registration.&nbsp; It must be stressed that OCT No. 5677, 5678, 5679 and 5680 and its derivative titles were ordered cancelled precisely because they were issued pursuant to Decree Nos. N-111862 to N-111865 issued in LRC Case No. N-5416 in the name of Velasquez, who lost in the final judgment rendered in CA-G.R. No. 40739-40-R, and whose claim to the lots covered thereby were declared null and void.&nbsp; Logically, therefore, any new certificate of title to be issued to the heirs of Gregorio by virtue of the aforesaid final judgment adjudicating the land to <i>Emilio Gregorio</i>, could not possibly be a&nbsp; transfer or replacement of the aforesaid void OCTs in the name of <i>Velasquez</i>.<br><br>But even granting that the subject entries in TCT No. 107729 were mere clerical errors and assuming <i>arguendo</i> that said certificate was issued to implement the final judgment in CA-G.R. No. 40739-40-R, such execution is tainted with infirmity.&nbsp; The March 21, 1986 order issued by the RTC of Pasig did not only cancel OCT No. 5678 (and other titles in the name of Velasquez covering the same lots adjudicated to Gregorio), it also ordered the issuance of <i>new </i>certificates of title in the name of the heirs of Emilio Gregorio despite having been informed by the LRA and the Register of Deeds that there was already issued OCT No. 9587 over the same lot in the name of Emilio Gregorio, which was replaced with TCT No. S-91911 in the name of the heirs of Emilio Gregorio following the decision rendered by the appellate court (CA-G.R. No. 56015-R) in another case filed by Gregorio against spouses Parami (Civil Case No. 16977).<br><br>At this point, it serves well to emphasize that upon finality of judgment in land registration cases, the winning party does not file a motion for execution as in ordinary civil actions.&nbsp; Instead, he files a petition with the land registration court for the issuance of an order directing the Land Registration Authority to issue a decree of registration, a copy of which is then sent to the Register of Deeds for inscription in the registration book, and issuance of the original certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; The LRC upon the finality of the judgment adjudicating the land to an applicant shall, following the prescribed procedure, merely issues an order for the issuance of a decree of registration and the corresponding certificate of title in the name of such applicant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In this case, the RTC of Pasig, cognizant of a previous decree of registration instead ordered the Register of Deeds to issue <i>new</i> certificates in favor of the heirs of Gregorio, erroneously declaring that such certificates are <i>in </i>lieu of OCT Nos. 5677, 5678, 5679 and 5680.&nbsp; Said court exceeded its authority when it ordered the issuance of <i>transfer</i> certificates in the name of the heirs of Gregorio despite the existence of TCT No. S-91911 already issued to them covering the sae parcel of land. This caused the duplication of titles held by the heirs of Gregorio over Lot 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, while there was only one decree and original certificate issued to the common predecessor-in-interest of petitioner and private respondent, Emilio Gregorio, the latter's heirs were able to secure <i>two </i>transfer certificates covering the same land.&nbsp; Indeed it could not order the issuance of another OCT as it would result to duplication of titles or "double titling."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> A land registration court has no jurisdiction to order the registration of land already decreed in the name of another in an earlier land registration case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Issuance of another decree covering the same land is therefore null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the light of the LRA Report dated September 12, 1984 stating that compliance with the July 30, 1971 final judgment rendered by the CA which reversed the LRC decision and adjudicated Lots 1, 3 and 4 in favor of Emilio Gregorio, would result in duplication of titles, it was grave error for the RTC of Pasig to grant the motion for execution filed by the heirs of Emilio Gregorio who sought, -- <i>in the guise of implementing the July 30, 1971 CA decision </i>-- the issuance of new titles in their name notwithstanding the existence of OCT No. 9587 and <i> TCT No. S-91911</i>.&nbsp; Given such vital information, there exists a compelling need for the land registration court to ascertain the facts and "address the likelihood of duplication of titles x x x, an eventuality that will undermine the Torrens system of land registration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Petitioner nonetheless assails OCT No. 9587 as null and void, having been issued when the adverse decision of the appellate court in CA-G.R.
