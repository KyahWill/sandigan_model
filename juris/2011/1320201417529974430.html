				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 01955 dated April 14, 2008 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan in Crim. Case No. 197-M-2001 and Crim. Case No. 198-M-2001 dated January 23, 2006.<br><br>Accused-appellant Aniceto Bulagao was charged with two counts of rape in separate Informations both dated December 21, 2000. The Informations read as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 197-M-2001<br></center><br>That on or about the 29<sup>th</sup> day of June, 2000, in the municipality of Bocaue, Province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a knife, with force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with lewd designs, have carnal knowledge of [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 14 years old, against the latter's will and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><center>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 198-M-2001<br></center><br>That on or about the 17<sup>th</sup> day of June, 2000, in the municipality of Bocaue, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a knife, with force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with lewd designs, have carnal knowledge of [AAA], 14 years old, against the latter's will and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Upon arraignment on February 26, 2001, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty on both counts.&nbsp; Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>Only private complainant AAA took the witness stand for the prosecution.&nbsp; AAA was born on April 13, 1986.&nbsp; According to her late-registered birth certificate, her parents are BBB (mother) and CCC (father). AAA, however, testified that BBB and CCC are not her biological parents, as she was only adopted when she was very young.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; CCC died in December 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In April 2000, AAA arrived from the province and settled in the house of her brother DDD (son of BBB and CCC) and his wife in Lolomboy, Bocaue, Bulacan.&nbsp; With AAA in the house were two other brothers, EEE and accused-appellant Aniceto Bulagao, and her younger sister, then six-year-old FFF (who were also the children of BBB and CCC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On June 17, 2000, at around 8:00 p.m., AAA and FFF were sleeping in a room which had no door.&nbsp; AAA was suddenly awakened when she felt somebody enter the room. She recognized the accused-appellant as the intruder, and saw that he was holding a knife.&nbsp; Accused-appellant poked the knife at AAA's neck, causing her to freeze in fear.&nbsp; Accused-appellant removed AAA's clothes, and then his own.&nbsp; Both AAA and accused-appellant were wearing t-shirt and shorts before the undressing.&nbsp; Accused-appellant kissed her neck and inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; FFF woke up at this moment, but accused-appellant did not stop and continued raping AAA for one hour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On June 29, 2000, AAA was residing in the house of her sister, also located in Lolomboy, Bocaue, Bulacan.&nbsp; At around 11:00 p.m. on that day, AAA was sleeping in the second floor of the house, where there are no rooms.&nbsp; AAA was roused from her sleep when accused-appellant was already undressing her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant removed his shorts and inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; AAA tried to resist, but accused-appellant held her hands.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then touched her breasts and kissed her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant remained on top of her for half an hour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>AAA told her mother, BBB, and her brother, EEE, about the rape incidents.&nbsp; Upon learning of the same, BBB did not believe AAA and whipped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>During cross-examination, the defense, in trying to establish the character and chastity of AAA, asked AAA about an alleged sexual intercourse between her and the now deceased CCC. AAA affirmed her statement in her affidavit that CCC took advantage (<i>pinagsamantalahan</i>) of her when he was still alive.&nbsp; This allegedly happened five times, the first of which was when she was only seven years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Answering a query from the court, AAA testified that she was currently in the custody of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The prosecution was supposed to present medico-legal officer Dr. Ivan Richard Viray as its second witness. However, the latter's testimony was dispensed with upon the stipulation of the parties on the fact of examination of AAA by Dr. Viray on September 5, 2000, and the contents of the examination report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which includes the finding that AAA was in a "non-virgin state."<br><br>When it was time for the defense to present their evidence more than a year later, it also presented as its witness AAA, who recanted her testimony for the prosecution.&nbsp; This time, she testified that the sexual encounters between her and the accused-appellant were consensual.&nbsp; She fabricated the charge of rape against the accused-appellant because she was supposedly angry with him.&nbsp; She also claimed that she was instructed by the police officer who investigated the incident to say that the accused-appellant used a knife.&nbsp; She also testified that she was raped by her father CCC when she was seven years old.&nbsp; She was recanting her previous testimony because she purportedly was no longer angry with accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, AAA clarified that she fabricated the charge of rape because she was angry with the accused-appellant for making her do laundry work for him.&nbsp; However, when asked if she "consented and voluntarily submitted" herself to the accused-appellant when she had sexual intercourse with him, she answered in the negative.&nbsp; She had been released from the custody of the DSWD and was alone by herself for some time, but she now lives with the family of accused-appellant. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On redirect examination, AAA testified that accused-appellant did not force himself upon her.&nbsp; She affirmed that accused-appellant had a little defect in his mind.&nbsp; On re-cross examination, AAA testified that accused-appellant was not her sweetheart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Another witness for the defense was Yolanda Palma, a clinical psychologist.&nbsp; She conducted a mental examination on accused-appellant on September 12, 2002, and found that accused-appellant was suffering from mental retardation as he had an IQ of below 50.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant, who was 40 years old when he testified on June 15, 2005, claimed that AAA seduced him by removing her clothes.&nbsp; He asserted that they ended up merely kissing each other and did not have sexual intercourse.&nbsp; He denied pointing a knife at AAA.&nbsp; AAA accused him of rape because she was asking for P300 from him after they kissed.&nbsp; Accused-appellant also testified that there was no legal proceeding for the adoption of AAA ("<i>ampun-ampunan lang</i>").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On January 23, 2006, the RTC rendered its joint Decision in Crim. Case No. 197-M-2001 and 198-M-2001, decreeing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime as charged, and hereby sentences him to suffer:<br><br>(a) In Crim. Case No. 197-M-01, the penalty of DEATH.&nbsp; The accused is likewise directed to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P50,000.00;<br><br>(b) In Crim. Case No. 198-M-01, the penalty of DEATH.&nbsp; The accused is likewise directed to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC observed that AAA was in the custody of the DSWD when she testified for the prosecution, and was returned to the family of the accused-appellant after her original testimony. It was during the time when she was back in the custody of the accused-appellant's family that she recanted her testimony for the prosecution.&nbsp; According to the RTC, it is clear that she had no other place to go to as she was completely orphaned and was dependent on the family of the accused, and it was understandable that she may have recanted in order to remain in the good graces of the accused-appellant's family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As regards the defense of accused-appellant that he was suffering from mental retardation, the RTC noted that the psychological examination of accused-appellant was conducted more than a couple of years after the dates of the complained of incidents.&nbsp; There was no showing from the findings of the psychologist that accused-appellant had the same mental or psychological condition at the time of the said incidents.&nbsp; Even assuming that accused-appellant was of such mental state at the time of the incidents, the psychologist testified that accused-appellant had the capacity to discern right from wrong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On April 14, 2008, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision affirming that of the RTC, except with a modification on the penalty in view of the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346 prohibiting the imposition of death penalty.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DISMISSED.&nbsp; The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 13, dated 23 January 2006, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION on the penalty imposed and damages awarded.&nbsp; Accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole, in each of the two (2) counts of rape.&nbsp; He is further directed to pay private complainant the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages, for each count of rape, in addition to the civil indemnity awarded by the court <i>a quo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, accused-appellant interposed the present appeal.&nbsp; Both parties manifested that they are waiving their rights to file a supplemental brief, as the same would only contain a reiteration of the arguments presented in their appellant's and appellee's briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In seeking to overturn his conviction, accused-appellant asserted that the prosecution evidence was insufficient, particularly in view of AAA's withdrawal of her original testimony.<br><br>We have recently held that "[c]ourts look with disfavor upon retractions, because they can easily be obtained from witnesses through intimidation or for monetary considerations.&nbsp; Hence, a retraction does not necessarily negate an earlier declaration.&nbsp; They are generally unreliable and looked upon with considerable disfavor by the courts.&nbsp; Moreover, it would be a dangerous rule to reject the testimony taken before a court of justice, simply because the witness who has given it later on changes his mind for one reason or another."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; We have, in the past, also declared that the recantation, even of a lone eyewitness, does not necessarily render the prosecution's evidence inconclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; In the often-cited <i>Molina v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> we specified how a recanted testimony should be examined:<br><br><blockquote>Mere retraction by a prosecution witness does not necessarily vitiate the original testimony if credible. <b>The rule is settled that in cases where previous testimony is retracted and a subsequent different, if not contrary, testimony is made by the same witness, the test to decide which testimony to believe is one of comparison coupled with the application of the general rules of evidence.</b> A testimony solemnly given in court should not be set aside and disregarded lightly, and before this can be done, <b>both the previous testimony and the subsequent one should be carefully compared and juxtaposed, the circumstances under which each was made, carefully and keenly scrutinized, and the reasons or motives for the change, discriminatingly analyzed.&nbsp; x x x.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><b>&nbsp; </b>(Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>These rules find applicability even in rape cases, where the complainant is usually the lone eyewitness.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>People v. Sumingwa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> where the rape victim later disavowed her testimony that she was raped by her father, this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>In rape cases particularly, the conviction or acquittal of the accused most often depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony.&nbsp; By the very nature of this crime, it is generally unwitnessed and usually the victim is left to testify for herself.&nbsp; When a rape victim's testimony is straightforward and marked with consistency despite grueling examination, it deserves full faith and confidence and cannot be discarded. If such testimony is clear, consistent and credible to establish the crime beyond reasonable doubt, a conviction may be based on it, notwithstanding its subsequent retraction.&nbsp; Mere retraction by a prosecution witness does not necessarily vitiate her original testimony.<br><br>A retraction is looked upon with considerable disfavor by the courts.&nbsp; It is exceedingly unreliable for there is always the probability that such recantation may later on be repudiated.&nbsp; It can easily be obtained from witnesses through intimidation or monetary consideration. Like any other testimony, it is subject to the test of credibility based on the relevant circumstances and, especially, on the demeanor of the witness on the stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, the determination by the trial court of the credibility of AAA's accusation and recantation is facilitated by the fact that her recantation was made in open court, by testifying for the defense.&nbsp; Unlike in cases where recantations were made in affidavits, the trial court in this case had the opportunity to see the demeanor of AAA not only when she narrated the sordid details of the alleged rape by her "adoptive" brother, but also when she claimed that she made up her previous rape charges out of anger.&nbsp; As such, it is difficult to overlook the fact that the trial court convicted accused-appellant even after examining the young witness as she made a complete turnaround and admitted to perjury.&nbsp; The legal adage that the trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses thus finds an entirely new significance in this case where AAA was subjected to grueling cross examinations, redirect examinations, and re-cross examinations both as a prosecution and defense witness.&nbsp; Still, the trial court found that the private complainant's testimony for the prosecution was the one that was worthy of belief.<br><br>However, even if we disregard the elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, it is clear to this Court which of the narrations of AAA was sincere and which was concocted.&nbsp; AAA's testimony for the prosecution, which was taken when she was in the custody of the DSWD, was clear, candid, and bereft of material discrepancies.&nbsp; All accused-appellant can harp on in his appellant's brief was AAA's failure to recall the length of the knife used in the assaults, a minor and insignificant detail not material to the elements of the crime of rape.&nbsp; She remained steadfast on cross-examination even as defense counsel tried to discredit her by bringing up her dark past of being sexually molested by the accused-appellant's father when she was seven years old.&nbsp; This is in stark contrast to her testimony for the defense, where AAA, now living with accused-appellant's family, claimed that she fabricated a revolting tale of rape simply because accused-appellant made her do laundry.&nbsp; AAA's recantation even contradicts the testimony of accused-appellant himself. While AAA claims in her retraction that she had consensual sex with her brother, accused-appellant testified that they merely kissed and that AAA's purported motive for the rape charges was monetary.<br><br>As furthermore observed by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals, the cross-examination of AAA as a defense witness revealed that it was taken at a time when AAA had nowhere to go and was forced to stay with the family of accused-appellant and upon a reliance on the family's implied commitment to send accused-appellant to Mindanao:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

Nevertheless, we agree with the finding of the trial court that there was no proof that the mental condition accused-appellant allegedly exhibited when he was examined by Yolanda Palma was already present at the time of the rape incidents.&nbsp; Anyone who pleads the exempting circumstance of insanity bears the burden of proving it with clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Besides, this Court observes that neither the acts of the accused-appellant proven before the court, nor his answers in his testimony, show a complete deprivation of intelligence or free will.&nbsp; Insanity presupposes that the accused was completely deprived of reason or discernment and freedom of will at the time of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Only when there is a complete deprivation of intelligence at the time of the commission of the crime should the exempting circumstance of insanity be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>As previously stated, the RTC imposed upon accused-appellant the penalty of death for each count of rape.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals modified the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in view of the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346.&nbsp; It should be noted at this point that while Republic Act No. 9346 prohibits the imposition of death penalty, the presence of a qualifying circumstance which would have warranted the imposition of the death penalty would still cause the award of moral damages and civil indemnity to be increased each from Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) to Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) under prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, both Informations charge a crime of rape qualified by the use of a deadly weapon.&nbsp; Under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, the crime of rape under paragraph 1 of Article 266-A when committed with the use of a deadly weapon is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; This crime was proven as charged in Crim.
