Cortez St., Brgy. San Jose, Concepcion, Tarlac, the Intelligence Operatives of the Concepcion Police Station, Concepcion, Tarlac, conducted a surveillance on the place from May 25, 2003 until June 23, 2003 when they applied for a search warrant which was granted on the same day. Before implementing the search warrant, the police officers conducted another surveillance from June 23 to June 24, 2003 during which, it was observed that several students were going inside the petitioner's house.&nbsp; It was also during that time that the poseur-buyer was able to buy <i>shabu</i> (methamphetamine hydrochloride) from the petitioner.<br><br>On June 29, 2003, around 1:00 p.m., the search team composed of PO3 Mario Flores, PO2 Henry Balabat, SPO1 Rustico Basco and PO1 Roger Paras, implemented the search warrant with the presence of <i>Barangay</i> Captain Antonio Canono.&nbsp; The search team, before conducting the search, sought permission from the petitioner.&nbsp; The two-storey house had two rooms ? one downstairs and the other one upstairs. According to petitioner, the room downstairs was occupied by his brother, Rael David, who was not present during the search, and the room upstairs was occupied by the former.<br><br>PO3 Flores found six (6) sachets of marijuana and three (3) plastic sachets of substance suspected to be shabu on top of a padlocked cabinet underneath the stairs.&nbsp; During that time, appellant was around two (2) meters away in the sala.<br><br>Thereafter, the police operatives took pictures of the items searched and the <i>barangay</i> captain signed a certificate of good search.&nbsp; The confiscated items were then turned over to Investigator Simplicio Cunanan of the Concepcion Police Station for investigation.<br><br>It was revealed in Chemistry Report No. D-143-2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of Police Inspector Jessica R.

Afterwards, petitioner was asked about the whereabouts of the <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; At the time of the search, petitioner's brother, Rael David, was not present.

He argues that the testimony of PO3 Flores that he found six (6) teabags of <i>marijuana</i> and three (3) sachets of <i>shabu</i> remains uncorroborated as SPO1 Basco testified that he did not see PO3 Flores when the latter discovered the said dangerous drugs.&nbsp; Even so, this does not diminish the fact that dangerous drugs were found during the&nbsp; search of the house. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), in its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated October 16, 2008, was correct in pointing out that&nbsp; during the operation, it is not incredible that only one of the operatives found the dangerous drugs because they were scattered throughout the house.&nbsp; The OSG stated:<br><br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; The fact that PO3 Flores was the only one who discovered the illegal substances is not incredible.&nbsp; It must be considered that during the operation, the police operatives scattered themselves throughout the house in order to conduct the search.&nbsp; SPO1 Basco searched the upper room, while PO3 Flores searched the lower portion of the house.&nbsp; Noteworthy, the testimonies of SPO1 Basco and PO3 Flores jibed on material points, particularly on the illegal objects seized.&nbsp; SPO1 Basco corroborated PO3 Flores' testimony that he found six (6) sachets of marijuana and three sachets of shabu during the search. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner also claims that the prior surveillance before the issuance of a search warrant was not clearly established by the testimonies of the witnesses.&nbsp; He insists that SPO1 Basco testified that a surveillance was conducted by PO3 Flores and PO1 Joel Canlas from May 25, 2003 to June 24, 2003, but PO3 Flores denied having participated in the surveillance and pointed to PO1 Canlas as the one who conducted the surveillance.&nbsp; According to petitioner, such inconsistency in the testimony is damaging.&nbsp; This Court finds no significance in the said inconsistency as it is merely minor.&nbsp; What is important is that they were able to establish through their testimonies that a surveillance indeed took place before and even after the issuance of the search warrant.&nbsp; PO3 Flores testified during clarifications from the court that:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">COURT:</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Some questions from the court.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Prior to the application of search warrant, was there any surveillance conducted by your office?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Who conducted that surveillance?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">PO1 Canlas, your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Why did you still conduct surveillance after issuing the search warrant?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">To collate concrete evidence against the suspects, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">COURT:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Why?

No. 6425 - a classification was provided between a prohibited drug and a regulated drug.&nbsp; I believe in the new proposed measure, there is no distinction between the two categories.&nbsp; And in lieu of the two categories, the new measure merely provides for an all-embracing category of dangerous drugs.<br><br>May we know, Mr. President, the significance of eliminating the two categories in the old law because there might be adverse implications if we do not classify "prohibited" from "regulated" drugs.&nbsp; There are instances, for example, when a cancer patient - I know I am not a doctor but Senator Flavier might be able to enlighten us here - is allowed to use with prescription from a licensed physician regulated drugs.&nbsp; Morphine, for example, for pain killers.&nbsp; How would this declassification affect this case?<br><br>Senator Barbers.&nbsp; Well, her point is very valid, Mr. President.&nbsp; The reason as to why under R.A. No. 6425 there was a distinction between "prohibited" and "regulated" drugs is that this is in consonance with the International Treaties on Drugs under the UN Convention of 1961, 1971, and 1988.&nbsp; Now, when we speak of narcotics under this treaty, it would mean "prohibited" drugs. When we speak of psychotropic under the same convention, it would mean "regulated" drugs.&nbsp; In this particular proposal, we did not make any distinction anymore.&nbsp; Why? Because whether these are regulated, whether these are prohibited, these are considered as dangerous drugs unless authorized by law.&nbsp; That a patient, for example, is in need of some drugs, morphine, for example, then that would be another story.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Senator De Castro.&nbsp; Mr. President, on page 3, line 3, the term used is "dangerous," while under our present law, Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, the term used is "prohibited."&nbsp; May we know from the sponsor the distinction between the words "prohibited" and "dangerous."<br><br>Senator Barbers.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. President.&nbsp; Under Republic Act No. 6425, there is a distinction between prohibited drugs and regulated drugs.&nbsp; When we speak of prohibited drugs, it would mean that there is no prescription needed. While in the regulated drugs, a prescription is needed in order to purchase that kind of drug from the drugstore.<br><br>Under the present bill, Mr. President, we removed the distinction and we came up with the term "dangerous drugs" instead of classifying these drugs into prohibited and regulated ones.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because there are prohibited drugs that sometimes are also being dispensed with prescription, like for example, morphine and opium.&nbsp; These could be used as pain relievers.&nbsp; There are also regulated ones which become prohibited drugs when we use a proportion which could not be considered as therapeutic in nature.<br><br>Senator De Castro.&nbsp; Therapeutic and that includes marijuana, Mr. President?<br><br>Senator Barbers.&nbsp; That is correct, Mr. President, although marijuana is not dispensed in drugstores.&nbsp; We classify marijuana under RA 6425 as a prohibited drug, while under this measure marijuana is considered as a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Senator Cayetano.&nbsp; Mr. President, I also note that there is no definition of "regulated drug" at least in my cursory examination.&nbsp; Has the good sponsor deleted the provision of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 or Republic Act No. 6425 where there is a definition of "regulated drug?"&nbsp; And if so, I just want to find out why this particular definition of what constitutes a regulated drug is not included in this bill?<br><br>Senator Barbers.&nbsp; That is correct, Mr. President.&nbsp; In the present measure, we already deleted prohibited drugs as well as regulated drugs.&nbsp; We came up with one item only from regulated, from prohibited, to dangerous drugs. That would be the classification now. Whether it is regulated or prohibited, it is of no moment to us.&nbsp; What is important is that we define dangerous drugs.<br><br>Senator Cayetano.&nbsp; No. The reason I asked that, Mr. President, is, under the present law, "regulated drugs" is defined and the penalties for transgression of the requirements of getting a regulated drug is different from the transgression of committing any act in relation to what constitutes purely dangerous drugs.<br><br>So this is the reason I am inquiring because it is important. Regulated drugs <i>per se</i> are not dangerous drugs, regulated in the sense that it may be dispensed by a certified physician or members of the medical or dental profession.<br><br>The only transgression or penalty that may be included on regulated drug is, for instance, if one imports regulated drugs without the necessary authority from the present Dangerous Drugs Board, and also the manufacture as well as the sale of the same.<br><br>So that is the reason I am inquiring, Mr. President.<br><br>Senator Barbers.&nbsp; I have with me here, Mr. President, a definition of a "regulated drug," but this is applicable under Republic Act No. 6425.&nbsp; Under my proposal, we deleted the definition.&nbsp; We concentrated on dangerous drugs.<br><br>Senator Cayetano.&nbsp; So am I correct then that the omission is deliberate, but it does not repeal the provision of Republic Act No. 6425 which is known as the "Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972," <i>vis-a-vis</i> the regulated drugs?&nbsp; It does not.<br><br>Senator Barbers.&nbsp; Mr. President, this proposed measure is practically a repeal of Republic Act No. 6425.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>From the above-quoted, it is clear that the deliberate elimination of the classification of dangerous drugs is the main reason that under R.A. 9165, the possession of any kind of dangerous drugs is now penalized under the same section. The deliberations, however, do not address a case wherein an individual is caught in possession of different kinds of dangerous drugs.&nbsp; In the present case, petitioner was charged under two Informations, one for illegal possession of six (6) plastic heat-sealed sachets containing dried <i>marijuana</i> leaves weighing more or less 3.865 grams and the other for illegal possession of three (3) plastic heat-sealed sachets containing <i>shabu</i> weighing more or less 0.327 gram.&nbsp; Under Section 11 of R.A. 9165, the corresponding penalty for each charge, based on the weight of the dangerous drugs confiscated, is imprisonment for twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and a fine of three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00).&nbsp; The trial court imposed a single penalty of imprisonment for twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and a fine of three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00), while the CA modified it by imposing the corresponding penalty for each charge.<br><br>Absent any clear interpretation as to the application of the penalties in cases such as the present one, this Court shall construe it in favor of the petitioner for the subject provision is penal in nature.&nbsp; It is a well-known rule of legal hermeneutics that penal or criminal laws are strictly construed against the state and liberally in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, an accused may only be convicted of a single offense of possession of dangerous drugs if he or she was caught in possession of different kinds of dangerous drugs in a single occasion.&nbsp; If convicted, the higher penalty shall be imposed, which is still lighter if the accused is convicted of two (2) offenses having two (2) separate penalties.&nbsp; This interpretation is more in keeping with the intention of the legislators as well as more favorable to the accused.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i> dated April 11, 2008 of petitioner Raul David is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; Decision dated August 31, 2007 and Resolution dated February 20, 2008 of the Court of Appeals are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the penalty of&nbsp; imprisonment for Twelve (12) years &amp; one (1) day, as minimum, to Fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and a fine of Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00) be imposed.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Abad, Mendoza</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 11-129.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Marlene Gonzales-Sison, with Associate Justices Juan Q.
