To his surprise, the respondent learned that the petitioner had already obtained in his name two transfer certificates of title (<i>TCTs</i>): <i>one</i>, TCT No. 195812 - covering an area of 3,020 square meters; and <i>two</i>, TCT No. 195813 - covering an area of 1,004 square meters (or a total of 4,024 square meters).<br><br>The Register of Deeds informed the respondent that they could not find the record of OCT No. 24695; instead, the Register of Deeds furnished the respondent with the following <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (collectively<i>, petitioner's documents</i>):<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Two (2) deeds of absolute sale dated June 14, 1969, both executed by Sta.

Particularly, the respondent assailed the Benigna Deed by presenting Benigna's death certificate. The respondent argued that Benigna could not have executed a deed, which purports to convey 4,024 square meters to the petitioner, in 1969 because Benigna already died in 1944. The respondent added that neither could Sta. Maria have sold to the parties her three-fourths (¾) share in 1969 because she had already sold her share to Benigna in 1932. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The respondent denied his purported signature appearing in the Affidavit, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and prayed for:<br><br><blockquote>a) xxx the cancellation of the [petitioner's documents];<br><br>b)&nbsp; the <u>cancellation of TCT No. 195813 in the name of Modesto Leoveras and that it be reconveyed</u> to the [respondent];<br><br>c) the <u>cancellation and nullification of [TCT No. 195812]</u> covering an area of 3,020 square meters xxx;<br><br>d) [the issuance of] title xxx in the name of [respondent] over an area of 17, 104 square meters of OCT 24695; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In his defense, the petitioner claimed that the parties already had (i) delineated their respective portions of the subject property even before they acquired it in 1969 and (ii) agreed that upon acquisition, each would own the portion as delineated; that the area he actually possessed and subsequently acquired has a total area of 4,024 square meters, which he subdivided into two portions and caused to be covered by the two TCTs in question. The petitioner claimed that in signing the Agreement, he was led to believe, based on the parties' rough estimation, that the area he actually possessed is only 3,020 square meters contrary to the parties' real intention - <i>i.e.</i>, the extent of their ownership would be based on their actual possession. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The petitioner further claimed that the respondent voluntarily participated in executing the Affidavit, which corrected the mistake in the previously executed Agreement <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and confirmed the petitioner's ownership over the disputed property. The petitioner asked for the dismissal of the complaint and for a declaration that he is the lawful owner of the parcels of land covered by his titles.<br><br><center><u><b>RTC RULING</b></u><br></center><br>The RTC dismissed the complaint. The court ruled that the respondent failed to preponderantly prove that the Benigna Deed and the Affidavit are fabricated and, consequently, no ground exists to nullify the petitioner's titles. The court observed that the respondent did not even compare his genuine signature with the signatures appearing in these documents.<br><br><center><u><b>CA RULING</b></u><br></center><br>On appeal, the CA reversed the RTC by ruling against the authenticity of the Benigna Deed and the Affidavit. The CA gave weight to Benigna's death certificate which shows the impossibility of Benigna's execution of the deed in 1969. The CA also noted the discrepancy between the respondent's signatures as appearing in the Affidavit, on one hand, and the documents on record, on the other. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The CA added that the respondent's failure to compare his genuine signature from his purported signatures appearing in the petitioner's documents is not fatal, since Section 22, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court allows the court to make its own comparison. In light of its observations, the CA ruled:<br><br><blockquote>As the totality of the evidence presented sufficiently sustains [the respondent's] claim that the titles issued to [the petitioner] were based on forged and spurious documents, it behooves this Court to annul these certificates of title.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision dated June 23, 2000 is SET ASIDE. Declaring TCT No. 195812 and TCT No. 195813 as NULL and VOID, <b>[</b>the<b> petitioner] is hereby directed to reconvey the subject <u>parcels</u> of land to [</b>the <b>respondent]</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>Unwilling to accept the CA's reversal of the RTC ruling, the petitioner filed the present appeal by <i>certiorari</i>, claiming that the CA committed "gross misappreciation of the facts" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> by going beyond what the respondent sought in his complaint.<br><br><center><u><b>THE PETITION</b></u><br></center><br>The petitioner claims that the CA should not have ordered the reconveyance of both parcels of land covered by the TCTs in question since the respondent only seeks the reconveyance of the disputed property - <i>i.e.</i>, the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 195813.<br><br>The petitioner asserts that <b>after </b>the subject sale, the parties physically partitioned the subject property and possessed their respective portions, thereby setting the limits of their ownership.<br><br>The petitioner admits that the Benigna Deed is "fabricated" but hastens to add that it was only designed (i) to affirm the "true intent and agreement" of the parties on the extent of their ownership, as shown by their actual physical possession, and (ii) as a "convenient tool" to facilitate the transfer of title to his name.<br><br><center><u><b>THE RESPONDENT'S COMMENT</b></u><br></center><br>The respondent claims that since the petitioner himself admitted using a spurious document in obtaining his titles (as alleged in the complaint and as found by the CA), then the CA correctly cancelled the latter's titles. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The petitioner forged the respondent's signature in the Affidavit to make it appear that he agreed to the division indicated in the document. The respondent defended the CA's reconveyance of both parcels of land, covered by the petitioner's titles, to the respondent by arguing that if the distribution in the Affidavit is followed, the "original intendment" of the parties on their shares of the subject property would be "grievously impaired" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>THE ISSUES</b></u><br></center><br>The two basic issues <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for our resolution are:<br><br><ol><li> Whether the CA erred in nullifying the petitioner's titles.<br></li><li>Whether the CA erred in ordering the reconveyance of the parcel of land covered by the petitioner's titles.<br></li></ol><br><center><u><b>THE RULING</b></u><br></center><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br></span></span><b>We <i>partially </i>grant the petition. </b><br><br>An action for reconveyance is a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful landowner, whose land was wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another, to compel the registered owner to transfer or reconvey the land to him. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The plaintiff in this action must allege and prove his ownership of the land in dispute and the defendant's erroneous, fraudulent or wrongful registration of the property.<br><br>We rule that the respondent adequately proved his ownership of the disputed property by virtue of the (i) Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Josefa in favor of the parties; (ii) the parties' Affidavit of Adverse Claim; and (iii) the parties' Agreement, which cover the subject property.<br><br>The petitioner does not dispute the due execution and the authenticity <br> of these documents, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> particularly the Agreement. However, he claims that since the Agreement does not reflect the true intention of the parties, the Affidavit was subsequently executed in order to reflect the parties' true intention.<br><br>The petitioner's argument calls to fore the application of the parol evidence rule, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>i.e.</i>, when the terms of an agreement are reduced to writing, the written agreement is deemed to contain all the terms agreed upon and no evidence of these terms can be admitted other than what is contained in the written agreement. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Whatever is not found in the writing is understood to have been waived and abandoned. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>To avoid the operation of the parol evidence rule, the Rules of Court allows a party to present evidence modifying, explaining or adding to the terms of the written agreement if he puts in issue in his pleading, as in this case, the failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties. The failure of the written agreement to express the true intention of the parties is either by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or accident, which nevertheless did not prevent a meeting of the minds of the parties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>At the trial, the petitioner attempted to prove, by parol evidence, the alleged true intention of the parties by presenting the Affidavit, which allegedly corrected the mistake in the previously executed Agreement and confirmed his ownership of the parcels of land covered by his titles. It was the petitioner's staunch assertion that the respondent co-executed this Affidavit supposedly to reflect the parties' true intention.<br><br>In the present petition, however, the petitioner made a damaging admission that the <b>Benigna Deed</b> is<i> </i>fabricated, thereby completely bolstering the respondent's cause of action for reconveyance of the disputed property on the ground of fraudulent registration of title. Since the Affidavit merely reflects what is embodied in the Benigna Deed, the petitioner's admission, coupled with the respondent's denial of his purported signature in the Affidavit, placed in serious doubt the reliability of this document, supposedly the bedrock of the petitioner's defense.<br><br>Curiously, if the parties truly intended to include in the petitioner's share the disputed property, the petitioner obviously need not go at length of fabricating a deed of sale to support his application for the transfer of title of his rightful portion of the subject property. Notably, there is nothing in the Affidavit (that supposedly corrected the mistake in the earlier Agreement) that supports the petitioner's claim that the partition of the subject property is based on the parties' actual possession.<br><br>Note that the RTC dismissed the complaint based on the respondent's alleged failure to prove the spuriousness of the documents submitted by the petitioner to the Register of Deeds. However, by admitting the presentation of a false deed in securing his title, the petitioner rendered moot the issue of authenticity of the Benigna Deed and relieved the respondent of the burden of proving its falsity as a ground to nullify the petitioner's titles.<br><br>By fraudulently causing the transfer of the registration of title over the disputed property in his name, the petitioner holds the title to this disputed property in trust for the benefit of the respondent as the true owner; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; registration does not vest title but merely confirms or records title already existing and vested. The Torrens system of registration cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner, nor can it be used as a shield for the commission of fraud, or to permit one to enrich oneself at the expense of others. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the CA correctly ordered the reconveyance of<i> </i>the disputed property, covered by TCT No. 195813, to the respondent.<br><br><b><i>The parties' Agreement effectively <br>partitioned the subject property</i></b><br><br>The petitioner also relies on his alleged actual possession of the disputed property to support his claim of ownership. Notably, both parties make conflicting assertions of possession of the disputed property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The petitioner testified on his possession as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">How many square meters did you get from the land and how many square meters was the share of [respondent]?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">4 <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[0]</span>20 square meters and my brother-in-law 6,000 plus square meters.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="CENTER">xxx</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Was there a boundary between the 4,020 square meters and the rest of the property which (sic) designated by your brother-in-law?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">There is sir, and the boundary is the fence.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">When did you put up that fence which is the boundary?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">After the deed of sale was made.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">And that boundary fence which you put according to you since the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale in 1969 up to the present does it still exist?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Since the time you purchased the property according to you you already divided the property, is that correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp; </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And that as of today who is in possession of that 4,020 square meters?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">I, sir. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>The petitioner and the respondent were originally co-owners of the subject property when they jointly bought it from the same vendor in 1969. However, the parties immediately terminated this state of indivision by executing an <i>Agreement</i>, which is in the nature of a partition agreement.<i> </i><br><br>The Civil Code of the Philippines defines partition as the separation, division and assignment of a thing held in common among those to whom it may belong. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Partition is the division between two or more persons of real or personal property, owned in common, by<i> </i>setting apart their respective interests so that they may enjoy and possess these in severalty, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> resulting in <br> the partial or total extinguishment of co-ownership. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the parties agreed to divide the subject property by giving the petitioner the 3,020 square meters "residential portion on the northern part near the Municipal road." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> There is no dispute that this 3,020- square meter portion is the same parcel of land identified as Lot No. 2 (which is <b>not</b> the subject of the respondent's action <i>for reconveyance</i>) in the Affidavit and the Subdivision Plan presented by the petitioner before the Register of Deeds. The fact that the Agreement lacks technical description of the parties' respective portions or that the subject property was then still embraced by a single certificate of title could not legally prevent a partition, where the different portions allotted to each were determined and became separately identifiable, as in this case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>What is strikingly significant is that even the petitioner's own testimony merely attempted to confirm his actual possession of the disputed property, without, however, supporting his claim - contrary to the written Agreement - that the parties' ownership of the subject property would be co-extensive with their possession.&nbsp; This is the core of the petitioner's defense. At any rate, just as non-possession does not negate ownership, neither does possession automatically prove ownership, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> especially in the face of an unambiguous document executed by the parties themselves.<br><br>Contrary to the petitioner's claim that his actual possession determines the extent of his ownership, it is the parties' <i>Agreement</i> that defines the extent of their ownership in the subject property. One of the legal effects of partition, whether by agreement among the co-owners or by judicial proceeding, is to terminate the co-ownership and, consequently, to make the previous co-owners the absolute and exclusive owner of the share allotted to him. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Parenthetically, the respondent declared for taxation purposes the portion he claims in December 1987. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The total area (7,544 square meters) of the properties declared is equivalent to the area allotted to the respondent under the Agreement. On the other hand, the petitioner declared the 1,004-square meter portion only in September 1994, under Tax Declaration No. 9393, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> despite his claim of exclusive and adverse possession since 1969.<br><br><b><i>Nullification of the petitioner's title <br>over the 3,020 square meter portion</i></b><br><br>While the petitioner admitted using a spurious document in securing his titles, nonetheless, he questions the CA's nullification of TCT No. 195812 on the ground that, <i>per</i> the respondent's own admission and the parties' Agreement, he is the rightful owner of the land covered by this title.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>The petitioner's argument confuses registration of title with ownership. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> While the petitioner's ownership over the land covered by TCT No. 195812 is undisputed, his ownership only gave him the <i>right to apply </i>for the proper transfer of title to the property in his name. Obviously, the petitioner, even as a rightful owner, must comply with the statutory provisions on the transfer of registered title to lands. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Section 53 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 provides that the subsequent registration of title procured by the presentation of a forged deed or other instrument is null and void. Thus, the subsequent issuance of TCT No. 195812 gave the petitioner no better right than the tainted registration which was the basis for the issuance of the same title. The Court simply cannot allow the petitioner's attempt to get around the proper procedure for registering the transfer of title in his name by using spurious documents.<br><br><b><i>Reconveyance is the remedy of<br> the rightful owner only</i></b><br><br>While the CA correctly nullified the petitioner's certificates of title, the CA erred in ordering the reconveyance of the <i>entire </i>subject property in the respondent's favor. The respondent himself admitted that the 3,020- square meter portion covered by TCT No. 195812 is the petitioner's just share in the subject property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, although the petitioner obtained TCT No. 195812 using the same spurious documents, the land covered by this title should not be reconveyed in favor of the respondent since he is <b><i>not the rightful owner</i></b> of the property covered by this title. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is partially <b>GRANTED</b>.
