No. 00-5-03-SC dated September 28, 2004, which became effective on October 15, 2004, this judgment of the Court of Appeals may be appealed to the Supreme Court by notice of appeal filed with the Clerk of Court of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, appellant interposed this appeal before this Court and adopted his Appellant’s Brief with the Court of Appeals, wherein he put forth a single assignment of error:<br><br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED–APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant maintains that the trial court totally disregarded material and substantial facts, as well as several purportedly incredulous statements made by the alleged victim.&nbsp; He argues that not only was the testimony of the alleged victim inconsistent and uncorroborated but that it was also incredible since she claimed to have been raped by him for several years without even telling her mother and grandmother.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is inexplicable that she did not shout while being raped so that her siblings could have helped her, as she testified that most of the rapes were committed inside their house while her other siblings were sleeping just beside her.<br><br>In addition, appellant argues that the elements of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code were not present in the facts of the instant case.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Given that the incidents of rape occurred prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997), the applicable law is Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 335.&nbsp; <i>When and how rape is committed</i>. – Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using force or intimidation;<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br></blockquote><br>The elements of rape under the said provision of law are: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (2) such act was accomplished through force or intimidation; or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is under 12 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Contrary to appellant’s assertions, all the essential elements of rape are present in the case at bar.&nbsp; The evidence on record, particularly the victim’s detailed and damning testimony, clearly proves that the appellant had carnal knowledge of his own minor daughter on multiple occasions.<br><br>In a prosecution for rape, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of the victim that is credible, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; There is a plethora of cases which tend to disfavor the accused in a rape case by holding that when a woman declares that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed and, where her testimony passes the test of credibility, the accused can be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, the Court has repeatedly declared that it takes a certain amount of psychological depravity for a young woman to concoct a story which would put her own father to jail for the rest of his remaining life and drag the rest of the family including herself to a lifetime of shame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; For this reason, courts are inclined to give credit to the straightforward and consistent testimony of a minor victim in criminal prosecutions for rape.<br><br>We note that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals have found and considered the victim’s testimony as credible and worthy of belief.&nbsp; We have previously held that when the issue focuses on the credibility of the witnesses or the lack of it, the assessment of the trial court is controlling because of its unique opportunity to observe the witness and the latter’s demeanor, conduct, and attitude especially during the cross-examination unless cogent reasons dictate otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, it is an established rule that findings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misinterpreted which would otherwise materially affect the disposition of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, we see no compelling reason to veer away from this rule.<br><br>In an attempt to erode the victim’s credibility, appellant points to the victim’s failure to immediately report the repeated incidents of rape to her mother and grandmother.&nbsp; Likewise, appellant underscores the implausibility of the charges since the victim could have easily shouted for help during the alleged instances of sexual assault.<br><br>However, we are not impressed by these claims as we have previously held that the delay in reporting a rape could be attributed to the victim’s tender age and the appellant’s threats.&nbsp; A rape victim’s actions are oftentimes influenced by fear, rather than reason.&nbsp; In incestuous rape, this fear is magnified because the victim usually lives under the same roof as the perpetrator or is at any rate subject to his dominance because of their blood relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>As his main defenses, appellant puts forward denial and alibi which the Court has consistently regarded as inherently weak defenses and must be rejected when the identity of the accused is satisfactorily and categorically established by the eyewitnesses to the offense, especially when such eyewitnesses have no ill motive to testify falsely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; In the instant case, the defense failed to show that the victim and sole eyewitness to the crimes of rape was motivated by ill will.<br><br>Moreover, it is settled jurisprudence that for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant’s own categorical admission that he regularly went to the alleged boarding house of the victim and his two other children to give them their provisions for food and other expenses cast major doubt on his defense of alibi because, even if it were true, this only demonstrates that it was not physically impossible for appellant to be at the locus delicti when the victim was repeatedly raped.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we therefore affirm the conviction of appellant in this case for all twenty-seven (27) counts of rape.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, the proper penalty for qualified rape (as charged in Criminal Case Nos. 00-0590 and 00-0653) is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346 which prohibited the imposition of the death penalty.&nbsp; In addition, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence on simple rape in order to set a public example, to serve as deterrent to elders who abuse and corrupt the youth and to protect the latter from sexual abuse,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we modify the trial court’s Decision as regards the exemplary damages that should be granted to the victim and increase the same from Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) to Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) for each of the twenty-five (25) counts of rape in Criminal Case Nos. 00-0488 to 0495, 00-0497 to 0512, and 0571. Furthermore, we revise the modification made by the Court of Appeals with regard to the amount of exemplary damages awarded in Criminal Case Nos. 0590 and 0653 for qualified rape&nbsp; by increasing the same from Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) to Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) following established jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated December 21, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
