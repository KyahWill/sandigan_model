				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><u><b>The Case</b></u><br></center><br>This is an administrative complaint for Grave Misconduct Unbecoming a Court Employee and Physical Injuries filed by Recarredo S. Valenzuela (Clerk IV, Personnel Division, Office of Administrative Services-Office of the Court Administrator [OAS-OCA]) against Ricardo R. Giganto (Utility Worker II, Personnel Division, OAS-OCA).<br><br><center><u><b>The Facts</b></u><br></center><br>On 18 January 2011, complainant Recarredo S. Valenzuela (Valenzuela) filed a sworn Letter-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> with the Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer of the Supreme Court, charging respondent Ricardo R. Giganto (Giganto) with Grave Misconduct Unbecoming a Court Employee and Physical Injuries. In his Letter-Complaint, Valenzuela claims:<br><br><blockquote>[W]hile on a half leaning standing position on top of my computer hardware on my table, said Ricardo R. Giganto suddenly and treacherously appeared and grasped and pulled my polo shirt's breast part and at the same time unlawfully and feloniously, without provocation punched me at the `nasolabial area of my face which made me thrown off my back.<br><br>Astounded and dizzy, I tried to get on my feet but he again delivered several fist blows on my left temple, head and left eye, which caused me bleeding profusely as a consequence.</blockquote><br>In support of his claims, Valenzuela submitted a Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 18 January 2011, with the following physical examination findings of Dr. Prudencio P. Banzon, Jr., Chief, Supreme Court Medical and Dental Services: swelling, upper lip; superficial incised wound, inferior portion of alae nasi right; and BP elevated at 210/120.<br><br>On 24 January 2011, Giganto filed his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to the Letter-Complaint, claiming that the allegations of Valenzuela are "incorrect and misleading." Giganto claims that on 14 January 2011, at around afternoon time, Valenzuela, who is his colleague in the MTC Personnel Division, told him that Crisanto Madeja, one of their co-workers, was looking for him and planned to stab him. Giganto asked Valenzuela why Madeja was going to stab him, to which Valenzuela replied, "<i>Basta ikaw ay hinahanap/ hinahanting at sasaksakin</i>."<br><br>Giganto saw and confronted Madeja, while they were lining up in the bundy clock. Madeja said, "<i>hindi totoo iyon at lalong hindi totoo na ikaw ay sasaksakin ko, ano sira ulo ba ako bakit kita sasaksakin na tayo ay magkaibigan at magkakasama sa isang Division.</i>"<br><br>Giganto went back to Valenzuela to tell him that he spoke to Madeja, who denied saying anything about stabbing Giganto. Valenzuela became angry and told Giganto not to disturb him. Valenzuela and Giganto then exchanged heated words. Valenzuela threatened to hit Giganto, so Giganto punched Valenzuela, resulting in a fistfight between the two.<br><br>Giganto denies that Valenzuela fell on the floor, and that he continuously punched Valenzuela while the latter was on the floor. In fact, Giganto also claims to have been hit by Valenzuela's punches in the body, face, head, and lip, because Valenzuela kept on punching him, even after Joanne Ruaburo grabbed Giganto's arm and led him away to stop the fight. Because of the fight, Giganto's shirt got torn.<br><br>In addition, Giganto requested that his Comment be considered as a counter-complaint, and cited several grievances against Valenzuela, in particular: a) Aleli Padre's formal complaint in 2007 against Valenzuela for Amorous Advances and Acts of Indecency; b) Rosalyn Marabut's claim that Valenzuela is "<i>bastos at maniak</i>"; and c) Myra Guillo's claim that she was called Myra Malibog by Valenzuela.<br><br>In support of his Comment, Giganto submitted a Medical Certificate issued on 21 January 2011 by Dr. Prudencio P. Banzon, Jr., Chief, Supreme Court Medical and Dental Services, with the following findings: skin avulsion wound, 1.5cm x 1.0cm, on healing stage, at the left upper portion of his back, scapular area, posterior axillary line, attributable to blunt trauma.<br><br>Valenzuela filed his sworn Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to Giganto's Comment on 1 February 2011, claiming that, "we did not exchange blows as I never retaliated when I was treacherously attacked with fistic blows by said Ricardo R. Giganto."<br><br>On 8 February 2011, Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer Atty. Eden T.

In his Sworn Statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Cruz affirmed that there was a heated exchange of words between Valenzuela and Giganto before the fistfight. He likewise affirmed that there was an exchange of punches between the two. Cruz narrated his eyewitness testimony on the turn of events:<br><br><blockquote>`<i>Ano ang tsini-tsismis mo na sasaksakin ako?'</i> Sasaksakin daw siya ni Chris. Yun pala si Mr. Recaredo pala ang sinasabi niya. x x x Syempre makitid lang `yun parang nagkaroon na sila ng gantihan ng suntok. Ang nangyari, ang computer ni Regine, mahuhulog na.

In her Sworn Statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Ruaburo affirmed that both Valenzuela and Giganto exchanged punches, and Giganto suffered blows on his face:<br><br><blockquote>Oo. Nagsusuntukan na sila. Hindi ko talaga alam kung ano yung nangyari before.

The OAS noted the presence of mitigating circumstances for Valenzuela and Giganto, who both had very satisfactory performance ratings for the past three consecutive semesters. In addition, Valenzuela had four years of service in the Court, while Giganto had twelve years of service.<br><br>The OAS found both Giganto and Valenzuela guilty of conduct unbecoming a court employee which amounts to simple misconduct under Section 52(B)(2) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in<i> </i>the Civil Service because both parties engaged in a fistfight and exchanged punches.<br><br>The OAS recommended a suspension of thirty (30) days for Giganto because he was the aggressor in this case, as gleaned from his own Comment. A suspension of seven (7) days was recommended for Valenzuela because: a) he still engaged in the fistfight; and b) he fabricated the story about Chris Madeja planning to stab Giganto, which was the root cause of the fight.<br><br>The OAS dismissed Valenzuela's charge of physical injuries because such charge is the subject of a separate criminal case that must be filed and resolved at the proper forum.<br><br>The OAS likewise dismissed Giganto's counter-complaint impugning the character of Valenzuela because Giganto relied on second-hand information to prove the charge. The OAS noted, however, that a Complaint for Amorous Advances and Acts of Indecency was filed against Valenzuela, docketed as A.M. No. 2007-18-SC, but was dismissed. The Court, however, warned Valenzuela that a repetition of similar incidents in the future would be dealt with more severely.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The Court approves the findings of the OAS but modifies the recommended penalty on Valenzuela. The penalty for Giganto is affirmed, while the penalty for Valenzuela is increased.<br><br>Section 52(B)(2) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Rules) provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 52. Classification of Offenses - Administrative offenses with corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave or light, depending on their gravity or depravity and effects on the government service.<br><br>x x x<br><br>B.

Edilberto L. Idulsa and Ross C. Romero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court characterized the fighting incident as a less grave offense under simple misconduct. As well, the length of service, satisfactory performance ratings, and number of times an employee has been administratively charged were considered as mitigating, aggravating and alternative circumstances, as the case may be.<br><br><center><u><b>Giganto's Liability</b></u><br></center><br>Time and again, the Court has stressed the need for the conduct and behavior of every person connected with the dispensation of justice to be characterized by propriety and decorum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> This standard is applied, not only with respect to a court employee's dealings with the public, but also with his or her co-workers in the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Conduct violative of this standard quickly and surely erodes respect for the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Misbehavior within and around the court's vicinity diminishes the court's sanctity and dignity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Any fighting or misunderstanding becomes a disgraceful sight reflecting adversely on the good image of the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In this case, Giganto was the aggressor, based on his own statement in his Comment to the Letter-Complaint, which stated:<br><br><blockquote><i>Katunayan, siya ang nagpakita ng motibo na suntukin </i>ako kaya ako naman ay humanda baka may masamang gawin sa akin, <b><u>at yon na nga binantaan na akong suntukin kaya ako rin ang gumanti ng suntok sa kanya </u></b><u>at doon na kami nagpalitan ng suntok</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><i> (</i>Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Even if Valenzuela took the fighting stance, it was Giganto who threw the first punch. The fact that Giganto was the aggressor in this case was corroborated by the Sworn Statement of witness Abner Cruz:<br><br><blockquote>Nagkainitan na sila nagkaroon na ng suntukan naggantihan na sila doon. <b><u>Parang nauna yata si Mr. Giganto</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><i> </i>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Valenzuela charges Giganto with gross misconduct. Misconduct is defined as any unlawful conduct on the part of a person concerned in the administration of justice prejudicial to the rights of parties or to the proper determination of the cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It generally means wrongful, improper or unlawful conduct motivated by a premeditated, obstinate or intentional purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The term "gross" connotes something "out of all measure; beyond allowance; not to be excused; flagrant; shameful."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In Giganto's case, his actions as the aggressor in the fistfight, while condemnable, are not totally inexcusable as he was also provoked by the fabricated stories and antagonistic attitude of Valenzuela. Hence, this Court finds him guilty only of simple misconduct. The Court affirms the OAS' recommendation of suspension of thirty (30) days on Giganto, considering his twelve years of service, his very satisfactory performance ratings for the past three consecutive semesters, and the fact that this is his first administrative charge, as mitigating circumstances.<br><br>The Court dismisses Giganto's counter-complaint based on Aleli Padre's formal complaint in 2007 against Valenzuela for Amorous Advances and Acts of Indecency on the ground that this was the subject of a previous charge that had already been dismissed. We also dismiss Giganto's counter-complaint based on Rosalyn Marabut's alleged claim that Valenzuela is "<i>bastos at maniak,</i>" and Myra Guillo's alleged claim that she was called Myra Malibog by Valenzuela, for lack of merit.<br><br><center><u><b>Valenzuela's Liability</b></u><br></center><br>Valenzuela, on the other hand, cannot be exonerated from liability. His claim that he never retaliated against Giganto's punches, which was reiterated in his sworn Reply and Sworn Statement, was clearly rebutted by the Sworn Statements of witnesses Abner Cruz and Joanne Ruaburo.<br><br>Witness Abner Cruz, who was closest to the parties during the intercalation, saw Valenzuela throwing punches:<br><br><blockquote>Nagkainitan na sila nagkaroon na ng suntukan naggantihan na sila doon.

He denied saying that Giganto was being hunted down by Chris Medaja, which was the root cause of the fight. He denied throwing any punches against Giganto. He denied having any confrontation prior to the fistfight, and claimed he was just punched suddenly out of nowhere without provocation. He also claimed that he fell down due to the strength of Giganto's punches.<br><br>Valenzuela's claims and denials, which were made under oath and executed in affidavits, were clearly rebutted by the candid sworn statements of witnesses Abner Cruz, Joanne Ruaburo and Crisanto Medaja. This Court would like to remind Valenzuela that the willful and deliberate assertion of a falsehood on a material matter under oath or executed in an affidavit for a legal purpose made before a competent officer authorized to administer oaths constitutes the crime of perjury under Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines.<br><br>The Court considers the mitigating circumstances of Valenzuela's four years of service, and very satisfactory ratings for the past three consecutive semesters. However, there is also the Court's previous warning to Valenzuela in <i>Aleli Padre v. Recarredo S. Valenzuela</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Moreover, Valenzuela's claims and denials in his Sworn Statement, sworn Letter-Complaint and sworn Reply to prove his innocence were clearly rebutted by the Sworn Statements of credible witnesses and appear to be intentional assertions of falsehoods. Finally, Valenzuela caused intrigue between Giganto and Madeja by telling Giganto that Madeja was out to stab him - and this was the root cause of the fistfight. Thus, the Court increases the penalty on Valenzuela from a suspension of seven (7) days to a suspension of twenty (20) days.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>AFFIRM </b>the recommended penalty on respondent Ricardo R. Giganto of suspension for thirty (30) days for simple misconduct. We <b>DISMISS </b>complainant Recarredo S. Valenzuela's charge of Physical Injuries on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
