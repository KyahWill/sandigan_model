				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">By a verified November 22, 2009 Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Josephine Jazmines Tan (complainant) charges Judge Sibanah E. Usman (respondent), Presiding Judge of Branch 28,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Regional Trial Court, Catbalogan, Samar, with abuse of power and authority, conduct unbecoming a judicial officer, mental dishonesty, grave misconduct, gross ignorance of the law and knowingly rendering an unjust order, and bribery and corruption, in connection with Civil Case No. 7681<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Criminal Case No. 6536.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>It appears that complainant, together with his co-plaintiffs in the civil case/co-accused in the criminal case, filed a Motion for Inhibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against respondent. The movants attached to their motion the Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of complainant.<br><br>Complainant claims that during the hearing of the Motion for Inhibition, respondent became very emotional, coerced her to testify without the assistance of counsel and demanded a public apology from her;&nbsp; and that while she requested to refer the motion to the Executive Judge, respondent interrogated her relentlessly following which he issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of August 28, 2009 finding her guilty of Direct Contempt and ordered her detention.&nbsp; Thus respondent disposed in his Order:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW THEREOF, premises considered, in order to set as an example for anyone <u>not</u> to make fabricated charges against the Court employees and judges, and also to restore the integrity of the Court, the affiant, Josephine Jazmines Tan is hereby cited of <u>Direct Contempt of Court</u> and thus ordered <u>detained at the Samar Provincial Jail until she divulges the name of the informant/employee of the Court or publicly apologize</u> to the employees of the Court, the Presiding Judge and the Executive Judge, but the <u>period of <b>detention shall not exceed more than thirty (30) days</b></u><b></b> beginning from her service of confinement. Mrs. Perla Santiago, PO3 Marlon Villanueva and PO3 Doroteo Montejo are hereby directed to escort the affiant, Josephine Jazmines Tan, to the Samar Provincial Jail for detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (emphasis supplied;&nbsp; underscoring partly in the original, partly supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Complainant was in fact detained from August 28, 2009 until September 16, 2009<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> or for a total of 19 days.<br><br>In his January 14, 2010 Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to the complaint, respondent explained that during the hearing of the Motion for Inhibition, the employees of the court appeared before complainant but she failed to name any of them as having allegedly told her that Jaime Cui, Jr. "was bragging that they have disbursed a substantial amount of money" to him (respondent);&nbsp; that Atty. Lee M. Zosa, the private prosecutor in the criminal case, and Atty. Benly Frederick Bergonio, counsel for the PNB in the civil case, moved that complainant be cited for Direct Contempt of Court and that she be detained until she divulges the name of her informant;&nbsp; and that Atty. Jose M. Mendiola, complainant's lawyer, failed to give any comment because, according to him, complainant did not consult him about the filing of the Motion for Inhibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Respondent went on to explain that since he issued his August 28, 2009 Order in an official capacity, the remedy of complainant was to file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal, not an administrative case;&nbsp; that he gave complainant a maximum of 30 days detention to give her "a wider opportunity to either apologize or divulge the name of her informant, so that even before the expiration of the period, the court can lift the Order of Contempt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>By Report of November 25, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) came up with the following evaluation of the Complaint:<br><br><blockquote>The instant administrative case is <u>partly meritorious</u>.<br><br><u>Complainant Tan failed to prove that respondent Judge Usman committed an Act Unbecoming a Judge by shouting at her at the hearing </u>on the <i>Motion for Inhibition</i>.&nbsp; Aside from her allegation, there is nothing on record to support her claim.&nbsp; The TSN did not contain any inappropriate language. Neither did it reflect any observation/manifestation from the lawyers present, (who are presumably aware and vigilant of their duties as officers of the court) of any untoward incident. Complainant Tan countered that given the limitations of the TSN, i.e., its inability to capture the nuance of speech and project emotions vividly, the fact that respondent Judge Usman shouted expletives cannot be erased or rendered inexistent by this limitation.&nbsp; Downplaying the TSN's significance by highlighting its limitation is not the same as saying that respondent Judge Usman did in fact shout at her.&nbsp; In other words, she cannot rely on the TSN's limitation and present it as proof that respondent Judge Usman shouted at her.<br><br><u>The charge of Mental Dishonesty has no merit</u>.&nbsp; When respondent Judge Usman included other court employees and the Executive Judge in his discourse on the charge of bribery/corruption against him, he was not twisting the facts but was merely discussing the projected overall effect of the complainant Tan's accusation.&nbsp; The perception that a particular employee of the judiciary is corrupt, eventually, engulfs the entire institution.<br><br>Hence, complainant Tan <u>failed to prove by substantial evidence her charge of Knowingly Rendering an Unjust Order</u>.&nbsp; The records bear nothing to show that a competent court had previously adjudged respondent Judge Usman guilty of the crime of Knowingly Rendering an Unjust Order in Civil Case No. 7681 and/or Criminal Case No. 6536.<br><br>Complainant Tan likewise failed <u>to prove the charge of Bribery/Corruption</u>. Bare allegation alone is insufficient to hold respondent Judge Usman liable.&nbsp; Complainant Tan admitted the deficiency of her proof when, at the outset, she reserved her right to submit other proofs in support of this particular charge.<br><br>Based on the evidence presented, <b><i><u>respondent Judge Usman gravely abused his authority and is grossly ignorant of the rule on Direct Contempt of Court</u></i>....</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>. . . [I]n the Order dated 28 August 2009, respondent Judge Usman directed that complainant Tan be detained for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days.&nbsp; No amount of rationalization can reconcile the limit of the 10-day period of imprisonment for Direct Contempt of Court set in section 1, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court with the 30-day (maximum period of) imprisonment that respondent Judge Usman fixed in the<i> Order.&nbsp; </i>This Office finds nothing in the rule, which suggests, however remotely, the theory that the 10-day period of imprisonment in Section 1, Rule 71 is pliable enough to validly stretch to 30 days.&nbsp; By virtue of his office, respondent Judge Usman knows or should have known this so basic a rule.&nbsp; The glaring clarity of the rule tripped respondent Judge Usman to commit a glaring error, which was made even more flagrant by the fact that complainant Tan was <b>actually imprisoned for 19 days.</b><br><br>Further, <i><u>respondent Judge Usman failed to indicate in the Order the amount of bond as required under Section 2, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court</u></i>.&nbsp; Due to this omission, complainant Tan's option to stay the execution of the judgment had been rendered nugatory, and a result thereof caused her immediate detention.&nbsp; <u>An order of direct contempt is not immediately executory</u>. Respondent Judge Usman's error, however, made it so.<br><br><u>Respondent Judge Usman wielded power abusively by depriving complainant Tan her liberty for <b>nine (9) days</b> without due process of law</u>.&nbsp; Lest any misperception of this institution thrive, this regretful incident must be decisively addressed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (emphasis partly in the original, partly supplied; italics in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In its Report, the OCA also listed the other administrative complaints filed against respondent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and their respective status, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Per Alphalist as of 30, June 2010, respondent Judge Usman was the subject of other administrative complaints, to wit:<br><br><table width="100%" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="30%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">RTJ-91-777 </div></td> <td width="40%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Irregular Financial Support</div></td> <td width="30%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Complaint Dismissed (3.23.93) Fine 2 mos.

By accepting the exalted position of a judge, respondent ought to have been familiar with the legal norms and precepts as well as the procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Contrary to respondent's claim, complainant has no remedy of appeal, as the above-quoted Section 2 of Rule 71 shows.&nbsp; And the penalty for direct contempt if imprisonment is imposed should not, as Section 1 of Rule 71 provides, exceed 10 days.&nbsp; As stated earlier, complainant was detained for 19 days or 9 days more than the limit imposed by the Rules.<br><br>More.&nbsp; Respondent did not fix the bond, in violation of the same Section 2 of Rule 71, which complainant could have posted had she desired to challenge the order. And on the same day the Order was issued, respondent ordered the confinement of complainant to the provincial jail.<br><br><i>Oclarit v.

The contemner must be afforded a reasonable remedy to extricate or purge himself of the contempt. Thus, in the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, the Court introduced a new provision granting a remedy to a person adjudged in direct contempt by any court. Such person may not appeal therefrom, <u>but may avail himself of <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition.
