				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Being placed under corporate rehabilitation and having a receiver appointed to carry out the rehabilitation plan do not <i>ipso facto </i>deprive a corporation and its corporate officers of the power to recover its unlawfully detained property.<br><br>Petitioners filed this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the October 15, 2007 Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 91096, as well as its January 2, 2008 Resolution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Decision dated March 28, 2005 of the trial court is affirmed <i>in toto. </i><br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br></blockquote><b><i>Factual Antecedents</i></b><br><br>This case involves a parcel of land identified as Lot 7, Block 5, Amethyst Street, Ortigas Center, Pasig City which was originally owned by Amethyst Pearl Corporation (Amethyst Pearl), a company that is, in turn, wholly-owned by respondent ASB Realty Corporation (ASB Realty).<br><br>In 1996, Amethyst Pearl executed a Deed of Assignment in Liquidation of the subject premises in favor of ASB Realty in consideration of the full redemption of Amethyst Pearl's outstanding capital stock from ASB Realty. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, ASB Realty became the owner of the subject premises and obtained in its name Transfer Certificate of Title No. PT-105797, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which was registered in 1997 with the Registry of Deeds of Pasig City.<br><br>Sometime in 2003, ASB Realty commenced an action in the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) of Pasig City for unlawful detainer <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the subject premises against petitioner Leonardo S. Umale (Umale).&nbsp; ASB Realty alleged that it entered into a lease contract <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with Umale for the period June 1, 1999-May 31, 2000.&nbsp; Their agreement was for Umale to conduct a pay-parking business on the property and pay a monthly rent of P60,720.00 to ASB Realty.<br><br>Upon the contract's expiration on May 31, 2000, Umale continued occupying the premises and paying rentals albeit at an increased monthly rent of P100,000.00.&nbsp; The last rental payment made by Umale to ASB Realty was for the June 2001 to May 2002 period, as evidenced by the Official Receipt No. 56511 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated November 19, 2001.<br><br>On June 23, 2003, ASB Realty served on Umale a Notice of Termination of Lease and Demand to Vacate and Pay. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; ASB Realty stated that it was terminating the lease effective midnight of June 30, 2003; that Umale should vacate the premises, and pay to ASB Realty the rental arrears amounting to P1.3 million by July 15, 2003.&nbsp; Umale failed to comply with ASB Realty's demands and continued in possession of the subject premises, even constructing commercial establishments thereon.<br><br>Umale admitted occupying the property since 1999 by virtue of a verbal lease contract but vehemently denied that ASB Realty was his lessor.&nbsp; He was adamant that his lessor was the original owner, Amethyst Pearl.&nbsp; Since there was no contract between himself and ASB Realty, the latter had no cause of action to file the unlawful detainer complaint against him.<br><br>In asserting his right to remain on the property based on the oral lease contract with Amethyst Pearl, Umale interposed that the lease period agreed upon was "for a long period of time." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; He then allegedly paid P1.2 million in 1999 as one year advance rentals to Amethyst Pearl. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Umale further claimed that when his oral lease contract with Amethyst Pearl ended in May 2000, they both agreed on an oral contract to sell. They agreed that Umale did not have to pay rentals until the sale over the subject property had been perfected between them. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Despite such agreement with Amethyst Pearl regarding the waiver of rent payments, Umale maintained that he continued paying the annual rent of P1.2 million. He was thus surprised when he received the Notice of Termination of Lease from ASB Realty. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Umale also challenged ASB Realty's personality to recover the subject premises considering that ASB Realty had been placed under receivership by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a rehabilitation receiver had been duly appointed.&nbsp; Under Section 14(s), Rule 4 of the Administrative Memorandum No. 00-8-10SC, otherwise known as the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (Interim Rules), it is the rehabilitation receiver that has the power to "take possession, control and custody of the debtor's assets."&nbsp; Since ASB Realty claims that it owns the subject premises, it is its duly-appointed receiver that should sue to recover possession of the same. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>ASB Realty replied that it was impossible for Umale to have entered into a Contract of Lease with Amethyst Pearl in 1999 because Amethyst Pearl had been liquidated in 1996.&nbsp; ASB Realty insisted that, as evidenced by the written lease contract, Umale contracted with ASB Realty, not with Amethyst Pearl.&nbsp; As further proof thereof, ASB Realty cited the official receipt evidencing the rent payments made by Umale to ASB Realty.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its August 20, 2004 Decision, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the MTC dismissed ASB Realty's complaint against Umale without prejudice.&nbsp; It held that ASB Realty had no cause to seek Umale's ouster from the subject property because it was not Umale's lessor.&nbsp; The trial court noted an inconsistency in the written lease contract that was presented by ASB Realty as basis for its complaint.&nbsp; Its whereas clauses cited ASB Realty, with Eden C. Lin as its representative, as Umale's lessor; but its signatory page contained Eden C. Lin's name under the heading Amethyst Pearl.&nbsp; The MTC then concluded from such inconsistency that Amethyst Pearl was the real lessor, who can seek Umale's ejectment from the subject property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the MTC agreed with Umale that only the rehabilitation receiver could file suit to recover ASB Realty's property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Having been placed under receivership, ASB Realty had no more personality to file the complaint for unlawful detainer.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>ASB Realty appealed the adverse MTC Decision to the Regional Trial Court (RTC), <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which then reversed <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the MTC ruling.<br><br>The RTC held that the MTC erred in dismissing ASB Realty's complaint for lack of cause of action.&nbsp; It found sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that it was indeed ASB Realty that entered into a lease contract with Umale, hence, the proper party who can assert the corresponding right to seek Umale's ouster from the leased premises for violations of the lease terms.&nbsp; In addition to the written lease contract, the official receipt evidencing Umale's rental payments for the period June 2001 to May 2002 to ASB Realty adequately established that Umale was aware that his lessor, the one entitled to receive his rent payments, was ASB Realty, not Amethyst Pearl.<br><br>ASB Realty's positive assertions, supported as they are by credible evidence, are more compelling than Umale's bare negative assertions.&nbsp; The RTC found Umale's version of the facts incredible. It was implausible that a businessman such as Umale would enter into several transactions with his alleged lessor - a lease contract, payment of lease rentals, acceptance of an offer to sell from his alleged lessor, and an agreement to waive rentals - <i>sans</i> a sliver of evidence.<br><br>With the lease contract between Umale and ASB Realty duly established and Umale's failure to pay the monthly rentals since June 2002 despite due demands from ASB Realty, the latter had the right to terminate the lease contract and seek his eviction from the leased premises.&nbsp; Thus, when the contract expired on June 30, 2003 (as stated in the Notice of Termination of Lease), Umale lost his right to remain on the premises and his continued refusal to vacate the same constituted sufficient cause of action for his ejectment. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>With respect to ASB Realty's personality to file the unlawful detainer suit, the RTC ruled that ASB Realty retained all its corporate powers, including the power to sue, despite the appointment of a rehabilitation receiver. Citing the Interim Rules, the RTC noted that the rehabilitation receiver was not granted therein the power to file complaints on behalf of the corporation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the retention of its corporate powers by the corporation under rehabilitation will advance the objective of corporate rehabilitation, which is to conserve and administer the assets of the corporation in the hope that it may eventually be able to go from financial distress to solvency.&nbsp; The suit filed by ASB Realty to recover its property and back rentals from Umale could only benefit ASB Realty. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed decision is hereby reversed and set aside.&nbsp; Accordingly, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff-appellant ordering defendant-appellee and all persons claiming rights under him:<br><br>1)&nbsp; To immediately vacate the subject leased premises located at Lot 7, Block 5, Amethyst St., Pearl Drive, Ortigas Center, Pasig City and deliver possession thereof to the plaintiff-appellant;<br><br>2) To pay plaintiff-appellant the sum of P1,300,000.00 representing rentals in arrears from June 2002 to June 2003;<br><br>3) To pay plaintiff-appellant the amount of P100,000.00 a month starting from July 2003 and every month thereafter until they finally vacate the subject premises as reasonable compensation for the continued use and occupancy of the same;<br><br>4)&nbsp; To pay plaintiff-appellant the sum of P200,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees; and the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Umale filed a Motion for Reconsideration <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> while ASB Realty moved for the issuance of a writ of execution pursuant to Section 21 of the 1991 Revised Rules on Summary Procedure. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In its July 26, 2005 Order, the RTC denied reconsideration of its Decision and granted ASB Realty's Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Execution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;Umale then filed his appeal <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> with the CA insisting that the parties did not enter into a lease contract. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Assuming that there was a lease, it was at most an implied lease.&nbsp; Hence its period depended on the rent payments.&nbsp; Since Umale paid rent annually, ASB Realty had to respect his lease for the entire year.&nbsp; It cannot terminate the lease at the end of the month, as it did in its Notice of Termination of Lease. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, Umale insisted that it was the rehabilitation receiver, not ASB Realty, that was the real party-in-interest. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Pending&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution thereof,&nbsp; Umale&nbsp; died&nbsp; and was&nbsp; substituted&nbsp; by&nbsp; his<br><br>widow and legal heirs, per CA Resolution dated August 14, 2006. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>The CA affirmed the RTC Decision <i>in toto</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>According to the appellate court, ASB Realty fully discharged its burden to prove the existence of a lease contract between ASB Realty and Umale, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as well as the grounds for eviction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The veracity of the terms of the lease contract presented by ASB Realty was further bolstered, instead of demolished, by Umale's admission that he paid monthly rents in accordance therewith. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The CA found no merit in Umale's claim that in light of Article 1687 of the Civil Code the lease should be extended until the end of the year. The said provision stated that in cases where the lease period was not fixed by the parties,&nbsp; the lease period depended on the payment periods.&nbsp; In the case at bar, the rent payments were made on a monthly basis, not annually; thus, Umale's failure to pay the monthly rent gave ASB Realty the corresponding right to terminate the lease at the end of the month. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The CA then upheld ASB Realty's, as well as its corporate officers', personality to recover an unlawfully withheld corporate property.&nbsp; As expressly stated in Section 14 of Rule 4 of the Interim Rules, the rehabilitation receiver does not take over the functions of the corporate officers. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; in the<br><br>assailed January 2, 2008 Resolution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The petitioners raise the following issues for resolution: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>1.&nbsp; Can a corporate officer of ASB Realty (duly authorized by the Board of Directors) file suit to recover an unlawfully detained corporate property despite the fact that the corporation had already been placed under rehabilitation?<br><br>2.&nbsp; Whether a contract of lease exists between ASB Realty and Umale; and<br><br>3.&nbsp; Whether Umale is entitled to avail of the lease periods provided in Article 1687 of the Civil Code.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>Petitioners ask for the dismissal of the complaint for unlawful detainer on the ground that it was not brought by the real party-in-interest. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners maintain that the appointment of a rehabilitation receiver for ASB Realty deprived its corporate officers of the power to recover corporate property and transferred such power to the rehabilitation receiver.&nbsp; Section 6, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court states that a receiver has the power to bring actions in his own name and to collect debts due to the corporation.&nbsp; Under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 902-A and the Interim Rules, the rehabilitation receiver has the power to take custody and control of the assets of the corporation. Since the receiver for ASB Realty did not file the complaint for unlawful detainer, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the subject property. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioners cite <i>Villanueva v.

The Manila Banking Corporation,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as authorities for the rule that the appointment of a receiver suspends the authority of the corporation and its officers over its property and effects. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><i> </i><br><br>ASB Realty counters that there is no provision in PD 902-A, the Interim Rules, or in Rule 59 of the Rules of Court that divests corporate officers of their power to sue upon the appointment of a rehabilitation receiver. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, Section 14 , Rule 4 of the Interim Rules expressly limits the receiver's power by providing that the rehabilitation receiver does not take over the management and control of the corporation but shall closely oversee and monitor the operations of the debtor. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Further, the SEC Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery (SEC Rules), the rules applicable to the instant case, do not include among the receiver's powers the exclusive right to file suits for the corporation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The Court resolves the issue in favor of ASB Realty and its officers.<br><br>There is no denying that ASB Realty, as the owner of the leased premises, is the real party-in-interest in the unlawful detainer suit. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Real party-in-interest is defined as "the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>What petitioners argue is that the corporate officer of ASB Realty is incapacitated to file this suit to recover a corporate property because ASB Realty has a duly-appointed rehabilitation receiver.&nbsp; Allegedly, this rehabilitation receiver is the only one that can file the instant suit.<br><br>Corporations, such as ASB Realty, are juridical entities that exist by operation of law. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; As a creature of law, the powers and attributes of a corporation are those set out, expressly or impliedly, in the law.&nbsp; Among the general powers granted by law to a corporation is the power to sue in its own name. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; This power is granted to a duly-organized corporation, unless <i>specifically</i> revoked by another law.&nbsp; The question becomes:&nbsp; Do the laws on corporate rehabilitation - particularly PD 902-A, as amended, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and its corresponding rules of procedure - forfeit the power to sue from the corporate officers and Board of Directors?<br><br>Corporate rehabilitation is defined as "the restoration of the debtor to a position of successful operation and solvency, if it is shown that its continuance of operation is economically feasible and its creditors can recover by way of the present value of payments projected in the plan more if the corporation continues as a going concern than if it is immediately liquidated." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; It was first introduced in the Philippine legal system through PD 902-A, as amended. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The intention of the law is "to effect a feasible and viable rehabilitation by <i>preserving</i> a floundering business as a <i>going</i> <i>concern</i>, because the assets of a business are often more valuable <i>when so maintained</i> than they would be when liquidated." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; This concept of preserving the corporation's business as a going concern while it is undergoing rehabilitation is called debtor-in-possession or debtor-in-place. This means that the debtor corporation (the corporation undergoing rehabilitation), through its Board of Directors and corporate officers, remains <b><i>in control of its business and properties, </i></b>subject only to the monitoring of the appointed rehabilitation receiver. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; The concept of debtor-in-possession, is carried out more particularly in the SEC Rules, the rule that is relevant to the instant case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; It states therein that the interim rehabilitation receiver of the debtor corporation "does <b><i>not</i></b> take over the control and management of the debtor corporation." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, the rehabilitation receiver that will replace the interim receiver is tasked only to monitor the successful implementation of the rehabilitation plan. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; There is nothing in the concept of corporate rehabilitation that would <i>ipso facto </i>deprive <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Board of Directors and corporate officers of a debtor corporation, such as ASB Realty, of control such that it can no longer enforce its right to recover its property from an errant lessee.<br><br>To be sure, corporate rehabilitation imposes several restrictions on the debtor corporation. The rules enumerate the prohibited corporate actions and transactions <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (most of which involve some kind of disposition or encumbrance of the corporation's assets) during the pendency of the rehabilitation proceedings but none of which touch on the debtor corporation's right to sue.&nbsp; The implication therefore is that our concept of rehabilitation does not restrict this particular power, save for the caveat that all its actions are monitored closely by the receiver, who can seek an annulment of any prohibited or anomalous transaction or agreement entered into by the officers of the debtor corporation.<br><br>Petitioners insist that the rehabilitation receiver has the power to bring and defend actions in his own name as this power is provided in Section 6 of Rule 59 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Indeed, PD 902-A, as amended, provides that the receiver shall have the powers enumerated under Rule 59 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; But Rule 59 is a rule of general application.&nbsp; It applies to different kinds of receivers - rehabilitation receivers, receivers of entities under management, ordinary receivers, receivers in liquidation - and for different kinds of situations. While the SEC has the discretion <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; to authorize the rehabilitation receiver, as the case may warrant, to exercise the powers in Rule 59, the SEC's exercise of such discretion cannot simply be assumed. There is no allegation whatsoever in this case that the SEC gave ASB Realty's rehabilitation receiver the exclusive right to sue.<br><br>Petitioners cite <i>Villanueva,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> <i>Yam,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><i> </i>and <i>Abacus Real Estate</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><i> </i>as authorities for their theory that the corporate officers of a corporation under rehabilitation is incapacitated to act.&nbsp; In <i>Villanueva,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court<i> </i>nullified the sale contract entered into by the Philippine Veterans Bank on the ground that the bank's insolvency restricted its capacity to act. <i>Yam,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> on the other hand,<i> </i>nullified the compromise agreement that Manphil Investment Corporation entered into while it was under receivership by the Central Bank.&nbsp; In <i>Abacus Real Estate,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><i> </i>it was<i> </i>held that Manila Bank's president had no authority to execute an "option to purchase" contract while the bank was under liquidation.<br><br>These jurisprudence are inapplicable to the case at bar because they involve<br><br>banking and financial institutions that are governed by different laws. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; In the cited cases, the applicable banking law was Section 29 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the Central Bank Act. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; In stark contrast to rehabilitation where the corporation retains control and management of its affairs, Section 29 of the Central Bank Act, as amended, expressly forbids the bank or the quasi-bank from doing business in the Philippines.<br><br>Moreover, the nullified transactions in the cited cases involve <i>dispositions</i> of assets and claims, which are prohibited transactions even for corporate rehabilitation <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> because these may be prejudicial to creditors and contrary to the rehabilitation plan.&nbsp; The instant case, however, involves the recovery of assets and collection of receivables, for which there is no prohibition in PD 902-A.<br><br>While the Court rules that ASB Realty and its corporate officers retain their power to sue to recover its property and the back rentals from Umale, the necessity of keeping the receiver apprised of the proceedings and its results is not lost upon this Court.&nbsp; Tasked to closely monitor the assets of ASB Realty, the rehabilitation receiver has to be notified of the developments in the case, so that these assets would be managed in accordance with the approved rehabilitation plan.<br><br>Coming&nbsp; to&nbsp; the second issue, petitioners&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; that&nbsp; ASB Realty has no<br><br>cause of action against them because it is not their lessor.&nbsp; They insist that Umale entered into a verbal lease agreement with Amethyst Pearl only. As proof of this verbal agreement, petitioners cite their possession of the premises, and construction of buildings thereon, <i>sans</i> protest from Amethyst Pearl or ASB Realty. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Petitioners concede that they may have raised questions of fact but insist nevertheless on their review as the appellate court's ruling is allegedly grounded entirely on speculations, surmises, and conjectures and its conclusions regarding the termination of the lease contract are manifestly absurd, mistaken, and impossible. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' arguments have no merit.&nbsp; Ineluctably, the errors they raised involve factual findings, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> the review of which is not within the purview of the Court's functions under Rule 45, particularly when there is adequate evidentiary support on record.<br><br>While petitioners assail the authenticity of the written lease contract by pointing out the inconsistency in the name of the lessor in two separate pages, they fail to account for Umale's actions which are consistent with the terms of the contract - the payment of lease rentals to ASB Realty (instead of his alleged lessor Amethyst Pearl) for a 12-month period.&nbsp; These matters cannot simply be brushed off as sheer happenstance especially when weighed against Umale's incredible version of the facts - that he entered into a verbal lease contract with Amethyst Pearl; that the term of the lease is for a "very long period of time;" that Amethyst Pearl offered to sell the leased premises and Umale had accepted the offer, with both parties not demanding any written documentation of the transaction and without any mention of the purchase price; and that finally, Amethyst Pearl agreed that Umale need not pay rentals until the perfection of the sale.&nbsp; The Court is of the same mind as the appellate court that it is simply inconceivable that a businessman, such as petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, would enter into commercial transactions with and pay substantial rentals to a corporation nary a single documentation.<br><br>Petitioners then try to turn the table on ASB Realty with their third argument. They say that under Article 1687 of the New Civil Code, the period for rent payments determines the lease period. Judging by the official receipt presented by ASB Realty, which covers the 12-month period from June 2001 to May 2002, the lease period should be annual because of the annual rent payments. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners then conclude that ASB Realty violated Article 1687 of the New Civil Code when it terminated the lease on June 30, 2003, at the beginning of the new period.&nbsp; They then implore the Court to extend the lease to the end of the annual period, meaning until May 2004, in accordance with the annual rent payments. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In arguing for an extension of lease under Article 1687, petitioners lost sight of the restriction provided in Article 1675 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; It states that a lessee that commits any of the grounds for ejectment cited in Article 1673, including non-payment of lease rentals and devoting the leased premises to uses other than those stipulated, cannot avail of the periods established in Article 1687. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the extension in Article 1687 is granted only as a matter of equity. The law simply recognizes that there are instances when it would be unfair to abruptly end the lease contract causing the eviction of the lessee.&nbsp; It is only for these clearly unjust situations&nbsp; that&nbsp; Article 1687 grants&nbsp; the court&nbsp; the&nbsp; discretion to<br><br>extend the lease. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>The particular circumstances of the instant case however, do not inspire granting equitable relief.&nbsp; Petitioners have not paid, much less offered to pay, the rent for 14 months and even had the temerity to disregard the pay-and-vacate notice served on them.&nbsp; An extension will only benefit the wrongdoer and punish the long-suffering property owner. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><b>&nbsp; WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED.</b> The October 15, 2007 Decision and January 2, 2008 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
