				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> assails the Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 31, 2007 and July 16, 2007. The assailed Resolutions granted respondents’ motion for new trial of a case for quieting of title and damages, decided in petitioners’ favor by the trial court in a summary judgment.<br><br>The facts of the case are, as follows:<br><br>Estrella Mapa Vda. de Ybiernas (Estrella) owned a parcel of land located in Talisay, Negros Occidental, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-83976. On April 28, 1988, Estrella executed a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> over the property in favor of her heirs, Dionisio Ybiernas (Dionisio) and petitioners Manuel Ybiernas, Vicente Ybiernas, and Maria Corazon Angeles.<br><br>On June 30, 1989, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 47, Bacolod City issued an Order in Cadastral Case No. 10, LRC (G.L.R.O.) Rec. No. 97, Lot 713-C-B, Psd-220027, Talisay Cadastre, directing the registration and annotation of the Deed of Absolute Sale on the title. Thus, on July 5, 1989, the Deed of Absolute Sale and the said RTC Order were annotated on the title, as follows:&nbsp; <blockquote>Entry No. 334150; Order; Dionisio M. Ybiernas; Order issued by the RTC of Negros Occ. to register and annotate the deed of sale on this title without need of presenting the owner’s duplicate. Date of order-June 30, 1989; Date of prescription-July 5, 1989 at 10:45 a.m.<br><br>Entry No. 334151; Sale; Dionisio Ybiernas, et al; Deed of absolute sale of this property for the sum of P650,000.00 in favor of Dionisio Ybiernas, Vicente M.

Date of instrument-April 28, 1988; Date of inscription-July 5, 1989 at 10:45 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 29, 1991, respondents Ester Tanco-Gabaldon and Manila Bay Spinning Mills, Inc. filed with the RTC of Pasig City a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for sum of money and damages, amounting to P6,000,000.00, against Estrella and three other individuals. The Complaint alleged that the defendants were guilty of fraud when they misrepresented to herein respondents that they own a parcel of land in Quezon City, and that the title over the said property is free from liens and encumbrances.<br><br>Upon respondents’ motion, the Pasig City RTC, in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>dated November 6, 1991, ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment upon filing of a bond. The sheriff issued the corresponding writ of attachment and levied the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On November 13, 1991, the notice of attachment was annotated on TCT No. T-83976 as Entry No. 346816.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>When Estrella’s heirs learned about the levy, Dionisio filed, on January 14, 1992, an Affidavit of Third-Party Claim, asserting the transfer of ownership to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8] </sup>Respondents, however, filed an indemnity bond; thus, the sheriff refused to lift the levy.<br><br>The Pasig City RTC resolved the Complaint for sum of money in favor of respondents, and Estrella, et al. were ordered to pay P6,000,000.00, plus legal interest and damages. Respondents, however, elevated the case all the way up to this Court, questioning the interest rate. This Court eventually denied the appeal in a Minute Resolution dated November 20, 2002, which became final and executory on April 14, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Dionisio died and was succeeded by his heirs, petitioners Valentin Ybiernas and Violeta Ybiernas.<br><br>On November 28, 2001, petitioners filed with the RTC of Bacolod City a Complaint for Quieting of Title and Damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>claiming that the levy was invalid because the property is not owned by any of the defendants in the Pasig City RTC case. They averred that the annotation of the RTC Order and the Deed of Absolute Sale on TCT No. T-83976 serves as notice to the whole world that the property is no longer owned by Estrella.<br><br>In their Answer with Counterclaims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> respondents contended that (a) the case constituted an interference in the proceeding of the Pasig City RTC, a co-equal court; (b) petitioners should have filed their claims against the indemnity bond filed by respondents; and (c) petitioners were guilty of forum-shopping, considering that the case actually sought a relief similar to the third-party claim.<br><br>During pre-trial, the parties admitted, among others, the "[e]xistence of the Order dated June 30, 1989 by RTC Branch 47, Bacolod City, in Cad. Case No. 10 concerning the same TCT No. T-83976."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On July 30, 2004, petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment. The RTC initially denied the motion in the Order dated December 23, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13] </sup>Upon petitioners’ motion for reconsideration, the RTC granted the motion for summary judgment in the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated December 27, 2005. The RTC made the following pronouncement:<br><div align="justify"></div><blockquote>A consideration of the issues defined by the parties during the pre-trial x x x shows quite clearly that they are issues that may already be properly resolved now at this stage of the proceedings in this case, as they, other than the amount of damages, are quite apparently pure questions of law, the factual antecedents for these issues having already been admitted by the parties.<br><br>As to issue No. 1 [whether ownership has been transferred to petitioners], it is a fact well-established, as admitted by the parties and shown by the annotation as Entry No. 334151 on said TCT No. T-8[39]76, that the said Deed of Absolute Sale, dated April 28, 1988 over the subject property by Estrella Mapa Vda. de Ybiernas in favor of Dionisio Ybiernas, Vicente Ybiernas, Manuel Ybiernas and Maria Corazon Y. Angeles, was validly annotated as such Entry No. 334151, inscribed on July 5, 1989, on said TCT No. T-83976 registered in the name of Estrella M. Ybiernas.<br><br>Neither the defendants nor anyone else has challenged the validity of the judicial proceedings before RTC, Branch 47, Bacolod City, which issued in Cadastral Case No. 10, the said Order dated June 30, 1989, which directed the registration and annotation of the said Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 28, 1988 on said TCT No. T-83976, and which led to the annotation under said Entry No. 334151 on said TCT No. T-83976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the dispositive portion of the December 27, 2005 RTC decision reads:<div align="justify"></div><blockquote>WHEREFORE, except as to the amount of damages, a summary judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, and as prayed for by the plaintiffs in their complaint:<br><ol><li>The levy on attachment made by herein defendant Sheriff of RTC, Branch 163, Pasig City on said TCT No. T-83976, issued by the Registrar of Deeds of the Province of Negros Occidental, covering the Subject Property, is hereby DECLARED INVALID; and, consequently,<br><br></li><li>Entry No. 346816 on the same TCT No. T-83976 is hereby CANCELLED and DISSOLVED.</li></ol><div align="justify">SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Respondents filed a notice of appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and it was granted by the RTC.<br><div align="justify"><br>While the appeal was pending in the CA, respondents filed a motion for new trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> claiming that they have discovered on May 9, 2006 that Cadastral Case No. 10 did not exist and the April 28, 1988 Deed of Sale was simulated.

Domingo, OIC Archives Division of the National Archives Office, stating that: "no copy is on file with this Office of a DEED OF SALE allegedly executed by and among ESTRELLA MAPA VDA. DE YBIERNAS, DIONISIO YBIERNAS, VICENTE M. YBIERNAS, JR., MANUEL YBIERNAS and MARIA CORAZON ANGELES, ratified on April 28, 1988 before INDALECIO P. ARRIOLA, a notary public for and within Iloilo City&nbsp; and acknowledged as Doc. No. 437; Page No. 89; Book No. VI; Series of 1988."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Respondents argued that they have satisfied all the requisites for the grant of a new trial based on newly discovered evidence: (1) they discovered&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; its&nbsp; judgment&nbsp;&nbsp; on December 27, 2005; (2) they could not have discovered and produced the evidence during the trial with reasonable diligence; and (3) the evidence was material, not merely cumulative, corroborative, or impeaching, and was of such weight that, if admitted, would probably change the judgment. On the second requisite, respondents explained that they could not have discovered the evidence with reasonable diligence because they relied in good faith on the veracity of the RTC Order dated June 30, 1989, based on the principle that the issuance of a court order, as an act of a public officer, enjoys the presumption of regularity. On the third requisite, respondents pointed out that, if the nonexistence of Cadastral Case No. 10 and the invalidity of the Order dated June 30, 1989 were allowed to be proven by the newly discovered evidence, the action for quieting of title would probably be dismissed, as respondents’ levy would be declared superior to petitioners’ claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">In their Comment/Opposition, petitioners argued that (a) the questioned decision was a partial summary judgment which could not be the subject of a motion for new trial; (b) the existence of Cadastral Case No. 10 was an admitted fact which could not be questioned in a motion for new trial; and (c) there was no newly discovered evidence that would warrant a new trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br></div><div align="justify">The CA did not agree with petitioners. Hence, on January 31, 2007, it granted respondents’ motion for new trial, thus:<br></div><div align="justify"></div><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the defendants-appellants having satisfied all the elements necessary to justify the filing of a Motion for New Trial which appears to be meritorious and in the higher interest of substantial&nbsp; justice, the said motion is GRANTED.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, let a new trial of the Quieting of Title case be held and let said case be REMANDED to the Court a quo for said purpose.<br><br><div align="justify">SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></div></blockquote>At the outset, the CA noted that the RTC summary judgment was a proper subject of an appeal because it was a final adjudication on the merits of the case, having completely disposed of all the issues except as to the amount of damages. The CA concluded that respondents properly availed of a motion for new trial because such remedy could be availed of at any time after the appeal from the lower court had been perfected and before the CA loses jurisdiction over the case. According to the CA, respondents were able to show that they obtained the new evidence only after the trial of the case and after the summary judgment had been rendered. The CA also held that respondents never admitted during the pre-trial the existence of Cadastral Case No. 10; they only admitted the existence of the Order dated June 30, 1989 in Cadastral Case No. 10.<br><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">On July 16, 2007, the CA denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br></div><div align="justify">Petitioners subsequently filed this petition for review on certiorari, raising the following issues:<br></div><blockquote><center>A.<br></center><br><div align="justify">WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN RULING THAT THE QUESTIONED DECISION OF THE RTC IS A PROPER SUBJECT OF AN APPEAL AND A MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL UNDER RULE 53 OF THE RULES OF COURT.<br><br></div><center>B.<br></center><br><div align="justify">WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FAILING TO RULE THAT A MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL IS AN IMPROPER REMEDY TO QUESTION ADMITTED FACTS.<br><br></div><center>C.<br></center><br><div align="justify">WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FAILING TO RULE THAT NO NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE WAS ADDUCED TO WARRANT A NEW TRIAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Petitioners posit that no appeal could be taken from the trial court’s decision because it did not completely dispose of all the issues in the case; it failed to settle the issue on damages. Petitioners categorize the decision as a partial summary judgment, which in <i>Guevarra, et al. v. Hon. Court of Appeals, et al.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; reiterated in <i>GSIS v. Philippine Village Hotel, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; the Court pronounced as not a final and an appealable judgment, hence, interlocutory and clearly an improper subject of an appeal. Petitioners theorize then that the appeal could not have been perfected and the CA could not have acquired jurisdiction over the case, including the motion for new trial. Accordingly, they conclude that the motion for new trial should have been denied outright for being violative of Section 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30] </sup>Rule 53 of the Rules of Court, which provides that the motion for new trial may be filed after the appeal has been perfected. Petitioners argue that, pursuant to Section 4, Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, trial should proceed instead to settle the issue on damages.&nbsp; Petitioners point out that the case cited by the CA in its Decision, <i>Bell Carpets International Trading Corporation v. Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> is not applicable to the case because, unlike in the present case, the trial court’s ruling completely disposed of all the issues in that case.<br><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">In addition, petitioners insist that respondents already admitted the existence of Cadastral Case No. 10 by its admission of the existence of the Order dated June 30, 1989. They maintain that respondents cannot admit the existence of an order and yet deny the existence of the proceedings from which the order emanates. Respondents’ judicial admission that the court Order existed necessarily carried with it the admission that the cadastral proceedings where the Order was issued likewise existed. Petitioners aver that respondents are bound by their judicial admission and they cannot be allowed to present evidence to contradict the same.<br><br></div><div align="justify">Petitioners next argue that the purported newly discovered pieces of evidence have no probative value. Petitioners say that the certifications are self-serving and inconclusive opinions of court employees, who did not even indicate the period when they occupied their positions and state whether they had the authority to issue such certifications and whether they had personal knowledge of the documents archived during the year that the deed of sale was executed. According to petitioners, the certifications cannot overcome the presumption of regularity in the issuance of the Order dated June 30, 1989. At most, the certifications would simply show that the records of Cadastral Case No. 10 could no longer be found in the records; hence, they would have no bearing on the result of the case.<br><br></div><div align="justify">Petitioners also emphasize that respondents failed to meet the burden of proving that the newly discovered pieces of evidence presented comply with the requisites to justify the holding of a new trial. They contend that respondents could have discovered and presented in court the certifications during trial had they exercised reasonable diligence. <br><br>Petitioners’ arguments are untenable.<br><br></div><div align="justify">The issue of whether the RTC judgment is a final judgment is indeed crucial. If the judgment were not final, it would be an improper subject of an appeal. Hence, no appeal would have been perfected before the CA, and the latter would not have acquired jurisdiction over the entire case, including the motion for new trial. But more importantly, only a final judgment or order, as opposed to an interlocutory order, may be the subject of a motion for new trial.<br><br></div><div align="justify">A final judgment or order is one that finally disposes of a case, leaving nothing more for the court to do in respect thereto, such as an adjudication on the merits which, on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial, declares categorically what the rights and obligations of the parties are and which party is in the right, or a judgment or order that dismisses an action on the ground of <i>res judicata</i> or prescription, for instance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Just like any other judgment, a summary judgment that satisfies the requirements of a final judgment will be considered as such.<br><br></div><div align="justify">A summary judgment is granted to settle expeditiously a case if, on motion of either party, there appears from the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits that no important issues of fact are involved, <i>except the amount of damages.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The RTC judgment in this case fully determined the rights and obligations of the parties relative to the case for quieting of title and left no other issue unresolved, except the amount of damages. Hence, it is a final judgment.<br><br></div><div align="justify">In leaving out the determination of the amount of damages, the RTC did not remove its summary judgment from the category of final judgments. In fact, under Section 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup>Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, a summary judgment may not be rendered on the amount of damages, although such judgment may be rendered on the issue of the right to damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br></div><div align="justify">In <i>Jugador v. De Vera,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36] </sup>the Court distinguished between the determination of the amount of damages and the issue of the right to damages itself in case of a summary judgment. The Court elucidated on this point, thus:<br></div><blockquote>[A] summary judgment may be rendered except as to the amount of damages. In other words, such judgment may be entered on the issue relating to the existence of the right to damages. Chief Justice Moran pertinently observes that "if there is any real issue as to the amount of damages, the c[o]urt, after rendering summary judgment, may proceed to assess the amount recoverable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>It is therefore reasonable to distinguish the present case from <i>GSIS v. Philippine Village Hotel, Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38] </sup>In that case, the summary judgment specifically stated that "[t]rial on the issu[e] of damages shall resume." Evidently, there remained an unresolved issue on the right to damages. Here, the trial court, in stating that "except as to the amount of damages, a summary judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants," had, in&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; resolved&nbsp; all&nbsp; issues, including&nbsp; the right to&nbsp; damages in favor of the plaintiffs (petitioners). What remained undetermined was only the amount of damages.<br><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">On the issue of whether respondents are proscribed from presenting evidence that would disprove the existence of Cadastral Case No. 10, we likewise sustain the CA.<br><br></div><div align="justify">A judicial admission is an admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, which dispenses with the need for proof with respect to the matter or fact admitted.&nbsp; It may be contradicted only by a showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br></div><div align="justify">During the pre-trial, respondents categorically admitted the existence of the Order dated June 30, 1989 only. The Court cannot extend such admission to the existence of Cadastral Case No. 10, considering the circumstances under which the admission was made. In construing an admission, the court should consider the purpose for which the admission is used and the surrounding circumstances and statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Respondents have constantly insisted that, in making the admission, they relied in good faith on the veracity of the Order which was presented by petitioners. Moreover, they relied on the presumption that the Order has been issued by Judge Enrique T. Jocson in the regular performance of his duties. It would therefore be prejudicial and unfair to respondents if they would be prevented from proving that the Order is in fact spurious by showing that there was no Cadastral Case No. 10 before the RTC, Branch 47, of Bacolod City.<br><br></div><div align="justify">Finally, we find that a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is warranted.&nbsp; New trial is a remedy that seeks to "temper the severity of a judgment or prevent the failure of justice." Thus, the Rules allows the courts to grant a new trial when there are errors of law or irregularities prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused committed during the trial, or when there exists newly discovered evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The grant or denial of a new trial is, generally speaking, addressed to the sound discretion of the court which cannot be interfered with unless a clear abuse thereof is shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br></div><div align="justify">This Court has repeatedly held that before a new trial may be granted on the ground of newly discovered evidence, it must be shown (1) that the evidence was discovered after trial; (2) that such evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; (3) that it is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative, or impeaching; and (4) the evidence is of such weight that it would probably change the judgment if admitted. If the alleged newly discovered evidence could have been very well presented during the trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the same cannot be considered newly discovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br></div><div align="justify">The only contentious element in the case is whether the evidence could have been discovered with the exercise of reasonable diligence.&nbsp; In <i>Custodio v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court expounded on the due diligence requirement, thus:<br></div><div align="justify"></div><blockquote>The threshold question in resolving a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence is whether the [proffered] evidence is in fact a "newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by due diligence." The question of whether evidence is newly discovered has two aspects:&nbsp; a temporal one, i.e., when was the evidence discovered, and a predictive one, i.e., when should or could it have been discovered.&nbsp; It is to the latter that the requirement of due diligence has relevance. We have held that in order that a particular piece of evidence may be properly regarded as newly discovered to justify new trial, what is essential is not so much the time when the evidence offered first sprang into existence nor the time when it first came to the knowledge of the party now submitting it; what is essential is that the offering party had exercised reasonable diligence in seeking to locate such evidence before or during trial but had nonetheless failed to secure it.<br><br><div align="justify">The Rules do not give an exact definition of due diligence, and whether the movant has exercised due diligence depends upon the particular circumstances of each case. Nonetheless, it has been observed that the phrase is often equated with "reasonable promptness to avoid prejudice to the defendant." In other words, the concept of due diligence has both a time component and a good faith component.&nbsp; The movant for a new trial must not only act in a timely fashion in gathering evidence in support of the motion; he must act reasonably and in good faith as well. Due diligence contemplates that the defendant acts reasonably and in good faith to obtain the evidence, in light of the totality of the circumstances and the facts known to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></div></blockquote>As previously stated, respondents relied in good faith on the veracity of the Order dated June 30, 1989 which petitioners presented in court. It was only practical for them to do so, if only to expedite the proceedings. Given this circumstance, we hold that respondents exercised reasonable diligence in obtaining the evidence. The certifications therefore qualify as newly discovered evidence.<br><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify">The question of whether the certifications presented by respondents have any probative value is left to the judgment and discretion of the trial court which will be hearing the case anew.<br><br></div><div align="justify"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
