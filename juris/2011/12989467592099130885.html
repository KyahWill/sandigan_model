Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented the following witnesses: Nimfa Celiz (Nimfa), Jepson Dichaves (Jepson), Police Superintendent Gilbert Cruz (P/Supt. Cruz), Police Superintendent Mario Chan (P/Supt. Chan), Police Inspector Cesar Escandor (P/Insp. Escandor) and Carolina Alejo, whose version of facts are summarized as follows:<br><br>At around 10:30 a.m. on 20 December 1993, Nimfa and her wards, siblings Jeson Kevin and Jeson Kirby Dichaves were riding in the Isuzu car of the Dichaves family, together with Yusan Dichaves (Yusan). Driver Pepito Acon (Acon) dropped off Yusan at Metrobank in Claro M. Recto Avenue, Manila.&nbsp; While waiting for Yusan, Acon drove along Bilibid Viejo, Sampaloc.&nbsp; When the vehicle passed by in front of San Sebastian Church, a stainless jeep with two men and one woman described as a <i>tomboy</i> on board, suddenly blocked its way.&nbsp; One of the men, who was in police uniform accosted Acon and accused him of hitting the son of a Presidential Security Group (PSG) General apparently with a stone when the vehicle ran over it. Acon denied the charges but he was transferred to the stainless jeep while the man in police uniform drove the Isuzu car.&nbsp; The <i>tomboy</i> sat next to Nimfa who then had Jeson Kirby sit on her lap while Jeson Kevin was sitting on the <i>tomboy</i>'s lap.&nbsp; They were brought to a house in Merville Subdivision, Para√±aque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>While still in garage of the house, Nimfa was able to sneak out of the car and place a call to the secretary of her employer to inform the latter that they were in Merville Subdivision. She came back to the car undetected and after a while, she and her wards were asked to alight from the car and they were locked inside the comfort room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Jepson was at his office at 10:00 a.m. of 20 December 1993.&nbsp; He received a call from his wife asking him if Nimfa or Acon called up, as she had been waiting for them at Metrobank where she was dropped off earlier.&nbsp; After 15 minutes, Yusan called again and was already hysterical because she could not find the car when she roamed around the area. Jepson immediately called up his brother Jaime and some police officers to inform them that his sons were missing. When Jepson arrived at Metrobank at around 11:30 a.m., he received a call from his secretary informing him that Nimfa called about their whereabouts.&nbsp; When Jepson got back to his office, his secretary informed him that an unidentified man called to inform them that he has custody of the children and demanded P26 Million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile in Merville Subdivision, the man in police uniform introduced himself to Nimfa as Sarge.&nbsp; He asked Nimfa for information regarding her name and her employer's telephone number. She feigned ignorance of those information.&nbsp; She even claimed that she was merely a new employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Sarge informed Nimfa that they were in Fairview and that she was asked if she knew how to go home.&nbsp; Nimfa chose to stay with her wards.&nbsp; When the phone rang, Sarge went out of the house and Nimfa again sneaked a phone call to her employer informing them that they were being held up in Merville Subdivision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Jepson, through Jaime's help, went to the house of then Vice-President Joseph Estrada (Vice-President Estrada) at 8:00 p.m.&nbsp; Thereat, he met General Jewel Canson (Gen. Canson), General Panfilo Lacson (Gen. Lacson) and Major Ray Aquino (Major Aquino).&nbsp; Vice-President Estrada ordered the police generals to rescue Jepson's sons and arrest the kidnappers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>At 6:00 p.m., the kidnappers called Jepson and reduced the ransom to P10 Million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; That night, Nimfa was able to speak to Jepson when two men handed the telephone to her. She recognized one of them as appellant, because she had seen the latter in her employer's office sometime in the first week of December 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On the following noon of 21 December 1993, the kidnappers called up Jepson numerous times to negotiate for the ransom.&nbsp; In one of those calls, Jepson was able to recognize the voice of appellant because he had several business transactions with the latter and they have talked for at least a hundred times during a span of two to four years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On 22 December 1993, the parties finally agreed to a ransom of P1.5 Million.&nbsp; Jepson offered P1.3 Million in cash and the balance to be paid in kind, such as jewelry and a pistol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Appellant asked Jepson to bring the ransom alone at Pancake House in Magallanes Commercial Center.&nbsp; Jepson called up Gen. Canson and Gen. Lacson to inform them of the pay-off.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>At around 1:00 p.m. of even date, Nimfa was able to talk to Jepson and the latter informed her that they would be released that afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> At 3:00 p.m., Jepson drove his white Toyota Corolla car and proceeded to Pancake House in Magallanes Commercial Center.&nbsp; He placed the money inside a gray bag and put it on the backseat. Jepson received a call from appellant at 4:00 p.m. who ordered him to put the bag in the trunk, leave the trunk unlocked, and walk away for ten (10) minutes without turning back.&nbsp; Later, appellant checked on his trunk and the bag was already gone.&nbsp; Appellant then apprised him that his sons and helper were already at the Shell Gasoline Station along South Luzon Expressway.&nbsp; He immediately went to the place and found his sons and helper seated at the corner of the gas station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>P/Insp. Escandor was assigned to proceed to Magallanes Commercial Center, together with two other police officers.&nbsp; They reached the place at 3:30 p.m. and positioned themselves in front of the Maranao Arcade located at Magallanes Commercial Center.&nbsp; He brought a camera to cover the supposed pay-off.&nbsp; He took a total of 24 shots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; He identified Macias together with appellant in Magallanes Commercial Center and the latter as the one who took the ransom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>P/Supt. Chan was one of the team leaders dispatched also at Magallanes Commercial Center in Makati on 22 December 1993 to take a video coverage on the supposed pay-off.&nbsp; He witnessed the pay-off and identified appellant as the one who took the bag containing the ransom money from the car trunk of Jepson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>P/Supt. Cruz is assigned to the now defunct Presidential Anti-Crime Commission Task Force Habagat and one of the team leaders of Special Project Task Force organized on 22 December 1993 with the primary task of apprehending the kidnappers of Dichaves' children and helper.&nbsp; His group was assigned at Fort Bonifacio to await instructions from the overall Field Command Officer Gen. Lacson.&nbsp; They had been waiting from 4:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. when they received information that the kidnap victims were released unharmed.&nbsp; They were further asked to maintain their position in Fort Bonifacio. At around 7:45 p.m., they heard on their radio that the suspect's vehicle, a red Nissan Sentra was heading in their direction.&nbsp; A few minutes later, they saw the red car and tailed it until it reached Dasmari√±as Village in Makati.&nbsp; They continuously followed the car inside the village.&nbsp; When said car slowed down, they blocked it and immediately approached the vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>They introduced themselves as police officers and accosted the suspect, who turned out to be appellant. Appellant suddenly pulled a .38 caliber revolver and a scuffle took place.&nbsp; They managed to subdue appellant and handcuffed him.&nbsp; Appellant was requested to open the compartment and a gray bag was found inside.&nbsp; P/Supt. Cruz saw money, jewelry and a gun inside the bag. Appellant was then brought to Camp Crame for questioning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>At 8:00 p.m., Jepson received a call from Gen. Lacson asking him to go to Camp Crame.&nbsp; He and Nimfa went to Camp Crame where he saw appellant alone in the office of Gen. Canson.&nbsp; He then saw the bag containing the ransom money, pieces of jewelry and his gun on the table.&nbsp; Photographs were taken and Jepson was asked to identify them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>A written inventory was prepared on the contents of the bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; It was found out that a portion of the ransom money was missing.&nbsp; It was then that appellant revealed that the missing money was in the possession of Macias.&nbsp; Appellant accompanied P/Supt. Cruz and his team to the residence of Macias in Camp Aguinaldo.&nbsp; P/Supt. Cruz waited for Macias until 4:00 a.m. on the following day and placed him under arrest.&nbsp; Macias was asked where the rest of the ransom money was and Macias went inside the house and retrieved a red bag inside a small cabinet.&nbsp; P/Supt. Cruz prepared a receipt of the seized property from Macias. Macias placed his signature on the receipt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Carolina Alejo was the owner of the house in Merville Subdivision where the kidnap victims were detained.&nbsp; She stated that she leased the house to appellant.&nbsp; On 23 December 1993, it came to her knowledge that said house was used in the kidnapping.&nbsp; She noticed that the lock of the comfort room was reversed so that it could only be locked from the outside.&nbsp; She considered this unusual because she personally caused the door knob to be installed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The defense, on its part, presented appellant, Florinda Sese Barcelona (Ms. Sese), Dr. Jaime Leal (Dr. Leal), and retired Colonel Ramon Navarro (Col. Navarro).<br><br>Appellant testified that he came to know Jepson when he was introduced to him by Col. Navarro in 1989 as the importer of police equipment and accessories.&nbsp; Jepson wanted to buy revolving lights, police sirens and paging system.&nbsp; Through Navarro, appellant also met Macias who was then selling his security agency in July 1993.&nbsp; He admitted that Jepson had been lending him money since 1990 and his total borrowings amounted to P8.5 Million in December 1993.&nbsp; Appellant also knew Nimfa since 1990 and had met her five (5) times in the office of Jepson where Nimfa usually served him coffee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In December 1993, he rented a house in Merville Subdivision for his mother.&nbsp; He was given the key to the house in 15 December 1993 but he denied going to said place on 20, 21, 22, 23 of December 1993.<br><br>At 3:00 p.m. of 20 December 1993, he received a call from Jepson asking for P1 Million, as partial payment of his loan.&nbsp; Jepson informed appellant that his sons were kidnapped and he requested appellant to negotiate with the kidnappers for the release of his children.&nbsp; Out of pity, appellant agreed.&nbsp; He actively participated in the negotiations between 20 to 22 of December 1993, where he successfully negotiated a lower ransom of P1.5 Million.<br><br>On 11:30 a.m. of 22 December 1993, Jepson again requested appellant to deliver the ransom money to the kidnappers.&nbsp; Appellant acceded to the request.&nbsp; He asked Macias, who was in his office that day, to accompany him.&nbsp; The kidnappers asked appellant to proceed to the Makati area and wait for further instructions.&nbsp; Appellant called up Jepson who told him that he would deliver the money to appellant once instructions were given by the kidnappers. The kidnappers finally called and asked appellant to proceed to Shell Gasoline Station-Magallanes.&nbsp; He informed Jepson of this fact and the latter asked appellant to meet him in Magallanes Commercial Center where he would just put the money inside the car trunk and leave it unlocked.&nbsp; Appellant took the money from Jepson's car and put it inside his car trunk and proceeded to Shell Gasoline station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Appellant and Macias did not see the kidnappers and Jepson's children at the station.&nbsp; He tried calling Jepson but failed to communicate with him.&nbsp; They then decided to go back to the office in Cubao, Quezon City. At 7:00 p.m., he received a call from the kidnappers who were cursing him because they apparently went to the Shell Gasoline Station and noticed that there were many policemen stationed in the area, which prompted them to release the victims.&nbsp; Appellant left his office at around 7:20 p.m. to go home in Dasmari√±as Village, Makati.&nbsp; When he was about ten (10) meters away from the gate of his house, a car blocked his path. He saw P/Supt. Cruz, a certain Lt. Rodica and two other men alight from the car and were heavily armed.&nbsp; They pulled him out of the car and hit him with their firearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Ms. Sese was at the office of appellant on 22 December 1993 when she was told by the secretary, who appeared shaken, that a caller was looking for appellant.&nbsp; She saw appellant arrive at the office with Macias.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Dr. Leal, the medico-legal officer at Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, presented the medico-legal certificate of appellant and testified that the injuries of appellant could have been sustained during the scuffle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Col. Navarro introduced appellant to Jepson.&nbsp; He was privy to the loan transactions between appellant and Jepson where the former asked loans from the latter.&nbsp; He even served as guarantor of some of the obligations of appellant.&nbsp; When the checks issued by appellant were dishonored by the bank, Jepson filed a case against Navarro for violation of <i>Batas Pambansa</i> <i>Blg</i>. 22, wherein the latter was eventually acquitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>While the criminal cases were undergoing trial, Macias died.&nbsp; Consequently, his criminal liability is totally extinguished under Article 89, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On 30 August 2002, the RTC rendered judgment finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping for ransom.&nbsp; The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered herein accused Ernesto Ramos Uyboco is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom penalized by Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 1084.&nbsp; He is hereby ordered to suffer the prison term of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for three (3) counts together with the accessory penalties provided by law.&nbsp; He should pay private complainant Jepson Dichaves the amount of P150,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>The above-described .45 Caliber Colt Pistol and 12-gauge Remington shotgun as well as the Nissan Sentra 4-Door Sedan are hereby confiscated in favor of the government.<br><br>The Warden of Metro Manila Rehabilitation Center, Camp Ricardo R.

Mateo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this Court in a Resolution dated 6 September 2004, referred the case to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On 27 September 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed <i>in toto </i>the Decision of the RTC, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the August 30, 2002 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, national Capital Judicial Region, Br. 18, Manila, in Criminal Cases Nos. 93-130980, 93-132606, and 93-132607, in convicting Ernesto Uyboco of three (3) counts of Kidnapping for Ransom is hereby AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>.

Escandor testified that at around 4:00 p.m., he saw Macias and appellant at Magallanes Commercial Center. Second, Nimfa could not properly identify the number of kidnappers.&nbsp; Third, Nimfa failed to state in her affidavit and during the direct examination that Sarge had a gun, but later on cross-examination, she intimated that Sarge had a gun.&nbsp; Fourth, it was incredible that Nimfa was able to identify the route taken by the kidnappers to the safe house because she was not allegedly blindfolded.&nbsp; Fifth, it was strange for Nimfa to say that two persons, Macias and appellant, were holding the receiver and the dialing mechanism whenever they hand the phone to her.&nbsp; Sixth, it was impossible for Nimfa to have access to an operational telephone while in captivity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals correctly dismissed these inconsistencies as immaterial, in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>The purported inconsistencies and discrepancies involve estimations of time or number; hence, the reference thereto would understandably vary.&nbsp; The rule is that inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses on minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration, their veracity or the weight of their testimonies.&nbsp; The inconsistencies and discrepancies of the testimonies, in the case at bar, are not of such nature as would warrant the reversal of the decision appealed from.&nbsp; On the contrary, such trivial inconsistencies strengthen, rather than diminish, Celiz' testimony as they erase suspicion that the same was rehearsed.<br><br>The fact that Uyboco and his companions neither donned masks to hide their faces nor blindfolded or tied up their victims goes to show their brazenness in perpetrating the crime.&nbsp; Besides, familiarity with the victims or their families has never rendered the commission of the crime improbable, but has in fact at times even facilitated its commission.&nbsp; Moreover, the fact that there was a usable phone in the house where Celiz and the kids were held captive only proves that, in this real world, mistakes or blunders are made and there is no such thing as a perfect crime.&nbsp; On a different view, it may even be posited that the incredible happenings narrated by Celiz only highlights the brilliance of Uyboco and his companions. Verily, in committing the crime of kidnapping with ransom, they adopted and pursued unfamiliar strategies to confuse the police authorities, the victim, and the family of the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant then zeroes in on Jepson and accuses him of lying under oath when he claimed that appellant owed him only P2.3 Million when in fact, appellant owed him P8.5 Million.&nbsp; Appellant charges Jepson of downplaying his closeness to him when in fact they had several business deals and Jepson would address appellant as "Ernie."&nbsp; Moreover, it was unbelievable for Jepson to be able to identify with utmost certainty that the kidnapper he was supposedly talking to was appellant.&nbsp; Finally, appellant claims that Jepson's motive to maliciously impute a false kidnapping charge against him boils down to money.&nbsp; Among the businesses that Jepson owns was along the same line of business as that of appellant, which is the supply of police equipment to the PNP. To eliminate competition and possibly procure all contracts from the PNP and considering his brother's close association to then Vice-President Estrada, Jepson crafted and executed a frame up of appellant.<br><br>And the Court of Appeals had this to say:<br><br><blockquote>For one, the strategy used, which is the use of unconventional or not so commonly used strategy, to apprehend the kidnappers of Celiz and the Dichaves' children is, by reason of their special knowledge and expertise, the police operatives' call or prerogative.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the absence of any evidence that said agents falsely testified against Uyboco, We shall presume regularity in their performance of official duties and disregard Uyboco's unsubstantiated claim that he was framed up.<br><br>Secondly, matters of presentation of witnesses by the prosecution and the determination of which evidence to present are not for Uyboco or even the trial court to decide, but the same rests upon the prosecution.&nbsp; This is so since Section 5, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court expressly vests in the prosecution the direction and control over the prosecution of a case. As the prosecution had other witnesses who it believes could sufficiently prove the case against Uyboco, its non-presentation of other witnesses cannot be taken against the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Time and again, this court has invariably viewed the defense of frame-up with disfavor.

He belittles the efforts of the police officers who participated in the operation. Appellant claims that despite knowledge of the place of alleged detention, the police did not try to rescue the kidnap victims.&nbsp; Appellant also notes that while P/Supt. Chan denies installing any listening device to record the conversations of the kidnappers and Jepson, the interview made by a reporter for a television network shows that Major Aquino admitted to taped conversations of appellant's alleged negotiations for the ransom with Jepson.&nbsp; Appellant insists that these taped conversations do exist.<br><br>Appellant cannot rely on a vague mention of an interview, if it indeed exists, to discredit the testimony of P/Supt. Chan.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is appellant failed to prove the existence of the alleged taped conversations.&nbsp; The matters of failure of the police officer to properly document the alleged pay-off, the non-production of the master copy of the video tape, and the chain of custody supposedly broken are not semblance of neglect so as to debunk the presumption of regularity. In the absence of proof of motive on the part of the police officers to falsely ascribe a serious crime against the accused, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, as well as the trial court's assessment on the credibility of the apprehending officers, shall prevail over the accused's self-serving and uncorroborated claim of frame-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Appellant then questions the validity of his arrest and the search conducted inside his car in absence of a warrant.&nbsp; The arrest was validly executed pursuant to Section 5, paragraph (b) of Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp; Arrest without warrant; when lawful. -- A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: (a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense; <b>(b) When an offense has in fact been committed and he has personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested has committed it;</b> and, (c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.

Such knowledge was then relayed to the other police officers stationed in Fort Bonifacio where appellant was expected to pass by.<br><br>Personal knowledge of facts must be based on probable cause, which means an actual belief or reasonable grounds of suspicion.&nbsp; The grounds of suspicion are reasonable when, in the absence of actual belief of the arresting officers, the suspicion that the person to be arrested is probably guilty of committing the offense is based on actual facts, <i>i.e.</i>, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to create the probable cause of guilt of the person to be arrested.&nbsp; A reasonable suspicion, therefore, must be founded on probable cause, coupled with good faith on the part of the peace officers making the arrest.&nbsp; Section 5, Rule 113 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure does not require the arresting officers to personally witness the commission of the offense with their own eyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It is sufficient for the arresting team that they were monitoring the pay-off for a number of hours long enough for them to be informed that it was indeed appellant, who was the kidnapper.&nbsp; This is equivalent to personal knowledge based on probable cause.<br><br>Likewise, the search conducted inside the car of appellant was legal because the latter consented to such search as testified by P/Supt. Cruz.&nbsp; Even assuming that appellant did not give his consent for the police to search the car, they can still validly do so by virtue of a search incident to a lawful arrest under Section 13, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 13.
