showing payment of the same.  However, they opted not to lift a finger, giving an impression that they never paid said benefits.<br><br>As to the award of attorney's fees, the NLRC found the same to be proper because respondents were forced to litigate in order to validate their claim.<br><br>The NLRC thus affirmed the Decision of the Labor Arbiter, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly,

grounds:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br><center>I.<br></center><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred and committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the reinstatement of respondents to their former positions which were no longer existing because its findings of facts are premised on misappreciation of facts.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The Honorable Court of

in the absence of counsel on record to handle and prosecute the case.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals also seriously erred and gravely abused its discretion in holding individual petitioner solidarily liable with petitioner company without specific evidence on which the same was based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioners' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioners contend that, contrary to their allegations, respondents were never dismissed from the service.  If respondents find themselves no longer in the service of petitioners, it is simply because of their refusal to report for work.  Further, granting that they were dismissed, respondents' prolonged absences is tantamount to abandonment which is a valid ground for the termination of their employment.  As to respondents monetary claims, it is incumbent upon them to prove the same because the burden of proof rests on their shoulders.  But since respondents failed to prove the same, their claims should be denied.<br><br><b><i>Respondents' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondents, in support of their claim that they were illegally dismissed, argue that as painters, they performed activities which were necessary and desirable in the usual business of petitioners, who are engaged in the business of contracting painting jobs.  Hence, they are regular employees who, under the law, cannot just be dismissed from the service without prior notice and without any just or valid cause.  According to the respondents, they did not abandon their job.  For abandonment to serve as basis for a valid termination of their employment, it must first be established that there was a deliberate and unjustified refusal on their part to resume work.  Mere absences are not sufficient for these must be accompanied by overt acts pointing to the fact that they simply do not want to work anymore.  Petitioners failed to prove this.  Furthermore, the filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal ably defeats the theory of abandonment of the job.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>"[T]his Court is not unmindful of the rule that in cases of illegal dismissal, the employer bears the burden of proof to prove that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> But "[b]efore the [petitioners] must bear the burden of proving that the dismissal was legal, [the respondents] must first establish by substantial evidence" that indeed they were dismissed.  "[I]f there is no dismissal, then there can be no question as to the legality or illegality thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><i>There was no dismissal in this case,<br>hence, there is no question that can be<br>entertained regarding its legality or<br>illegality.</i><br><br>As found by the Labor Arbiter, there was no evidence that respondents were dismissed nor were they prevented from returning to their work.  It was only respondents' unsubstantiated conclusion that they were dismissed.  As a matter of fact, respondents could not name the particular person who effected their dismissal and under what particular circumstances.<br><br>In <i>Machica v. Roosevelt Services Center, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court sustained the employer's denial as against the employees' categorical assertion of illegal dismissal.  In so ruling, this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>The rule is that one who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it; thus, petitioners were burdened to prove their allegation that respondents dismissed them from their employment. It must be stressed that the evidence to prove this fact must be clear, positive and convincing. The rule that the employer bears the burden of proof in illegal dismissal cases finds no application here because the respondents deny having dismissed the petitioners.<br></blockquote><br>In this case, petitioners were able to show that they never dismissed respondents.  As to the case of Fernando, Miguel and Ferdinand, it was shown that on November 25, 2000, at around 7:30 a.m., the petitioners' foreman, Wenifredo Lalap (Wenifredo) caught the three still eating when they were supposed to be working already.  Wenifredo reprimanded them and, apparently, they resented it so they no longer reported for work.  In the case of Gregorio, he absented himself from work on September 15, 2000 to apply as a painter with SAEI-EEI, the general contractor of Pacific Plaza Towers.  Since then he never reported back to work.  Lastly, in the case of Guillermo, he absented himself without leave on November 27, 2000, and so he was reprimanded when he reported for work the following day.  Because of the reprimand, he did not report for work anymore.<br><br>Hence, as between respondents' general allegation of having been orally dismissed from the service vis-a-vis those of petitioners which were found to be substantiated by the sworn statement of foreman Wenifredo, we are persuaded by the latter.  Absent any showing of an overt or positive act proving that petitioners had dismissed respondents, the latters' claim of illegal dismissal cannot be sustained.  Indeed, a cursory examination of the records reveal no illegal dismissal to speak of.<br><br><i>There was also no abandonment of work<br>on the part of the respondents.</i><br><br>The Labor Arbiter is also correct in ruling that there was no abandonment on the part of respondents that would justify their dismissal from their employment.<br><br>It is a settled rule that "[m]ere absence or failure to report for work x x x is not enough to amount to abandonment of work."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> "Abandonment is the deliberate and unjustified refusal of an employee to resume his employment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In <i>Northwest Tourism Corporation v. Former Special 3<sup>rd</sup> Division of the Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><i> </i>this Court held that "[t]o constitute abandonment of work, two elements must concur, [namely]:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the employee must have failed to report for work or must have been absent without valid or justifiable reason; and<br><br>(2) there must have been a clear intention on the part of the employee to sever the employer-employee relationship manifested by some overt act."<br></blockquote><br>"It is the employer who has the burden of proof to show a deliberate and unjustified refusal of the employee to resume his employment without any intention of returning."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  It is therefore incumbent upon petitioners to ascertain the respondents' interest or non-interest in the continuance of their employment.  However, petitioners failed to do so.<br><br><i>Respondents must be reinstated and paid<br>their holiday pay, service incentive leave<br>pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.</i><br><br>Clearly therefore, there was no dismissal, much less illegal, and there was also no abandonment of job to speak of.  The Labor Arbiter is therefore correct in ordering that respondents be reinstated but without any backwages.<br><br>However, petitioners are of the position that the reinstatement of respondents to their former positions, which were no longer existing, is impossible, highly unfair and unjust.  The project was already completed by petitioners on September 28, 2001.  Thus the completion of the project left them with no more work to do.  Having completed their tasks, their positions automatically ceased to exist.  Consequently, there were no more positions where they can be reinstated as painters.<br><br>Petitioners are misguided. They forgot that there are two types of employees in the construction industry. The first is referred to as project employees or those employed in connection with a particular construction project or phase thereof and such employment is coterminous with each project or phase of the project to which they are assigned.  The second is known as non-project employees or those employed without reference to any particular construction project or phase of a project.<br><br>The second category is where respondents are classified.  As such they are regular employees of petitioners.  It is clear from the records of the case that when one project is completed, respondents were automatically transferred to the next project awarded to petitioners. There was no employment agreement given to respondents which clearly spelled out the duration of their employment, the specific work to be performed and that such is made clear to them at the time of hiring. It is now too late for petitioners to claim that respondents are project employees whose employment is coterminous with each project or phase of the project to which they are assigned.<br><br>Nonetheless, assuming that respondents were initially hired as project employees, petitioners must be reminded of our ruling in <i>Maraguinot, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that "[a] project employee x x x may acquire the status of a regular employee when the following [factors] concur:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>There is a continuous rehiring of project employees even after cessation of a project; and</li><li>The tasks performed by the alleged "project employee" are vital, necessary and indespensable to the usual business or trade of the employer."<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>In this case, the evidence on record shows that respondents were employed and assigned continuously to the various projects of petitioners.  As painters, they performed activities which were necessary and desirable in the usual business of petitioners, who are engaged in subcontracting jobs for painting of residential units, condominium and commercial buildings. As regular employees, respondents are entitled to be reinstated without loss of seniority rights.<br><br>Respondents are also entitled to their money claims such as the payment of holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.  Petitioners as the employer of respondents and having complete control over the records of the company could have easily rebutted the monetary claims against it.  All that they had to do was to present the vouchers or payrolls showing payment of the same.  However, they decided not to provide the said documentary evidence.  Our conclusion therefore is that they never paid said benefits and therefore they must be ordered to settle their obligation with the respondents.<br><br><i>Respondents are also entitled to the<br>payment of attorney's fees.</i><br><br>Even though respondents were not represented by counsel in most of the stages of the proceedings of this case, the award of attorney's fees as ruled by the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC and the CA to the respondents is still proper.  In <i>Rutaquio v. National Labor Relations Commission,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>It is settled that in actions for recovery of wages or where an employee was forced to litigate and, thus, incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, the award of attorney's fees is legally and morally justifiable.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><i> </i>this Court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>Attorney's fees may be awarded when a party is compelled to litigate or to incur expenses to protect his interest by reason of an unjustified act of the other party.</blockquote><br>In this case, respondents filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with claim for payment of their holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.  The Labor Arbiter, the NLRC and the CA were one in ruling that petitioners did not pay the respondents their holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay as mandated by law.  For sure, this unjustified act of petitioners had compelled the respondents to institute an action primarily to protect their righ
