Ana verbally communicated to him that there were no pending cases against the Indians, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> he asked Navata and Caronongan to prepare the Order.<br><br>Petitioner disclaimed knowledge that the Indians were already charged before the RTC of Las Piñas, Prosecutor Lugtu never having communicated to him that he had, on July 28, 1994, filed a charge against the Indians before the RTC of Las Piñas City. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He <i>admitted, however, being aware</i> that the Indians had been undergoing preliminary investigation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Corroborating petitioner, <u>Caronongan</u> declared that petitioner instructed him on August 10, 1994 to conduct a record check of the Indians; that he referred the matter to Sta. Ana who informed him that the Indians had “no criminal records”; and that when he and Sta. Ana met with petitioner the next day, August 11, 1994, petitioner directed him to prepare the necessary order for the deportation of the Indians. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Caronongan clarified that the BID only maintains “derogatory records” of aliens in its watch list, black list or hold departure list, but not criminal or administrative records. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Albeit he admitted being aware that the Indians were apprehended by the NBI for the manufacture of illegal drugs, he took Sta.

Ana, who was tasked with obtaining and keeping information about aliens in the country.&nbsp; This is quite uncanny because as head of the agency, he should have exercised his responsibility of coursing valuable information to the Intelligence Service in order that records of the Bureau would be updated.&nbsp; Instead, he merely contented himself with going through the motions of having Mr. Sta. Ana assure him verbally that they had no derogatory record, when requests for self-deportation were filed with the BID.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Granting, however, that the eleven Indians had no derogatory record, as the phrase is understood within the BID to mean any violation of immigration laws, undesirability, term of residency or permission to work of an alien, the Self-Deportation Order should have specifically mentioned that fact, because that was in essence Mr. Sta. Ana’s report, instead of phrasing it in an extenuating statement that the records of the Bureau did not indicate any written complaint filed against them with any government agency.&nbsp; For obvious reasons, <i><b>having no derogatory record and having no written complaint filed</b></i> refer to two different things. x x x x (emphasis and italics supplied)<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>True, it is the filing in court of a case that may bar deportation, based on Memorandum Order No. 02-94 of the BID and as argued by Commissioner Respicio, but the tenacity of his argument pales in the light of his statement in his 4th Indorsement that a complaint charging a crime shall be referred to the proper Fiscal’s Office unless it has already been filed therewith or is pending in Court and that meanwhile, the deportation case shall be provisionally dismissed.&nbsp; <b>The necessary implication of this statement is that since no copy of the resolution of State Prosecutor Lugtu recommending the filing of charges in court against the eleven Indians has been furnished the Bureau, and that as such, the Bureau was not aware of the action of the Prosecutor conducting the preliminary investigation, the deportation would remain unavailing to the eleven Indians.&nbsp; However, the reverse situation happened.</b><br><br><center>x x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></center></blockquote><br>In convicting petitioner of the falsification charge, the Sandiganbayan declared:<br><br><blockquote>. . . [T]he statement contained in Self-Deportation Order No. 94-685, that “there is no indication from the records that the respondents (eleven Indian nationals) are subject of any written complaints before any written complaints before any government agency”, is absolutely false because the truth is that these eleven Indians were the subject of preliminary investigation being conducted by State Prosecutor Lugtu, and more importantly, when the requests for self-deportation of the eleven Indians were referred to Commissioner Respicio on August 4, 1994, earlier <u><b>communications had indeed already been sent to him containing the precise information that a preliminary investigation was being conducted by State Prosecutor Lugtu</b></u> against Pramod Shriad Jogoru, et al.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he approved and signed their self-deportation order without batting an eyelash.&nbsp; <b>It must be emphasized that <u>Commissioner Respicio could not have been oblivious to such information which he received through the 3rd Indorsement of Undersecretary Esguerra and to which he responded through his own 4th Indorsement addressed to State Prosecutor Lugtu</u>.</b><br><br><center>x x x x <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></center></blockquote><br>His motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioner filed the present petition for review, imputing error to the Sandiganbayan’s Decision and Resolution as<br><br><blockquote>. . . not [being] in accord with and/or not sustained by applicable decision[s] of this Honorable Court [for] being based on insufficient evidence/overlooking vital facts and circumstances which if given their proper perspective and significance would negate the alleged finding of guilt. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To petitioner, the prosecution failed to present any evidence pointing to his receipt or knowledge of Figueras’ letter dated July 5, 1994. In any event, he assists that the conduct of a preliminary investigation is not a bar to a self-deportation order in light of Memorandum Order No. 04-92, the pertinent provision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.&nbsp; Offer of self-deportation.—An offer of self-deportation by the alien shall be granted <b>provided there is <u>no pending</u> case in court against him.&nbsp; Self-deportation shall <i>not</i> be allowed as a means of evading criminal prosecution or civil liability.</b><br><br>The offer of self-deportation shall be approved by the Commissioner upon the favorable recommendation of the Special Prosecutor, the Chief of the Intelligence Division or the Board of Special Inquiry, as the case may be. (emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The immediately-quoted rule, petitioner argues, pertains only to an actual case filed in court, but no evidence was presented that he was aware of the filing of a case in court against the Indians.&nbsp; He thus maintains that he relied on the representations of his subordinates Caronongan and Sta. Ana about the lack of any criminal record of the Indians; and that he had discretion whether to grant or deny requests for self-deportation provided that there is no pending court case against the requesting party. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Petitioner goes on to posit that the prosecution failed to present any evidence of any ulterior motive on his part in allowing the deportation of the Indians as in fact it was advantageous to the government to deport the aliens.<br><br>Petitioner furthermore posits that the Order bore the approval and signature of the two other commissioners. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioner thus concludes that in light of the foregoing circumstances, he had no legal obligation to disclose the truth of something that he had no knowledge about. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Special Prosecutor counters that it was able to prove all the elements of the offense under Section 3 (e) of RA No. 3019 and that of falsification.&nbsp; It asserts that it proved bad faith on the part of petitioner, as despite the July 5, 1994 letter to him of&nbsp; Figueras inquiring about the status of the Indians who were “presently” under investigation by the NBI, and the July 27, 1994 3rd Indorsement to him&nbsp; of Usec. Esguerra about the&nbsp; “criminal cases against [the Indians which were] under preliminary investigation . . . by State Prosecutor . . . Lugtu,”&nbsp; petitioner issued the Order.<br><br>With the deportation of the Indians, the Office of the Special Prosecutor laments that prosecution of the criminal charge filed in court against the Indians had been barred. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Special Prosecutor additionally contends that the issuance of the Order required petitioner’s intervention on account of his position and that the statement in the Order that “there is no indication from the records that the eleven Indian [n]ationals are subject of any written complaints before any government agency” is false because petitioner was in fact informed that they were under preliminary investigation.&nbsp; The Office thus concludes that petitioner indubitably made an untruthful statement on the matter. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The petition fails.<br><br><u>Section 3(e) of RA 3019</u>, violation for which petitioner was charged, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3.&nbsp; Corrupt practices of public officers.— In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br><center>x x x x</center><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.
