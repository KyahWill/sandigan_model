				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">There is forum shopping when two or more actions or proceedings, founded on the same cause, are instituted by a party on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition. Where a party's petition for <i>certiorari</i> and subsequent appeal seek to achieve one and the same purpose, there is forum shopping which is a sufficient ground for the dismissal of the <i>certiorari</i> petition.<br><br>This Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>seeks to reverse and set aside the Court of Appeal's February 27, 2004 Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R.

Espiritu, for himself and as attorney-in-fact of Westmont Investment Corporation, Sta. Lucia Realty and Development Corporation, Golden Era Holdings, Inc., and Exchange Equity Corporation (Espiritu Group) and Tony Tan Caktiong and William Tan Untiong (Tan Group) filed a Petition for Issuance of Shares of Stock and/or Return of Management and Control <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> with the Regional Trial Court of Manila against United Overseas Bank Limited, United Overseas Bank Philippines, Manta Ray Holdings, Inc., Wee Cho Chaw, Wee Ee Cheong, Samuel Poon Hon Thang, Ong Sea Eng, Chua Ten Hui, Wang Lian Khee and Marianne Malate-Guerrero (UOBP Group). The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 02-103160 and raffled to Branch 46.<br><br>On June 27, 2002, Manuel N. Tankiansee and Juanita U. Tan, joined by Farmix Fertilizer Corp., and Pearlbank Securities, Inc. (intervenors), filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene and to Admit Attached Petition-In-Intervention. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On July 26, 2002, the UOBP Group filed their Answer <i>Ad Cautelam </i>with Counterclaim against intervenors, and Cross-claim against the Espiritu and Tan Groups.<br><br>On September 16, 2002, the Espiritu and Tan Groups filed their <i>Ex Abundanti Ad Cautelam </i>Answer to the cross-claim of the UOBP Group.<br><br>On October 4, 2002, the intervenors filed a Motion for Production, Inspection and Copying of Documents against the UOBP Group.<br><br>On October 14, 2002, the intervenors filed a Notice to Take Deposition Upon Oral Examination of John Anthony B. Espiritu, Tony Tan Caktiong and Chua Teng Hui. A similar notice was sent to Wee Cho Yaw. All the aforementioned parties opposed the taking of their depositions <i>via </i>separate Motions for Protective Order and/or Objection to Resort to Discoveries on the ground that resort to discovery procedure was already time-barred.<br><br>In an Order dated October 29, 2002, the trial court denied the motion for production of documents and notice to take depositions because, as modes of discovery, the same were filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period.<br><br>Subsequently, the intervenors filed a Motion for Clarification. On November 25, 2002, the trial court reversed its previous ruling and granted the intervenors' motion for production of documents and notice to take depositions. Thereafter, the Espiritu, Tan and UOBP Groups sought reconsideration of this order. However, on December 18, 2002, the trial court denied the same and maintained that resort to discovery is permissible under the premises.<br><br>Following suit, the Espiritu and Tan Groups attempted to resort to discovery procedure. On January 31, 2003, they filed a Notice to Take Depositions Upon Oral Examination of Manuel Tankiansee and Juanita U. Tan. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><b><i>Regional Trial Court's Ruling</i></b><br><br>On February 4, 2003, the trial court issued the first questioned order which, among others, disallowed the taking of the depositions of Manuel Tankiansee and Juanita U. Tan. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It held that the taking of the subject depositions is time-barred. Meanwhile, in view of the November 25 and December 18, 2002 Orders of the trial court allowing the deposition-taking of John Anthony B. Espiritu and Tony Tan Caktiong, on February 7, 2003, the Espiritu and Tan Groups filed a Motion for the Issuance of Protective Orders. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On February 17, 2003, the trial court issued the second questioned order which denied the said motion. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Upon motion, on February 26, 2003, the trial court issued the third questioned order which modified the February 17, 2003 Order by canceling the deposition of John Anthony B. Espiritu until further notice and resetting the deposition of Tony Tan Caktiong to a later date. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On April 14, 2003, the Espiritu and Tan Groups filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> before the Court of Appeals challenging the validity of the February 4, 17, and 26, 2003 Orders for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><b><i>Court of Appeal's Ruling</i></b><br><br><b>&nbsp; </b>On February 27, 2004, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision denying the petition for <i>certiorari</i>. It ruled that the Espiritu and Tan Groups failed to adduce evidence to establish that they filed the notice of deposition within the period provided under Section 1, Rule 3 of the Interim Rules of Procedure on Intra-Corporate Controversies.&nbsp; Moreover, the failure of a party to avail himself of modes of discovery does not operate to deprive him of the right to present his case because evidentiary matters may be presented before the court through pleadings and testimonies of the parties.<br><br>From this adverse decision, only the Espiritu Group (petitioners) appealed to this Court.<br><br>Meanwhile, while this case was pending resolution before the appellate court or on February 2, 2004, the trial court rendered a Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in the main case (<i>i.e.</i>, Civil Case No. 02-103160). From this judgment, petitioners, except petitioner Westmont Investment Corporation, filed a notice of appeal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This case was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 83161 and is pending resolution before the appellate court.&nbsp; For its part, petitioner Westmont Investment Corporation filed an <i>Ex Abundanti Ad Cautelam </i>Notice Of Appeal <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and a Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and <i>Mandamus</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On December 15, 2010, this Court issued a Resolution requiring the Court of Appeals to elevate the complete records of CA-G.R. CV No. 83161 to this Court.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>1. Whether the disallowance of the deposition-taking of Manuel Tankiansee and Juanita U. Tan (Tankiansee Group) is contrary to the mandate of liberality in the availment and interpretation of the Rules on Discovery. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>2. Whether petitioners were deprived due process when they were denied resort to the modes of discovery. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>3. Whether petitioners are guilty of forum shopping. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b><i>Petitioners' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioners contend that, in disallowing the deposition of Manuel N. Tankiansee and Juanita U. Tan, the trial court violated the liberality in the availment and interpretation of the Rules on Discovery. Moreover, the trial court failed to consider that the allowance of the deposition would not prejudice any party because, at the time the notices of deposition were served, no party had yet actually availed himself of and/or conducted any discovery proceeding. They emphasize that the testimonies of the intended deponents are crucial to establish their just claims in the main case.<br><br>Petitioners further argue that the Tankiansee Group was allowed to avail itself of the modes of discovery despite the fact that the latter filed their pleadings beyond the period allowed under the Interim Rules Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies. They claim that the trial court erroneously counted the 15-day period. In truth, both petitioners and the Tankiansee Group availed themselves of the modes of discovery beyond the 15-day period. In effect, the trial court denied petitioners the very same right it granted the Tankiansee Group.<br><br>Petitioners also note that after the submission of the respective pre-trial briefs in the main case, the trial court rendered judgment without conducting hearings. Hence, they were denied the right to fully present their case because they were unable to make use of the testimonies of the intended deponents. Petitioners plead that it is not yet too late to rectify this injustice by allowing the subject depositions because the aforesaid summary judgment has been challenged in the meantime in various proceedings.<br><br><b><i>Respondents' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondents claim that petitioners are guilty of forum shopping. On February 2, 2004, the trial court rendered a summary judgment in the main case, <i>i.e.</i>, Civil Case No. 02-103160. Petitioners, except petitioner Westmont Investment Corporation, thereafter filed a notice of appeal. Petitioner Westmont Investment Corporation chose to file an <i>ex abundanti ad cautelam </i>notice of appeal and a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>. All three cases seek to annul the February 2, 2004 Decision of the trial court.<br><br>According to respondents, the present recourse has the same objective, that is, to reopen the trial court's February 2, 2004 Decision which is pending review before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Considering that petitioners have a commonality of interest, the splitting of the causes of action on the same cause is tantamount to forum shopping.<br><br>Moreover, respondents argue that the notices of deposition filed by petitioners are time-barred. Section 1, Rule 3 of the Interim Rules Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies provides that a party can only avail himself of any of the modes of discovery not later than 15 days from the joinder of issues. According to the respondents, the joinder of issues occurred on September 29, 2002 after the lapse of the period for the filing of the last responsive pleading of the parties to this case. However, petitioners filed their notices of deposition only on January 31, 2003. Hence, the trial court did not err in denying their resort to modes of discovery.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><i>Petitioners' appeal before the Court of <br>Appeals is the appropriate and adequate <br>remedy, and the certiorari petition, subject <br>matter of this case, constitutes forum shopping.</i><br><br>As stated earlier, while this case was pending review before the Court of Appeals or on February 2, 2004, the trial court rendered a Decision in the main case (<i>i.e.</i>, Civil Case No. 02-103160). From this judgment, petitioners, except petitioner Westmont Investment Corporation, filed a notice of appeal. This case was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 83161 and is now pending resolution before the appellate court.&nbsp; For its part, petitioner Westmont Investment Corporation filed an <i>Ex Abundanti Ad Cautelam </i>Notice Of Appeal and a Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>and <i>Mandamus</i>.<br><br>With these developments, the instant petition should be denied because (1) petitioners' appeal before the appellate court is the appropriate and adequate remedy, and (2) the <i>certiorari</i> petition, subject matter of this case, constitutes forum shopping. This is in consonance with our ruling in <i>Ley Construction &amp; Development Corporation v. Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corporation</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In <i>Ley Construction &amp; Development Corporation</i>, petitioner filed a complaint for specific performance and damages against respondent. Subsequently, petitioner served notices to take the depositions of several individuals.&nbsp; Initially, the trial court issued an order allowing the petitioner to take the subject depositions.&nbsp; However, it later issued another order canceling all the depositions set for hearing in order not to delay the prompt disposition of the case.&nbsp; Petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals questioning the trial court's order canceling the deposition-taking which allegedly deprived it of its due process right to discovery.&nbsp; While this <i>certiorari</i> petition was pending before the appellate court, the trial court issued a resolution in the main case which dismissed the complaint for specific performance and damages.&nbsp; Subsequently, the Court of Appeals dismissed the <i>certiorari</i> petition.&nbsp; On appeal to this Court by petitioner from the dismissal of its <i>certiorari</i> petition, we ruled that -<br><br><blockquote><i>Second</i>, the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> was superseded by the filing, before the Court of Appeals, of a subsequent appeal docketed as CA-GR CV No. 57119, questioning <i>the Resolution and the two Orders</i>.&nbsp; In this light, there was no more reason for the CA to resolve the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, clearly provides that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is available only when "there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." A petition for <i>certiorari</i> cannot co-exist with an appeal or any other adequate remedy. The existence and the availability of the right to appeal are antithetical to the availment of the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>. As the Court has held, these two remedies are "mutually exclusive."<br><br>In this case, the subsequent appeal constitutes an adequate remedy.&nbsp; In fact it is the appropriate remedy because it assails not only the Resolution but also the two Orders.<br><br>It has been held that "what is determinative of the propriety of <i>certiorari</i> is the danger of failure of justice without the writ, not the mere absence of all other legal remedies." The Court is satisfied that the denial of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> by the Court of Appeals will not result in a failure of justice, for petitioner's rights are adequately and, in fact, more appropriately addressed in the appeal.<br><br><i>Third</i>, petitioner's submission that the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> has a practical legal effect is in fact an admission that the two actions are one and the same.&nbsp; Thus, in arguing that the reversal of the two interlocutory Orders "would likely result in the setting aside of the dismissal of petitioner's amended complaint," petitioner effectively contends that its Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, like the appeal, seeks to set aside the <i>Resolution and the two Orders</i>.<br><br>Such argument unwittingly discloses a recourse to forum shopping, which has been held as "the institution of two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition." Clearly, by its own submission, petitioner seeks to accomplish the same thing in its Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and in its appeal: both assail the two interlocutory Orders and both seek to set aside the RTC Resolution.<br><br>Hence, even assuming that the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> has a practical legal effect because it would lead to the reversal of the Resolution dismissing the Complaint, it would still be denied on the ground of forum shopping. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>In the same vein, petitioners' <i>certiorari </i>petition, questioning the three interlocutory orders which denied their resort to discovery procedure, has been superseded by the filing of their subsequent appeal before the Court of Appeals (<i>i.e.</i>, CA-G.R. CV No. 83161). As explained above, a <i>certiorari</i> petition may only be availed of if "there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> We find that petitioners' appeal from the February 2, 2004 Decision of the trial court in the main case is the appropriate and adequate remedy in this case as it challenges the aforesaid interlocutory orders and the decision in the main case.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners' appeal and <i>certiorari</i> petition effectively seek to annul the February 2, 2004 Decision of the trial court. In their pending appeal before the appellate court, petitioners argued, among others, that they were unduly deprived of their right to avail of modes of discovery, specifically, the deposition taking subject matter of this case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This is one of their arguments in their appeal which prays for the annulment of the February 2, 2004 Decision on due process grounds. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, petitioners argued in their <i>certiorari</i> petition that the disallowance of the taking of the subject depositions deprived them of the opportunity to bring to fore crucial evidence determinative of this case.&nbsp; According to petitioners, this brought about the erroneous February 2, 2004 Decision issued by the trial court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In fine, the appeal and <i>certiorari</i> petition raise similar arguments&nbsp; and&nbsp; effectively seek&nbsp; to&nbsp; achieve the&nbsp; same&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; annulling&nbsp; the<br><br>February 2, 2004 Decision which petitioners perceive to be in gross error.&nbsp; Thus, as in <i>Ley Construction &amp; Development Corporation</i>, the <i>certiorari</i> petition must perforce be dismissed on the ground of forum shopping.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The February 27, 2004 Decision and June 22, 2004 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 76518 are <b>AFFIRMED. </b><br><br>The records of CA-G.R.
