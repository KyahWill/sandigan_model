The CA likewise rejected petitioner's assertion that it received the subject shipment in bad order condition as this was belied by Marine Cargo Surveyors Redentor Antonio and Edgar Liceralde, who both testified that the actual counting of bad order bags was done only after all the bags were unloaded from the vessel and that the Turn Over Survey of Bad Order Cargoes (TOSBOC) upon which petitioner anchors its defense was prepared only on November 28, 1995 or after the unloading of the bags was completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp;

Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> we ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>Anent the second issue, it is our view and so hold that <b>the presentation in evidence of the marine insurance policy is not indispensable</b> in this case <b>before the insurer may recover from the common carrier the insured value of the lost cargo in the exercise of its subrogatory right.</b> <b>The subrogation receipt, by itself, is sufficient to establish not only the relationship of herein private respondent as insurer and Caltex, as the assured shipper of the lost cargo of industrial fuel oil, but also the amount paid to settle the insurance claim. The right of subrogation accrues simply upon payment by the insurance company of the insurance claim.</b><br><br>The presentation of the insurance policy was necessary in the case of <i>Home Insurance Corporation v. CA</i> (a case cited by petitioner) because the shipment therein (hydraulic engines) passed through several stages with different parties involved in each stage. First, from the shipper to the port of departure; second, from the port of departure to the M/S Oriental Statesman; third, from the M/S Oriental Statesman to the M/S Pacific Conveyor; fourth, from the M/S Pacific Conveyor to the port of arrival; fifth, from the port of arrival to the arrastre operator; sixth, from the arrastre operator to the hauler, Mabuhay Brokerage Co., Inc. (private respondent therein); and lastly, from the hauler to the consignee. We emphasized in that case that in the absence of proof of stipulations to the contrary, the hauler can be liable only for any damage that occurred from the time it received the cargo until it finally delivered it to the consignee. Ordinarily, it cannot be held responsible for the handling of the cargo before it actually received it. The insurance contract, which was not presented in evidence in that case would have indicated the scope of the insurer's liability, if any, since no evidence was adduced indicating at what stage in the handling process the damage to the cargo was sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In <i>International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. FGU Insurance Corporation,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> we used the same line of reasoning in upholding the Decision of the CA finding the arrastre contractor liable for the lost shipment despite the failure of the insurance company to offer in evidence the insurance contract or policy.&nbsp; We explained:<br><br><blockquote>Indeed, jurisprudence has it that the marine insurance policy needs to be presented in evidence before the trial court or even belatedly before the appellate court. In <i>Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Regis Brokerage Corp.,</i>&nbsp; the Court stated that the presentation of the marine insurance policy was necessary, as the issues raised therein arose from the very existence of an insurance contract between Malayan Insurance and its consignee, ABB Koppel, even prior to the loss of the shipment. In <i>Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. v. Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc.</i>, the Court ruled that the insurance contract must be presented in evidence in order to determine the extent of the coverage. This was also the ruling of the Court in <i>Home Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals.</i><br><br>However, as in every general rule, there are admitted exceptions. In <i>Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</i> the Court stated that the presentation of the insurance policy was not fatal because the loss of the cargo undoubtedly occurred while on board the petitioner's vessel, unlike in <i>Home Insurance</i> in which the cargo passed through several stages with different parties and it could not be determined when the damage to the cargo occurred, such that the insurer should be liable for it.<br><br>As in <i>Delsan</i>, there is no doubt that the loss of the cargo in the present case occurred while in petitioner's custody. Moreover, there is no issue as regards the provisions of Marine Open Policy No. MOP-12763, such that the presentation of the contract itself is necessary for perusal, not to mention that its existence was already admitted by petitioner in open court. And even though it was not offered in evidence, it still can be considered by the court as long as they have been properly identified by testimony duly recorded and they have themselves been incorporated in the records of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>Similarly, in this case, the presentation of the insurance contract or policy was not necessary. Although petitioner objected to the admission of the Subrogation Receipt in its Comment to respondent's formal offer of evidence on the ground that respondent failed to present the insurance contract or policy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> a perusal of petitioner's Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and Pre-Trial Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> shows that petitioner never questioned respondent's right to subrogation, nor did it dispute the coverage of the insurance contract or policy.&nbsp; Since there was no issue regarding the validity of the insurance contract or policy, or any provision thereof, respondent had no reason to present the insurance contract or policy as evidence during the trial.<br><br><b><i>Factual findings of the CA, affirming the<br> RTC, are conclusive and binding</i></b><br><br>Petitioner's attempt to absolve itself from liability must likewise fail.<br><br>Only questions of law are allowed in petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Thus, it is not our duty "to review, examine, and evaluate or weigh all over again the probative value of the evidence presented,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> especially where the findings of both the trial court and the appellate court coincide on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; As we have often said, factual findings of the CA affirming those of the RTC are conclusive and binding, except in the following cases: "(1) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (2) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (3) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (4) when the judgment of the [CA] is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) when the [CA], in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (6) when the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (7) when the [CA] manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; and (8) when the findings of fact of the [CA] are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; None of these are availing in the present case.<br><br>Both the RTC and the CA found the negligence of petitioner's stevedores to be the proximate cause of the damage/loss to the shipment.&nbsp; In disregarding the contention of petitioner that such finding is contrary to the documentary evidence, the CA had this to say:<br><br><blockquote>ATI, however, contends that the finding of the trial court was contrary to the documentary evidence of record, particularly,&nbsp; the Turn Over Survey of Bad Order Cargoes dated November 28, 1995,&nbsp; which was executed prior to the turn-over of the cargo by the carrier to the arrastre operator ATI,&nbsp; and which showed that the shipment already contained 2,702 damaged bags.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Contrary to ATI's assertion, <b>witness Redentor Antonio</b>, marine cargo surveyor of Inchcape for the vessel Jinlian I which arrived on November 21, 1995 and up to completion of discharging on November 28, 1995,<b> testified that</b> <b>it was only after all the bags were unloaded from the vessel that the actual counting of bad order bags was made,</b> thus:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>The above testimony of Redentor Antonio was corroborated by Edgar Liceralde,</b> marine cargo surveyor connected with SMS Average Surveyors and Adjusters, Inc., the company requested by consignee Chemphil Albright and Wilson Corporation to provide superintendence, report the condition and determine the final outturn of quantity/weight of the subject shipment.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Defendant-appellant ATI, for its part, presented its claim officer as witness who testified that a survey was conducted by the shipping company and ATI before the shipment was turned over to the possession of ATI and that the Turn Over Survey of Bad Order Cargoes was prepared by ATI's Bad Order (BO) Inspector.<br><br><b>Considering that the shipment arrived on November 21, 1998 and the unloading operation commenced on said date and was completed on November 26, 1998, while the Turn Over Survey of Bad Order Cargoes, reflecting a figure of 2,702 damaged bags, was prepared and signed on November 28, 1998</b> by ATI's BO Inspector and co-signed by a representative of the shipping company,&nbsp; <b>the trial court's finding that the damage to the cargoes was due to the improper handling thereof by ATI's stevedores cannot be said to be without substantial support from the records.&nbsp; </b><br><br>We thus see no cogent reason to depart from the ruling of the trial court that ATI should be made liable for the 2,702 bags of damaged shipment. Needless to state, it is hornbook doctrine that the assessment of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, which had the opportunity to observe the demeanor, conduct or attitude of the witnesses.&nbsp; The findings of the trial court on this point are accorded great respect and will not be reversed on appeal, unless it overlooked substantial facts and circumstances which, if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<br><br>We also find ATI liable for the additional 179 damaged bags discovered upon delivery of the shipment at the consignee's warehouse in Pasig.&nbsp; The final Report of Survey executed by SMS Average Surveyors &amp; Adjusters, Inc., and independent surveyor hired by the consignee,&nbsp; shows that the subject shipment incurred a total of 2881 damaged bags.<br><br>The Report states that the withdrawal and delivery of the shipment took about ninety-five (95) trips from November 29, 1995 to December 28, 1995 and it was upon completion of the delivery to consignee's warehouse where the final count of 2881 damaged bags was made. The damage consisted of torn/bad order condition of the bags due to spillages and caked/hardened portions.<br><br>We agree with the trial court that the damage to the shipment was caused by the negligence of ATI's stevedores and for which ATI is liable under Articles 2180 and 2176 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; The proximate cause of the damage (i.e., torn bags, spillage of contents and caked/hardened portions of the contents) was the improper handling of the cargoes by ATI's stevedores, x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ATI has not satisfactorily rebutted plaintiff-appellee's evidence on the negligence of ATI's stevedores in the handling and safekeeping of the cargoes. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We find no reason to disagree with the trial court's conclusion. Indeed,&nbsp; from the nature of the [damage] caused to the shipment, i.e., torn bags, spillage of contents and hardened or caked portions of the contents,&nbsp; it is not difficult to see that the damage caused was due to the negligence of ATI's stevedores who used steel hooks to retrieve the bags from the higher portions of the piles thereby piercing the bags and spilling their contents,&nbsp; and who piled the bags in the open storage area of ATI with insufficient cover thereby exposing them to the elements and [causing] the contents to cake or harden.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, the finding of negligence on the part of petitioner's stevedores is supported by both testimonial and documentary evidence.&nbsp; Hence, we see no reason to disturb the same.<br><br><b><i>Judicial notice does not apply</i></b><br><br>Finally, petitioner implores us to take judicial notice of Section 7.01,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Article VII of the Management Contract for cargo handling services it entered with the PPA, which limits petitioner's liability to P5,000.00 per package.<br><br>Unfortunately for the petitioner, it cannot avail of judicial notice.<br><br>Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 129 of the Rules of Court provide that:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.&nbsp; <i>Judicial notice, when mandatory</i>. -- A court shall take judicial notice, without the introduction of evidence, of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of the Philippines, the official acts of the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the Philippines, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions.<br><br>SEC.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; <i>Judicial notice, when discretionary</i>. -- A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions.<br></blockquote><br>The Management Contract entered into by petitioner and the PPA is clearly not among the matters which the courts can take judicial notice of.
