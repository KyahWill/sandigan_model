As to the claims of Heirs of Narciso Olimpiada (Carandang Group) and Heirs of Juan Desengaño, the trial court noted that while they were represented by their respective attorneys, they lost interest in pursuing their case and failed to introduce substantial evidence as they did not even file their memorandum.<br><br>In upholding the claim of VMMEI, the trial court ruled that VMMEI acquired ownership rights over the subject properties when it returned the refunded purchase price to the City Treasurer.

TG-355 and TG-356, though not subject of the petition before this Court, we note that the LRA Report dated August 10, 1990 submitted to the trial court in LRC Case No. TG-355 sets forth the following:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>1. Parcels of land described as Lot Nos. 7539, 7540 and 7541 in plan As-04-000064, situated in the Barrio of Sunga, Tagaytay City are being applied for original registration of title;<br><br>2. After examining the afore-said plan discrepancies were noted which were referred to the Lands Management Sector (LMS), Quezon City, for verification and correction in a letter of even date (August 10, 1990), Annex “A” hereof;<br><br>3. Letters of even date (August 10, 1990) were also sent to (a) Land Management Bureau (LMB), Manila, (b) Community Environment and Natural Resources Office, (CENRO), Bacoor, Cavite, and (c) Forest Management Bureau (FMB), Quezon City, Annexes “B” “C” &amp; “D” hereof, requesting for the status of the parcels of land sought to be registered, if covered by any kind of public land application/patent and are within the alienable and disposable land of public domain.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the foregoing are initially submitted to the Honorable Court for its information and guidance <span style="font-weight: bold;">with the recommendation that the rendition of the decision be held in abeyance until after the discrepancies are corrected and the requested informations are received</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Again, there is no showing that the above recommendation was duly considered and acted upon by the trial court. It also did not wait for the submission of reports requested by the LRA from the aforementioned agencies concerning the status of Lot 4831-B, whether it is covered by any kind of public land application/land patent, is a portion of or identical to any parcel of land covered by previously approved isolated survey, and is inside the alienable and disposable land of the public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>It should be stressed that a person who seeks registration of title to a piece of land must prove the claim by clear and convincing evidence, and is duty bound to identify sufficiently and satisfactorily the property.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, all facts must indicate that no other person, including the government, will be prejudiced by the adjudication of the land to the applicant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>Indeed, a land registration court has no jurisdiction to order the registration of land already decreed in the name of another in an earlier land registration case. A second decree for the same land would be null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>The applicant for registration under Section 14, paragraph (1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> of P.D. No. 1529 must specifically prove: (1) possession of the subject land under a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> claim of ownership from June 12, 1945 or earlier; and (2) the classification of the land as an alienable and disposable land of the public domain. The burden of proof in overcoming the presumption of State ownership of lands of the public domain is on the person applying for registration. The applicant must show that the land subject of the application is alienable or disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>In this case, the only evidence submitted before the trial court to show the character of the lands applied for is the Certification issued by CENRO Records Officer Benjamin Aukay stating the status of each lot as “not applied”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> This hardly suffices to prove the character of the land as it did not even state whether the subject lots are within the alienable and disposable zone of the public domain. It must also be stressed that the tax delinquency sale is no proof of registrability of the land.&nbsp; Both Mercado and VMMEI failed to submit a certification from the proper government agency to prove that the lands subject for registration are indeed alienable and disposable.<br><br>The Court has recently reiterated the stringent evidentiary requirements to establish the character of the land, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Matters of land classification or reclassification cannot be assumed; they call for proof. To prove that the land subject of an application for registration is alienable, an applicant must conclusively establish the existence of a positive act of the government, such as any of the following: a presidential proclamation or an executive order; other administrative actions; investigation reports of the Bureau of Lands investigator; or a legislative act or statute. The applicant may also secure a certification from the government that the lands applied for are alienable and disposable.<br><br>Previously, a certification from the DENR that a lot was alienable and disposable was sufficient to establish the true nature and character of the property and enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the absence of contradictory evidence.<br><br>However, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc.</span>, the Supreme Court overturned the grant by the lower courts of an original application for registration over a parcel of land in Batangas and ruled that a CENRO certification is not enough to certify that a land is alienable and disposable:<br><br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Further, it is not enough for the PENRO or CENRO to certify that a land is alienable and disposable</span>. The applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In addition, the applicant for land registration must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records. These facts must be established to prove that the land is alienable and disposable</span>. Respondent failed to do so because the certifications presented by respondent do not, by themselves, prove that the land is alienable and disposable.” (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, as it now stands, aside from a CENRO certification, an application for original registration of title over a parcel of land must be accompanied by a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records in order to establish that the land indeed is alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup></blockquote><br>If indeed proven to be forest land, then the land registration court has no jurisdiction over the subject properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> Jurisprudence is replete with cases reiterating that forest lands or forest reserves are not capable of private appropriation and possession thereof, however long, cannot convert them into private property. Possession of the land by private respondents, whether spanning decades or centuries, could never ripen into ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The Court is mindful of the fact that the Solicitor General, though represented before the trial court by the public prosecutor, did not appeal the May 31, 1999 Decision in LRC Case Nos. TG-354, TG-355 and TG-356.&nbsp; Nonetheless, in view of the serious discrepancies reported by the LRA in the approved plans, the absence of competent proof of the status of the lands subject of application, the trial court’s rendition of decision even before receipt of the reports requested by the LRA from the concerned government agencies (DENR-LMS, CENRO and FMB), we hold that remand of the case (G.R. No. 141019) for further proceedings is in order.<br><br>We recall this Court’s initial observation when G.R. No. 119059 was dismissed without prejudice under the September 3, 1997 Resolution, that the case is not yet ripe for resolution in view of petitioners’ allegation that the DENR has not yet finished the amendment of the approved plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>&nbsp; This Court, as well as the CA, took note of relevant information supposedly obtained by petitioners relative to Lot 4867, which prompted the CA to temporarily archive the consolidated cases CA-GR. CV No. 41164 and CA-G.R. SP No. 32309. When this Court entered judgment on the dismissal without prejudice of G.R. No. 119059, the CA was directed to proceed with the resolution of the said cases.&nbsp; However, G.R. No. 119059 did not actually resolve the merits of the petition and merely declared the case not yet ripe for disposition.<br><br>Perusal of the records in G.R. No. 119059 reveals that petitioners submitted a copy of the letter dated May 16, 1997 from DENR Regional Technical Director (Mainland Provinces) Benjamin P. Pambid and addressed to their counsel, Atty. Fabella, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>This has reference to the 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated May 07, 1997 by Director S.F.
