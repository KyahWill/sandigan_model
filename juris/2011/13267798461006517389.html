SP No. 89644, which denied due course and dismissed the Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> filed therewith by petitioners Pablo Polsotin, Jr. (Polsotin), Arwin Rayala (Rayala), Geronimo Limpante (Limpante), Raul Domdom (Domdom) and Oscar Andrin (Andrin) and consequently, affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission’s (NLRC) dismissal of their appeal for non-compliance with procedural rules.&nbsp; Also assailed is the May 3, 2006 Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the CA wherein said court likewise refused to give due course to petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration and instead affirmed and reiterated its assailed Decision.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Factual Antecedents</span><br><br>Petitioners Polsotin, Rayala, Limpante, Domdom and Andrin (petitioners) were bus drivers and conductors of respondent De Guia Enterprises, Inc.

It held that petitioners were validly terminated from employment for violation of company rules and regulations as well as for gross and habitual neglect of duties as supported by petitioners’ employment records submitted by respondent.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Labor Arbiter&nbsp; added&nbsp; that the procedural requirements for dismissing petitioners were likewise satisfied.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission</span><br><br>Without the assistance of counsel, petitioners, through Rayala as their representative, filed a Memorandum of Appeal <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> with the NLRC.&nbsp; They contended that the Labor Arbiter committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering a decision anchored mainly on respondent’s evidence.&nbsp; It was their assertion that by failing to appear at the scheduled hearings and to file a position paper on time without any justifiable reason, respondent should have been deemed to have waived its right to submit its own evidence.&nbsp; Thus, they prayed that respondent’s belatedly filed position paper be considered a mere scrap of paper.&nbsp; They also pointed out that said position paper interposed arguments only as against petitioners Polsotin and Rayala and thus cannot be used against the other petitioners.<br><br>In a Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated January 30, 2004, the NLRC dismissed the appeal for failure of petitioners to append thereto a certificate of non-forum shopping and proof of service upon the other party. The NLRC then affirmed the Decision appealed from.<br><br>From this resolution, petitioners moved for reconsideration by explaining that their lapses were due to their ignorance of the existence of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they clarified that they managed to duly furnish the respondent a copy of their Memorandum of Appeal and that the registry receipt showing proof of service was attached to the original copy of the said pleading when it was filed with the docket section of the NLRC.&nbsp; Moreover, at the bottom of said motion for reconsideration is a certification that there is no pending case involving the same cause of action in any court and that petitioners did not commit forum-shopping. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The motion for reconsideration was however denied by the NLRC in an Order <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated February 18, 2005.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br><br>Petitioners filed a Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> imploring the CA to be more liberal in the application of the rules of procedure considering that their dismissal from service was effected without due process as they were not given ample opportunity to be heard and to refute respondent’s allegations against them.&nbsp; They prayed that their appeal be given due course.<br><br>On January 26, 2006, the CA rendered a Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> denying due course and dismissing the petition for the following reasons: first, the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to the petition was not signed by all of the petitioners; and, second, there was no showing of grave abuse of discretion since the NLRC merely complied with the procedural rules governing appeals before it.&nbsp; Therefore, it could not be faulted in denying petitioners’ appeal.<br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; dated May 3, 2006.<br><br>Hence, petitioners, again without the benefit of counsel, brought this case before this Court to once more seek leniency in the application of the rules.&nbsp; It was only on September 8, 2010 or after the parties have submitted their respective Memoranda that the Public Attorney’s Office entered its appearance on behalf on the petitioners. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; On January 31, 2011, we resolved to note said entry of appearance. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Issue<br></div><br>WHETHER X X X IN SPITE OF TECHNICALITIES, PETITIONERS ARE STILL ENTITLED TO X X X DUE CONSIDERATION OF THEIR PETITION X X X. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Our Ruling<br></div><br>We find merit in the petition.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Strict application of technical rules <br>should be set aside to serve the broader<br> interest of substantial justice.</span><br><br>Petitioners’ appeal before the NLRC was dismissed purely on technical grounds as it did not contain the required certification of non-forum shopping and proof of service upon the respondent.&nbsp; Immediately, petitioners rectified these lapses by filing their motion for reconsideration indicating therein that there was no intention on their part to commit forum shopping and that the registry receipt showing proof of service upon respondent was attached to their Memorandum of Appeal filed with the NLRC.&nbsp; With respect to their petition for certiorari with the CA, petitioners failed to affix their individual signatures on top of their typewritten names in the verification and certification of non-forum shopping attached to the petition.&nbsp; On this basis and on the conclusion that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioners’ appeal on technical grounds, the CA denied due course to the petition and dismissed the same.<br><br>Note, however, that in both instances, petitioners were not represented by a lawyer.&nbsp; They had no counsel on record and had been filing and signing all pleadings only through their representative, petitioner Rayala. There was no showing that their case was directly handled or at the very least, that they were assisted by a counsel. Not being lawyers, petitioners’ lack of thorough understanding of procedural rules as well as the importance of its strict observance is understandable.&nbsp; As held in a case, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> a non-lawyer litigant cannot be expected to be well-versed on the rules of procedure as even the most experienced lawyers get tangled in the web of procedure.<br><br>Aware that petitioners are not represented by counsel, the CA could have been more prudent by giving petitioners time to engage the services of a lawyer or at least by reminding them of the importance of retaining one.&nbsp; It is worthy to mention at this point that the right to counsel, being intertwined with the right to due process, is guaranteed by the Constitution to any person whether the proceeding is administrative, civil or criminal. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The CA should have extended some degree of liberality so as to give the party a chance to prove their cause with a lawyer to represent or to assist them.<br><br>In line with this and as “the right of counsel is absolute and may be invoked at all times”, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we required petitioners to enter the appearance of a counsel. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Upon petitioners’ manifestation of their failure to secure the services of a counsel due to financial constraints, the Court resolved to appoint a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> to assist them in litigating their case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing that “the dismissal of an employee’s appeal on purely technical ground is inconsistent with the constitutional mandate on protection to labor.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Court has often set aside the strict application of procedural technicalities to serve the broader interest of substantial justice. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Petitioners were denied the <br>right to due process.</span><br><br>A careful consideration of the facts of the case convinces us that petitioners’ appeal should have been given due course.&nbsp; It may be recalled that respondent failed to timely submit its position paper when required by the Labor Arbiter, hence, the case was submitted for decision sans the same. Nonetheless, when respondent filed its position paper, the Labor Arbiter admitted the same and relied on it in coming up with a decision that petitioners were validly terminated.&nbsp; More important is that petitioners were not even furnished a copy of respondent’s position paper in order for them to refute the contents and allegations therein.&nbsp; And since neither did respondent appear in any of the hearings conducted before the Labor Arbiter, petitioners were never really afforded an opportunity to rebut respondent’s allegations and charges against them or to introduce evidence to refute them.&nbsp; Petitioners’ right to due process was thus clearly violated.<br><br>Indeed, labor tribunals are mandated to use all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily, objectively and without regard to technicalities of law or procedure. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; However, in every proceeding before it, the fundamental and essential requirements of due process should not to be ignored but must at all times be respected. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, petitioners’ case concerns their job, considered as a property right, of which they could not be deprived of without due process. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing considerations, we find that the NLRC gravely erred in denying due course to petitioners’ appeal and in sustaining the Labor Arbiter’s Decision as same infringed upon petitioners’ right to due process. We, therefore, remand the case to the Labor Arbiter to afford petitioners the opportunity to refute the allegations advanced by respondent, with the assistance of their counsel d<span style="font-style: italic;">e oficio.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.
