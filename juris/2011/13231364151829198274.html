				<BR><STRONG>SERENO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These consolidated petitions began as a simple case for payment of services rendered and for reimbursement of costs. The case spun a web of suits and counter-suits because of: (1) the size of the award for agent's fee rendered in favor of Atty. Magdaleno Peña (Peña) - PhP24,000,000 - rendered by the trial court; (2) the controversial execution of the full judgment award of PhP28,500,000 (agent's fee plus reimbursement for costs and other damages) pending appeal; and (3) the finding of solidary liability against Urban Bank, Inc., and several of its corporate officers and directors together with the concomitant levying and sale in execution of the personal (even conjugal) properties of those officers and directors; and (4) the fact that assets with declared conservative values of at least <b>PhP181 Million</b> which, together with those with undeclared values could reach very much more than such amount,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> were levied or sold on execution pending appeal to satisfy the PhP28.5 Million award in favor of Atty. Peña. Incidentally, two supersedeas bonds worth PhP80 Million (2.8 times the amount of the judgment) were filed by Urban Bank and some of its officers and directors to stay the execution pending appeal.<br><br>Had the four attendant circumstances not afflicted the original case, it would have been an open-and-shut review where this Court, applying even just the minimum equitable principle against unjust enrichment would have easily affirmed the grant of fair recompense to Atty. Peña for services he rendered for Urban Bank if such had been ordered by the trial court.<br><br>That Atty. Peña should be paid something by Urban Bank is not in dispute - the Court of Appeals (CA) and the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bago City, agreed on that. What they disagreed on is the basis and the size of the award. The trial court claims that the basis is an oral contract of agency and the award should be PhP28,5000,000; while, the appellate court said that Atty. Peña can only be paid under the legal principle against unjust enrichment, and the total award in his favor should only amount to PhP3,000,000.<br><br>In the eyes of the trial court, the controlling finding is that Atty. Peña should be believed when he testified that in a telephone conversation, the president of Urban Bank, Teodoro Borlongan, a respondent herein, agreed to pay him for his services 10% of the value of the property then worth PhP240,000,000, or PhP24,000,000. Costs and other awards additionally amount to PhP4,500,000, for a total award of PhP28,500,000 according to the trial court. To the Court of Appeals, such an award has no basis, as in fact, no contract of agency exists between Atty. Peña and Urban Bank. Hence, Atty. Peña should only be recompensed according to the principle of unjust enrichment, and that he should be awarded the amount of PhP3,000,000 only for his services and reimbursements of costs.<br><br>The disparity in the size of the award given by the trial court vis-à-vis that of the Court of Appeals (PhP28,500,000 v. PhP3,000,000) must be placed in the context of the service that Atty. Peña proved that he rendered for Urban Bank. As the records bear, Atty. Peña's services consisted of causing the departure of unauthorized sub-tenants in twenty-three commercial establishments in an entertainment compound along Roxas Boulevard. It involved the filing of ejectment suits against them, Peña's personal defense in the counter-suits filed against him, his settlement with them to the tune of PhP1,500,000, which he advanced from his own funds, and his retention of security guards and expenditure for other costs amounting to more or less PhP1,500,000. There is no claim by Atty. Peña of any service beyond those. He claims damages from the threats to his life and safety from the angry tenants, as well as a vexatious collection suit he had to face from a creditor-friend from whom he borrowed PhP3,000,000 to finance the expenses for the services he rendered Urban Bank.<br><br>At the time the award of PhP28,500,000 by the trial court came out in 1999, the net worth of Urban Bank was PhP2,219,781,104.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> While the bank would be closed by the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i> (BSP) a year later for having unilaterally declared a bank holiday contrary to banking rules, there was no reason to believe that at the time such award came out it could not satisfy a judgment of PhP28,500,000, a sum that was only 1% of its net worth, and a miniscule 0.2% of its total assets of PhP11,933,383,630.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In fact, no allegation of impending insolvency or attempt to abscond was ever raised by Atty. Peña and yet, the trial court granted execution pending appeal.<br><br>Interestingly, Peña had included as co-defendants with Urban Bank in the RTC case, several officers and board directors of Urban Bank. Not all board directors were sued, however. With respect to those included in the complaint, other than against Teodoro Borlongan, Corazon Bejasa, and Arturo Manuel, no evidence was ever offered as to their individual actions that gave rise to Atty. Peña's cause of action - the execution of the agency contract and its breach - and yet, these officers and directors were made solidarily liable by the trial court with Urban Bank for the alleged breach of the alleged corporate contract of agency. Execution pending appeal was also granted against them for this solidary liability resulting in the levy and sale in execution pending appeal of not only corporate properties of Urban Bank but also personal properties of the individual bank officers and directors. It would have been interesting to find out what drove Atty. Peña to sue the bank officers and directors of Urban Bank and why he chose to sue only some, but not all of the board directors of Urban Bank, but there is nothing on the record with which this analysis can be pursued.<br><br>Before us are: (a) the Petitions of Urban Bank (G. R. No. 145817) and the De Leon Group (G R. No. 145822) questioning the propriety of the grant of execution pending appeal, and (b) the Petition of Atty. Peña (G. R. No. 162562) assailing the CA's decision on the substantive merits of the case with respect to his claims of compensation based on an agency agreement.<br><br>Ordinarily, the final resolution by the Supreme Court of an appeal from a trial court decision would have automatic, generally-understood consequences on an order issued by the trial court for execution pending appeal. But this is no ordinary case, and the magnitude of the disproportions in this case is too mind-boggling that this Court must exert extra effort to correct whatever injustices have been occasioned in this case. Thus, our dispositions will include detailed instructions for several judicial officials to implement.<br><br>At core, these petitions can be resolved if we answer the following questions:<br><br><blockquote>1. What is the legal basis for an award in favor of Peña for the services he rendered to Urban Bank? Should it be a contract of agency the fee for which was orally agreed on as Peña claims? Should it be the application of the Civil Code provisions on unjust enrichment? Or is it to be based on something else or a combination of the legal findings of both the RTC and the CA? How much should the award be?<br><br>2. Are the officers and directors of Urban Bank liable in their personal capacities for the amount claimed by Peña?<br><br>3. What are the effects of our answers to questions (1) and (2), on the various results of the execution pending appeal that happened here?<br></blockquote><br><center><u><b>Factual Background of the Controversy</b></u><br></center><br>Urban Bank, Inc. (both petitioner and respondent in these two consolidated cases),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was a domestic Philippine corporation, engaged in the business of banking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The eight individual respondents in G. R. No. 162562 were officers and members of Urban Bank's board of directors, who were sued in their official and personal capacities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On the other hand, Benjamin L. De Leon, Delfin C. Gonzalez, Jr., and Eric L. Lee, (hereinafter the de Leon Group), are the petitioners in G. R. No. 145822 and are three of the same bank officers and directors, who had separately filed the instant Petition before the Court.<br><br>Petitioner-respondent Atty. Magdaleno M. Peña (Peña)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> is a lawyer by profession and was formerly a stockholder, director and corporate secretary of Isabel Sugar Company, Inc. (ISCI).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>ISCI owned a parcel of land<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> located in Pasay City (the Pasay property).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In 1984, ISCI leased the Pasay property for a period of 10 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Without its consent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and in violation of the lease contract,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the lessee subleased the land to several tenants, who in turn put up 23 establishments, mostly beer houses and night clubs, inside the compound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In 1994, a few months before the lease contract was to expire, ISCI informed the lessee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and his tenants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that the lease would no longer be renewed and that it intended to take over the Pasay property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> for the purpose of selling it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Two weeks before the lease over the Pasay property was to expire, ISCI and Urban Bank executed a Contract to Sell, whereby the latter would pay ISCI the amount of PhP241,612,000 in installments for the Pasay property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Both parties agreed that the final installment of PhP25,000,000 would be released by the bank upon ISCI's delivery of full and actual possession of the land, free from any tenants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In the meantime, the amount of the final installment would be held by the bank in escrow. The escrow provision in the Contract to Sell, thus, reads:<br><br><blockquote>"The SELLER (ISCI) agrees that from the proceeds of the purchase prices of the subject Property (Pasay property), the BUYER (Urban Bank) shall withhold the amount of PHP 25,000,000.00 by way of escrow and <b>shall release this amount to the SELLER only upon its delivery to the BUYER of the full and actual possession and control of the Subject Property, free from tenants, occupants, squatters or other structures or from any liens, encumbrances, easements or any other obstruction or impediment to the free use and occupancy by the buyer of the subject Property or its exercise of the rights to ownership over the subject Property</b>, within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of payment by the BUYER of the purchase price of the subject Property net of the amounts authorized to be deducted or withheld under Item II (a) of this Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>ISCI then instructed Peña, who was its director and corporate secretary, to take over possession of the Pasay property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> against the tenants upon the expiration of the lease. ISCI's president, Mr. Enrique G. Montilla III (Montilla), faxed a letter to Peña, confirming the latter's engagement as the corporation's agent to handle the eviction of the tenants from the Pasay property, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><blockquote>MEMORANDUM<br><br>TO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atty.

MONTILLA III<br>President<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>On 29 November 1994, the day the lease contract was to expire, ISCI and Urban Bank executed a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> over the Pasay property for the amount agreed upon in the Contract to Sell, but subject to the above escrow provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The title to the land was eventually transferred to the name of Urban Bank on 05 December 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On 30 November 1994, the lessee duly surrendered possession of the Pasay property to ISCI,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> but the unauthorized sub-tenants refused to leave the area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Pursuant to his authority from ISCI, Peña had the gates of the property closed to keep the sub-tenants out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He also posted security guards at the property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> services for which he advanced payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Despite the closure of the gates and the posting of the guards, the sub-tenants would come back in the evening, force open the gates, and proceed to carry on with their businesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> On three separate occasions, the sub-tenants tried to break down the gates of the property, threw stones, and even threatened to return and inflict greater harm on those guarding it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, a certain Marilyn G. Ong, as representative of ISCI, faxed a letter to Urban Bank - addressed to respondent Corazon Bejasa, who was then the bank's Senior Vice-President - requesting the issuance of a formal authority for Peña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Two days thereafter, Ms. Ong faxed another letter to the bank, this time addressed to its president, respondent Teodoro Borlongan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> She repeated therein the earlier request for authority for Peña, since the tenants were questioning ISCI's authority to take over the Pasay property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In response to the letters of Ms. Ong, petitioner-respondent bank, through individual respondents Bejasa and Arturo E. Manuel - Senior Vice-President and Vice-President, respectively - advised Peña<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> that the bank had noted the engagement of his services by ISCI and stressed that ISCI remained as the lawyer's principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>To prevent the sub-tenants from further appropriating the Pasay property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> petitioner-respondent Peña, as director and representative of ISCI, filed a complaint for injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (the First Injunction Complaint) with the RTC-Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Acting on ISCI's prayer for preliminary relief, the trial court favorably issued a temporary restraining order (TRO),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which was duly implemented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> At the time the First Injunction Complaint was filed, a new title to the Pasay property had already been issued in the name of Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On 19 December 1994, when "information reached the judge that the Pasay property had already been transferred by ISCI to Urban Bank, the trial court recalled the TRO and issued a break-open order for the property. According to Peña, it was the first time that he was apprised of the sale of the land by ISCI and of the transfer of its title in favor of the bank."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It is not clear from the records how such information reached the judge or what the break-open order was in response to.<br><br>On the same day that the TRO was recalled, petitioner-respondent Peña immediately contacted ISCI's president, Mr. Montilla, who in turn confirmed the sale of the Pasay property to Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Peña told Mr. Montilla that because of the break-open order of the RTC-Pasay City, he (Peña) would be recalling the security guards he had posted to secure the property. Mr. Montilla, however, asked him to suspend the planned withdrawal of the posted guards, so that ISCI could get in touch with petitioner-respondent bank regarding the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Later that same day, Peña received a telephone call from respondent Bejasa. After Peña informed her of the situation, she allegedly told him that Urban Bank would be retaining his services in guarding the Pasay property, and that he should continue his efforts in retaining possession thereof. He insisted, however, on talking to the Bank's president. Respondent Bejasa gave him the contact details of respondent Borlongan, then president of Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The facts regarding the following phone conversation and correspondences are highly-controverted. Immediately after talking to respondent Bejasa, Peña got in touch with Urban Bank's president, respondent Borlongan. Peña explained that the policemen in Pasay City were sympathetic to the tenants and were threatening to force their way into the premises. He expressed his concern that violence might erupt between the tenants, the city police, and the security guards posted in the Pasay property. Respondent Borlongan supposedly assured him that the bank was going to retain his services, and that the latter should not give up possession of the subject land. Nevertheless, petitioner-respondent Peña demanded a written letter of authority from the bank. Respondent Borlongan acceded and instructed him to see respondent Bejasa for the letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In the same telephone conversation, respondent Borlongan allegedly asked Peña to maintain possession of the Pasay property and to represent Urban Bank in any legal action that might be instituted relative to the property. Peña supposedly demanded 10% of the market value of the property as compensation and attorney's fees and reimbursement for all the expenses incurred from the time he took over land until possession was turned over to Urban Bank. Respondent Borlongan purportedly agreed on condition that possession would be turned over to the bank, free of tenants, not later than four months; otherwise, Peña would lose the 10% compensation and attorney's fees. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Later that afternoon, Peña received the bank's letter dated 19 December 1994, which was signed by respondents Bejasa and Manuel, and is quoted below:<br><br><blockquote><b>This is to confirm the engagement of your services as the authorized representative of Urban Bank, specifically to hold and maintain possession of our abovecaptioned property [Pasay property] and to protect the same from former tenants, occupants or any other person who are threatening to return to the said property and/or interfere with your possession of the said property for and in our behalf</b>.<br><br>You are likewise authorized to represent Urban Bank in any court action that you may institute to carry out the aforementioned duties, and to prevent any intruder, squatter or any other person not otherwise authorized in writing by Urban [B]ank from entering or staying in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>On even date, ISCI sent Urban Bank a letter, which acknowledged ISCI's engagement of Peña and commitment to pay for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of his services. ISCI's letter reads:<br><br><blockquote>This has reference to your property located along Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City [Pasay property] which you purchased from Isabela Sugar Company under a Deed of Absolute Sale executed on December 1, 1994.<br><br>In line with our warranties as the Seller of the said property and our undertaking to deliver to you the full and actual possession and control of said property, free from tenants, occupants or squatters and from any obstruction or impediment to the free use and occupancy of the property by Urban Bank, <b>we have engaged the services of Atty. Magdaleno M. Peña to hold and maintain possession of the property and to prevent the former tenants or occupants from entering or returning to the premises</b>. In view of the transfer of the ownership of the property to Urban Bank, it may be necessary for Urban Bank to appoint Atty. Peña likewise as its authorized representative for purposes of holding/maintaining continued possession of the said property and to represent Urban Bank in any court action that may be instituted for the abovementioned purposes.<br><br><b>It is understood that any attorney's fees, cost of litigation and any other charges or expenses that may be incurred relative to the exercise by Atty. Peña of his abovementioned duties shall be for the account of Isabela Sugar Company </b>and any loss or damage that may be incurred to third parties shall be answerable by Isabela Sugar Company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The following narration of subsequent proceedings is uncontroverted.<br><br>Peña then moved for the dismissal of ISCI's First Injunction Complaint, filed on behalf of ISCI, on the ground of lack of personality to continue the action, since the Pasay property, subject of the suit, had already been transferred to Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The RTC-Pasay City dismissed the complaint and recalled its earlier break-open order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, petitioner-respondent Peña, now in representation of Urban Bank, filed a separate complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (the Second Injunction Complaint) with the RTC-Makati City, to enjoin the tenants from entering the Pasay property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Acting on Urban Bank's preliminary prayer, the RTC-Makati City issued a TRO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>While the Second Injunction Complaint was pending, Peña made efforts to settle the issue of possession of the Pasay property with the sub-tenants. During the negotiations, he was exposed to several civil and criminal cases they filed in connection with the task he had assumed for Urban Bank, and he received several threats against his life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The sub-tenants eventually agreed to stay off the property for a total consideration of PhP1,500,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Peña advanced the payment for the full and final settlement of their claims against Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Peña claims to have borrowed PhP3,000,000 from one of his friends in order to maintain possession thereof on behalf of Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> According to him, although his creditor-friend granted him several extensions, he failed to pay his loan when it became due, and it later on became the subject of a separate collection suit for payment with interest and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This collection suit became the basis for Atty. Peña's request for discretionary execution pending appeal later on.<br><br>On 07 February 1995, within the four-month period allegedly agreed upon in the telephone conversation, Peña formally informed Urban Bank that it could already take possession of the Pasay property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> There was however no mention of the compensation due and owed to him for the services he had rendered.<br><br>On 31 March 1995, the bank subsequently took actual possession of the property and installed its own guards at the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Peña thereafter made several attempts to contact respondents Borlongan and Bejasa by telephone, but the bank officers would not take any of his calls. On 24 January 1996, or nearly a year after he turned over possession of the Pasay property, Peña formally demanded from Urban Bank the payment of the 10% compensation and attorney's fees allegedly promised to him during his telephone conversation with Borlongan for securing and maintaining peaceful possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><center><b style="text-decoration: underline;">Proceedings on the Complaint for Compensation</b><br></center><br>On 28 January 1996, when Urban Bank refused to pay for his services in connection with the Pasay property, Peña filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> for recovery of agent's compensation and expenses, damages and attorney's fees in RTC-Bago City in the province of Negros Occidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Interestingly, Peña sued only six out of the eleven members of the Board of the Directors of Urban Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> No reason was given why the six directors were selected and the others excluded from Peña's complaint. In fact, as pointed out, Atty. Peña mistakenly impleaded as a defendant, Ben Y. Lim, Jr., who was never even a member of the Board of Directors of Urban Bank; while, Ben T. Lim, Sr., father and namesake of Ben Y. Lim, Jr., who had been a director of the bank, already passed away in 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In response to the complaint of Atty.

On one end, the appellate court made a definitive ruling that <b>no agency relationship</b> existed at all between Peña and the bank, despite the services performed by Peña with respect to the Pasay property purchased by the bank. Although the Court of Appeals ruled against an award of agent's compensation, it still saw fit to award Peña with Ph3,000,000 for expenses incurred for his efforts in clearing the Pasay property of tenants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup>&nbsp; On the other extreme, the trial court heavily relied on the sole telephone conversation between Peña and Urban Bank's President to establish that the principal-agent relationship created between them included an agreement to pay Peña the <b>huge amount of PhP24,000,000</b>. In its defense, Urban Bank insisted that Peña was never an agent of the bank, but an agent of ISCI, since the latter, as seller of the Pasay property committed to transferring it free from tenants. Meanwhile, Peña argues on the basis of his successful and peaceful ejectment of the sub-tenants, who previously occupied the Pasay property.<br><br><b>Based on the evidence on records and the proceedings below, the Court concludes that Urban Bank constituted Atty. Peña as its agent to secure possession of the Pasay property. This conclusion, however, is not determinative of the basis of the amount of payment that must be made to him by the bank. The context in which the agency was created lays the basis for the amount of compensation Atty. Peña is entitled to. </b><br><br>The transactional history and context of the sale between ISCI and Urban Bank of the Pasay property, and Atty. Peña's participation in the transfer of possession thereof to Urban Bank provide crucial linkages that establish the nature of the relationship between the lawyer and the landowner-bank.<br><br>The evidence reveals that at the time that the Contract to Sell was executed on 15 November 1994, and even when the Deed of Absolute Sale was executed two weeks later on 29 November 1994, as far as Urban Bank was concerned, Peña was nowhere in the picture. All discussions and correspondences were between the President and Corporate Secretary of Urban Bank, on one hand, and the President of ISCI, on the other. The title to the Pasay property was transferred to Urban Bank on 5 December 1994. Interestingly, Peña testifies that it was only on 19 December 1994 that he learned that the land had already been sold by ISCI to Urban Bank, notwithstanding the fact that Peña was a director of ISCI. Peña was not asked to render any service for Urban Bank, neither did he perform any service for Urban Bank at that point.<br><br>ISCI undertook in the Contract to Sell, to physically deliver the property to Urban Bank, within 60 days from 29 November 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> under conditions of "full and actual possession and control ..., free from tenants, occupants, squatters or other structures or from any liens, encumbrances, easements or any other obstruction or impediment to the free use and occupancy by the buyer of the subject Property or its exercise of the rights to ownership over the subject Property...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> To guarantee this undertaking, ISCI agreed to the escrow provision where PhP25,000,000 (which is a little over 10% of the value of the Pasay property) would be withheld by Urban Bank from the total contract price until there is full compliance with this undertaking.<br><br>Apparently to ensure that ISCI is able to deliver the property physically clean to Urban Bank, it was ISCI's president, Enrique Montilla who directed on 26 November 1994 one of its directors, Peña, to immediately recover and take possession of the property upon expiration of the contract of lease on 29 November 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup> Peña thus first came into the picture as a director of ISCI who was constituted as its agent to recover the Pasay property against the lessee as well as the sub-tenants who were occupying the property in violation of the lease agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup> He was able to obtain possession of the property from the lessee on the following day, but the unauthorized sub-tenants refused to vacate the property.<br><br>It was only on 7 December 1994, that Urban Bank was informed of the services that Peña was rendering for ISCI. The faxed letter from ISCI's Marilyn Ong reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Atty. Magdaleno M. Peña, who has been assigned by Isabela Sugar Company, Inc., to take charge of inspecting the tenants</b> would like to request an authority similar to this from the Bank, as new owners. Can you please issue something like this today as he needs this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup></blockquote><br>Two days later, on 9 December 1994, ISCI sent Urban Bank another letter that reads:<br><br><blockquote>Dear Mr. Borlongan, I would like to request for an authorization from Urban Bank as per attached immediately - <b>as the tenants are questioning the authority of the people there who are helping us to take over possession of the property</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup></blockquote><br>It is clear from the above that ISCI was asking Urban Bank for help to comply with ISCI's own contractual obligation with the bank under the terms of the sale of the Pasay property. Urban Bank could have ignored the request, since it was exclusively the obligation of ISCI, as the seller, to deliver a clean property to Urban Bank without any help from the latter.<br><br>A full-bodied and confident interpretation of the contracts between ISCI and Urban Bank should have led the latter to inform the unauthorized sub-tenants that under its obligation as seller to Urban Bank, it was under duty and had continuing authority to recover clean possession of the property, despite the transfer of title. Yet, what unauthorized sub-tenant, especially in the kind of operations being conducted within the Pasay property, would care to listen or even understand such argument?<br><br>Urban Bank thus chose to cooperate with ISCI without realizing the kind of trouble that it would reap in the process. In an apparent attempt to allow the efforts of ISCI to secure the property to succeed, it recognized Peña's role in helping ISCI, but stopped short of granting him authority to act on its behalf. In response to the two written requests of ISCI, Urban Bank sent this letter to Peña on 15 December 1994:<br><br><blockquote>This is to advise you that we have noted the engagement of your services by Isabela Sugar Company to recover possession of the Roxas Boulevard property formerly covered by TCT No. 5382, effective November 29, 1994. <b>It is understood that your services have been contracted by and your principal remains to be the Isabela Sugar Company</b>, which as seller of the property and under the terms of our Contract to Sell dated November 29, 1994, has committed to deliver the full and actual possession of the said property to the buyer, Urban Bank, within the stipulated period. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Up to this point, it is unmistakable that Urban Bank was staying clear from making any contractual commitment to Peña and conveyed its sense that whatever responsibilities arose in retaining Peña were to be shouldered by ISCI.<br><br>According to the RTC-Bago City, in the reversed Decision, Atty. Peña only knew of the sale between ISCI and Urban Bank at the time the RTC-Pasay City recalled the TRO and issued a break-open order:<br><br><blockquote>"... when information reached the (Pasay City) judge that the Pasay property had already been transferred by ISCI to Urban Bank, the trial court recalled the TRO and issued a break-open order for the property. According to Peña, it was the first time that he was apprised of the sale of the land by ISCI and of the transfer of its title in favor of the bank."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup></blockquote><br>There is something contradictory between some of the trial court's factual findings and Peña's claim that it was only on 19 December 1994 that he first learned of the sale of the property to Urban Bank. It is difficult to believe Peña on this point considering: (1) that he was a board director of ISCI and a sale of this significant and valuable property of ISCI requires the approval of the board of directors of ISCI; and (2) that ISCI twice requested Urban Bank for authority to be issued in his favor (07 and 9 December 1994), 12 and 10 days before 19 December 1994, since it would be contrary to human experience for Peña not to have been informed by an officer of ISCI beforehand that a request for authority for him was being sent to Urban Bank.<br><br>The sequence of fast-moving developments, edged with a sense of panic, with respect to the decision of the RTC-Pasay City to recall the temporary restraining order and issue a break-open order on 19 December 1994 in the First Injunction Complaint, is highly enlightening to this Court.<br><br>First, Peña allegedly called up the president of ISCI, Montilla, who, according to Peña, confirmed to him that the Pasay property had indeed been sold to Urban Bank.<br><br>Second, Peña allegedly told Montilla that he (Peña) would be withdrawing his guards from the property because of the break-open order from the RTC-Pasay City.<br><br>Third, Montilla requested Peña to suspend the withdrawal of the guards while ISCI gets in touch with Urban Bank.<br><br>Fourth, apparently in view of Montilla's efforts, Bejasa, an officer of Urban Bank called Peña and according to the latter, told him that Urban Bank would continue retaining his services and for him to please continue with his effort to secure the property.<br><br>Fifth, this statement of Bejasa was not enough for Peña and he insisted that he be enabled to talk with no less than the President of Urban Bank, Borlongan. At this point, Bejasa gave him the phone number of Borlongan.<br><br>Sixth, immediately after the conversation with Bejasa, Peña calls Borlongan and tells Borlongan that violence might erupt in the property because the Pasay City policemen, who were sympathetic to the tenants, were threatening to force their way through the property.<br><br>At this point, if indeed this conversation took place, which Borlongan contests, what would have been the response of Borlongan? Any prudent president of a bank, which has just purchased a PhP240,000,000 property plagued by unauthorized and unruly sub-tenants of the previous owner, would have sought to continue the possession of ISCI, thru Peña, and he would have agreed to the reasonable requests of Peña. Borlongan could also have said that the problem of having the sub-tenants ejected is completely ISCI's and ISCI should resolve the matter on its own that without bothering the bank, with all its other problems. But the specter of violence, especially as night was approaching in a newly-bought property of Urban Bank, was not something that any publicly-listed bank would want publicized. To the extent that the violence could be prevented by the president of Urban Bank, it is expected that he would opt to have it prevented.<br><br>But could such response embrace the following legal consequences as Peña claims to have arisen from the telephone conversation with Borlongan: (1) A contract of agency was created between Peña and Urban Bank whereby Borlongan agreed to retain the services of Peña directly; (2) This contract of agency was to be embodied in a written letter of authority from Urban Bank; and (3) The agency fee of Peña was to be 10% of the market value as "attorney's fees and compensation" and reimbursement of all expenses of Peña from the time he took over the land until possession is turned over to Urban Bank.<br><br>This Court concludes that the legal consequences described in statements (1) and (2) above indeed took place and that the facts support them. However, the evidence does not support Peña's claim that Urban Bank agreed to "attorney's fees and compensation" of 10% of the market value of the property.<br><br>Urban Bank's letter dated 19 December 1994 confirmed in no uncertain terms Peña's designation as its authorized representative to secure and maintain possession of the Pasay property against the tenants. Under the terms of the letter, petitioner-respondent bank confirmed his engagement (a) "<b>to hold and maintain possession</b>" of the Pasay property; (b) "<b>to protect the same </b>from former tenants, occupants or any other person who are threatening to return to the said property and/or interfere with your possession of the said property for and in our behalf"; and (c) <b>to represent the bank in any instituted court action</b> intended to prevent any intruder from entering or staying in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup><br><br>These three express directives of petitioner-respondent bank's letter admits of no other construction than that a specific and special authority was given to Peña to act on behalf of the bank with respect to the latter's claims of ownership over the property against the tenants. Having stipulated on the due execution and genuineness of the letter during pretrial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> the bank is bound by the terms thereof and is subject to the necessary consequences of Peña's reliance thereon. No amount of denial can overcome the presumption that we give this letter - that it means what it says.<br><br>In any case, the subsequent actions of Urban Bank resulted in the ratification of Peña's authority as an agent acting on its behalf with respect to the Pasay property. By ratification, even an unauthorized act of an agent becomes an authorized act of the principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup><br><br>Both sides readily admit that it was Peña who was responsible for clearing the property of the tenants and other occupants, and who turned over possession of the Pasay property to petitioner-respondent bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> When the latter received full and actual possession of the property from him, it did not protest or refute his authority as an agent to do so. Neither did Urban Bank contest Peña's occupation of the premises, or his installation of security guards at the site, starting from the expiry of the lease until the property was turned over to the bank, by which time it had already been vested with ownership thereof. Furthermore, when Peña filed the Second Injunction Complaint in the RTC-Makati City under the name of petitioner-respondent bank, the latter did not interpose any objection or move to dismiss the complaint on the basis of his lack of authority to represent its interest as the owner of the property. When he successfully negotiated with the tenants regarding their departure from its Pasay property, still no protest was heard from it. After possession was turned over to the bank, the tenants accepted PhP1,500,000 from Peña, in "full and final settlement" of their claims against Urban Bank, and not against ISCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup><br><br>In all these instances, petitioner-respondent bank did not repudiate the actions of Peña, even if it was fully aware of his representations to third parties on its behalf as owner of the Pasay property. Its tacit acquiescence to his dealings with respect to the Pasay property and the tenants spoke of its intent to ratify his actions, as if these were its own. Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that it issued no written authority, and that the oral contract was not substantially established, the bank duly ratified his acts as its agent by its acquiescence and acceptance of the benefits, namely, the peaceful turnover of possession of the property free from sub-tenants.<br><br>Even if, however, Peña was constituted as the agent of Urban Bank, it does not necessarily preclude that a third party would be liable for the payment of the agency fee of Peña. Nor does it preclude the legal fact that Peña while an agent of Urban Bank, was also an agent of ISCI, and that his agency from the latter never terminated. This is because the authority given to Peña by both ISCI and Urban Bank was common - to secure the clean possession of the property so that it may be turned over to Urban Bank. This is an ordinary legal phenomenon - that an agent would be an agent for the purpose of pursuing a shared goal so that the common objective of a transferor and a new transferee would be met.<br><br>Indeed, the Civil Code expressly acknowledged instances when two or more principals have granted a power of attorney to an agent for a <b>common transaction</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> The agency relationship between an agent and two principals may even be considered extinguished if the object or the purpose of the agency is accomplished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> In this case, Peña's services as an agent of both ISCI and Urban Bank were engaged for one shared purpose or transaction, which was to deliver the property free from unauthorized sub-tenants to the new owner - a task that Peña was able to achieve and is entitled to receive payment for.<br><br>That the agency between ISCI and Peña continued, that ISCI is to shoulder the agency fee and reimbursement for costs of Peña, and that Urban Bank never agreed to pay him a 10% agency fee is established and supported by the following:<br><br>First, the initial agency relationship between ISCI and Peña persisted. No proof was ever offered that the letter of 26 November 1994 of Mr. Montilla of ISCI to Peña, for the latter "to immediately recover and take possession of the property upon expiration of the contract of lease on 29 November 1994" was terminated.&nbsp; It is axiomatic that the appointment of a new agent for the same business or transaction revokes the previous agency from the day on which notice thereof was given to the former agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> If it is true that the agency relationship was to be borne by Urban Bank alone, Peña should have demonstrated that his previous agency relationship with ISCI is incompatible with his new relationship with Urban Bank, and was thus terminated.<br><br>Second, instead, what is on the record is that ISCI confirmed the continuation of this agency between Peña and itself and committed to pay for the services of Peña, in its letter to Urban Bank dated 19 December 1994 which reads:<br><blockquote><br>In line with our warranties as the Seller of the said property and our undertaking to deliver to you the full and actual possession and control of said property, free from tenants, occupants or squatters and from any obstruction or impediment to the free use and occupancy of the property&nbsp; by Urban Bank, <b>we have engaged the services of Atty. Magdaleno M. Peña to hold and maintain possession of the property and to prevent the former tenants or occupants from entering or returning to the premises</b>. In view of the transfer of the ownership of the property to Urban Bank, it may be necessary for Urban Bank to appoint Atty. Peña likewise as its authorized representative for purposes of holding/maintaining continued possession of the said property and to represent Urban Bank in any court action that may be instituted for the abovementioned purposes.<br><br><b>It is understood that any attorney's fees, cost of litigation and any other charges or expenses that may be incurred relative to the exercise by Atty. Peña of his abovementioned duties shall be for the account of Isabela Sugar Company </b>and any loss or damage that may be incurred to third parties shall be answerable by Isabela Sugar Company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Third, Peña has never shown any written confirmation of his 10% agency fee, whether in a note, letter, memorandum or board resolution of Urban Bank. An agency fee amounting to PhP24,000,000 is not a trifling amount, and corporations do not grant their presidents unilateral authority to bind the corporation to such an amount, especially not a banking corporation which is closely supervised by the BSP for being a business seriously imbued with public interest. There is nothing on record except the self-serving testimony of Peña that Borlongan agreed to pay him this amount in the controverted telephone conversation.<br><br>Fourth, while ordinarily, uncontradicted testimony will be accorded its full weight, we cannot grant full probative value to the testimony of Peña for the following reasons: (a) Peña is not a credible witness for testifying that he only learned of the sale of the property of 19 December 1994 when the acts of ISCI, of Urban Bank and his own up to that point all indicated that he must have known about the sale to Urban Bank; and (b) it is incredible that Urban Bank will agree to add another PhP24,000,000 to the cost of the property by agreeing to the agency fee demanded by Peña. No prudent and reasonable person would agree to expose his corporation to a new liability of PhP24,000,000 even if, in this case, a refusal would lead to the Pasay City policemen and unauthorized sub-tenants entering the guarded property and would possibly erupt in violence.<br><br>Peña's account of an oral agreement with Urban Bank for the payment of PhP24,000,000 is just too much for any court to believe. Whatever may be the agreement between Peña and ISCI for compensation is not before this Court. This is not to say, however, that Urban Bank has no liability to Peña. It has. Payment to him is required because the Civil Code demands that no one should be unjustly enriched at the expense of another. This payment is to be measured by the standards of <i>quantum meruit</i>.<br><br><b><i>Amount of Compensation </i></b><br><br>Agency is presumed to be for compensation. But because in this case we find no evidence that Urban Bank agreed to pay Peña a specific amount or percentage of amount for his services, we turn to the principle against unjust enrichment and on the basis of <i>quantum meruit</i>.<br><br>Since there was no written agreement with respect to the compensation due and owed to Atty. Peña under the letter dated 19 December 1994, the Court will resort to determining the amount based on the well-established rules on <i>quantum meruit</i>.<br><br>Agency is presumed to be for compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> Unless the contrary intent is shown, a person who acts as an agent does so with the expectation of payment according to the agreement and to the services rendered or results effected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> We find that the agency of Peña comprised of services ordinarily performed by a lawyer who is tasked with the job of ensuring clean possession by the owner of a property. We thus measure what he is entitled to for the legal services rendered.<br><br>A stipulation on a lawyer's compensation in a written contract for professional services ordinarily controls the amount of fees that the contracting lawyer may be allowed to collect, unless the court finds the amount to be unconscionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup> In the absence of a written contract for professional services, the attorney's fees are fixed on the basis of <i>quantum meruit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup><i> i.e.</i>, the reasonable worth of the attorney's services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup>When an agent performs services for a principal at the latter's request, the law will normally imply a promise on the part of the principal to pay for the reasonable worth of those services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[278]</sup> The intent of a principal to compensate the agent for services performed on behalf of the former will be inferred from the principal's request for the agents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup><br><br>In this instance, no extra-ordinary skills employing advanced legal training nor sophisticated legal maneuvering were required to be employed in ejecting 23 sub-tenants who have no lease contract with the property owner, and whose only authority to enter the premises was unlawfully given by a former tenant whose own tenancy has clearly expired. The 23 sub-tenants operated beer houses and nightclubs, ordinary retail establishments for which no sophisticated structure prevented easy entry. After Peña succeeded in locking the gate of the compound, the sub-tenants would open the padlock and resume their businesses at night. Indeed, it appears that only security guards, chains and padlocks were needed to keep them out. It was only the alleged connivance of Pasay City policemen that Peña's ability to retain the possession was rendered insecure. And how much did it take Peña to enter into a settlement agreement with them and make all these problems go away? By Peña's own account, PhP1,500,000 only. That means that each tenant received an average of PhP65,217.40 only. Surely, the legal services of Peña cannot be much more than what the sub-tenants were willing to settle for in the first place. We therefore award him the equivalent amount of PhP1,500,000 for the legal and other related services he rendered to eject the illegally staying tenants of Urban Bank's property.<br><br>The Court of Appeals correctly reversed the trial court and found it to have acted with grave abuse of discretion in granting astounding monetary awards amounting to a total of PhP28,500,000 without any basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[280]</sup> For the lower court to have latched on to the self-serving claims of a telephone agreement as sufficient support for extending a multi-million peso award is highly irregular. Absent any clear basis for the amount of the lawyer's compensation, the trial court should have instinctively resorted to <i>quantum meruit</i>, instead of insisting on a figure with circumstantial and spurious justification.<br><br>We cannot also agree with the Decision penned by Judge Edgardo L. Catilo characterizing Pena's 10% fee as believable because it is nearly congruent to the PhP25 Million retention money held in escrow for ISCI until a clean physical and legal turn-over of the property is effected:<br><br><blockquote>We now come to the reasonableness of the compensation prayed for by the plaintiff which is 10% of the current market value which defendants claim to be preposterous and glaringly excessive. Plaintiff [Peña] testified that defendant Borlongan agreed to such an amount and this has not been denied by Ted Borlongan. The term "current market value of the property" is hereby interpreted by the court to mean the current market value of the property at the time the contract was entered into. To interpret it in accordance with the submission of the plaintiff that it is the current market value of the property at the time payment is made would be preposterous. The only evidence on record where the court can determine the market value of the property at the time the contract of agency was entered into between plaintiff and defendant is the consideration stated in the sales agreement between Isabela Sugar Company, Inc. and Urban bank which is P241,612,000.00. Ten percent of this amount is a reasonable compensation of the services rendered by the plaintiff considering the "no cure, no pay" arrangement between the parties and the risks which plaintiff had to undertake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[281]</sup></blockquote><br>In the first place, the Decision of Judge Catilo makes Peña's demand of an agency fee of PhP24 Million, an additional burden on Urban Bank. The Decision does not make the retention money responsible for the same, or acquit Urban Bank of any liability to ISCI if it pays the PhP24 Million directly to Pena instead of ISCI. In the second place, the amount of money that is retained by transferees of property transactions while the transferor is undertaking acts to ensure a clean and peaceful transfer to the transferee does not normally approximate a one-to-one relationship to the services of ejecting unwanted occupants. They may be inclusive of other costs, and not only legal costs, with enough allowances for contingencies, and may take into consideration other liabilities as well. The amount can even be entirely arbitrary, and may have been caused by the practice followed by Urban Bank as advised by its officers and lawyers or by industry practice in cases where an expensive property has some tenancy problems. In other words, Judge Catilo's statement is a <i>non sequitur</i>, is contrary to normal human experience, and sounds like an argument being made to fit Peña's demand for a shocking pay-out.<br><br>In any case, 10% of the purchase price of the Pasay property - a staggering PhP24,161,200 - is an <b>unconscionable amount</b>, which we find reason to reduce.&nbsp; Neither will the Court accede to the settlement offer of Peña to Urban Bank of at least PhP38,000,000 for alleged legal expenses incurred during the course of the proceedings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[282]</sup> an amount that he has not substantiated at any time.<br><br>Lawyering is not a business; it is a profession in which duty to public service, not money, is the primary consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[283]</sup> The principle of <i>quantum meruit</i> applies if lawyers are employed <b>without a price agreed upon for their services</b>, in which case they would be entitled to receive what they merit for their services, or as much as they have earned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[284]</sup> In fixing a reasonable compensation for the services rendered by a lawyer on the basis of <i>quantum meruit</i>, one may consider factors such as the time spent and extent of services rendered; novelty and difficulty of the questions involved; importance of the subject matter; skill demanded; probability of losing other employment as a result of acceptance of the proffered case; customary charges for similar services; amount involved in the controversy and the resulting benefits for the client; certainty of compensation; character of employment; and professional standing of the lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[285]</sup><br><br>Hence, the Court affirms the appellate court's award of PhP3,000,000 to Peña, for expenses incurred corresponding to the performance of his services. An additional award of PhP1,500,000 is granted to him for the services he performed as a lawyer in securing the rights of Urban Bank as owner of the Pasay property.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br><blockquote><b>The corporate officers and directors of Urban Bank are not solidarily or personally liable with their properties for the corporate liability of Urban Bank to Atty.

Absent any proof that individual petitioners as bank officers acted in bad faith or with gross negligence or assented to a patently unlawful act, they cannot be held solidarily liable together with the corporation for services performed by the latter's agent to secure possession of the Pasay property. Thus, the trial court had indeed committed grave abuse of discretion when it issued a ruling against the eight individual defendant bank directors and officers and its Decision should be absolutely reversed and set aside.<br><br>A corporation, as a juridical entity, may act only through its directors, officers and employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[286]</sup> Obligations incurred as a result of the acts of the directors and officers as corporate agents are not their personal liabilities but those of the corporation they represent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[287]</sup> To hold a director or an officer personally liable for corporate obligations, two requisites must concur: (1) the complainant must allege in the complaint that the director or officer assented to patently unlawful acts of the corporation, or that the officer was guilty of gross negligence or bad faith; and (2) the complainant must clearly and convincingly prove such unlawful acts, negligence or bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[288]</sup> "To hold a director, a trustee or an officer personally liable for the debts of the corporation and, thus, pierce the veil of corporate fiction, bad faith or gross negligence by the director, trustee or officer in directing the corporate affairs must be established clearly and convincingly."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[289]</sup><br><br>Peña failed to allege and convincingly show that individual defendant bank directors and officers assented to patently unlawful acts of the bank, or that they were guilty of gross negligence or bad faith. Contrary to his claim, the Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[290]</sup> in the lower court never alleged that individual defendants acquiesced to an unlawful act or were grossly negligent or acted in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[291]</sup> Neither is there any specific allegation of gross negligence or action in bad faith that is attributable to the individual defendants in performance of their official duties.<br><br>In any event, Peña did not adduce any proof that the eight individual defendants performed unlawful acts or were grossly negligent or in bad faith. Aside from the general allegation that they were corporate officers or members of the board of directors of Urban Bank, <b>no specific acts were alleged and proved to warrant a finding of solidary liability</b>. At most, petitioners Borlongan, Bejasa and Manuel were identified as those who had processed the agency agreement with Peña through their telephone conversations with him and/or written authorization letter.<br><br>Aside from Borlongan, Bejasa and Manuel, Atty. Peña in the complaint pointed to no specific act or circumstance to justify the inclusion of Delfin C. Gonzalez, Jr., Benjamin L. de Leon, P. Siervo H. Dizon, Eric L. Lee, and Ben T. Lim, Jr., except for the fact that they were members of the Board of Directors of Urban Bank at that time. That the five other members of the Board of Directors were excluded from Peña's complaint highlights the peculiarity of their inclusion. What is more, the complaint mistakenly included <b>Ben Y. Lim, Jr.</b>, who had not even been a member of the Board of Directors of Urban Bank. In any case, his father and namesake, Ben T. Lim, Sr., who had been a director of the bank at that time, had already passed away in 1997.<br><br>In ruling for the solidary liability of the other bank directors, the decision of the trial court hinged solely on the purported admission of Arturo Manuel, Jr., that the transactions with Atty. Peña were approved by the Board of Directors:<br><br><blockquote>In this case, plaintiff testified as to the personal participation of defendants Ted Borlongan and Corazon Bejasa in the subject transaction. On the other hand, with respect to the other defendants, it was the defendants themselves, through witness Arturo Manuel, Jr., <b>who admitted that all the transactions involved in this case were approved by the board of directors</b>.

That they assented to the transactions of the bank with respect to Atty. Peña's services without any showing that these corporate actions were patently unlawful or that the officers were guilty of gross negligence or bad faith is insufficient to hold them solidarily liable with Urban Bank. It seems absurd that the trial court will hold the impleaded selected members of the Board of Directors only, but not the others who also purportedly approved the transactions. Neither is the reason behind the finding of "solidariness" with Urban Bank in such liability explained at all. It is void for completely being devoid of facts and the law on which the finding of liability is based.<br><br>The Court of Appeals correctly rejected the claim of personal liability against the individual petitioners when it held as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The plaintiff-appellee's complaint before the court <i>a quo</i> does not point to any particular act of either one or all of the defendants-appellants that will subject them to personal liability.

Hence, We cannot allow the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[293]</sup></blockquote><br>Peña had argued that individual defendant bank directors and officers should be held personally and solidarily liable with petitioner-respondent bank, since they failed to argue for limited corporate liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[294]</sup> The trial court subscribed to his reasoning and held that the failure to resort to the said defense constituted a waiver on the part of individual defendants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[295]</sup> The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>As the complainant on the trial court level, Peña carried the burden of proving that the eight individual defendants performed specific acts that would make them personally liable for the obligations of the corporation. This he failed to do. He cannot capitalize on their alleged failure to offer a defense, when he had not discharged his responsibility of establishing their personal liabilities in the first place. This Court cannot sustain the individual liabilities of the bank officers when Peña, at the onset, has not persuasively demonstrated their assent to patently unlawful acts of the bank, or that they were guilty of gross negligence or bad faith, regardless of the weaknesses of the defenses raised. This is too basic a requirement that this Court must demand sufficient proof before we can disregard the separate legal personality of the corporation from its offices.<br><br>Hence, only Urban Bank, not individual defendants, is liable to pay Peña's compensation for services he rendered in securing possession of the Pasay property.

In addition, the trial court mistakenly anchored its astounding award of damages amounting PhP28,500,000 on the basis of the mere account of Atty. Peña of&nbsp; a telephone conversation, without even considering the surrounding circumstances and the sheer disproportion to the legal services rendered to the bank.<br><br>A void judgment never acquires finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[307]</sup> In contemplation of law, that void decision is deemed non-existent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[308]</sup> <i>Quod nullum est, nullum producit effectum</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[309]</sup> Hence, the validity of the execution pending appeal will ultimately hinge on the court's findings with respect to the decision in which the execution is based.<br><br>Although discretionary execution can proceed independently while the appeal on the merits is pending, the outcome of the main case will greatly impact the execution pending appeal, especially in instances where as in this case, there is a complete reversal of the trial court's decision.

Execution pending appeal is an extraordinary remedy allowed only when there are reasons to believe that the judgment debtor will not be able to satisfy the judgment debt if the appeals process will still have to be awaited. It requires proof of circumstances such as insolvency or attempts to escape, abscond or evade a just debt.<br><br>In <i>Florendo v. Paramount Insurance, Corp</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[312]</sup> the Court explained that the execution pending appeal is an exception to the general rule that execution issues as a matter of right, when a judgment has become final and executory:<br><br><blockquote>As such exception, the court's discretion in allowing it must be <b>strictly construed</b> and firmly grounded on the existence of good reasons. <b>"Good reasons," it has been held, consist of compelling circumstances that justify immediate execution lest the judgment becomes illusory</b>. The circumstances must be superior, outweighing the injury or damages that might result should the losing party secure a reversal of the judgment. Lesser reasons would make of execution pending appeal, instead of an instrument of solicitude and justice, a tool of oppression and inequity. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Indeed, the presence or the absence of good reasons remains the yardstick in allowing the remedy of execution pending appeal, which should consist of exceptional circumstances of such urgency as to outweigh the injury or damage that the losing party may suffer, should the appealed judgment be reversed later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[313]</sup> Thus, the Court held that even the financial distress of the prevailing company is not sufficient reason to call for execution pending appeal:<br><br><blockquote>In addressing this issue, the Court must stress that the execution of a judgment before its finality must be founded upon good reasons. The yardstick remains the presence or the absence of good reasons consisting of exceptional circumstances of such urgency as to outweigh the injury or damage that the losing party may suffer, should the appealed judgment be reversed later. Good reason imports a superior circumstance that will outweigh injury or damage to the adverse party. In the case at bar, petitioner failed to show "paramount and compelling reasons of urgency and justice." Petitioner cites as good reason merely the fact that "it is a small-time building contractor that could ill-afford the protracted delay in the reimbursement of the advances it made for the aforesaid increased costs of . . . construction of the [respondent's] buildings."<br><br><b>Petitioner's allegedly precarious financial condition, however, is not by itself a jurisprudentially compelling circumstance warranting immediate execution</b>. The financial distress of a juridical entity is not comparable to a case involving a natural person -- such as a very old and sickly one without any means of livelihood, an heir seeking an order for support and monthly allowance for subsistence, or one who dies.<br><br>Indeed, the alleged financial distress of a corporation does not outweigh the long standing general policy of enforcing only final and executory judgments. Certainly, a juridical entity like petitioner corporation has, other than extraordinary execution, alternative remedies like loans, advances, internal cash generation and the like to address its precarious financial condition. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Philippine Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[314]</sup> the Court denied execution pending appeal to a juridical entity which allegedly was in financial distress and was facing civil and criminal suits with respect to the collection of a sum of money. It ruled that the financial distress of the prevailing party in a final judgment which was still pending appeal may not be likened to the situation of a natural person who is ill, of advanced age or dying as to justify execution pending appeal:<br><br><blockquote>It is significant to stress that private respondent Falcon is a juridical entity and not a natural person. <b>Even assuming that it was indeed in financial distress and on the verge of facing civil or even criminal suits, the immediate execution of a judgment in its favor pending appeal cannot be justified as Falcon's situation may not be likened to a case of a natural person who may be ill or may be of advanced age</b>. <b>Even the danger of extinction of the corporation will not <i>per se</i> justify a discretionary execution</b> unless there are showings of other good reasons, such as for instance, impending insolvency of the adverse party or the appeal being patently dilatory. But even as to the latter reason, it was noted in <i>Aquino vs. Santiago</i> (161 SCRA 570 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1988]</sup>), that it is not for the trial judge to determine the merit of a decision he rendered as this is the role of the appellate court. Hence, it is not within competence of the trial court, in resolving a motion for execution pending appeal, to rule that the appeal is patently dilatory and rely on the same as its basis for finding good reason to grant the motion. Only an appellate court can appreciate the dilatory intent of an appeal as an additional good reason in upholding an order for execution pending appeal which may have been issued by the trial court for other good reasons, or in cases where the motion for execution pending appeal is filed with the appellate court in accordance with Section 2, paragraph (a), Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Court.<br><br>What is worse, only one case was actually filed against Falcon and this is the complaint for collection filed by Solidbank. The other cases are "impending", so it is said. <b>Other than said Solidbank case, Falcon's survival as a body corporate cannot be threatened by anticipated litigation</b>. This notwithstanding, and even assuming that there was a serious threat to Falcon's continued corporate existence, we hold that it is not tantamount nor even similar to an impending death of a natural person. The material existence of a juridical person is not on the same plane as that of human life. The survival of a juridical personality is clearly outweighed by the long standing general policy of enforcing only final and executory judgments. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In this case, the trial court supported its discretionary grant of execution based on the alleged collection suit filed against Peña by his creditor friend for PhP3,000,000:<br><br><blockquote>It has been established that the plaintiff secured the loan for the purpose of using the money to comply with the mandate of defendant bank to hold and maintain possession of the parcel of land in Pasay City and to prevent intruders and former tenants from occupying the said property. The purpose of the loan was very specific and the same was made known to defendant bank through defendant Teodoro Borlongan. The loan was not secured for some other purpose. Truth to tell, the plaintiff accomplished his mission in clearing the property of tenants, intruders and squatters, long before the deadline given him by the defendant bank. The plaintiff was assured by no less than the President of defendant bank of the availability of funds for his compensation and reimbursement of his expenses. Had he been paid by defendant bank soon after he had fulfilled his obligation, he could have settled his loan obligation with his creditor.<br><br>Defendants were benefitted by the services rendered by the plaintiff. While plaintiff has complied with the undertaking, the defendants, however, failed to perform their obligation to the plaintiff.<br><br><b>The plaintiff stands to suffer greatly if the collection case against him is not addressed. Firstly, as shown in Exhibit "C", plaintiff's total obligation with Roberto Ignacio as of May 1999 is PhP24,192,000.00. This amount, if left unpaid, will continue to increase due to interest charges being imposed by the creditor to the prejudice of plaintiff.</b> Secondly, a preliminary attachment has already been issued and this would restrict the plaintiff from freely exercising his rights over his property during the pendency of the case.<br><br>In their opposition, defendants claim that plaintiff's indebtedness is a ruse, however, defendants failed to adduce evidence to support its claim.<br><br>The court finds that the pendency of the case for collection of money against plaintiff is a good reason for immediate execution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[315]</sup></blockquote><br>The mere fact that Atty. Peña was already subjected to a collection suit for payment of the loan proceeds he used to perform his services for Urban Bank is not an acceptable reason to order the execution pending appeal against the bank. Financial distress arising from a lone collection suit and not due to the advanced age of the party is not an urgent or compelling reason that would justify the immediate levy on the properties of Urban Bank pending appeal. That Peña would made liable in the collection suit filed by his creditor-friend would not reasonably result in rendering illusory the final judgment in the instant action for agent's compensation.<br><br>Peña's purported difficulty in paying the loan proceeds used to perform his services does not outweigh the injury or damages that might result should Urban Bank obtain a reversal of the judgment, as it did in this case. Urban Bank even asserts that the collection suit filed against Peña was a mere ruse to provide justification for the execution pending appeal, no matter how flimsy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[316]</sup> As quoted above, the trial court noted Atty. Peña's total obligation to his creditor-friend as of May 1999 was already the incredible amount of PhP24,192,000.00, even when the Complaint dated 03 April 1999 itself, which spawned the collection suit included only a prayer for payment of PhP3,500,000 with attorney's fees of PhP100,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[317]</sup> It seems absurd that Atty. Peña would agree to obtaining a loan from his own friend, when the Promissory Notes provided for a penalty of 5% interest per month or 60% per annum for delay in the payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[318]</sup> It sounds more like a creative justification of the immediate execution of the PhP28.5 Million judgment notwithstanding the appeal.<br><br>In fact, the Court of Appeals noted Atty. Peña's admission of sufficient properties to answer for any liability arising from the collection suit arising from his creditor-friend. In initially denying the execution pending appeal, the appellate court held that:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, private respondent's claim that the only way he could pay his indebtedness to Roberto Ignacio is through the money that he expects to receive from petitioners in payment of his services is belied by his testimony at the hearing conducted by the trial court on the motion for execution pending appeal wherein petitioners were able to secure an admission from him that he has some assets which could be attached by Roberto Ignacio and that he would probably have other assets left even after the attachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[319]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, to rule that a pending collection suit against Atty. Peña, which has not been shown to result in his insolvency, would be to encourage judgment creditors to indirectly and indiscriminately instigate collection suits or cite pending actions, related or not, as a "good reason" to routinely avail of the remedy of discretionary execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[320]</sup> As an exception to the general rule on execution after final and executory judgment, the reasons offered by Atty. Peña to justify execution pending appeal must be strictly construed.<br><br>Neither will the Court accept the trial court's unfounded assumption that Urban Bank's appeal was merely dilatory, as in fact, the PhP28,500,000 award given by the trial court was overturned by the appellate court and eventually by this Court.<br><br>Moreover, at the time the Special Order of Judge Henry Trociño of the RTC-Bago City came out in 1999, Urban Bank had assets worth more than PhP11 Billion and had a net worth of more than PhP2 Billion. There was no reason then to believe that Urban Bank could not satisfy a judgment of PhP28,500,000, a sum that was only 1% of its net worth, and 1/5 of 1% of its total assets of PhP11,933,383,630.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[321]</sup> Urban Bank was even given a Solvency, Liquidity and Management Rating of 82.89 over 100 by no less than the BSP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[322]</sup> and reportedly had liquid assets amounting to PhP2,036,878.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[323]</sup> In fact, no allegation of impending insolvency or attempt to abscond was ever raised by Atty. Peña and yet, the trial court granted execution pending appeal.<br><br>Since the original order granting execution pending appeal was completely void for containing no justifiable reason, it follows that any affirmance of the same by the Court of Appeals is likewise void.<br><br>The Decision of the Court of Appeals in the case docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 55667, finding a new reason for granting execution pending appeal, <i>i.e</i>., the receivership of Urban Bank, is likewise erroneous, notwithstanding this Court's ruling in <i>Lee v.

Trocino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[325]</sup> we directly resolve the issue of the insufficiency of the reasons that led to the grant of execution pending appeal.<br><br>In cases where the two or more defendants are made subsidiarily or solidarily liable by the final judgment of the trial court, discretionary execution can be allowed if <b>all the defendants</b> have been found to be insolvent. Considering that only Urban Bank, and not the other eight individual defendants, was later on considered by the Court of Appeals to have been "in danger of insolvency," is not sufficient reason to allow execution pending appeal, since the liability for the award to Peña was made (albeit, mistakenly) solidarily liable together with the bank officers.<br><br>In <i>Flexo Manufacturing Corp. v. Columbus Food, Inc., and Pacific Meat Company, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[326]</sup> both Columbus Food, Inc., (Columbus Food) and Pacific Meat Company, Inc., (Pacific Meat) were found by the trial court therein to be solidarily liable to Flexo Manufacturing, Inc., (Flexo Manufacturing) for the principal obligation of PhP2,957,270.00. The lower court also granted execution pending appeal on the basis of the insolvency of Columbus Food, <b>even if Pacific Meat was not found to be insolvent</b>. Affirming the reversal ordered by the Court of Appeals, this Court ruled that since there was another party who was solidarily liable to pay for the judgment debt, aside from the insolvent Columbus Food, there was no good reason to allow the execution pending appeal:<br><br><blockquote>Regarding the state of insolvency of Columbus, the case of <i>Philippine National Bank v. Puno</i>, held:<br><br><blockquote>"While this Court in several cases has held that insolvency of the judgment debtor or imminent danger thereof is a good reason for discretionary execution, otherwise to await a final and executory judgment may not only diminish but may nullify all chances for recovery on execution from said judgment debtor, We are constrained to rule otherwise in this particular case. <b>In the aforecited cases, there was either only one defeated party or judgment debtor who was, however, insolvent or there were several such parties but all were insolvent, hence the aforesaid rationale for discretionary execution was present</b>. In the case at bar, it is undisputed that, assuming MMIC is insolvent, its co-defendant PNB is not. <b>It cannot, therefore, be plausibly assumed that the judgment might become illusory; if MMIC cannot satisfy the judgment, PNB will answer for it.</b> It will be observed that, under the dispositive portion of the judgment hereinbefore quoted, the liability of PNB is either subsidiary or solidary.<br></blockquote><br><b>Thus, when there are two or more defendants and one is not insolvent, the insolvency of a co-defendant is not a good reason to justify execution pending appeal if their liability under the judgment is either subsidiary or solidary</b>. In this case, Pacific was adjudged to be solidarily liable with Columbus. Therefore, the latter is not the only party that may be answerable to Flexo. <b>Its insolvency does not amount to a good reason to grant execution pending appeal</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Similarly, the trial court in this case found Urban Bank and all eight individual bank officers solidarily liable to Atty. Peña for the payment of the PhP28,500,000 award. Hence, had the judgment been upheld on appeal, Atty. Peña could have demanded payment from any of the nine defendants. Thus, it was a mistake for the Court of Appeals to have affirmed execution pending appeal based solely on the receivership of Urban Bank, when there were eight other individual defendants, who were solidarily liable but were not shown to have been insolvent.&nbsp; Since Urban Bank's co-defendants were not found to have been insolvent, there was no good reason for the Court of Appeals to immediately order execution pending appeal, since Atty. Peña's award could have been satisfied by the eight other defendants, especially when the de Leon Group filed its supersedeas bond.<br><br>It seems incongruous for Atty. Peña to be accorded the benefit of erroneously impleading several bank directors, who had no direct hand in the transaction, but at the same time, concentrating solely on Urban Bank's inability to pay to justify execution pending appeal, regardless of the financial capacity of its other co-defendants. Worse, he capitalized on the insolvency and/or receivership of Urban Bank to levy or garnish properties of the eight other individual defendants, who were never shown to have been incapable of paying the judgment debt in the first place. The disposition on the execution pending appeal may have been different had Atty. Peña filed suit against Urban Bank alone minus the bank officers and the same bank was found solely liable for the award and later on declared under receivership.<br><br>In addition, a judgment creditor of a bank, which has been ordered by the BSP to be subject of receivership, has to fall in line like every other creditor of the bank and file its claim under the proper procedures for banks that have been taken over by the PDIC. Under Section 30 of Republic Act No. 7653, otherwise known as the New Central Bank Act,&nbsp; which prevailed at that time, once a bank is under receivership, the receiver shall immediately gather and take charge of all the assets and liabilities of the bank and administer the same for the benefit of its creditors and all of the bank's assets shall be considered as under <i>custodial legis</i> and exempt from any order of garnishment, levy, attachment or execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[327]</sup> In the Minute Resolution of the Monetary Board of the BSP, Urban Bank was not only prevented from doing business in the Philippines but its asset and affairs were placed under receivership as provided for under the same law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[328]</sup> In fact, even Peña himself assured the PDIC, as receiver of Urban Bank, that he would not schedule or undertake execution sales of the bank's assets for as long as the bank remains in receivership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[329]</sup> Until the approval of the rehabilitation or the initiation of the liquidation proceedings, all creditors of the bank under receivership shall stand on equal footing with respect to demanding satisfaction of their debts, and cannot be extended preferred status by an execution pending appeal with respect to the bank's assets:<br><br><blockquote>... [t]o execute the judgment would unduly deplete the assets of respondent bank to the obvious prejudice of other creditors. After the Monetary Board has declared that a bank is insolvent and has ordered it to cease operations, the Board becomes the trustee of its assets for the equal benefit of all the depositors and creditors. After its insolvency, one creditor cannot obtain an advantage or preference over another by an attachment, execution or otherwise. <b>Until there is an approved rehabilitation or the initiation of the liquidation proceedings, creditors of the bank stand on equal footing with respect to demanding satisfaction of their debts, and cannot be afforded special treatment by an execution pending appeal with respect to the bank's assets</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[330]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Moreover, assuming that the CA was correct in finding a reason to justify the execution pending appeal because of the supervening event of Urban Bank's closure, the assumption by the EIB of the liabilities of Urban Bank meant that any execution pending appeal can be granted only if EIB itself is shown to be unable to satisfy Peña's judgment award of PhP28,500,000. That is not at all the case. In just one particular sale on execution herein, EIB offered to answer in cash for a substantial part of Peña's claims, as evidenced by EIB's capacity and willingness to redeem the executed properties (condominium units sold to intervenor Unimega) by tendering manager's checks for more than PhP22 Million<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[331]</sup> which is already 77.57% of Peña's total award from the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[332]</sup> The fact that EIB's offer to take over Urban Bank means it was able to satisfy the BSP's concern that all legitimate liabilities of Urban Bank be duly discharged.<br><br>As an exception to the general rule that only final judgments may be executed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[333]</sup> the grant of execution pending appeal must perforce be based on "good reasons." These reasons must consist of compelling or superior circumstances demanding urgency which will outweigh the injury or damages suffered, should the losing party secure a reversal of the judgment or final order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[334]</sup> The circumstances that would reasonably justify superior urgency, demanding interim execution of Peña's claims for compensation and/or damages, have already been settled by the financial capacity of the eight other co-defendants, the approval of the supersedeas bonds, the subsequent takeover by EIB, and the successor bank's stable financial condition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[335]</sup> which can answer for the judgment debt. Thus, Peña's interest as a judgment creditor is already well-protected.<br><br>While there is a general rule that a final and executory judgment in the main case will render moot and academic a petition questioning the exercise of the trial court's discretion in allowing execution pending appeal, we find it necessary to rule categorically on this question because of the magnitude of the aberrations that attended the execution pending appeal in the Decision of the RTC-Bago City.<br><br><b>Irregularities in the Levy and Sale <br>on Execution Pending Appeal</b><br><br>Assuming that the Special Order granting execution pending appeal were valid, issues have been raised on alleged irregularities that mar the levy and sale on execution of the properties of Urban Bank and its officers and directors. Many of the facts have not been sufficiently litigated before the trial and appellate courts for us to fully rule on the issue, nevertheless, from what is on record, the following are the observations of this Court:<br><br>First, contrary to the general rules on execution, no opportunity was given to Urban Bank or the other co-defendants to pay the judgment debt in cash or certified check.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[336]</sup> Before proceeding on the levying and garnishing personal and real properties, demand must be made by the sheriff against the judgment debtors, Urban Bank and the eight other individual bank officers, for the immediate payment of the award subject of the execution pending appeal. It has not been shown whether Urban Bank and its officers and directors were afforded such an opportunity.&nbsp; Instead of garnishing personal properties of the bank, the sheriff inexplicably proceeded to levy substantial real properties of the bank and its officers at the onset.<br><br>Second, assuming that Urban Bank and its officers did not possess sufficient cash or funds to pay for the judgment debt pending appeal, they should have been given the option to choose which of their properties to be garnished and/or levied. In this case, Urban Bank exercised its option by presenting to the sheriff various parcels of land, whose values amount to more than PhP76,882,925 and were sufficient to satisfy the judgment debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[337]</sup> Among those presented by the bank, only the property located in Tagaytay was levied upon by the sheriff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[338]</sup> No sufficient reason was raised why the bank's chosen properties were rejected or inadequate for purposes of securing the judgment debt pending appeal. Worse, the Sheriff proceeded with garnishing and levying on as many properties of Urban Bank and its officers, in disregard of their right to choose under the rules.<br><br>Third, the public auction sales conducted in the execution pending appeal sold more properties of Urban Bank and the directors than what was sufficient to satisfy the debt. Indeed, the conservative value of the properties levied herein by the sheriff amounting to more than <b>PhP181,919,190</b>, consisting of prime condominium units in the heart of the Makati Business district, a lot in Tagaytay City, shares in exclusive clubs, and shares of stock, among others, was more than sufficient to answer for the <b>PhP28,500,000</b> judgment debt six times over. Rather than stop when the properties sold had approximated the monetary award, the execution sale pending appeal continued and unduly benefitted Atty. Peña, who, as judgment creditor and, at times, the winning bidder, purchased most of the properties sold.<br><br>Fourth, it was supremely disconcerting how Urban Bank, through its successor EIB, was unduly deprived of the opportunity to redeem the properties, even after presenting manager's checks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[339]</sup> equal to the purchase price of the condominium units sold at the execution sale. No reason was offered by the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[340]</sup> or the sheriff<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[341]</sup> for rejecting the redemption price tendered by EIB in order to recover the properties executed and sold in public auction pending appeal.<br><br>Finally, the Court cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that there was already a sufficient supersedeas bond given to answer for whatever monetary award will be given in the end. To recall, the De Leon Group had already tendered a supersedeas bond of PhP40,000,000 in the Court of Appeals to prevent execution pending appeal over their properties. In fact, even Urban Bank tendered a separate supersedeas bond of equal amount with this Court, for a total of PhP80,000,000 to secure any judgment to be awarded to Atty. Peña. That execution sales over the properties of judgment debtors proceeded despite the three-fold value of securities compared to the amount of the award indicates bad faith, if not malice, with respect to the conduct of the execution pending appeal.<br><br>Inasmuch as the RTC Decision has already been vacated and an independent finding has been made by this Court of the complete nullity of the order granting execution pending appeal, it follows that all acts pursuant to such order and its writ are also void. It does not follow however, that the Court's Decision in <i>Co v. Sillador</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[342]</sup> is nullified, inasmuch as an equally-important legal doctrine - the immutability of Supreme Court final decisions - is also to be considered. In any case, the factual circumstances and the ruling on that case were limited to the actions of Sheriff Allan Sillador with respect to properties levied under the same Special Order and Writ of Execution, which were subject of third party claims made by the spouses of Teodoro Borlongan, Corazon Bejasa and Arturo Manuel, Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[343]</sup> It does not encompass other specific events and acts committed in the course of the execution pending appeal that may warrant administrative or disciplinary actions. Having said that, this Court leaves it to the parties to explore avenues for redress in such a situation.<br><br>The observation on the irregularities above-enumerated are made for the purpose of correcting the injustice that has been committed herein, by allowing the Court to pursue the question of who was responsible for such gross violation of the rules on execution, and for the Court to find measures to improve the safeguards against abuse of court processes. It is for this reason that the Office of the Court Administrator will be given a special task by the Court on this matter. Judge Henry Trocino of RTC-Bago City, who issued the Special Order and had supervisory authority over the proceedings of the execution pending appeal, would have been included under such administrative investigation by the Office of the Court Administrator, were it not for his retirement from the judicial service.<br><br><i>The Court's Suspension Order <br>of Execution Pending Appeal</i><br><br>Acting on Atty.

This Order was affirmed by the same Division as its duly-promulgated order. In relation to this, the affirmation by the Division of this Order demonstrates that there is no truth to Atty.

Peña's claim of undue interest against Justice Carpio specifically with respect to the latter having the instant case transferred to his new Division, is based on ignorance of the system of assignment of cases in the Supreme Court.&nbsp; When a reorganization of the Court takes place in the form of a change in the composition of Divisions, due to the retirement or loss of a member, the Justices do not thereby lose their case assignments but bring the latter with them to their new Divisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[348]</sup> The cases are then transferred to the Justices' new Divisions, by way of the corresponding request from each justice. Each justice is in fact, required to make this request, otherwise the <i>rollo</i> of the cases of which he is Member-in-Charge will be retained by a Division in which he is no longer a member. Indeed, Atty. Peña's imagination has gotten the better of him.<br><br>Thirdly, his insinuation (which he denies) that Justice Carpio may have been bribed because the latter has a new Mercedes Benz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[349]</sup> is highly offensive and has no place where his points should have been confined to legal reasons and arguments.<br><br>Incidentally, Atty. Peña has voiced the fear in the Letter of Complaint filed in the Court's Committee on Ethics and Ethical Standards,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[350]</sup> which he brought against the <i>ponente</i> of this Decision, that she will suppress material information regarding the issuance of the Order suspending the redemption period because of her close relationship to Justice Carpio. Contrary to this fear, this Decision is frontally disposing of this claim by stating that there is no basis to believe that the questioned Order was anything than the joint decision of the five members of the then First Division, and that his arguments in his motion to reconsider does not persuade this Court to vary in any form the questioned order. Moreover, our disposition of this case renders moot his motion to reconsider the order.<br><br>It must be emphasized that the prolonged resolution of the procedural issue in the Petitions in G. R. Nos. 145817 and 145822 on the execution pending appeal is due in no small part to the delays arising from Peña's peculiar penchant for filing successive motions for inhibition and re-raffle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[351]</sup> The Court cannot sanction Peña's repeated requests for voluntary inhibition of members of the Court based on the sole ground of his own self-serving allegations of lack of faith and trust, and would like to reiterate, at this point, the policy of the Court not to tolerate acts of litigants who, for just about any conceivable reason, seek to disqualify a judge (or justice) for their own purpose, under a plea of bias, hostility, prejudice or prejudgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[352]</sup> The Court cannot allow the unnecessary and successive requests for inhibition, lest it opens the floodgates to forum-shopping where litigants look for a judge more friendly and sympathetic to their cause than previous ones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[353]</sup><br><br><i>Restitution of the Bank's Executed Properties</i><br><br>The Court is still confronted with the supervening acts related to the execution pending appeal and the reversal of the award of damages, which affect the rights of the parties as well as of the intervenors to the case, specifically, intervenor Unimega. In completely resolving the differing claims and performing its educational function, the Court shall briefly encapsulate and restate the operational rules governing execution pending appeal when there has been a reversal of the trial court's Decision on the award of damages in order to guide the parties as well as the bench and bar in general. The necessity of making these detailed instructions is prompted by the most natural question an ordinary person with a sense of justice will ask after reading the facts: How can an obligation to pay for the services of a lawyer so that 23 unwanted tenants leave a corporation's property lead to&nbsp;&nbsp; the loss or the impairment of use of more than <b>PhP181 Million</b> worth of properties of that corporation and of its officers and directors? Obviously, this Court must undertake corrective actions swiftly.<br><br>The rule is that, where the executed judgment is reversed totally or partially, or annulled - on appeal or otherwise - the trial court may, on motion, issue such orders of restitution or reparation of damages as equity and justice may warrant under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[354]</sup> The Rules of Court precisely provides for restitution according to equity, in case the executed judgment is reversed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[355]</sup> "In an execution pending appeal, funds are advanced by the losing party to the prevailing party with <b>the implied obligation of the latter to repay the former, in case the appellate court cancels or reduces the monetary award</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[356]</sup><br><br>In disposing of the main case subject of these Petitions, the Court totally reversed the staggering amount of damages given by the trial court, and limited on a <i>quantum meruit</i> basis the agent's compensation to PhP4,500,000 only. However, properties of Urban Bank and individual petitioners have been garnished and levied upon in the amount of supposedly more than PhP85,399,350.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[357]</sup><br><br>Applying the foregoing rules, petitioner-respondent bank is entitled to complete and full restitution of its levied properties, subject to the payment of the PhP4,500,000. Meanwhile, petitioners bank officers, all of whom have not been found individually or solidarily liable, are entitled to full restitution of all their properties levied upon and garnished, since they have been exonerated from corporate liability with respect to the bank's agency relationship with Peña.<br><br>Considering the monetary award to Peña and the levy on and execution of some of its properties pending appeal, Urban Bank, now EIB, may satisfy the judgment in the main case and at the same time fully recover all the properties executed owing to the complete reversal of the trial court's awarded damages. It must immediately and fully pay the judgment debt before the entire lot of levied properties, subject of the execution pending appeal, is restored to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[358]</sup><br><br>Due to the complete reversal of the trial court's award for damages, which was the basis of the Special Order and Writ of Execution allowing execution pending appeal, intervenor Unimega and other bidders who participated in the public auction sales are liable to completely restore to petitioner-respondent bank all of the properties sold and purchased therein. Although execution pending appeal is sanctioned under the rules and jurisprudence, when the executed decision is reversed, the premature execution is considered to have lost its legal bases. The situation necessarily requires equitable restitution to the party prejudiced thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[359]</sup> As a matter of principle, courts are authorized at any time to order the return of property erroneously ordered to be delivered to one party, if the order is found to have been issued without jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[360]</sup><br><br>As a purchaser of properties under an execution sale, with an appeal on the main case still pending, intervenor Unimega knew or was bound to know that its title to the properties, purchased in the premature public auction sale, was contingent on the outcome of the appeal and could possibly be reversed. Until the judgment on the main case on which the execution pending appeal hinges is rendered final and executory in favor of the prevailing judgment creditor, it is incumbent on the purchasers in the execution sale to preserve the levied properties. They shall be personally liable for their failure to do so, especially if the judgment is reversed, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[361]</sup> In fact, if specific restitution becomes impracticable - such as when the properties pass on to innocent third parties - the losing party in the execution even becomes liable for the full value of the property at the time of its seizure, with interest. The Court has ruled:<br><br><blockquote>When a judgment is executed pending appeal and subsequently overturned in the appellate court, the party who moved for immediate execution should, upon return of the case to the lower court, be required to make specific restitution of such property of the prevailing party as he or any person acting in his behalf may have acquired at the execution sale. <b>If specific restitution becomes impracticable, the losing party in the execution becomes liable for the full value of the property at the time of its seizure, with interest</b>.<br><br>While the trial court may have acted judiciously under the premises, its action resulted in grave injustice to the private respondents. It cannot be gainsaid that it is incumbent upon the plaintiffs in execution (Arandas) to return whatever they got by means of the judgment prior to its reversal. <b>And if perchance some of the properties might have passed on to innocent third parties as happened in the case at bar, the Arandas are duty bound nonetheless to return the corresponding value of said properties as mandated by the Rules</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[362]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, the rights of intervenor Unimega to the 10 condominium units bought during the public auction sale under the Special Order are rendered nugatory by the reversal of the award of unconscionable damages by the trial court. It cannot claim to be an innocent third-party purchaser of the levied condominium units, since the execution sale was precisely made pending appeal. It cannot simply assume that whatever inaction or delay was incurred in the process of the appeal of the main Decision would<br> automatically render the remedy dilatory in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[363]</sup> Whatever rights were acquired by intervenor Unimega from the execution sale under the trial court's Special Orders are conditional on the final outcome of the appeal in the main case. Unlike in auction sales arising from final and executory judgments, both the judgment creditor and the third parties who participate in auction sales pending appeal are deemed to knowingly assume and voluntarily accept the risks of a possible reversal of the decision in the main case by the appellate court.<br><br>Therefore, intervenor Unimega is required to restore the condominium units to Urban Bank. Although the intervenor has caused the annotation of the sale and levied on the titles to those units, the titles have remained under the name of the bank, owing to the supersedeas bond it had filed and the Court's own orders that timely suspended the transfer of the titles and further execution pending appeal.<br><br>The obligation to restore the properties to petitioner-respondent bank is, however, without prejudice to the concurrent right of intervenor Unimega to the return of the PhP10,000,000 the latter paid for the condominium units, which Peña received as judgment creditor in satisfaction of the trial court's earlier Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[364]</sup> Consequently, intervenor's earlier request for the issuance of a writ of possession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[365]</sup> over those units no longer has any leg to stand on. Not being entitled to a writ of possession under the present circumstances, Unimega's <i>ex parte</i> petition is consequently denied.<br><br>Upon the reversal of the main Decision, the levied properties itself, subject of execution pending appeal must be returned to the judgment debtor, if those properties are still in the possession of the judgment creditor, plus compensation to the former for the deprivation and the use thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[366]</sup>&nbsp; The obligation to return the property itself is likewise imposed on a third-party purchaser, like intervenor Unimega, in cases wherein it <b>directly participated in the public auction sale</b>, and the <b>title to the executed property has not yet been transferred</b>. The third-party purchaser shall, however, be entitled to reimbursement from the judgment creditor, with interest.<br><br>Considering the foregoing points, the Court adopts with modification the rules of restitution expounded by retired Justice Florenz D. Regalado in his seminal work on civil procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[367]</sup> which the appellate court itself cited earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[368]</sup> In cases in which restitution of the prematurely executed property is no longer possible, compensation shall be made in favor of the judgment debtor in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>a. If the purchaser at the public auction is the judgment creditor, he must pay the full value of the property at the time of its seizure, with interest.<br><br>b. If the purchaser at the public auction is a third party, and <b>title to the property has already been validly and timely transferred to the name of that party</b>, the judgment creditor must pay the amount realized from the sheriff's sale of that property, with interest.<br><br>c. If the judgment award is reduced on appeal, the judgment creditor must return to the judgment debtor only the excess received over and above that to which the former is entitled under the final judgment, with interest.</blockquote><br>In summary, Urban Bank is entitled to complete restoration and return of the properties levied on execution considering the absolute reversal of the award of damages, upon the payment of the judgment debt herein amounting to PhP4,500,000, with interest as indicated in the dispositive portion. With respect to individual petitioners, they are entitled to the absolute restitution of their executed properties, except when restitution has become impossible, in which case Peña shall be liable<b> </b>for the full value of the property at the time of its seizure, with interest. Whether Urban Bank and the bank officers and directors are entitled to any claim for damages against Peña and his indemnity bond is best ventilated before the trial court, as prescribed under the procedural rules on execution pending appeal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DENIES </b>Atty.
