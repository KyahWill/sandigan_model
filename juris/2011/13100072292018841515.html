The poseur-buyer thereupon turned over the plastic sachet containing <i>shabu</i> to SPO1 Selibio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>With the seized items, the team members brought appellant to the Cebu City Police Station where P/Supt. Antonio Lao Obenza prepared a memorandum dated March 12, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> addressed to the Regional Chief of the PNP Crime Laboratory in Cebu City requesting for a laboratory examination of the substance contained in the plastic sachet.&nbsp; The team members subsequently executed a Joint Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> subscribed and sworn to on March 14, 2005 recounting the details of the operation leading to appellant's arrest.<br><br>Upon receipt of the letter-request and the plastic sachet also on March 12, 2005 at 5:20 p.m., Inspector Salinas, Forensic Chemical Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory Office 7 in Cebu City, conducted a laboratory examination of the sachet's contents which disclosed the following findings, as recorded in Chemistry Report No. D-305-2005 dated March 13, 2005:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>"A"- One (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic packet, labeled with "ANB", containing 0.05 gram of white crystalline substance, placed in a small plastic pack, x x x<br><br>PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION:<br><br>To determine the presence of dangerous drugs.<br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative analysis conducted on the above-mentioned specimen gave&nbsp; <b>POSITIVE</b> result for the presence of <u>Methylamphetamine hydrochloride</u>. x x x<br><br>C O N C L U S I O N:<br><br>Specimen A contains <u>Methylamphetamine hydrochloride</u>, a dangerous drug. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Denying the accusation, appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> gave his version as follows:<br><br>At around 2:00 p.m. on March 12. 2005, while he was working as a caretaker of two video carrera machines installed in the house of one Alice Tetet, police officers kicked the door of the house and arrested him, over his resistance, as the police officers demanded for coins from the proceeds of the machines.&nbsp; He was thereafter brought to the Office of the City Prosecutor before undergoing medical examination, and he was later brought to the Bagong Buhay Rehabilitation Center.<br><br>In fine, appellant claimed that the charge against him was fabricated.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of March 28, 2006, the trial court found appellant guilty as charged, disposing as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Foregoing considered, this court finds the accused GUILTY as charged, and hereby sentences him to suffer LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>The pack of dangerous drugs (Exh. B) shall be forfeited in favor of the state for proper disposition.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>affirming</i> the trial court's decision, the Court of Appeals, by Decision of April 22, 2008, held that, contrary to appellant's claim, the chain of custody over the seized illegal drug consonant with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 had been preserved, the prosecution having clearly established that the plastic pack containing <i>shabu</i> was recovered by SPO1 Selibio, who handed it to SPO1 Abelgas who thereupon prepared the request for a laboratory analysis which PO1 Vicada delivered, together with the specimen, to the PNP Crime Laboratory.<br><br>The appellate court held too that the prosecution had amply proven that the plastic pack of <i>shabu</i> presented before the trial court was the same pack seized from appellant bearing the marking "ANB" and duly identified in court; and that the failure of the apprehending team to conduct a physical inventory and photograph of the seized drug is not fatal to sustain a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In brushing aside appellant's frame-up defense as self-serving and uncorroborated, it noted that appellant failed to adduce evidence on the possible motive for the police officers to fabricate the charge against him.<br><br>Hence, the present appeal.<br><br>Owing to the built-in dangers of abuse that a buy-bust operation entails, the law prescribes specific procedures on the seizure and custody of .drugs, independently o[ the general procedures geared to ensure that the rights of people under criminal investigation and of the accused facing a criminal charge are safeguarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote><u>[B]y the very nature of anti-narcotic operations</u>, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin can be planted in the pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, <u>the possibility of abuse is great</u>. Thus, the courts have been exhorted <u>to be extra vigilant in trying drug cases</u> lest an innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The records of the case indicate that even the basics of the outlined procedure in the custody of seized drugs was not observed. Consider the team members' Joint Affidavit executed and sworn to by them two days after the operation or on March 14, 2005, <i>viz</i>, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><ol

Us non-compliance will not render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the <b>preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items</b>, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (citation omitted, underscoring and emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The apprehending team in the present case has not, however, shown any justifiable ground to exempt it from complying with the legal requirements. To impose benediction on such shoddy police work, absent exempting circumstances, would only spawn further abuses.<br><br>In <i>People v. Orteza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">22</sup> the Court did not hesitate to strike down the conviction of the therein accused for failure of the police officers to observe the procedure laid down under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Law thus:<br><br><blockquote>First, there appears nothing in the records showing that police officers complied with the proper procedure in the custody of seized drugs as specified in <i>People v. Lim, i.e.,</i> any apprehending team having initial control of said drugs and/or paraphernalia should, immediately after seizure or confiscation, have the same physically inventoried and photographed in the presence of the accused, if there be any. and or his representative, who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.&nbsp; The failure of the agents to comply with the requirement raises doubt whether what was submitted for laboratory examination and presented in court was actually recovered from appellant. It negates the presumption that official duties have been regularly performed by the police officers. <br><br>In <i>People v. Laxa</i>, where the buy-bust team failed to mark the confiscated marijuana immediately after the apprehension of the accused, the Court held that the deviation from the standard procedure in anti-narcotics operations produced doubts as to the origins of the marijuana. Consequently, the Court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<br><br>The Court made a similar ruling in <i>People v. Kimura</i>, where the Narcom operatives failed to place markings on the seized marijuana at the time the accused was arrested and to observe the procedure and take custody of the drug.<br><br>More recently, in <i>Zarraga r. People</i>, the Court held that the material inconsistencies with regard to when and where the markings on the shabu were made and the lack of inventory on the seized drugs created reasonable doubt as to the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.&nbsp; The Court thus acquitted the accused due to the prosecution's failure to indubitably show the identity of the <i>shabu</i>.<br></blockquote><br>IN FINE, the unjustified failure of the police officers to show that the integrity of the object evidence-shabu was properly preserved negates the presumption of regularity accorded to acts undertaken by police officers in the pursuit of their official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Appellant's contention that the apprehending police officers were gravely remiss in complying with the statutory requirements imposed under Section 21 is thus well-taken.
