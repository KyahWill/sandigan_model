That on motion, the Honorable Court, on November 21, 1985, issued a Writ of Possession which for some reason or [another] was not satisfied, so that the Honorable Court, on April 7, 1989 - acting on an ex-parte motion dated April 6, 1989 - directed the issuance of an Alias Writ of Possession;<br><br>9. That the Deputy Sheriff of this Court, Mr. Placid[o] Cayco tendered the Alias Writ of Possession to the oppositors, particularly to Mr. Eugenio Basbas, Sr. and Eugenio Basbas, Jr. who, as the Deputy Sheriff stated in his Progress Report dated May 18, 1989 `did not believe and obey the CFI Decision and the decision of the Court of Appeals' and `x x x [t]hey demanded a relocation survey to determine the exact location of applicants' (complainant[s] herein) property described in the alias writ of possession.' x x x;<br><br>10.&nbsp; That on June 16, 1989, the Honorable Court, acting on the Progress Report of Deputy Sheriff Placido Cayco, issued an Order on even date appointing Geodetic Engineer Jose A.

Record No. N51830 x x x'&nbsp; This Order was dictated in open court in the presence of Mr. Eugenio Basbas, Sr. and Eugenio&nbsp; Basbas, Jr. who had both objected to the Writ of Possession, and their counsel Atty.

All the defendants named above are x x x of legal age and are residents of Balagtas, Matag-ob, Leyte where they may be served summons and other court processes; while defendant-spouses Pablito Basarte and Marcelina Basbas Basarte were not named as among the oppositors in the land registration case whose decision is herein sought to be revived, said spouses are nonetheless participating in the harvest, processing and sale of the coconuts with the other defendants named above;<br><br>3. Plaintiffs Beata Sayson and her late husband, Roberto Sayson are petitioners in Land Registration Case No. 0-177 for the registration of a parcel of agricultural land situated in Barrio Balagtas, Matag-ob, Leyte, filed on September 2, 1976 with the then Court of First Instance of Leyte, Branch V, Ormoc City.&nbsp; The above-named defendants, namely:&nbsp; Eugenio Basbas, Teofilo Aras, Gervacio Basbas, Rufino Aras, Ismael Aras, Eugenio Aras, Simfronio Aras, Feliciano Aras, Rosita Aras and Eugenio Basbas, Jr. were oppositors to the application;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>13.&nbsp; That despite this admonition in the [September 13, 1989] [O]rder that they could be cited for contempt of Court, the respondents, defendants herein, had continuously defied the same and this notwithstanding the fact that it was upon their own demands and insistence that a relocation survey be made on the premises subject of this case before they would obey the alias writ of possession x x x and that the finding[s] of the Court[-]appointed Commissioner Engr. Jose A. Tahil show that the oppositors-respondents did [encroach] on the land of plaintiffs herein;<br><br>14.&nbsp; That this [September 13, 1989] Order however was not implemented thru a Writ of Execution within the five-year period from the time the Order became final because of the retirement of Deputy Sheriff Placido Cayco and by reason also of the fact that the then Clerk of Court, Atty. Constantino A. Trias, Jr. who was also the ex-officio Provincial Sheriff was not physically fit to hike thru the mountains and hills of Brgy. Balagtas where the property and the defendants therein reside due to his heart condition;<br><br>15.&nbsp; That despite their knowledge of the Court[`s] [September 13, 1989] Order, the same [having been] dictated in open court, the respondents had continued to occupy the land of the plaintiffs and for more than five (5) years since this Order for them to vacate the land in question was issued, they had harvested the coconuts growing thereon and such other produce of the land herein involved.&nbsp; And until the decision of the Court of Appeals is executed, plaintiff will continue to suffer losses and damages by reason of defendants' unlawful occupation and possession and their continued harvesting of the produce of this land of the herein plaintiffs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>By way of special and affirmative defenses, said petitioners contended that the Order sought to be revived is not the "judgment" contemplated under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, hence the action for revival of judgment is improper.&nbsp; Also, except for Rufino, petitioners averred that they cannot be made parties to the complaint for revival of judgment as they were not parties to the land registration case.&nbsp; They thus believed that the September 13, 1989 Order sought to be revived is not binding upon them and hence, the complaint states no cause of action with respect to them. As to the counterclaim, petitioners prayed that respondents pay them moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<br><br>Pre-trial conference was thereafter set<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> but since not all petitioners were served with summons, this was reset and alias summons was issued and served upon Simfronio and the spouses Basarte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Upon receipt of summons, Simfronio adopted the Answer with Counterclaim of Gervacio, Rufino, Ismael, Eugenio, Feliciano, Rosita and Eugenio Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> while the spouses Basarte filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> on the ground of lack of cause of action. As said motion was also denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the spouses Basarte later filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> that they were also adopting the Answer with Counterclaim filed by Gervacio and the others.<br><br>During the pre-trial conference on July 14, 1999, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which provides in part, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In today's pre-trial conference, manifestations and counter-manifestations were exchanged.

In addition, they questioned the Special Power of Attorney (SPA) executed by Beata in Canada empowering her son Roberto Jr. to appear on her behalf in the pre-trial conference.&nbsp; They argued that since said SPA has not been authenticated by a Philippine Consulate official, it is not sufficient authorization and hence, Beata cannot be considered to have attended the pre-trial conference.&nbsp; The case must, therefore, be dismissed insofar as she is concerned.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In resolving respondents' Omnibus Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment, the RTC found that petitioners' Answer does not essentially tender an issue since the material allegations of the Complaint were admitted.&nbsp;

Without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners thus filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> which was approved in an Order dated June 06, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>Finding no merit in the appeal, the CA denied the same in a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated February 17, 2004. It noted that petitioners' Answer admitted almost all of the allegations in respondents' complaint. Hence, the RTC committed no reversible error when it granted respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment. The appellate court likewise found untenable the issue as regards the failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.&nbsp; To the appellate court, petitioners' refusal to vacate the subject property despite the final and executory Decision of the CA in the land registration case and the September 13, 1989 Order of the RTC for them to vacate the same, clearly support respondents' cause of action against them. Also contrary to petitioners' posture, the September 13, 1989 Order is a final order as it finally disposed of the controversy between the parties in the land registration case.&nbsp; The CA likewise found the SPA executed by Beata in favor of Roberto Jr. as valid, hence, she was duly represented during the pre-trial conference. The dispositive portion of said CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present appeal is DENIED.&nbsp; The May 21, 2001 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Ormoc City, Branch 35 is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>Their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> having been denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated April 19, 2006, petitioners are now before this Court through the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Petitioners impute upon the CA the following errors:<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; The Honorable Court of Appeals clearly committed serious errors of law in its decision and Resolution dated February 17, 2004 and April 19, 2006 when it affirmed the Order of the Regional Trial Court dated May 21, 2001 and declared that no reversible error was committed by the Regional Trial Court of Ormoc City in granting respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings and/or summary judgment;<br><br>2.

No. 77008, December 29, 1987).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>The Parties' Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioners insist that a judgment&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; pleadings or a summary judgment<br><br>is not proper in this case since the controverted stipulations and the first three issues enumerated in the pre-trial order involve facts which must be threshed out during trial.&nbsp; They also claim that the Complaint for Revival of Judgment states no cause of action because the September 13, 1989 Order which it sought to revive is not the "judgment" contemplated under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and, therefore, cannot be the subject of such an action.&nbsp; Moreover, they argue that the CA Decision in the land registration case should not have been revived as same was not prayed for in the Complaint for Revival of Judgment.&nbsp; Lastly, petitioners assail the SPA which authorized Roberto Jr. to represent his mother, Beata, during the pre-trial conference, it not having been authenticated by a Philippine consulate officer in Canada where it was executed.&nbsp; Citing <i>Lopez v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> they contend that said document cannot be admitted in evidence and hence, Beata was not duly represented during said pre-trial conference. The case, therefore, should have been dismissed insofar as she is concerned.<br><br>For their part, respondents point out that the RTC's basis in granting the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment was petitioners' admission of practically all the material allegations in the complaint.&nbsp; They aver that Section 1, Rule 34 of the Rules of Court clearly provides that where an answer fails to tender an issue or otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading, the court may, on motion of that party, direct judgment on the pleadings. Also, the test for a motion for summary judgment is whether the pleadings, affidavits or exhibits in support of the motion are sufficient to overcome the opposing papers and to justify a finding as a matter of law that there is no defense to the action or the claim is clearly meritorious. And since, as found by the CA, petitioners' Answer did not tender an issue and that there is no defense to the action, the grant of the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment was appropriate.&nbsp; Respondents likewise contend that if their prayer in the Complaint is taken in its proper context, it can be deduced that what they were really seeking is the implementation of the CA Decision dated July 24, 1985 and the orders ancillary thereto. With respect to the SPA, they submit that the law does not require that a power of attorney be notarized.&nbsp; Moreover, Section 4, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court simply requires that a representative appear fully authorized "in writing".&nbsp; It does not specify a particular form of authority.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>There is no merit in the petition.<br><br><b>I.&nbsp; The instant case is proper for the rendition of a summary judgment.</b><br><br>Petitioners principally assail the CA's affirmance of the RTC's Order granting respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment.<br><br>In <i>Tan v. De la Vega</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> citing <i>Narra Integrated Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the court distinguished summary judgment from judgment on the pleadings, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The existence or appearance of ostensible issues in the pleadings, on the one hand, and their sham or fictitious character, on the other, are what distinguish a proper case for summary judgment from one for a judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; In a proper case for judgment on the pleadings, there is no ostensible issue at all because of the failure of the defending party's answer to raise an issue.&nbsp; On the other hand, in the case of a summary judgment, issues apparently exist - <i>i.e. </i>facts are asserted in the complaint regarding which there is as yet no admission, disavowal or qualification; or specific denials or affirmative defenses are in truth set out in the answer - but the issues thus arising from the pleadings are sham, fictitious or not genuine, as shown by affidavits, depositions, or admissions. x x x.</blockquote><br>Simply stated, what distinguishes a judgment on the pleadings from a summary judgment is the presence of issues in the Answer to the Complaint.&nbsp; When the Answer fails to tender any issue, that is, if it does not deny the material allegations in the complaint or admits said material allegations of the adverse party's pleadings by admitting the truthfulness thereof and/or omitting to deal with them at all, a judgment on the pleadings is appropriate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, when the Answer specifically denies the material averments of the complaint or asserts affirmative defenses, or in other words raises an issue, a summary judgment is proper provided that the issue raised is not genuine. "A `genuine issue' means an issue of fact which calls for the presentation of evidence, as distinguished from an issue which is fictitious or contrived or which does not constitute a genuine issue for trial."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><i>a) Judgment on the pleadings is not proper <br>because petitioners' Answer tendered issues.</i><br><br>In this case, we note that while petitioners' Answer to respondents' Complaint practically admitted all the material allegations therein, it nevertheless asserts the affirmative defenses that the action for revival of judgment is not the proper action and that petitioners are not the proper parties.&nbsp; As issues obviously arise from these affirmative defenses, a judgment on the pleadings is clearly improper in this case.<br><br>However, before we consider this case appropriate for the rendition of summary judgment, an examination of the issues raised, that is, whether they are genuine issues or not, should first be made.<br><br><i>b) The issues raised are not genuine issues, <br>hence rendition of summary judgment is proper.</i><br><br>To resolve the issues of whether a revival of judgment is the proper action and whether respondents are the proper parties thereto, the RTC merely needed to examine the following: 1) the RTC Order dated September 13, 1989, to determine whether same is a judgment or final order contemplated under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court; and, 2) the pleadings of the parties and pertinent portions of the records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> showing, among others, who among the respondents were oppositors to the land registration case, the heirs of such oppositors and the present occupants of the property.&nbsp; Plainly, these issues could be readily resolved based on the facts established by the pleadings.&nbsp; A full-blown trial on these issues will only entail waste of time and resources as they are clearly not genuine issues requiring presentation of evidence.<br><br>Petitioners aver that the RTC should not have granted respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment because of the controverted stipulations and the first three issues enumerated in the Pre-trial Order, which, according to them, require the presentation of evidence. These stipulations and issues, however, when examined, basically boil down to questions relating to the propriety of the action resorted to by respondents, which is revival of judgment, and to the proper parties thereto - the same questions which we have earlier declared as not constituting genuine issues.<br><br>In sum, this Court holds that the instant case is proper for the rendition of a summary judgment, hence, the CA committed no error in affirming the&nbsp; May 21, 2001 Order of the RTC granting respondents' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Summary Judgment.<br><br><b>II.&nbsp; The Complaint states a cause of action<i>.</i></b><br><br>Petitioners contend that the complaint&nbsp; states&nbsp; no&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; action&nbsp; since&nbsp; the<br><br>September 13, 1989 Order sought to be revived is not the judgment contemplated under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; They also aver that the RTC erred when it ordered the revival not only of the September 13, 1989 Order but also of the July 24, 1985 CA Decision, when what was prayed for in the complaint was only the revival of the former.<br><br>This Court, however, agrees with respondents that these matters have already been sufficiently addressed by the RTC in its Order of May 9, 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and we quote with approval, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The body of the Complaint as well as the prayer mentioned about the executory decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on July 24, 1985 that had to be finally implemented.&nbsp; So it appears to this Court that the Complaint does not alone invoke or use as subject thereof the Order of this Court which would implement the decision or judgment regarding the land in question.&nbsp; The Rules of Court referring to the execution of judgment, particularly Rule 39, Sec. 6, provides a mechanism by which the judgment that had not been enforced within five (5) years from the date of its entry or from the date the said judgment has become final and executory could be enforced.&nbsp; In fact, the rule states: "...judgment may be enforced by action."<br><br>So in this Complaint, what is sought is the enforcement of a judgment and the Order of this Court dated September 13, 1989 is part of the process to enforce that judgment. To the mind of the Court, therefore, the Complaint sufficiently states a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br><b>III. Any perceived defect in the SPA would not serve to bar the case from proceeding.</b><br><br>Anent the SPA, we find that given the particular circumstances in the case at bar, an SPA is not even necessary such that its efficacy or the lack of it would not in any way preclude the case from proceeding. This is because upon Roberto Sr.'s death, Roberto Jr., in succession of his father, became a co-owner of the subject property together with his mother, Beata.&nbsp; As a co-owner, he may, by himself alone, bring an action for the recovery of the co-owned property pursuant to the well-settled principle that "in a co-ownership, co-owners may bring actions for the recovery of co-owned property without the necessity of joining all the other co-owners as co-plaintiffs because the suit is presumed to have been filed for the benefit of his co-owners."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>While we note that the present action for revival of judgment is not an action for recovery, the September 13, 1989 Order sought to be revived herein ordered the petitioners, among others, to vacate the subject property pursuant to the final and executory judgment of the CA affirming the CFI's adjudication of the same in favor of respondents.&nbsp; This Order was issued after the failure to enforce the writ of execution and alias writ of execution due to petitioners' refusal to vacate the property.&nbsp; To this Court's mind, respondents' purpose in instituting the present action is not only to have the CA Decision in the land registration case finally implemented but ultimately, to recover possession thereof from petitioners.&nbsp; This action is therefore one which Roberto Jr., as co-owner, can bring and prosecute alone, on his own behalf and on behalf of his co-owner, Beata.&nbsp; Hence, a dismissal of the case with respect to Beata pursuant to Sec. 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Rule 18 of the Rules of Court will be futile as the case could nevertheless be continued by Roberto Jr. in behalf of the two of them.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b> and the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 17, 2004 and Resolution dated April 19, 2006 in CA-G.R.
