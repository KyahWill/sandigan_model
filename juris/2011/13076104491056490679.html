CV No. 64936, which reversed and set aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated September 2, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 54, Bacolod City, in Civil Case No. 93-7942. 
</p><div align="justify"><p></p><p align="center"><b><i>The Facts</i></b></p>
<p align="justify">Eduardo Dewara (Eduardo) and petitioner Elenita 
Magallanes Dewara (Elenita) were married before the enactment of the 
Family Code. Thus, the Civil Code governed their marital relations. 
Husband and wife were separated-in-fact because Elenita went to work in 
California, United States of America, while Eduardo stayed in Bacolod 
City.
      
</p>
<p align="justify">On January 20, 1985, Eduardo, while driving a private jeep registered in the name of Elenita,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> hit respondent Ronnie Lamela (Ronnie). Ronnie filed a criminal case for serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 against Eduardo before the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), 
Branch IV, Bacolod City. The MTCC found Eduardo guilty of the charge and
 sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of two (2) months 
and one (1) day to (3) months, and to pay civil indemnity of Sixty-Two 
Thousand Five Hundred Ninety-Eight Pesos and Seventy Centavos 
(P62,598.70) as actual damages and Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) as 
moral damages. On appeal, the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> affirmed the decision of the MTCC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and it became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">The writ of execution on the civil liability was 
served on Eduardo, but it was returned unsatisfied because he had no 
property in his name. Ronnie requested the City Sheriff, respondent 
Stenile Alvero, to levy on Lot No. 234-C, Psd. 26667 of the Bacolod 
Cadastre, with an area of One Thousand Four Hundred Forty (1,440) square
 meters (sq m), under Transfer Certificate  of  Title  (TCT)  No. 
T-80054, in the name of “ELENITA M. DEWARA, of legal age, Filipino, 
married to Eduardo Dewara, and resident of Bacolod City,” to satisfy the
 judgment on the civil liability of Eduardo. The City Sheriff served a 
notice of embargo on the title of the lot and subsequently sold the lot 
in a public auction. In the execution sale, there were no interested 
buyers other than Ronnie. The City Sheriff issued a certificate of sale 
to spouses Ronnie and Gina Lamela to satisfy the civil liability in the 
decision against Eduardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
Ronnie then caused the consolidation of title in a Cadastral Proceeding 
before the RTC, which ordered the cancellation of TCT No. T-80054 in the
 name of Elenita and the issuance of a new certificate of title in the 
name of respondent spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">The levy on execution, public auction, issuance of 
certificate of sale, and cancellation of title of the lot in the name of
 Elenita were done while Elenita was working in California.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 Thus, Elenita, represented by her attorney-in-fact, Ferdinand 
Magallanes, filed a case for annulment of sale and for damages against 
respondent spouses and ex-officio sheriff Stenile Alvero before the RTC 
of Bacolod City. Petitioner claimed that the levy on execution of Lot 
No. 234-C was illegal because the said property was her paraphernal or 
exclusive property and could not be made to answer for the personal 
liability of her husband. Furthermore, as the registered owner of the 
property, she received no notice of the execution sale. She sought the 
annulment of the sale and the annulment of the issuance of the new TCT 
in the name of respondent spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, respondent spouses averred that 
the subject lot was the conjugal property of petitioner Elenita and 
Eduardo. They asserted that the property was acquired by Elenita during 
her marriage to Eduardo; that the property was acquired with the money 
of Eduardo because, at the time of the acquisition of the property, 
Elenita was a plain housewife; that the jeep involved in the accident 
was registered in the name of petitioner; and that Elenita did not 
interpose any objection pending the levy on execution of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On September 2, 1999, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of petitioner, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the [petitioner] and against the [respondents]:
    
  <ol><li>The levy on execution on Lot No. 234-C of the Bacolod 
Cadastre covered by TCT No. 80054 in the name of [petitioner] Elenita M.
 Dewara, the public auction of the property, and the consolidation of 
the title and issuance of new TCT No. 167403 in the name of [respondent]
 Ronnie Lamela, are hereby declared null and void;
        </li><li>The Register of Deeds of Bacolod City is ordered to 
cancel TCT No. 167403 in the name of [respondent] Ronnie Lamela and TCT 
No. 80054 be reinstated or a new one issued in the name of [petitioner] 
Elenita M. Dewara;
        </li><li>There is no pronouncement on damages with cost de officio.  
    </li></ol>
    SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>
  <p>The RTC declared that said property was paraphernal in nature. It 
arrived at this conclusion by tracing how Elenita acquired the subject 
property. Based on the documentary evidence submitted, Elenita’s 
grandfather, Exequiel Magallanes, originally owned Lot No. 234-C. Upon 
his demise, his children, Jesus (Elenita’s father), Salud, and 
Concepcion, inherited the property, each entitled to a share equal to 
one-third (1/3) of the total area of the land. They were issued a new 
title (TCT No. T-17541) for the property. On July 6, 1966, petitioner’s 
aunt, Salud, executed a waiver of rights duly registered with the Office
 of the Register of Deeds under Entry No. 76392, thereby waiving her 
rights and participation over her 1/3 share of the property in favor of 
her siblings, Jesus and Concepcion. The two siblings then became the 
owners of the property, each owning one-half (1/2) of the property. 
Jesus subsequently sold his share to his daughter, Elenita, for the sum 
of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00), based on the deed of sale dated 
March 26, 1975. The deed of sale was duly registered with the Register 
of Deeds under Entry No. 76393. Concepcion also sold her share to her 
niece, Elenita, for the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00), based on
 the deed of sale dated April 29, 1975, which was duly registered with 
the Register of Deeds under Entry No. 76394. By virtue of the sale 
transactions, TCT No. T-17541 was cancelled and a new title, TCT No. 
T-80054, was issued in the name of Elenita.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
    
</p>
  <p>The RTC gave credence to the testimony of Elenita on the 
circumstances surrounding the sale of the property. First, it was sold 
to her by her father and her aunt so that the family would remain on the
 lot. Second, the minimal and inadequate consideration for the 1,440 sq m
 property was for the purpose of helping her expand her capital in her 
business at the time. Thus, the sale was essentially a donation and was 
therefore gratuitous in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
  <p>
        
Having declared that the property was the paraphernal property of 
Elenita, the RTC ruled that the civil liability of Eduardo, which was 
personal to him, could not be charged to the exclusive property of his 
wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
        
</p>
  <p>On appeal, the CA reversed the decision of the RTC. The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:
          
</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><b>WHEREFORE</b></i>, in view of all the foregoing, the instant appeal is <i><b>GRANTED</b></i>.
 The assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City, 
Branch 54, dated September 2, 1999, in Civil Case No. 93-7942 is hereby <i><b>REVERSED</b></i> and <i><b>SET ASIDE</b></i>, and a new Decision is <i><b>entered DISMISSING</b></i>
 the complaint for lack of merit. Let a copy of this Decision be 
furnished to the Office of the Register of Deeds of Bacolod City, Negros
 Occidental [which] is hereby ordered to <b>cancel</b> Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. T-80054 or any transfer certificate of title 
covering Lot No. 234-C issued in the name of Elenita M. Dewara, and <i><b>reinstate</b></i> Transfer Certificate of Title No. 167403 <b><i>or issue</i></b> a new transfer certificate of title covering Lot No. 234-C in the name of Ronnie Lamela. No pronouncement as to costs.      </p>
    <p><b><i>SO ORDERED.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In reversing the decision of the RTC, the CA elucidated that the 
gross inadequacy of the price alone does not affect a contract of sale, 
except that it may indicate a defect in the consent, or that the parties
 really intended a donation or some other act or contract. Except for 
the assertions of Elenita, there was nothing in the records that would 
indicate a defect in Jesus and Concepcion Magallanes’ consent to the 
sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The CA ruled that 
Elenita and Eduardo acquired the property by onerous title during their 
marriage through their common fund. Thus, it belonged to the conjugal 
partnership of gains and might be levied upon to answer for civil 
liabilities adjudged against Eduardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p>
  <p>Hence, this petition.  </p>
  <p align="center"><b><i>The Issue</i></b></p>
  <p>The sole issue for resolution is whether the subject property is 
the paraphernal/exclusive property of Elenita or the conjugal property 
of spouses Elenita and Eduardo.</p>
  <p>The answer to this question will define whether the property may be
 subject to levy and execution sale to answer for the civil liability 
adjudged against Eduardo in the criminal case for serious physical 
injuries, which judgment had already attained finality. </p>
  <p align="center"><i><b>The Ruling of the Court
  </b></i></p>
  <p>All property of the marriage is presumed to belong to the conjugal 
partnership, unless it be proved that it pertains exclusively to the 
husband or to the wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Registration in the name of the husband or the wife alone does not destroy this presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 The separation-in-fact between the husband and the wife without 
judicial approval shall not affect the conjugal partnership. The lot 
retains its conjugal nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 Moreover, the presumption of conjugal ownership applies even when the 
manner in which the property was acquired does not appear. The use of 
the conjugal funds is not an essential requirement for the presumption 
to arise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p>
  <p>There is no dispute that the subject property was acquired by 
spouses Elenita and Eduardo during their marriage. It is also undisputed
 that their marital relations are governed by the conjugal partnership 
of gains, since they were married before the enactment of the Family 
Code and they did not execute any prenuptial agreement as to their 
property relations. Thus, the legal presumption of the conjugal nature 
of the property applies to the lot in question. The presumption that the
 property is conjugal property may be rebutted only by strong, clear, 
categorical, and convincing evidence—there must be strict proof of the 
exclusive ownership of one of the spouses, and the burden of proof rests
 upon the party asserting it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p>
  <p>Aside from the assertions of Elenita that the sale of the property 
by her father and her aunt was in the nature of a donation because of 
the alleged gross disparity between the actual value of the property and
 the monetary consideration for the sale, there is no other evidence 
that would convince this Court of the paraphernal character of the 
property. Elenita proffered no evidence of the market value or assessed 
value of the subject property in 1975. Thus, we agree with the CA that 
Elenita has not sufficiently proven that the prices involved in the 
sales in question were so inadequate for the Court to reach a conclusion
 that the transfers were in the nature of a donation rather than a sale.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, gross inadequacy of the price does not affect a 
contract of sale, except as it may indicate a defect in the consent, or 
that the parties really intended a donation or some other act or 
contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The records are 
bereft of proof that the consent of petitioner’s father and her aunt 
were vitiated or that, in reality, they intended the sale to be a 
donation or some other contract. Inadequacy of the price per se will not
 rule out the transaction as one of sale; the price must be grossly 
inadequate or shocking to the conscience, such that the mind would 
revolt at it and such that a reasonable man would neither directly nor 
indirectly consent to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p>
  <p>However, even after having declared that Lot No. 234-C is the 
conjugal property of spouses Elenita and Eduardo, it does not 
necessarily follow that it may automatically be levied upon in an 
execution to answer for debts, obligations, fines, or indemnities of one
 of the spouses. Before debts and obligations may be charged against the
 conjugal partnership, it must be shown that the same were contracted 
for, or the debts and obligations should have redounded to, the benefit 
of the conjugal partnership. Fines and pecuniary indemnities imposed 
upon the husband or the wife, as a rule, may not be charged to the 
partnership. However, if the spouse who is bound should have no 
exclusive property or if the property should be insufficient, the fines 
and indemnities may be enforced upon the partnership assets only after 
the responsibilities enumerated in Article 161 of the Civil Code have 
been covered.</p>
  <p>In this case, it is just and proper that Ronnie be compensated for 
the serious physical injuries he suffered. It should be remembered that 
even though the vehicle that hit Ronnie was registered in the name of 
Elenita, she was not made a party in the said criminal case. Thus, she 
may not be compelled to answer for Eduardo’s liability. Nevertheless, 
their conjugal partnership property may be held accountable for it since
 Eduardo has no property in his name. The payment of indemnity adjudged 
by the RTC of Bacolod City in Criminal Case No. 7155 in favor of Ronnie 
may be enforced against the partnership assets of spouses Elenita and 
Eduardo after the responsibilities enumerated under Article 161 of the 
Civil Code have been covered. This remedy is provided for under Article 
163 of the Civil Code, viz.: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Art. 163. The payment of debts contracted by the husband or the 
wife before the marriage shall not be charged to the conjugal 
partnership.    </p>
    <p><b>Neither shall the fines and pecuniary indemnities imposed upon them be charged to the partnership.  </b>      </p>
    <p><b>However</b>, the payment of debts contracted by the husband or the wife before the marriage, and that of <b><u>fines
 and indemnities imposed upon them, may be enforced against the 
partnership assets after the responsibilities enumerated in Article 161 
have been covered</u>, if the spouse who is bound should have no exclusive property or if it should be insufficient</b>;
 but at the time of the liquidation of the partnership such spouse shall
 be charged for what has been paid for the purposes above-mentioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  Article 161 of the Civil Code enumerates the obligations which the conjugal partnership may be held answerable, viz.:
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Art. 161. The conjugal partnership shall be liable for:</p>
  <p>(1) All debts and obligations contracted by the husband for the 
benefit of the conjugal partnership, and those contracted by the wife, 
also for the same purpose, in the cases where she may legally bind the 
partnership;</p>
  <p>(2) Arrears or income due, during the marriage, from obligations 
which constitute a charge upon property of either spouse or of the 
partnership;</p>
  <p> (3) Minor repairs or for mere preservation made during the 
marriage upon the separate property of either the husband or the wife; 
major repairs shall not be charged to the partnership;</p>
  <p>(4) Major or minor repairs upon the conjugal partnership property;</p>
  <p>(5) The maintenance of the family and the education of the children
 of both the husband and wife, and of legitimate children of one of the 
spouses;</p>
  <p>(6) Expenses to permit the spouses to complete a professional, vocational or other course.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p>The enumeration above-listed should first be complied with before 
the conjugal partnership may be held to answer for the liability 
adjudged against Eduardo.
    
</p>
  <p>Finally, the indemnity imposed against Eduardo shall earn an 
interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum, in accordance with our
 ruling in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>    </p>
  <p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated 
November 6, 2006 and the Resolution dated July 10, 2007 of the Court of 
Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 64936 are hereby <b>ANNULLED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The decision dated September 2, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City in Civil Case No. 93-7942 is hereby <b>REINSTATED WITH MODIFICATION</b>
 that the conjugal properties of spouses Elenita Dewara and Eduardo 
Dewara shall be held to answer for the judgment of Seventy-Two Thousand 
Five Hundred Ninety-Eight Pesos and Seventy Centavos (P72,598.70), plus 
an interest rate of twelve (12) percent per annum from the date of 
finality of the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City in
