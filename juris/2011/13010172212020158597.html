Respondent Blas F.

Manalo, signed the Rome Statute which, by its terms, is "subject to ratification, acceptance or approval" by the signatory states.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; As of the filing of the instant petition, only 92 out of the 139 signatory countries appear to have completed the ratification, approval and concurrence process.&nbsp; The Philippines is not among the 92.<br><br><center><b>RP-US Non-Surrender Agreement</b><br></center><br>On May 9, 2003, then Ambassador Francis J. Ricciardone sent US Embassy Note No. 0470 to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) proposing the terms of the non-surrender bilateral agreement (<i>Agreement</i>, hereinafter) between the USA and the RP.<br><br>Via Exchange of Notes No. BFO-028-03<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated May 13, 2003 (E/N BFO-028-03, hereinafter), the RP, represented by then DFA Secretary Ople, agreed with and accepted the US proposals embodied under the US Embassy Note adverted to and put in effect the <i>Agreement</i> with the US government. <i>In esse</i>, the <i>Agreement</i> aims to protect what it refers to and defines as "persons" of the RP and US from frivolous and harassment suits that might be brought against them in international tribunals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; It is reflective of the increasing pace of the strategic security and defense partnership between the two countries.&nbsp; As of May 2, 2003, similar bilateral agreements have been effected by and between the US and 33 other countries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The <i>Agreement</i> pertinently provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>1. For purposes of this Agreement, "persons" are current or former Government officials, employees (including contractors), or military personnel or nationals of one Party.<br><br>2. Persons of one Party present in the territory of the other shall not, <u>absent the express consent of the first Party</u>,<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) be surrendered or transferred by any means to any international tribunal for any purpose, unless such tribunal has been established by the UN Security Council, or<br><br>(b) be surrendered or transferred by any means to any other entity or third country, or expelled to a third country, for the purpose of surrender to or transfer to any international tribunal, unless such tribunal has been established by the UN Security Council.<br></div><br>3. When the [US] extradites, surrenders, or otherwise transfers a person of the Philippines to a third country, the [US] will not agree to the surrender or transfer of that person by the third country to any international tribunal, unless such tribunal has been established by the UN Security Council, absent the express consent of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines [GRP].<br><br>4. When the [GRP] extradites, surrenders, or otherwise transfers a person of the [USA] to a third country, the [GRP] will not agree to the surrender or transfer of that person by the third country to any international tribunal, unless such tribunal has been established by the UN Security Council, absent the express consent of the Government of the [US].<br><br>5. This Agreement shall remain in force until one year after the date on which one party notifies the other of its intent to terminate the Agreement.&nbsp; The provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply with respect to any act occurring, or any allegation arising, before the effective date of termination.<br></blockquote><br>In response to a query of then Solicitor General Alfredo L. Benipayo on the status of the non-surrender agreement, Ambassador Ricciardone replied in his letter of October 28, 2003 that the exchange of diplomatic notes constituted a legally binding agreement under international law; and that, under US law, the said agreement did not require the advice and consent of the US Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In this proceeding, petitioner imputes grave abuse of discretion to respondents in concluding and ratifying the <i>Agreement</i> and prays that it be struck down as unconstitutional, or at least declared as without force and effect.<br><br>For their part, respondents question petitioner's standing to maintain a suit and counter that the <i>Agreement</i>, being in the nature of an executive agreement, does not require Senate concurrence for its efficacy. And for reasons detailed in their comment, respondents assert the constitutionality of the <i>Agreement</i>.<br><br><blockquote><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER THE [RP] PRESIDENT AND THE [DFA] SECRETARY x x x GRAVELY ABUSED THEIR DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION FOR CONCLUDING THE <b>RP-US NON SURRENDER AGREEMENT </b>BY MEANS OF [<i>E/N</i>]<i> BFO-028-03 DATED 13 MAY 2003</i>, WHEN THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY SIGNED THE <i>ROME STATUTE OF THE [ICC] </i>ALTHOUGH THIS IS PENDING RATIFICATION BY THE PHILIPPINE SENATE.<br><br><ol type="A"><li>Whether by entering into the x x x<b> Agreement</b> Respondents gravely abused their discretion when they capriciously abandoned, waived and relinquished our only legitimate recourse through the <i>Rome Statute of the [ICC]</i> to prosecute and try "persons" as defined in the x x x<b> Agreement</b>, x x x or literally any conduit of American interests, who have committed crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression, thereby abdicating Philippine Sovereignty.<br><br></li><li>Whether after the signing and pending ratification of the <i>Rome Statute of the [ICC]</i> the [RP] President and the [DFA] Secretary x x x are obliged by the principle of good faith to refrain from doing all acts which would substantially impair the value of the undertaking as signed.<br><br></li><li>Whether the x x x<b> Agreement</b> constitutes an act which defeats the object and purpose of the <i>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</i> and contravenes the obligation of good faith inherent in the signature of the President affixed on the <i>Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</i>, and if so whether the x x x<b> Agreement</b> is void and unenforceable on this ground.<br><br></li><li>Whether the <b>RP-US Non-Surrender Agreement</b> is void and unenforceable for grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in connection with its execution.</li></ol><br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE <b>RP-US NON SURRENDER AGREEMENT </b>IS VOID <i>AB INITIO </i>FOR CONTRACTING OBLIGATIONS THAT <u>ARE EITHER IMMORAL OR OTHERWISE AT VARIANCE WITH UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW</u>.<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE x x x<b> AGREEMENT </b>IS VALID, BINDING AND EFFECTIVE <u>WITHOUT THE CONCURRENCE BY AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS (2/3) OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE</u> x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>The foregoing issues may be summarized into two: <i>first</i>, whether or not the <i>Agreement</i> was contracted validly, which resolves itself into the question of whether or not respondents gravely abused their discretion in concluding it; and <i>second</i>, whether or not the <i>Agreement</i>, which has not been submitted to the Senate for concurrence, contravenes and undermines the Rome Statute and other treaties.&nbsp; But because respondents expectedly raised it, we shall first tackle the issue of petitioner's legal standing.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>This petition is bereft of merit.<br><br><center><b>Procedural Issue:&nbsp; <i>Locus Standi </i>of Petitioner</b><br></center><br>Petitioner, through its three party-list representatives, contends that the issue of the validity or invalidity of the <i>Agreement</i> carries with it constitutional significance and is of paramount importance that justifies its standing.&nbsp; Cited in this regard is what is usually referred to as the emergency powers cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in which ordinary citizens and taxpayers were accorded the personality to question the constitutionality of executive issuances.<br><br><i>Locus standi</i> is "a right of appearance in a court of justice on a given question."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Specifically, it is "a party's personal and substantial interest in a case where he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the act being challenged, and "calls for more than just a generalized grievance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The term "interest" refers to material interest, as distinguished from one that is merely incidental.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; The rationale for requiring a party who challenges the validity of a law or international agreement to allege such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy is "to assure the concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>Locus standi</i>, however, is merely a matter of procedure and it has been recognized that, in some cases, suits are not brought by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or any other government act, but by concerned citizens, taxpayers, or voters who actually sue in the public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, in a catena of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> this Court has invariably adopted a liberal stance on <i>locus standi.</i><br><br>Going by the petition, petitioner's representatives pursue the instant suit primarily as concerned citizens raising issues of transcendental importance, both for the Republic and the citizenry as a whole.<br><br>When suing as a citizen to question the validity of a law or other government action, a petitioner needs to meet certain specific requirements before he can be clothed with standing.&nbsp; <i>Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> expounded on this requirement, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In a long line of cases, however, concerned citizens, taxpayers and legislators when specific requirements have been met have been given standing by this Court.<br><br>When suing as a <i>citizen</i>, the interest of the petitioner assailing the constitutionality of a statute must be direct and personal. He must be able to show, not only that the law or any government act is invalid, but also that he sustained or is in imminent danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way.&nbsp; It must appear that the person complaining has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute or act complained of.&nbsp; In fine, when the proceeding involves the assertion of a public right, the mere fact that he is a citizen satisfies the requirement of personal interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, petitioner's representatives have complied with the qualifying conditions or specific requirements exacted under the <i>locus standi</i> rule.&nbsp; As citizens, their interest in the subject matter of the petition is direct and personal.&nbsp; At the very least, their assertions questioning the <i>Agreement</i> are made of a public right, i.e., to ascertain that the <i>Agreement</i> did not go against established national policies, practices, and obligations bearing on the State's obligation to the community of nations.<br><br>At any event, the primordial importance to Filipino citizens in general of the issue at hand impels the Court to brush aside the procedural barrier posed by the traditional requirement of <i>locus standi</i>, as we have done in a long line of earlier cases, notably in the old but oft-cited emergency powers cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <i>Kilosbayan v. Guingona, Jr</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In cases of transcendental importance, we wrote again in <i>Bayan v. Zamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> "The Court may relax the standing requirements and allow a suit to prosper even where there is no direct injury to the party claiming the right of judicial review."<br><br>Moreover, bearing in mind what the Court said in <i>Tañada v. Angara</i>, "that it will not shirk, digress from or abandon its sacred duty and authority to uphold the Constitution in matters that involve grave abuse of discretion brought before it in appropriate cases, committed by any officer, agency, instrumentality or department of the government,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we cannot but resolve head on the issues raised before us.&nbsp; Indeed, where an action of any branch of government is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution or is done with grave abuse of discretion, it becomes not only the right but in fact the duty of the judiciary to settle it.&nbsp; As in this petition, issues are precisely raised putting to the fore the propriety of the <i>Agreement</i> pending the ratification of the Rome Statute.<br><br><center><b>Validity of the RP-US Non-Surrender Agreement</b><br></center><br>Petitioner's initial challenge against the <i>Agreement</i> relates to form, its threshold posture being that E/N BFO-028-03 cannot be a valid medium for concluding the <i>Agreement</i>.<br><br>Petitioners' contention—perhaps taken unaware of certain well-recognized international doctrines, practices, and jargons—is untenable. One of these is the doctrine of incorporation, as expressed in Section 2, Article II of the Constitution, wherein the Philippines adopts the generally accepted principles of international law and international jurisprudence as part of the law of the land and adheres to the policy of peace, cooperation, and amity with all nations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> An exchange of notes falls "into the category of inter-governmental agreements,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which is an internationally accepted form of international agreement. The United Nations Treaty Collections (Treaty Reference Guide) defines the term as follows:<br><br><blockquote>An "exchange of notes" is a record of a routine agreement, that has many similarities with the private law contract. The agreement consists of the exchange of two documents, each of the parties being in the possession of the one signed by the representative of the other. Under the usual procedure, the accepting State repeats the text of the offering State to record its assent.&nbsp; The signatories of the letters may be government Ministers, diplomats or departmental heads.&nbsp; The technique of exchange of notes is frequently resorted to, either because of its speedy procedure, or, sometimes, to avoid the process of legislative approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In another perspective, the terms "exchange of notes" and "executive agreements" have been used interchangeably, exchange of notes being considered a form of executive agreement that becomes binding through executive action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, executive agreements concluded by the President "sometimes take the form of exchange of notes and at other times that of more formal documents denominated `agreements' or `protocols.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; As former US High Commissioner to the Philippines Francis B. Sayre observed in his work, <i>The Constitutionality of Trade</i> <i>Agreement Acts</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The point where ordinary correspondence between this and other governments ends and agreements - whether denominated executive agreements or exchange of notes or otherwise - begin, may sometimes be difficult of ready ascertainment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> x x x</blockquote><br>It is fairly clear from the foregoing disquisition that E/N BFO-028-03--be it viewed as the Non-Surrender Agreement itself, or as an integral instrument of acceptance thereof or as consent to be bound--is a recognized mode of concluding a legally binding international written contract among nations.<br><br><center><b>Senate Concurrence Not Required</b><br></center><br>Article 2 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties defines a treaty as "an international agreement concluded between states in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> International agreements may be in the form of (1) treaties that require legislative concurrence after executive ratification; or (2) executive agreements that are similar to treaties, except that they do not require legislative concurrence and are usually less formal and deal with a narrower range of subject matters than treaties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Under international law, there is no difference between treaties and executive agreements in terms of their binding effects on the contracting states concerned,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as long as the negotiating functionaries have remained within their powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Neither, on the domestic sphere, can one be held valid if it violates the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Authorities are, however, agreed that one is distinct from another for accepted reasons apart from the concurrence-requirement aspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As has been observed by US constitutional scholars, a treaty has greater "dignity" than an executive agreement, because its constitutional efficacy is beyond doubt, a treaty having behind it the authority of the President, the Senate, and the people;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> a ratified treaty, unlike an executive agreement, takes precedence over any prior statutory enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner parlays the notion that the <i>Agreement</i> is of dubious validity, partaking as it does of the nature of a treaty; hence, it must be duly concurred in by the Senate. Petitioner takes a cue from <i>Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading</i>, in which the Court reproduced the following observations made by US legal scholars: "[I]nternational agreements involving political issues or changes of national policy and those involving international arrangements of a permanent character usually take the form of treaties [while] those embodying adjustments of detail carrying out well established national policies and traditions and those involving arrangements of a more or less temporary nature&nbsp; take the form of executive agreements." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><i></i><br><br>Pressing its point, petitioner submits that the subject of the <i>Agreement </i>does not fall under any of the subject-categories that are enumerated in the <i>Eastern Sea Trading </i>case, and that may be covered by an executive agreement, such as commercial/consular relations, most-favored nation rights, patent rights, trademark and copyright protection, postal and navigation arrangements and settlement of claims.<br><br>In addition, petitioner foists the applicability to the instant case of <i>Adolfo v. CFI of Zambales and Merchant</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><i> </i>holding that an executive agreement through an exchange of notes cannot be used to amend a treaty.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>The categorization of subject matters that may be covered by&nbsp;&nbsp; international agreements mentioned in <i>Eastern Sea Trading</i> is not cast in stone. There are no hard and fast rules on the propriety of entering, on a given subject, into a treaty or an executive agreement as an instrument of international relations.&nbsp; The primary consideration in the choice of the form of agreement is the parties' intent and desire to craft an international agreement in the form they so wish to further their respective interests.&nbsp; Verily, the matter of form takes a back seat when it comes to effectiveness and binding effect of the enforcement of a treaty or an executive agreement, as the parties in either international agreement each labor under the <i>pacta sunt servanda</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> principle.<br><br>As may be noted, almost half a century has elapsed since the Court rendered its decision in <i>Eastern Sea Trading</i>.&nbsp; Since then, the conduct of foreign affairs has become more complex and the domain of international law wider, as to include such subjects as human rights, the environment, and the sea.&nbsp; In fact, in the US alone, the executive agreements executed by its President from 1980 to 2000 covered subjects such as defense, trade, scientific cooperation, aviation, atomic energy, environmental cooperation, peace corps, arms limitation, and nuclear safety, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Surely, the enumeration in <i>Eastern Sea Trading</i> cannot circumscribe the option of each state on the matter of which the international agreement format would be convenient to serve its best interest. As Francis Sayre said in his work referred to earlier:<br><br><blockquote>x x x It would be useless to undertake to discuss here the large variety of executive agreements as such concluded from time to time. Hundreds of executive agreements, other than those entered into under the trade-agreement act, have been negotiated with foreign governments. x x x They cover such subjects as the inspection of vessels, navigation dues, income tax on shipping profits, the admission of civil air craft, custom matters and commercial relations generally, international claims, postal matters, the registration of trademarks and copyrights, etc. x x x<br></blockquote><br>And lest it be overlooked, one type of executive agreement is a treaty-authorized<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> or a treaty-implementing executive agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> which necessarily would cover the same matters subject of the underlying treaty.<br><br>But over and above the foregoing considerations is the fact that—save for the situation and matters contemplated in Sec. 25, Art. XVIII of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>—when a treaty is required, the Constitution does not classify any subject, like that involving political issues, to be in the form of, and ratified as, a treaty.&nbsp; What the Constitution merely prescribes is that treaties need the concurrence of the Senate by a vote defined therein to complete the ratification process.<br><br>Petitioner's reliance on <i>Adolfo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is misplaced, said case being inapplicable owing to different factual milieus.&nbsp; There, the Court held that an executive agreement cannot be used to amend a duly ratified and existing treaty, i.e., the Bases Treaty.&nbsp; Indeed, an executive agreement that does not require the concurrence of the Senate for its ratification may not be used to amend a treaty that, under the Constitution, is the product of the ratifying acts of the Executive and the Senate.&nbsp; The presence of a treaty, purportedly being subject to amendment by an executive agreement, does not obtain under the premises.<br><br>Considering the above discussion, the Court need not belabor at length the third main issue raised, referring to the validity and effectivity of the <i>Agreement</i> without the concurrence by at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court has, in <i>Eastern Sea Trading</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as reiterated in <i>Bayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> given recognition to the obligatory effect of executive agreements without the concurrence of the Senate:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he right of the Executive to enter into binding agreements without the necessity of subsequent Congressional approval has been confirmed by long usage. From the earliest days of our history, we have entered executive agreements covering such subjects as commercial and consular relations, most favored-nation rights, patent rights, trademark and copyright protection, postal and navigation arrangements and the settlement of claims. The validity of these has never been seriously questioned by our courts.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Agreement Not in Contravention of the Rome Statute</b><br></center><br>It is the petitioner's next contention that the <i>Agreement</i> undermines the establishment of the ICC and is null and void insofar as it unduly restricts the ICC's jurisdiction and infringes upon the effectivity of the Rome Statute. Petitioner posits that the <i>Agreement</i> was constituted solely for the purpose of providing individuals or groups of individuals with immunity from the jurisdiction of the ICC; and such grant of immunity through non-surrender agreements allegedly does not legitimately fall within the scope of Art. 98 of the Rome Statute.&nbsp; It concludes that state parties with non-surrender agreements are prevented from meeting their obligations under the Rome Statute, thereby constituting a breach of Arts. 27,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> 86,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> 89<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and 90<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> thereof.<br><br>Petitioner stresses that the overall object and purpose of the Rome Statute is to ensure that those responsible for the worst possible crimes are brought to justice in all cases, primarily by states, but as a last resort, by the ICC; thus, any agreement—like the non-surrender agreement—that precludes the ICC from exercising its complementary function of acting when a state is unable to or unwilling to do so, defeats the object and purpose of the Rome Statute.<br><br>Petitioner would add that the President and the DFA Secretary, as representatives of a signatory of the Rome Statute, are obliged by the imperatives of good faith to refrain from performing acts that substantially devalue the purpose and object of the Statute, as signed.&nbsp; Adding a nullifying ingredient to the <i>Agreement</i>, according to petitioner, is the fact that it has an immoral purpose or is otherwise at variance with a priorly executed treaty.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner's pretense, the <i>Agreement</i> does not contravene or undermine, nor does it differ from, the Rome Statute.&nbsp; Far from going against each other, one complements the other.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the principle of complementarity underpins the creation of the ICC.&nbsp; As aptly pointed out by respondents and admitted by petitioners, the jurisdiction of the ICC is to "be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions [of the signatory states]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Art. 1 of the Rome Statute pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article 1<br><br>The Court</center><br><br>An International Crimininal Court ("the Court") is hereby established.&nbsp; It x x x <b>shall have the power to exercise its jurisdiction</b> over persons for the most serious crimes of international concern, as referred to in this Statute, and <b>shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions</b>.&nbsp; The jurisdiction and functioning of the Court shall be governed by the provisions of this Statute.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote><br>Significantly, the sixth preambular paragraph of the Rome Statute declares that "it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes." This provision indicates that primary jurisdiction over the so-called international crimes rests, at the first instance, with the state where the crime was committed; secondarily, with the ICC in appropriate situations contemplated under Art. 17, par. 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the Rome Statute.<br><br>Of particular note is the application of the principle of <i>ne bis in idem</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> under par. 3 of Art. 20, Rome Statute, which again underscores the primacy of the jurisdiction of a state vis-a-vis that of the ICC.&nbsp; As far as relevant, the provision states that "no person who has been tried by another court for conduct x x x [constituting crimes within its jurisdiction] shall be tried by the [International Criminal] Court with respect to the same conduct x x x."<br><br>The foregoing provisions of the Rome Statute, taken collectively, argue against the idea of jurisdictional conflict between the Philippines, as party to the non-surrender agreement, and the ICC; or the idea of the <i>Agreement</i> substantially impairing the value of the RP's undertaking under the Rome Statute.&nbsp; Ignoring for a while the fact that the RP signed the Rome Statute ahead of the <i>Agreement</i>, it is abundantly clear to us that the Rome Statute expressly recognizes the primary jurisdiction of states, like the RP, over serious crimes committed within their respective borders, the complementary jurisdiction of the ICC coming into play only when the signatory states are unwilling or unable to prosecute.<br><br>Given the above consideration, petitioner's suggestion--that the RP, by entering into the <i>Agreement</i>, violated its duty required by the imperatives of good faith and breached its commitment under the Vienna Convention<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to refrain from performing any act tending to impair the value of a treaty, e.g., the Rome Statute--has to be rejected outright.&nbsp; For nothing in the provisions of the <i>Agreement</i>, in relation to the Rome Statute, tends to diminish the efficacy of the Statute, let alone defeats the purpose of the ICC.&nbsp; Lest it be overlooked, the Rome Statute contains a proviso that enjoins the ICC from seeking the surrender of an erring person, should the process require the requested state to perform an act that would violate some international agreement it has entered into.&nbsp; We refer to Art. 98(2) of the Rome Statute, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article 98<br><br>Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity<br>and consent to surrender<br></center><br>x x x x<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.<br></blockquote><br>Moreover, under international law, there is a considerable difference between a State-Party and a signatory to a treaty. Under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a signatory state is only obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of a treaty;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> whereas a State-Party, on the other hand, is legally obliged to follow all the provisions of a treaty in good faith.<br><br>In the instant case, it bears stressing that the Philippines is only a signatory to the Rome Statute and not a State-Party for lack of ratification by the Senate. Thus, it is only obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the Rome Statute. Any argument obliging the Philippines to follow any provision in the treaty would be premature.<br><br>As a result, petitioner's argument that State-Parties with non-surrender agreements are prevented from meeting their obligations under the Rome Statute, specifically Arts. 27, 86, 89 and 90, must fail. These articles are only legally binding upon State-Parties, not signatories.<br><br>Furthermore, a careful reading of said Art. 90 would show that the <i>Agreement</i> is not incompatible with the Rome Statute. Specifically, Art. 90(4) provides that "[i]f the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender from the Court. x x x" In applying the provision, certain undisputed facts should be pointed out: <i>first</i>, the US is neither a State-Party nor a signatory to the Rome Statute; and <i>second</i>, there is an international agreement between the US and the Philippines regarding extradition or surrender of persons, i.e., the <i>Agreement</i>. Clearly, even assuming that the Philippines is a State-Party, the Rome Statute still recognizes the primacy of international agreements entered into between States, even when one of the States is not a State-Party to the Rome Statute.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote><b>Sovereignty Limited by International Agreements</b><br></blockquote></div><br>Petitioner next argues that the RP has, through the <i>Agreement</i>, abdicated its sovereignty by bargaining away the jurisdiction of the ICC to prosecute US nationals, government officials/employees or military personnel who commit serious crimes of international concerns in the Philippines.&nbsp; Formulating petitioner's argument a bit differently, the RP, by entering into the <i>Agreement</i>, does thereby abdicate its sovereignty, abdication being done by its waiving or abandoning its right to seek recourse through the Rome Statute of the ICC for erring Americans committing international crimes in the country.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; As it were, the <i>Agreement</i> is but a form of affirmance and confirmance of the Philippines' national criminal jurisdiction.&nbsp; National criminal jurisdiction being primary, as explained above, it is always the responsibility and within the prerogative of the RP either to prosecute criminal offenses equally covered by the Rome Statute or to accede to the jurisdiction of the ICC.&nbsp; Thus, the Philippines may decide to try "persons" of the US, as the term is understood in the <i>Agreement</i>, under our national criminal justice system.&nbsp; Or it may opt not to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over its erring citizens or over US "persons" committing high crimes in the country and defer to the secondary criminal jurisdiction of the ICC over them. As to "persons" of the US whom the Philippines refuses to prosecute, the country would, in effect, accord discretion to the US to exercise either its national criminal jurisdiction over the "person" concerned or to give its consent to the referral of the matter to the ICC for trial.&nbsp; In the same breath, the US must extend the same privilege to the Philippines with respect to "persons" of the RP committing high crimes within US territorial jurisdiction.<br><br>In the context of the Constitution, there can be no serious objection to the Philippines agreeing to undertake the things set forth in the <i>Agreement</i>. Surely, one State can agree to waive jurisdiction—o the extent agreed upon—to subjects of another State due to the recognition of the principle of extraterritorial immunity.&nbsp; What the Court wrote in <i>Nicolas v. Romulo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>—a case involving the implementation of the criminal jurisdiction provisions of the RP-US Visiting Forces Agreement—is apropos:<br><br><blockquote>Nothing in the Constitution prohibits such agreements recognizing immunity from jurisdiction or some aspects of jurisdiction (such as custody), in relation to long-recognized subjects of such immunity like Heads of State, diplomats and members of the armed forces contingents of a foreign State allowed to enter another State's territory. x x x<br></blockquote><br>To be sure, the nullity of the subject non-surrender agreement cannot be predicated on the postulate that some of its provisions constitute a virtual abdication of its sovereignty.&nbsp; Almost every time a state enters into an international agreement, it voluntarily sheds off part of its sovereignty.&nbsp; The Constitution, as drafted, did not envision a reclusive Philippines isolated from the rest of the world.&nbsp; It even adheres, as earlier stated, to the policy of cooperation and amity with all nations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>By their nature, treaties and international agreements actually have a limiting effect on the otherwise encompassing and absolute nature of sovereignty.&nbsp; By their voluntary act, nations may decide to surrender or waive some aspects of their state power or agree to limit the exercise of their otherwise exclusive and absolute jurisdiction.&nbsp; The usual underlying consideration in this partial surrender may be the greater benefits derived from a pact or a reciprocal undertaking of one contracting party to grant the same privileges or immunities to the other.&nbsp; On the rationale that the Philippines has adopted the generally accepted principles of international law as&nbsp; part of the law of the land, a portion of sovereignty may be waived without violating the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Such waiver does not amount to an unconstitutional diminution or deprivation of jurisdiction of Philippine courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><center><b>Agreement Not Immoral/Not at Variance<br>with Principles of International Law</b><br></center><br>Petitioner urges that the <i>Agreement</i> be struck down as void <i>ab initio</i> for imposing immoral obligations and/or being at variance with allegedly universally recognized principles of international law.&nbsp; The immoral aspect proceeds from the fact that the <i>Agreement</i>, as petitioner would put it, "leaves criminals immune from responsibility for unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the conscience of humanity; x x x it precludes our country from delivering an American criminal to the [ICC] x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The above argument is a kind of recycling of petitioner's earlier position, which, as already discussed, contends that the RP, by entering into the <i>Agreement</i>, virtually abdicated its sovereignty and in the process undermined its treaty obligations under the Rome Statute, contrary to international law principles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded. Suffice it to state in this regard that the non-surrender agreement, as aptly described by the Solicitor General, "is an assertion by the Philippines of its desire to try and punish crimes under its national law. x x x The agreement is a recognition of the primacy and competence of the country's judiciary to try offenses under its national criminal laws and dispense justice fairly and judiciously."<br><br>Petitioner, we believe, labors under the erroneous impression that the <i>Agreement</i> would allow Filipinos and Americans committing high crimes of international concern to escape criminal trial and punishment.&nbsp; This is manifestly incorrect.&nbsp; Persons who may have committed acts penalized under the Rome Statute can be prosecuted and punished in the Philippines or in the US; or with the consent of the RP or the US, before the ICC, assuming, for the nonce, that all the formalities necessary to bind both countries to the Rome Statute have been met.&nbsp; For perspective, what the <i>Agreement</i> contextually prohibits is the surrender by either party of individuals to international tribunals, like the ICC, without the consent of the other party, which may desire to prosecute the crime under its existing laws.&nbsp; With the view we take of things, there is nothing immoral or violative of international law concepts in the act of the Philippines of assuming criminal jurisdiction pursuant to the non-surrender agreement over an offense considered criminal by both Philippine laws and the Rome Statute.<br><br><center><b>No Grave Abuse of Discretion</b><br></center><br>Petitioner's final point revolves around the necessity of the Senate's concurrence in the <i>Agreement</i>.&nbsp; And without specifically saying so, petitioner would argue that the non-surrender agreement was executed by the President, thru the DFA Secretary, in grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The Court need not delve on and belabor the first portion of the above posture of petitioner, the same having been discussed at length earlier on.&nbsp; As to the second portion, We wish to state that petitioner virtually faults the President for performing, through respondents, a task conferred the President by the Constitution—the power to enter into international agreements.<br><br>By constitutional fiat and by the nature of his or her office, the President, as head of state and government, is the sole organ and authority in the external affairs of the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; The Constitution vests in the President the power to enter into international agreements, subject, in appropriate cases, to the required concurrence votes of the Senate. But as earlier indicated, executive agreements may be validly entered into without such concurrence.&nbsp; As the President wields vast powers and influence, her conduct in the external affairs of the nation is, as <i>Bayan</i> would put it, "executive altogether."&nbsp; The right of the President to enter into or ratify binding executive agreements has been confirmed by long practice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In thus agreeing to conclude the <i>Agreement</i> thru E/N BFO-028-03, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, represented by the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, acted within the scope of the authority and discretion vested in her by the Constitution.

(Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>A view is advanced that the <i>Agreement </i>amends existing municipal laws on the State's obligation in relation to grave crimes against the law of nations, i.e., genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.&nbsp; Relying on the above-quoted statutory proviso, the view posits that the Philippine is required to surrender to the proper international tribunal those persons accused of the grave crimes defined under RA 9851, if it does not exercise its primary jurisdiction to prosecute them.<br><br>The basic premise rests on the interpretation that if it does not decide to prosecute a foreign national for violations of RA 9851, the Philippines has only two options, to wit: (1) surrender the accused to the proper international tribunal; or (2) surrender the accused to another State if such surrender is "pursuant to the applicable extradition laws and treaties."&nbsp; But the Philippines may exercise these options only in cases where "another court or international tribunal is already conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such crime;" otherwise, the Philippines must prosecute the crime before its own courts pursuant to RA 9851.<br><br>Posing the situation of a US national under prosecution by an international tribunal for any crime under RA 9851, the Philippines has the option to surrender such US national to the international tribunal if it decides not to prosecute such US national here.&nbsp; The view asserts that this option of the Philippines under Sec. 17 of RA 9851 is not subject to the consent of the US, and any derogation of Sec. 17 of RA 9851, such as requiring the consent of the US before the Philippines can exercise such option, requires an amendatory law.&nbsp; In line with this scenario, the view strongly argues that the <i>Agreement</i> prevents the Philippines—without the consent of the US—from surrendering to any international tribunal US nationals accused of crimes covered by RA 9851, and, thus, in effect amends Sec. 17 of RA 9851.&nbsp; Consequently, the view is strongly impressed that the <i>Agreement</i> cannot be embodied in a simple executive agreement in the form of an exchange of notes but must be implemented through an extradition law or a treaty with the corresponding formalities.<br><br>Moreover, consonant with the foregoing view, citing Sec. 2, Art. II of the Constitution, where the Philippines adopts, as a national policy, the "<b>generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land</b>," the Court is further impressed to perceive the Rome Statute as declaratory of customary international law.&nbsp; In other words, the Statute embodies principles of law which constitute customary international law or custom and for which reason it assumes the status of an enforceable domestic law in the context of the aforecited constitutional provision.&nbsp; As a corollary, it is argued that any derogation from the Rome Statute principles cannot be undertaken via a mere executive agreement, which, as an exclusive act of the executive branch, can only implement, but cannot amend or repeal, an existing law.&nbsp; The <i>Agreement</i>, so the argument goes, seeks to frustrate the objects of the principles of law or alters customary rules embodied in the Rome Statute.<br><br>Prescinding from the foregoing premises, the view thus advanced considers the <i>Agreement</i> inefficacious, unless it is embodied in a treaty duly ratified with the concurrence of the Senate, the theory being that a Senate- ratified treaty partakes of the nature of a municipal law that can amend or supersede another law, in this instance Sec. 17 of RA 9851 and the status of the Rome Statute as constitutive of enforceable domestic law under Sec. 2, Art. II of the Constitution.<br><br>We are unable to lend cogency to the view thus taken. For one, we find that the <i>Agreement</i> does not amend or is repugnant to RA 9851.&nbsp; For another, the view does not clearly state what precise principles of law, if any, the <i>Agreement</i> alters.&nbsp; And for a third, it does not demonstrate in the concrete how the <i>Agreement</i> seeks to frustrate the objectives of the principles of law subsumed in the Rome Statute.<br><br>Far from it, as earlier explained, the <i>Agreement</i> does not undermine the Rome Statute as the former merely reinforces the primacy of the national jurisdiction of the US and the Philippines in prosecuting criminal offenses committed by their respective citizens and military personnel, among others.&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the ICC pursuant to the Rome Statute over high crimes indicated thereat is clearly and unmistakably complementary to the national criminal jurisdiction of the signatory states.<br><br>Moreover, RA 9851 clearly: (1) defines and establishes the crimes against international humanitarian law, genocide and other crimes against humanity;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (2) provides penal sanctions and criminal liability for their commission;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and (3) establishes special courts for the prosecution of these crimes and for the State to exercise primary criminal jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; Nowhere in RA 9851 is there a proviso that goes against the tenor of the <i>Agreement</i>.<br><br>The view makes much of the above quoted second par. of Sec. 17, RA 9851 as <b>requiring</b> the Philippine State to surrender to the proper international tribunal those persons accused of crimes sanctioned under said law if it does not exercise its primary jurisdiction to prosecute such persons.&nbsp; This view is not entirely correct, for the above quoted proviso clearly provides <b>discretion</b> to the Philippine State on whether to surrender or not a person accused of the crimes under RA 9851.&nbsp; The statutory proviso uses the word "<b><i>may</i></b>."&nbsp; It is settled doctrine in statutory construction that the word "may" denotes discretion, and cannot be construed as having mandatory effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the pertinent second pararagraph of Sec. 17, RA 9851 is simply permissive on the part of the Philippine State.<br><br>Besides, even granting that the surrender of a person is mandatorily required when the Philippines does not exercise its primary jurisdiction in cases where "another court or international tribunal is already conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such crime," still, the tenor of the <i>Agreement</i> is not repugnant to Sec. 17 of RA 9851.&nbsp; Said legal proviso aptly provides that the surrender may be made "to another State pursuant to the applicable extradition laws and treaties."&nbsp; The <i>Agreement </i>can already be considered a treaty following this Court's decision in <i>Nicolas v.

However, before the petitions could be resolved by the Court, the Office of the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation and Motion averring that the Philippine Government decided not to continue with the ZTE National Broadband Network Project, thus rendering the petition moot. In resolving the case, the Court took judicial notice of the act of the executive department of the Philippines (the President) and found the petition to be indeed moot. Accordingly, it dismissed the petitions.<br><br>In his dissent in the abovementioned case, Justice Carpio discussed the legal implications of an executive agreement. He stated that "an executive agreement has the force and effect of law x x x [it] cannot amend or repeal <b>prior </b>laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Hence, this argument finds no application in this case seeing as RA 9851 is a subsequent law, not a prior one. Notably, this argument cannot be found in the <i>ratio decidendi </i>of the case, but only in the dissenting opinion.<br><br>The view further contends that the RP-US Extradition Treaty is inapplicable to RA 9851 for the reason that under par. 1, Art. 2 of the RP-US Extradition Treaty, "[a]n offense shall be an extraditable offense if it is <b><i>punishable</i> under the laws in both Contracting Parties</b> x x x,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and thereby concluding that while the Philippines has criminalized under RA 9851 the acts defined in the Rome Statute as war crimes, genocide and other crimes against humanity, there is no similar legislation in the US. It is further argued that, citing <i>U.S. v. Coolidge</i>, in the US, a person cannot be tried in the federal courts for an international crime unless Congress adopts a law defining and punishing the offense<i>.</i><br><br>This view must fail.<br><br>On the contrary, the US has already enacted legislation punishing the high crimes mentioned earlier. In fact, as early as October 2006, the US enacted a law criminalizing war crimes. Section 2441, Chapter 118, Part I, Title 18 of the United States Code Annotated (USCA) provides for the criminal offense of "war crimes" which is similar to the war crimes found in both the Rome Statute and RA 9851, thus:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Offense - Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, commits a war crime, in any of the circumstances described in subsection (b), shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both, and if death results to the victim, shall also be subject to the penalty of death.<br><br>(b) Circumstances - The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are that the person committing such war crime or the victim of such war crime is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a national of the United States (as defined in Section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act).<br><br>(c) Definition - As used in this Section the term "war crime" means any conduct -<br><br><blockquote>(1) Defined as a grave breach in any of the international conventions signed at Geneva 12 August 1949, or any protocol to such convention to which the United States is a party;<br><br>(2) Prohibited by Article 23, 25, 27 or 28 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, signed 18 October 1907;<br><br>(3) Which constitutes a grave breach of common Article 3 (as defined in subsection [d]) when committed in the context of and in association with an armed conflict not of an international character; or<br><br>(4) Of a person who, in relation to an armed conflict and contrary to the provisions of the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices as amended at Geneva on 3 May 1996 (Protocol II as amended on 3 May 1996), when the United States is a party to such Protocol, willfully kills or causes serious injury to civilians.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Similarly, in December 2009, the US adopted a law that criminalized genocide, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>§1091.

The view used a report written by Victoria K. Holt and Elisabeth W. Dallas, entitled "On Trial: The US Military and the International Criminal Court," as its basis.<br>&nbsp;At the outset, it should be pointed out that the report used may not have any weight or value under international law. Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) lists the sources of international law, as follows: (1) international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states; (2) international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law; (3) the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations; and (4) subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and <b>the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations</b>, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.

In fact, the report itself stated as much, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Few believed there were wide differences between the crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court and crimes within the Uniform Code of Military Justice that would expose US personnel to the Court. Since US military lawyers were instrumental in drafting the elements of crimes outlined in the Rome Statute, they ensured that most of the crimes were consistent with those outlined in the UCMJ and gave strength to complementarity for the US. Small areas of potential gaps between the UCMJ and the Rome Statute, military experts argued, could be addressed through existing military laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> x x x<br></blockquote><br>The report went on further to say that "[a]ccording to those involved, the elements of crimes laid out in the Rome Statute have been part of US military doctrine for decades."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Thus, the argument proffered cannot stand.<br><br>Nonetheless, despite the lack of actual domestic legislation, the US notably follows the doctrine of incorporation.&nbsp; As early as 1900, the esteemed Justice Gray in <i>The Paquete Habana</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> case already held international law as part of the law of the US, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>International law is part of our law</b>, and must be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination. For this purpose, where there is no treaty and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to the customs and usages of civilized nations, and, as evidence of these, to the works of jurists and commentators who by years of labor, research, and experience have made themselves peculiarly well acquainted with the subjects of which they treat. Such works are resorted to by judicial tribunals, not for the speculations of their authors concerning what the law ought to be, but for the trustworthy evidence of what the law really is.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Thus, a person can be tried in the US for an international crime despite the lack of domestic legislation.&nbsp; The cited ruling in <i>U.S. v.

So it was that in <i>Ex Parte Quirin</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> the US Supreme Court noted that "[f]rom the very beginning of its history this Court has recognized and applied the law of war as including that part of the law of nations which prescribes, for the conduct of war, the status, rights and duties of enemy nations as well as of enemy individuals."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> It went on further to explain that Congress had not undertaken the task of codifying the specific offenses covered in the law of war, thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is no objection that <b>Congress</b> in providing for the trial of such offenses <b>has not itself undertaken to codify that branch of international law or to mark its precise boundaries, or to enumerate or define by statute all the acts which that law condemns</b>. An Act of Congress punishing `the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations is an appropriate exercise of its constitutional authority, Art. I, s 8, cl. 10, `to define and punish' the offense since it has adopted by reference the sufficiently precise definition of international law. x x x Similarly by the reference in the 15th Article of War to `offenders or offenses that x x x by the law of war may be triable by such military commissions.

Do states behave the way they do because they consider it obligatory to behave thus or do they do it only as a matter of courtesy?&nbsp; <i>Opinio juris</i>, or the belief that a certain form of behavior is obligatory, is what makes practice an international rule.&nbsp; Without it, practice is not law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>Evidently, there is, as yet, no overwhelming consensus, let alone prevalent practice, among the different countries in the world that the prosecution of internationally recognized crimes of genocide, etc. <b>should be handled by a particular international criminal court</b>.<br><br>Absent the widespread/consistent-practice-of-states factor, the second or the psychological element must be deemed non-existent, for an inquiry on why states behave the way they do presupposes, in the first place, that they are actually behaving, as a matter of settled and consistent practice, in a certain manner.

The power to enter into executive agreements has long been recognized to be lodged with the President. As We held in <i>Neri v.

(Emphasis supplied)<br><br>To implement this State policy, Section 17 of RA 9851 provides:<br><br>Section 17. <i>Jurisdiction</i>. - The State shall exercise jurisdiction over persons, whether military or civilian, suspected or accused of a crime defined and penalized in this Act, regardless of where the crime is committed, provided, any one of the following conditions is met:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) The accused is a Filipino citizen;<br>(b) <b>The accused, regardless of citizenship or residence, is present in the Philippines</b>; or<br>(c) The accused has committed the said crime against a Filipino citizen.<br></div><br>In the interest of justice, the relevant Philippine authorities may dispense with the investigation or prosecution of a crime punishable under this Act<b> if another court or international tribunal is <i>already</i> conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such crime.

The Philippines is expressly mandated by law to prosecute the accused before its own courts.<br><br>If the Philippines decides not to prosecute such accused, the Philippines has only two options. First, it may surrender the accused to the "appropriate international court" such as the International Criminal Court (ICC). Or second, it may surrender the accused to another State if such <b>surrender is "<i>pursuant to the applicable extradition laws and treaties</i></b>." Under the second option, the Philippines must have an applicable extradition law with the other State, or both the Philippines and the other State must be signatories to an applicable treaty. Such applicable extradition law or treaty must not frustrate the Philippine State policy, which embodies a generally accepted principle of international law, that it is "the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes."<br><br>In any case, the Philippines can exercise either option <b><i><u>only if</u></i></b> "<b>another court or international tribunal is <i>already</i> conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such crime</b>." In short, the Philippines should surrender the accused to another State only if there is assurance or guarantee by the other State that the accused will be prosecuted under the other State's criminal justice system.

After retirement, military personnel are not covered by the UCMJ, but instead would be held accountable to the US Code, in particular Title 10 and Title 18. For some retired military personnel, this was an area of some concern.<br><br><b>These individuals offered that former leaders, in particular the "Henry Kissingers of the world," are most at risk. Indeed, they stressed that as the main concern for the US: that the Court will take up cases of former senior civilian leadership and military officials who, acting under the laws of war, are no longer covered by the UCMJ and therefore, potentially open to gaps in federal law where the US ability to assert complementarity is nebulous. The fear is that they could be subject to ICC prosecution for actions they did previously in uniform.</b><br><br><b>One legal scholar pointed out that several crimes defined within the Rome Statute do not appear on the US books (e.g., apartheid, persecution, enslavement, and extermination.) While similar laws exist, it would be within the competency of the Chief Prosecutor to argue before the Pre-Trial Chamber<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that in fact, the US does not have laws to prosecute for the crimes that have been committed</b>. A similar situation arose in 1996, when Congressman Walter Jones (R-NC) determined through a series of investigations that civilians serving overseas under a contract with the US military were not covered under the UCMJ. It had been assumed that the US Code gave US primacy over civilians serving in a military capacity, but instead it was discovered that if a civilian serving with a military unit deployed overseas is accused of war crime, the foreign state whose territory the crimes were committed in would in fact have primary jurisdiction to try the case. Therefore, Rep. Jones authored the "War Crimes Act of 1996," which was designed to cover civilian serving in a military capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b>To ensure that no gaps exist between the US Code, the UCMJ, and the crimes within the Court's jurisdiction, a similar effort could be made. This process would need to identify first where crimes exist in the Statute that are not covered in some context through Title 10 and Title 18 of the US Code and then draft legislation - modeled after the War Crimes Act - designed to fill gaps. This would protect former US service members and senior civilian leadership from ICC prosecution</b>.<br><br>There is very little discussion today about the gaps in law. Scholars are aware of the potential gaps and see this area as one where the US might be able to move forward to clarify legal ambiguities that may exist, and to make corrections to US laws. This exercise would strengthen the US assertion of complementarity. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The same report added, "At Rome, the U.S. was concerned with the definition of crimes, especially the definition of war crimes and, to lesser extent, the definition of crimes against humanity xxx;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> that the crime of genocide was acceptable to the U.S. delegation; and that throughout the negotiations, the U.S. position was to seek one hundred percent assurance that U.S. service members would only be held accountable to U.S. systems of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>With the existing gap between the crimes of Genocide, War Crimes and Other Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute - now all criminalized in the Philippines under RA 9851 on the one hand, and U.S. domestic laws on the other, these crimes cannot be considered <b>"punishable under the laws in both Contracting Parties"</b> as required under the RP-US Extradition Treaty, and hence, cannot be considered as extraditable offenses under the treaty. The crimes considered as Genocide, War Crimes, and Other Crimes against Humanity under the Rome Statute and RA 9851 may not necessarily be considered as such crimes under United States laws. Consequently, the RP-US Extradition Treaty does not qualify as an <b>"applicable"extradition law or treaty</b> under Section 17 of RA 9851, which allows the Philippines to surrender to another state a person accused of Genocide, War Crimes and Other Crimes against Humanity. <b>In short, the Philippines cannot surrender to the United States a U.S. national accused of any of these grave international crimes, when the United States does not have the same or similar laws to prosecute such crimes.</b><br><br>Neither is the RP-US Non-Surrender Agreement an "applicable" extradition law or treaty as required in Section 17 of RA 9851. Thus, the Agreement cannot be implemented by the Philippine Government in the absence of an applicable extradition law or treaty allowing the surrender to the United States of U.S. nationals accused of crimes under RA 9851.<br><br>If a U.S. national is under investigation or prosecution by an international tribunal for any crime punishable under RA 9851, the Philippines has the option to surrender such U.S. national to the international tribunal if the Philippines decides not to prosecute such U.S. national in the Philippines. This option of the Philippine Government under Section 17 of RA 9851 is not subject to the consent of the United States. <b>Any derogation from Section 17, such as requiring the consent of the United States before the Philippines can exercise such option, requires an amendment to RA 9851 by way of either an extradition law or treaty. Such an amendment cannot be embodied in a mere executive agreement or an exchange of notes such as the assailed Agreement.</b><br><br>Section 17 of RA 9851 has clearly raised to a <b>statutory level</b> the surrender to another State of persons accused of any crime under RA 9851. Any agreement in derogation of Section 17, such as the surrender to the U.S. of a U.S. national accused of an act punishable under RA 9851 but not punishable under U.S. domestic laws, or the non-surrender to an international tribunal, without U.S. consent, of a U.S. national accused of a crime under RA 9851, cannot be made in a mere executive agreement or an exchange of notes. <b>Such surrender or non-surrender, being contrary to Section 17 of RA 9851, can only be made in an amendatory law, such as a subsequent extradition law or treaty.</b><br><br>Moreover, Section 17 of RA 9851 allows the surrender to another State only "<b>if another court xxx is <i>already</i> conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such crime</b>." This means that <b><i>only if</i></b><i> </i>the other State is already investigating or prosecuting the crime can the Philippines surrender the accused to such other State. The RP-US Non-Surrender Agreement does not require that the United States must already be investigating or prosecuting the crime before the Philippines can surrender the accused. In fact, a U.S. national accused of a crime under RA 9851 may not even be chargeable of such crime in the U.S. because the same act may not be a crime under U.S. domestic laws. In such a case, the U.S. cannot even conduct an investigation of the accused, much less prosecute him for the same act. Thus, the RP-US Non-Surrender Agreement violates the condition in Section 17 of RA 9851 that the other State must <b><i>already</i></b> be investigating or prosecuting the accused for the crime penalized under RA 9851 before the Philippines can surrender such accused.<br><br>To repeat, the assailed Agreement prevents the Philippines, <b>without the consent of the United States</b>, from surrendering to any international tribunal U.S. nationals accused of crimes under RA 9851. Such consent is not required under RA 9851which mandates that any non-surrender without the consent of another State must be embodied in an extradition law or treaty. The assailed Agreement also dispenses with the condition in Section 17 that before the Philippines can surrender the accused to the United States, the accused must already be under investigation or prosecution by the United States for the crime penalized under RA 9851, a condition that may be impossible to fulfill because not all crimes under RA 9851 are recognized as crimes in the United States. <b>Thus, the Agreement violates Section 17 of RA 9851 as well as existing municipal laws arising from the incorporation doctrine of the Constitution.</b> The Agreement cannot be embodied in a simple executive agreement or an exchange of notes, but must be implemented through an extradition law or a treaty ratified with the concurrence of at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate.<br><br>In international law, there is no difference between treaties and executive agreements on their binding effect upon party states, as long as the negotiating functionaries have remained within their powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> However, while the differences in nomenclature and form of various types of international agreements are immaterial in international law, they have significance in the municipal law of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> An example is the requirement of concurrence of the legislative body with respect to treaties, whereas with respect to executive agreements, the head of State may act alone to enforce such agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The 1987 Philippine Constitution provides: "No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This express constitutional requirement makes treaties different from executive agreements, which require no legislative concurrence.<br><br>An executive agreement can only implement, and not amend or repeal, an existing law.

The principles of law embodied in the Rome Statute were already generally accepted principles of international law even prior to the adoption of the Statute. Subsequently, the Rome Statute itself has been widely accepted and, as of November 2010, it has been ratified by 114 states, 113 of which are members of the UN.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>There are at present 192 members of the UN.
