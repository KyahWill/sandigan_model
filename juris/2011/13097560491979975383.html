We reiterated our directive for petitioners to file their comment <i>via </i>our Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated February 28, 2011.&nbsp; On March 16, 2011, petitioners filed a Very Urgent Manifestation <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in lieu of their comment.&nbsp; In gist, they reminded this Court of the Entry of Judgment made on July 27, 2010 and argued that the motions filed by P&amp;G are frivolous and dilatory.<br><br><b><i>Issuance of Entry of Judgment was Proper.</i></b><br><br>We stress that the issuance of the Entry of Judgment on July 27, 2010 was proper because it was made after receipt by P&amp;G of a copy of the Resolution denying its motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Section 1, Rule 15 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> provides that: <br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.&nbsp; <i>Finality of decisions and resolutions</i>. - A decision or resolution of the Court may be deemed final after the lapse of fifteen days from receipt by the parties of a copy of the same subject to the following:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; the date of receipt indicated in the registry return card signed by the party or, in case he or she is represented by counsel, by such counsel or his or her representative, shall be the reckoning date for counting the fifteen-day period; and<br><br>(b)&nbsp; if the Judgment Division is unable to retrieve the registry return card within thirty (30) days from mailing, it shall immediately inquire from the receiving post office on (i) the date when the addressee received the mailed decision or resolution, and (ii) who received the same, with the information provided by authorized personnel of the said post office serving as the basis for the computation of the fifteen-day period.</blockquote><br>It is immaterial that the Entry of Judgment was made without the Court having first resolved P&amp;G's second motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; This is because the issuance of the entry of judgment is reckoned from the time the parties received a copy of the resolution denying the first motion for reconsideration. The filing by P&amp;G of several pleadings after receipt of the resolution denying its first motion for reconsideration does not in any way bar the finality or entry of judgment.&nbsp; Besides, to reckon the finality of a judgment from receipt of the denial of the second motion for reconsideration would be absurd.&nbsp; First, the Rules of Court and the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court prohibit the filing of a second motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Second, some crafty litigants may resort to filing prohibited pleadings just to delay entry of judgment.&nbsp; Our ruling in <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v. PICOP Resources, Inc.</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> is instructive, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Dinglasan v. Court of Appeals</i>, this Court explained the reason why it is unwise to reckon the period of finality of judgment from the denial of the second motion for reconsideration.<br><br><blockquote>`To rule that finality of judgment shall be reckoned from the receipt of the resolution or order denying the second motion for reconsideration would result to an <b>absurd situation whereby courts will be obliged to issue orders or resolutions denying what is a prohibited motion in the first place</b>, in order that the period for the finality of judgments shall run, thereby, prolonging the disposition of cases. Moreover, such a ruling would allow a party to forestall the running of the period of finality of judgments by virtue of filing a prohibited pleading; such a situation is not only illogical but also unjust to the winning party.' <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br><b><i>The March 9, 2010 Decision has <br>attained finality; it is therefore <br>immutable.</i></b><br><br>The March 9, 2010 Decision had already attained finality. It could no longer be set aside or modified.<br><br><blockquote>It is a hornbook rule that once a judgment has become final and executory, it may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land, as what remains to be done is the purely ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment.<br><br>The doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional errors, the judgment of adjudicating bodies must become final and executory on some definite date fixed by law. [...], the Supreme Court reiterated that the doctrine of immutability of final judgment is adhered to by necessity notwithstanding occasional errors that may result thereby, since litigations must somehow come to an end for otherwise, it would 'even be more intolerable than the wrong and injustice it is designed to correct.' <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Mocorro, Jr. v. Ramirez</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we held that:<br><br><blockquote>A definitive final judgment, however erroneous, is no longer subject to change or revision.<br><br>A decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable. This quality of immutability precludes the modification of a final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law. And this postulate holds true whether the modification is made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court in the land. The orderly administration of justice requires that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments/resolutions of a court must reach a point of finality set by the law. The noble purpose is to write <i>finis</i> to dispute once and for all. This is a fundamental principle in our justice system, without which there would be no end to litigations. Utmost respect and adherence to this principle must always be maintained by those who exercise the power of adjudication. Any act, which violates such principle, must immediately be struck down. Indeed, the principle of conclusiveness of prior adjudications is not confined in its operation to the judgments of what are ordinarily known as courts, but extends to all bodies upon which judicial powers had been conferred.<br><br>The only exceptions to the rule on the immutability of final judgments are (1) the correction of clerical errors, (2) the so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and (3) void judgments. <i>Nunc pro tunc</i> judgments have been defined and characterized by the Court in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>The object of a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is not the rendering of a new judgment and the ascertainment and determination of new rights, but is one placing in proper form on the record, the judgment that had been previously rendered, to make it speak the truth, so as to make it show what the judicial action really was, not to correct judicial errors, such as to render a judgment which the court ought to have rendered, in place of the one it did erroneously render, nor to supply nonaction by the court, however erroneous the judgment may have been. (Wilmerding vs. Corbin Banking Co., 28 South., 640, 641; 126 Ala., 268.)<br><br>A <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entry in practice is an entry made now of something which was actually previously done, to have effect as of the former date. Its office is not to supply omitted action by the court, but to supply an omission in the record of action really had, but omitted through inadvertence or mistake. (Perkins vs. Haywood, 31 N. E., 670, 672)</blockquote></blockquote><br><b><i>A second motion for reconsideration <br>is a prohibited pleading.</i></b> <br><br>Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court explicitly provides that "[n]o motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained.&nbsp; Moreover, Section 3, Rule 15 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> decrees <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3.&nbsp; <i>Second motion for reconsideration</i>. - The Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration and any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice by the Court <i>en banc </i>upon a vote of at least two-thirds of its actual membership. There is reconsideration 'in the highest interest of justice' when the assailed decision is not only legally erroneous but is likewise patently unjust and potentially capable of causing unwarranted and irremediable injury or damage to the parties.&nbsp; A second motion for reconsideration can only be entertained<b> <u>before the ruling sought to be reconsidered becomes final by operation of law or by the Court's declaration.</u></b><br><br>In the Division, a vote of three Members shall be required to elevate a second motion for reconsideration to the Court <i>En Banc</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, therefore, P&amp;G's second motion for reconsideration could no longer be entertained based on two grounds:&nbsp; First, it is a prohibited pleading.&nbsp; Second, the ruling sought to be reconsidered has already become final per Entry of Judgment made on July 27, 2010.<br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, we will proceed to discuss the issues raised by P&amp;G - not because they are of transcendental importance or that P&amp;G proffered "extraordinarily persuasive reasons" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> but only to dispel any doubt that it is being denied due process.<br><br><b><i>The Court correctly determined that<br> SAPS is a labor-only contractor.</i></b><br><br>There is no basis for P&amp;G's claim that the Court erred in not applying the "four-fold" test, particularly the "control test" in determining whether SAPS is a legitimate independent contractor or a labor-only contractor.&nbsp; As discussed in our March 9, 2010 Decision, the applicable rules are Article 106 of the Labor Code and Rule VIII-A, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, as amended by Department Order No. 18-02. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Article 106 defines "labor-only" contracting, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>There is "labor-only" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him.</blockquote><br>On the same vein, Rule VIII-A, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, as amended by Department Order No. 18-02, pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote><i>Section 5. Prohibition against labor-only contracting.&nbsp; </i>Labor only contracting is hereby declared prohibited.&nbsp; For this purpose, labor-only contracting shall refer to an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal, and <b><u>ANY</u></b> of the following elements are present:<br><br>i)The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal; <b><u>OR</u></b><br><br>ii)&nbsp; [T]he contractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work of the contractual employee.</blockquote><br>Therefore, the "control test" is merely one of the factors to consider. This is clearly deduced from the above-provision which states that labor-only contracting exists when <i><u>any</u> </i>of the two elements is present.&nbsp; In our March 9, 2010 Decision, it was established that SAPS has no substantial capitalization and it was performing merchandising and promotional activities which are directly related to P&amp;G's business.&nbsp; Since SAPS met one of the requirements, it was enough basis for us to hold that it is a labor-only contractor. Consequently, its principal, P&amp;G, is considered the employer of its employees.&nbsp; This is pursuant to our ruling in <i>Aklan v. San Miguel Corporation</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where we held that "[a] <b>finding that a contractor isa`labor-only'contractor, as opposed to permissible job contracting, is equivalent to declaring that there is an employer-employee relationship between the principal and the employees of the supposed contractor, and the `labor-only' contractor is considered as a mere agent of the principal, the real employer</b>."<br><br>Corollarily, we also decreed in <i>Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. v. Agito</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>The law clearly establishes an employer-employee relationship between the principal employer and the contractor's employee upon a finding that the contractor is engaged in "labor-only" contracting. Article 106 of the Labor Code categorically states: "There is `labor-only' contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, <b>and</b> the workers recruited and placed by such persons are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer." Thus, performing activities directly related to the principal business of the employer is only one of the two indicators that "labor-only" contracting exists; the other is lack of substantial capital or investment. The Court finds that both indicators exist in the case at bar.</blockquote><br><b><i>The Court did not err in finding <br>that SAPS has no substantial capital.</i></b><br><br>P&amp;G claims that contrary to the principle that "no absolute figure is set for what is considered 'substantial capital'" because the same is "measured against the type of work which the contractor is obligated to perform for the principal," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; the March 9, 2010 Decision used the prevailing economic atmosphere in the country and the capitalization of another contractor engaged to perform a different kind of service to gauge the sufficiency or insufficiency of the capitalization of SAPS.<br><br>This is misleading.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our discussion on whether Promm-Gem and SAPS have substantial capitalization in our March 9, 2010 Decision is self-explanatory. <br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, the financial statements of Promm-Gem show that it has authorized capital stock of P1 million and a paid-in capital, or capital available for operations, of P500,000.00 as of 1990.&nbsp; It also has long term assets worth P432,895.28 and current assets of P719,042.32. Promm-Gem has also proven that it maintained its own warehouse and office space with a floor area of 870 square meters.&nbsp; It also had under its name three registered vehicles which were used for its promotional/merchandising business.&nbsp; Promm-Gem also has other clients aside from P&amp;G.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, we find that Promm-Gem has substantial investment which relates to the work to be performed.&nbsp; These facts negate the existence of the element specified in Section 5(i) of DOLE Department Order No. 18-02.<br><br>The records also show that Promm-Gem supplied its complainant-workers with the relevant materials, such as markers, tapes, liners and cutters, necessary for them to perform their work.&nbsp; Promm-Gem also issued uniforms to them.&nbsp; It is also relevant to mention that Promm-Gem already considered the complainants working under it as its regular, not merely contractual or project, employees.&nbsp; This circumstance negates the existence of element (ii) as stated in Section 5 of DOLE Department Order No. 18-02, which speaks of <i>contractual</i> employees. This, furthermore, negates - on the part of Promm-Gem - bad faith and intent to circumvent labor laws which factors have often been tipping points that lead the Court to strike down the employment practice or agreement concerned as contrary to public policy, morals, good customs or public order.<br><br>Under the circumstances, Promm-Gem cannot be considered as a labor-only contractor.&nbsp; We find that it is a legitimate independent contractor.<br><br><b>On the other hand, the Articles of Incorporation of SAPS shows that it has a paid-in capital of only P31,250. There is no other evidence presented to show how much its working capital and assets are.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is no showing of substantial investment in tools, equipment or other assets.</b><br><br>In <i>Vinoya v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, the Court held that "[w]ith the current economic atmosphere in the country, the paid-in capitalization of PMCI amounting to P75,000.00 cannot be considered as substantial capital and, as such, PMCI cannot qualify as an independent contractor."&nbsp; Applying the same rationale to the present case, it is clear that <b>SAPS - having a paid-in capital of only P31,250 - has no substantial capital.
