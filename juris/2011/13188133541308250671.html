Moreover, the official cashbooks for these funds disclosed that the last remittances made by Elumbaring for SAJF and JDF were for the months of July 2008 and August 2008, respectively, and the same do not tally with the actual balance of her undeposited collections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The Team observed that Elumbaring engaged in the practice of lapping<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> collection and remittances.&nbsp; The JDF collections were not deposited in full.&nbsp; Likewise, the collections were deposited beyond the reglementary period prescribed in court-issued circulars.&nbsp; In fact, most of her collections were deposited only after two or three months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Team also discovered that Elumbaring withdrew cash bonds upon issuance of a court order, but failed to refund the same to the bondsman or accused and, instead, kept in her possession for 20 days or more.&nbsp; It appeared that Elumbaring did not release the same due to the bondsman's/accused's failure to either show up or produce valid identification cards.&nbsp; The Team, however, concluded that Elumbaring's continuous possession of the withdrawn bonds for a long period of time, without even redepositing the same to the court's fiduciary fund account and with no safety vault for proper safekeeping, showed that she had, at the very least, temporarily appropriated said money for personal use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In her Explanation, Elumbaring disputed the Team's findings, yet submitted machine-validated deposit slips showing that the shortages in the JDF and SAJF amounting to P90,578.23 and P153,356.47 were duly deposited on November 28, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Futhermore, to restitute the computed shortages of Eighty-Five Thousand Five Hundred Forty Pesos and 45/100 (P85,540.45) in the Fiduciary Fund, Elumbaring deposited the amounts of P21,000.00 and P50,000.00, on November 19 and 28, 2008, respectively. Thus, only the amount of&nbsp; P14,540.45 remained in her balance of accountability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In a Memorandum dated February 2, 2009, Elumbaring was directed to: (1) explain why no administrative charges shall be filed against her for her failure to remit the JDF and SAJF collections in full and within the reglementary period; (2) submit valid documents to support the withdrawals of the unauthorized withdrawals amounting to P995,200,00, or otherwise restitute the same; and (3) restitute the balance of her accountability in the Court's Fiduciary Fund amounting to P14,540.45.<br><br>In her Compliance, Elumbaring admitted that she failed to remit her judiciary collections in full within the reglementary period and acknowledged that she had no legitimate excuse for such failure. She, however, claimed that there is no Land Bank Branch in Carmen, Davao Del Norte; the nearest LBP is located in Panabo City, which is 6 kms or aaproximately 30 minutes away from MCTC Carmen, Davao Del Norte.<br><br>Elumbaring likewise argued that she does not know how to operate a computer and relied on the court personnel to do the financial reports.&nbsp; She also claimed that it was not stated in her job description as clerk of court that she will act as the "financial accountable officer."&nbsp; She said that if she had known earlier, she would not have applied for the position as she knew she was not suited for that kind of work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Thus, in a Memorandum to the Chief Justice, dated November 11, 2009, the OCA found Elumbaring guilty of Dishonesty and Malversation of Public Funds for her failure to deposit her collections within the prescribed period and, accordingly, recommended her dismissal from the service.<br><br>The OCA confirmed that Elumbaring already submitted valid documents to support the unauthorized withdrawals of cash bonds amounting to P995,200,00. Likewise, the aggregate amount of P329,475.15 consisting of: P85,540.45 for the Fiduciary Fund, P153,356.47 for the SAJF, and P90,578.23 for JDF have already been deposited on November 19 and 28, 2008, respectively.&nbsp; On April 6, 2009, she deposited the shortage of P14,540.45 to the Fiduciary Fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; In sum, the OCA manifested that Elumbaring was able to restitute the whole amount of her accountabilities in the court collections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On January 27, 2010, as recommended by the OCA, the Court resolved to:<br><br><blockquote>(1) REDOCKET this matter as a regular administrative case against Evelyn G. Elumbaring, Clerk of Court II, MCTC, Carmen-Sto. Tomas-Braulio E. Dujali, Davao Del Norte, for gross dishonesty and malversation of public funds;<br><br>(2) REQUIRE Clerk of Court Elumbaring to MANIFEST whether she is willing to submit the case for decision on the basis of the pleadings/records already filed and submitted, within ten (10) days from notice; and<br><br>(3) DIRECT Hon. Evalyn Arellano-Morales, Presiding Judge, MCTC, Carmen-Sto. Tomas-Braulio E.

They are reminded to deposit immediately, with authorized government depositories, the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep those funds in their custody. The unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<br><br>Likewise, the practice of respondent in offsetting her collection is not allowed under accounting and auditing rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; By failing to properly remit the cash collections constituting public funds, she violated the trust reposed in her as disbursement officer of the Judiciary.&nbsp; Likewise, her claim that she did not know that she is the accountable officer for the court collections does not convince Us.&nbsp; Clerks of Court are presumed to know their duty to immediately deposit with the authorized government depositories the various funds they receive, for they are not supposed to keep funds in their personal possession.&nbsp; Her failure to deposit the said amount upon collection was prejudicial to the court, which did not earn interest income on the said amount or was not able to otherwise use the said funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Under Section 22 of Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Other Pertinent Civil Service Laws, Dishonesty is classified as a grave offense.
