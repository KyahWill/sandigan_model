Moreover, the RTC upheld the MTC's jurisdiction over the case, affirming the MTC's ratiocination that an action for enforcement of a dormant judgment is a personal action, and hence may be filed either at the court of the place where plaintiffs reside or where the defendants reside.<br><br>In his Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Nilo contended that his petition with the RTC was timely filed as shown by the registry receipt dated March 1, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> stamped on the mailing envelope he used in filing said petition.&nbsp; He argued that this date of mailing is also the date of filing.&nbsp; He also contended that the RTC's Decision was bereft of any explanation as to why it ruled that the case is a personal action.&nbsp; He further alleged that the RTC failed to discuss the issues of prescription and non-compliance with the rule against forum shopping.<br><br>In its Order dated September 20, 2004, the RTC denied the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; It said:<br><br><blockquote>Assuming&nbsp; that the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of posting was March 1, 2004, as shown in the registry<br><br>receipts, still the 60-day reglementary period had already lapsed with December 30, 2003 as the reckoning period when petitioner received the December 9, 2003 Order of Hon. Judge Jose A. Benesisto.&nbsp; With the month of February, 2004 having 29 days, it is now clear that the petition was filed sixty one (61) days after; hence, there is no timeliness of the petition to speak of.<br><br>Civil Case No. 104 is an ordinary action to enforce a dormant judgment filed by plaintiffs against defendants.&nbsp; Being an action for the enforcement of dormant judgment for damages is a personal one and should be brought in any province where the plaintiff or defendant resides, at the option of the plaintiff.&nbsp; As regards prescription, the present rule now is, the prescriptive period commences to run anew from the finality of the revived judgment. A revived judgment is enforceable again by motion within five years and thereafter by another action within ten years from the finality of the revived judgment.&nbsp; There is, therefore, no prescription or beyond the statute of limitations to speak [sic] in the instant case.&nbsp; Petitioner's contention must therefore fail.<br><br>It is but proper and legal that the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 514 of which they are the prevailing parties to institute for the enforcement of a dormant judgment [which right] they have failed to exercise x x x for more than a decade.&nbsp; Being an ordinary action to enforce a dormant judgment, not even testimonial evidence is necessary to enforce such judgment because the decision had long obtained its finality.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Nilo finds the RTC's adverse ruling as wanting in sufficient explanation as to the factual and legal bases for upholding the MTC.&nbsp; He also highlights the failure of the Badillo family to attach to their complaint a certificate of non-forum shopping. Petitioner also argues that the date of mailing of his petition with the RTC is the date of his filing.&nbsp; He stressed that the filing of his petition on March 1, 2004 was well within the prescriptive period.&nbsp; As the 60<sup>th</sup> day from December 30, 2003 fell on a Saturday, he maintains that the Rules of Court allows him to file his petition on the next working day, which is March 1, 2004, a Monday.<br><br>As&nbsp; have&nbsp; already&nbsp; been raised in the&nbsp; courts below,&nbsp; Nilo mentions&nbsp; the<br><br>following grounds for the dismissal of the action against him before the MTC:<br><br>a) The MTC lacks jurisdiction.&nbsp; Nilo reiterates that the prime objective of the Badillo family in Civil Case No. 104 is to recover real property, which makes it a real action.&nbsp; Citing the case of <i>Aldeguer v. Gemelo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> he contends that this suit must be brought before the RTC of Allen, Northern Samar. Besides, the assessed value of the land in controversy, <i>i.e.</i>, P26,940.00, divests the MTC of jurisdiction.<br><br>b) Prescription.&nbsp; Nilo claims that the Badillo family's suit had already lapsed as they allowed 11 years to pass without resorting to any legal remedy before filing the action for revival of judgment.&nbsp; Although the Badillo family moved for the issuance of a writ of execution in Civil Case No. A-514, the same did not interrupt the running of the period to have the judgment enforced by motion or by action.<br><br><b><i>Respondents' Arguments</i></b><br><br>While impliedly acknowledging that Nilo seasonably filed his petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the RTC, the Badillo family note that he should have filed an appeal before the RTC.&nbsp; They claim that they properly filed their case, a personal action, with the MTC of San Isidro, Northern Samar as they are allowed under Section 2, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court to elect the venue as to where to file their case.<br><br>Granting that their action is considered a revival of judgment, the Badillos claim that they filed their suit within the 10-year period.&nbsp; They contend that in filing Civil Case No. 104 in December 1997, the prescriptive period should not be counted from the finality of judgment in Civil Case No. A-514, but should be reckoned from August 22, 1989, when the RTC issued an Order that considered as abandoned&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion to declare&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants in&nbsp; default&nbsp; in&nbsp; the contempt<br><br>proceedings.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>The question that should be settled is whether the RTC correctly affirmed the MTC ruling that it has jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 104.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>Indeed, "[t]he existence and availability of the right of appeal proscribes a resort to <i>certiorari</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; The court <i>a quo </i>could have instead dismissed Nilo's petition on the ground that this question should have been raised by way of an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; This rule is subject to exceptions, such as "when the writs issued are null and void or when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; As will be later on discussed, the RTC, although it ultimately erred in its judgment, was nevertheless correct in entertaining the special civil action for <i>certiorari.&nbsp; </i>The exceptions we mentioned apply in the case at bar, as it turns out that petitioner's jurisdictional objection has compelling basis.<br><br><i>Timeliness of the petition for certiorari</i><br><br>The petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the RTC was timely filed.&nbsp; If the pleading filed was not done personally, the date of mailing, as stamped on the envelope or the registry receipt, is considered as the date of filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; By way of registered mail, Nilo filed his petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the RTC on March 1, 2004, as indicated in the date stamped on its envelope.&nbsp; From the time Nilo received on December 30, 2003 the MTC's denial of his motion for reconsideration, the last day for him to file his petition with the RTC fell on February 28, 2004, a Saturday.&nbsp; Under the Rules, should the last day of the period to file a pleading fall on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, a litigant is allowed to file his or her pleading on the next working day,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which in the case at bar, fell on a Monday, <i>i.e.</i>, March 1, 2004.<br><br><i>Jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 104</i><br><br>We shall now look into the core argument of Nilo anent the MTC's lack of jurisdiction over the case and the alleged prescription of the action.<br><br>"[W]hat determines the nature of the action and which court has jurisdiction over it are the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; In their complaint in Civil Case No. 104, some of the allegations of the Badillo family, which petitioner never opposed and are thus deemed admitted by him, states:<br><br><blockquote>4. That plaintiffs are the joint owners of Lot No. 4080. Pls-54, with a total area of 10,167 square meters, covered by OCT No. 736 in the name of Eutequio Badillo, deceased husband of plaintiff Fructosa Badillo and father of the rest of the other plaintiffs, covered by Tax Declaration No. 9160 and assessed at P26,940.00;<br><br>5.
