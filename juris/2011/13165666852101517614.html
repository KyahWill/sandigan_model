				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal assailing the June 5, 2008 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>) in CA-G.R. HC-No. 02734 which affirmed with modification the February 6, 2007 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Baguio City, Branch 61 <i>(RTC)</i>.&nbsp; The RTC found accused Juan Mendoza y Vicente guilty of having violated Section 5 and Section 11, Article II of Republic Act (<i>R.A.</i>) No. 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br><b><u>Version of the Prosecution</u></b><br><br>The evidence for the prosecution shows that Senior Police Officer 4 Edelfonso Sison (<i>SPO4 Sison</i>) received information from a long-serving unidentified informant of the Baguio City Police Office's (<i>BCPO</i>) Drug Enforcement Section (<i>DES</i>) that the accused contacted him and offered to sell <i>shabu</i> worth P1,000.00 to any interested buyer.&nbsp; The accused then suggested that they meet at the stairs of the Cresencia Barangay Hall along Bokawkan Road.<br><br>After interviewing the informant, Police Senior Inspector Myles Pascual (<i>PSI Pascual</i>) decided to conduct a buy-bust operation to entrap the accused.&nbsp; PSI Pascual made arrangements for the informant, the accused, and the poseur buyer officer to meet on April 14, 2005 around 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon at the stairs below the Cresencia Barangay Hall along Bokawkan Road. He planned for an entrapment operation and put together a team, with SPO4 Sison, as team leader; Police Officer 3 Ricky Calamiong <i>(PO3 Calamiong)</i> and PO3 Roy Mateo (<i>PO3 Mateo</i>), as back-up officers; and Police Officer 2 Edgar Antolin <i>(PO2 Antolin)</i>, as the poseur buyer.<br><br>In coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency <i>(PDEA)</i>, the entrapment team proceeded to the area at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, half an hour before the scheduled time.&nbsp; The team parked their vehicle 20 to 30 meters away from the designated transaction area. PO2 Antolin and the informant alighted and proceeded to the stairway to wait for the accused.<br><br>Twenty minutes later, the accused arrived and approached the informant. The latter introduced PO2 Antolin as the buyer. After the accused asked if the buyer had the money, PO2 Antolin handed over P1,000.00.&nbsp; The accused then gave him two (2) sachets containing white crystalline substance. PO2 Antolin raised his right hand, the pre-arranged signal, signifying to the other team members that the transaction had been consummated. The team rushed to assist PO2 Antolin, who arrested the accused and recovered the buy-bust-money. PO2 Antolin frisked the accused and recovered five (5) more small transparent sachets with white crystalline substance from the pants pocket of the accused. He turned over the same to the team leader, SPO4 Sison.<br><br>SPO4 Sison informed the accused in Tagalog the reason why he was being arrested and apprised him of his constitutional rights. The accused merely nodded but otherwise kept silent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; The buy-bust team then took the accused to the BCPO, where PO2 Antolin identified him as Juan Mendoza, alias "<i>Ampi.</i>"<br><br>In a preliminary test, the white crystalline substance recovered from the accused tested positive for the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The case records state that after the conduct of such preliminary test, the items confiscated from the accused were turned over to the Philippine National Police <i>(PNP)</i> Crime Laboratory Service at Camp Bado Dangwa, La Trinidad, Benguet for further analysis and disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>A confirmatory test conducted on the same day by Police Inspector and Forensic Chemical Officer Cecile Akiangan Bullong yielded the same result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><u>Version of the Accused</u></b><br><br>The accused alleges that in the afternoon of April 14, 2005, he was walking down Sepic Road, Baguio City, on his way home from his brother's house in Guisad, where he had just finished washing diapers and clothes. A vehicle stopped beside him and SPO4 Sison alighted. The accused knew SPO4 Sison because the latter arrested him for a drug offense way back in 1997, for which he was convicted and incarcerated in Camp Sampaguita for five years.<br><br>SPO4 Sison showed him a photograph and demanded information about the person in the photo. When he insisted that he did not know who it was, SPO4 Sison invited him to the BCPO-DES.&nbsp; As he could not decline, he went along with him.<br><br>At the DES, the police again asked him if he knew the person in the photo and a certain Gary Chua, but he replied in the negative. He was also questioned whether he knew someone who was selling drugs, and he again replied in the negative.&nbsp; He told the police that since his release from prison, he no longer dabbled in the drug trade, as he already had a family. When he told SPO4 Sison that he did not know anyone who was selling drugs, SPO4 Sison got angry.<br><br>After an hour, he was informed that he would be subjected to a drug test. Again, unable to refuse, he was subjected to a drug test at the BCPO Station 7 laboratory, in front of the DES. He was then brought to the Baguio General Hospital (<i>BGH</i>) for a medical examination, and later back to the police station.<br><br>During the interrogation at the police office, he did not have a counsel present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; SPO4 Sison did not inform him that he was being arrested for the possession of the 5 heat-sealed plastic sachets containing <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><b><u>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</u></b><br><br>In its Decision dated February 6, 2007, the RTC found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt in both Criminal Case No. 24384-R and Criminal Case No. 24385-R.
