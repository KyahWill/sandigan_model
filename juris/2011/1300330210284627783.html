NR-699933 and LU-631498, a prohibited drug, without the corresponding license and prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellants entered a not guilty plea upon arraignment. During the pre-trial conference, the parties stipulated on the identity of the accused; that they were arrested at <i>Barangay</i> Mauway, Mandaluyong City, and that the arresting officers were PO1 Gilbert Buenafe (PO1 Buenafe) and PO1 Walter Alano (PO1 Alano).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution's version of the facts is as follow:<br><br>Acting on a tip from an informant that there is rampant selling of illegal drugs in Antipolo Street, <i>Barangay</i> Mauway, Mandaluyong City, the Chief of the Metro South Narcotics Office in Taguig ordered a buy-bust operation against appellants on 18 August 1998.&nbsp; The team, headed by SPO2 Dante Rebolado (SP02 Rebolado), was composed of five (5) to six (6) members.&nbsp; PO1 Alano was the designated <i>poseur</i>-buyer while PO1 Buenafe acted as back-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Two (2) pieces of P100.00 peso bills with Serial No. NR-699933 and No. LU-631498 were prepared, along with 23 cut-out money-sized papers or "boodle money." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The initials "WAA" were marked on the two (2) P100.00 peso bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>After the briefing, the team proceeded to 338 Antipolo Street.&nbsp; PO1 Buenafe positioned himself inside a vehicle, which was parked five (5) meters away from the target house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; PO1 Alano and the informant was approached by a man who identified himself as Roding, and the latter invited them to go inside the house where they were met by Ronnie. The informant then ordered one (1) kilo of <i>marijuana</i> from Ronnie for P3,000.00.&nbsp; Ronnie ordered Roding to get the money from PO1 Alano while he went inside a room.&nbsp; A few seconds later, Ronnie went out of the room and handed PO1 Alano a green transparent plastic bag containing two (2) brown folded envelopes, the contents of which are bricks of dried <i>marijuana</i>.&nbsp; Immediately after verifying the contents as <i>marijuana</i>, PO1 Alano introduced himself as a police officer and arrested Ronnie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Roding was able to go out of the house but he was later on arrested by PO1 Buenafe, who responded to the scene when he noticed a commotion outside the target house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The boodle money was seized from Roding.&nbsp; Appellants were brought to the South Metro Narcotics District Office in Fort Bonifacio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>While at the police station, PO1 Alano placed his initials on each of the brown envelopes containing the <i>marijuana</i> before bringing it to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Police Senior Inspector Grace Eustaquio examined the specimens brought to her and she prepared Physical Sciences Report No. D-2350-98 confirming that the specimens were found positive for <i>marijuana</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The defense belied the allegations that there was a buy-bust operation conducted wherein they were caught red-handed selling <i>marijuana</i>.<br><br>Roding, a tricycle driver, testified that he went to Calbayog Street in Mandaluyong City to see his niece, who happens to be his tricycle operator, because he wanted to get money to buy spare parts for his tricycle. While he was waiting for his niece to arrive, he went to the store of Ronnie to buy cigarettes.&nbsp; Suddenly, a group of men who introduced themselves as Narcotics Command (NARCOM) operatives arrived and asked for Ronnie.&nbsp; Ronnie came forward and was handcuffed.&nbsp; Roding was also invited to go with the NARCOM operatives for questioning.&nbsp; When Roding refused, he was forced to board a vehicle and was brought along to Fort Bonifacio. While inside the vehicle, Roding was forced to admit that he was with Ronnie selling prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Ronnie stated that while he was manning his store, three (3) cars stopped in front of the store and around seven (7) NARCOM operatives alighted from the cars.&nbsp; Ronnie was then frisked and arrested.&nbsp; Some of the NARCOM operatives searched his house.&nbsp; It was then at that moment when Roding came by his store to buy cigarettes. Roding was likewise arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Ronnie claimed that he knew Roding only two (2) days before they were arrested or on 16 August 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> while Roding apparently came to know Ronnie as early as November 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In finding appellant guilty, the RTC held that the prosecution clearly established that there was a lawful buy-bust operation conducted by operatives of NARCOM and the appellants were lawfully arrested upon the consummation of the sale transaction of <i>marijuana</i>.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of said decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, this Court finds accused RONALDO MORALES y FLORES alias "Ronnie" and RODOLFO FLORES y MANGYAN alias "Roding" both GUILTY for violation of Section 4, Article II in relation to Section 21, Article IV of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, and both accused RONALDO MORALES y FLORES and RODOLFO FLORES y MANGYAN are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for TWENTY (20) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY to FORTY (40) YEARS of reclusion perpetua considering that the death penalty can no longer be imposed in accordance with Republic Act No. 9346 which abolished the imposition of the death penalty.<br><br>The green transparent plastic bag containing two (2) brown folded envelopes which further contained 635.5 grams and 152.8 grams of <i>marijuana</i> fruiting tops, respectively, with a total weight of 788.3 grams and the two (2) pieces of P100.00 peso bills one with Serial No. NR699933 x x x and NU631498 x x x, and the eight (8) pieces of cut-out money-sized papers or "boodle money" x x x and fifteen (15) pieces of cut-out money-sized papers or "boodle money" x x x are hereby forfeited in favor of the government and the same will be disposed of in accordance with law.<br><br>Finally, the period of detention of accused Rodolfo Flores y Mangyan at the Mandaluyong City Jail is hereby fully credited to his account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>On 20 June 2007 appellant appealed to the Court of Appeals <i>via</i> a notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; On 26 November 2008, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment affirming with modification the RTC's decision in Criminal Case No.&nbsp; MC-98-746-D-H.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals gave weight to the testimony of the <i>poseur</i>-<i>buyer</i> which revealed material details of the buy-bust operations.&nbsp; In imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering the payment of P500,000.00 each as fine, the Court of Appeals took into consideration that amount of <i>marijuana</i> sold pursuant to Section 4, in relation to Section 20 of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>Sale, Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Prohibited Drugs.</i> - The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death and a fine from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><i>Sec. 20.Application of Penalties, Confiscation and Forfeiture of the Proceeds or instrument of the Crime.</i> -- The penalties for offenses under Section 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II and Sections 14, 14-A, 15 and 16 of Article III of this Act shall be Applied if the dangerous drugs involved is in any of the following quantities:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>5.750 grams or more of indian hemp or marijuana;<br><br></blockquote>Undaunted, appellant filed a notice of appeal before this Court.

They are certainly not sufficient to overturn their conviction. Time and again, this Court has ruled that the witnesses' testimonies need only to corroborate one another on material details surrounding the actual commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>This Court likewise sustains the findings of the trial court on the credibility of these prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; In cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Law, appellate courts tend to rely heavily on the trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses, because the latter had the unique opportunity, denied to the appellate courts, to observe the witnesses and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under direct and cross-examination.&nbsp; Hence, its factual findings are accorded great respect, even finality, absent any showing that certain facts of weight and substance bearing on the elements of the crime have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In recognition of the credibility of these witnesses, the presumption that police officers have performed their duties in good faith is correctly applied in this case.&nbsp; Appellants failed to adduce any ill or improper motive on the part of the NARCOM operatives.&nbsp; In fact, Roding admitted that it was his first time to meet them and neither does he have any misunderstanding with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Absent any clear and convincing evidence that the NARCOM operatives had ill or improper motive to falsely testify against appellants, their testimonies regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the buy-bust operation must be accorded full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Appellants also assert that the police officers failed to establish the chain of custody of the <i>marijuana</i>, considering that PO1 Alano categorically admitted that the <i>marijuana</i> was only marked at their office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Resurreccion,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court reiterates that failure to immediately mark seized drugs will not automatically impair the integrity of chain of custody as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>PO1 Alano accounted for the crucial links in the chain of custody of the <i>marijuana</i>. It can be recalled that the green plastic bag containing <i>marijuana</i> placed inside two (2) envelopes was handed to him by Ronnie. After arresting appellants, PO1 Alano and the rest of the NARCOM operatives immediately brought appellants and the seized <i>marijuana</i> to Fort Bonifacio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Upon reaching the camp, PO1 Alano placed his initials on each envelope and turned them over to P/Supt. Pepito Dumantay (P/Supt. Dumantay).&nbsp; Together with PO1 Buenafe and P/Supt Dumantay, PO1 Alano brought the <i>marijuana</i> to the PNP Crime Laboratory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The forensic chemist examined the very same specimen brought to her, and in her findings, she confirmed it to be positive for <i>marijuana</i>.<br><br>The prosecution indeed sufficiently proved that that the chain of custody of the <i>marijuana </i>was never broken from the time PO1 Alano received the <i>marijuana</i> from Ronnie up to the moment it was presented in court as evidence.<br><br>We quote with approval the ruling of the appellate court in this matter:<br><br><blockquote>As borne out by the extant evidence, after the conclusion of the entrapment operation, the buy-bust team, together with appellants, proceeded to their headquarters at Fort Bonifacio.&nbsp; Thereat, PO1 Alano marked with his initials the two (2) brown envelopes containing the <i>marijuana</i> and then turned over custody of the same to the Chief of their unit, P.Supt. Pepito Dumantay.&nbsp; The latter in turn prepared a request for laboratory examination thereof, describing them in the request as " . . . two (2) folden brown envelopes, each containign suspected dried <i>marijuana</i> flowering tops, marked WAA/8/18/98."&nbsp; The qualitative examination of the specimen conducted by forensic chemist S/Insp.
