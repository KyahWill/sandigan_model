She is likewise ordered to indemnify the offended party in the sum of Nine Hundred Seventy-two Thousand One Hundred Pesos (Php972,100.00) representing the total value of the cash and jewelry taken by the accused without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>On March 26, 2007, Olaco was committed to the Correctional Institution for Women in Mandaluyong City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Olaco filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals, which was docketed as CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 02756.&nbsp; In a Decision promulgated on January 20, 2011, the appellate court denied Olaco's appeal and affirmed with modification the RTC judgment, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is DENIED. The Decision dated 05 March 2007 of the Regional Trial Court of Las Pinas City, Branch 198 in Crim. Case No. 04-0746 finding accused-appellant Juliet Olaco y Poler guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Theft under Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing her to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is hereby AFFIRMED with&nbsp; MODIFICATION in that accused-appellant is hereby ordered to pay private complainant Ruben Vinluan the reduced amount of Php200,000.00, as actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>However, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated January 27, 2011, Rachel D. Ruelo, Superintendent IV of the Correctional Institution for Women, informed the Court of Appeals that Olaco had died on February 17, 2010.&nbsp; A photocopy of Olaco's Death Certificate was attached to Ruelo's&nbsp; letter.<br><br>On February 2, 2011, Olaco's counsel still filed, on behalf of his deceased client, a Notice of Appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which the Court of Appeals gave due course on February 8, 2011.&nbsp; Accordingly, the appellate court directed its Judicial Records Division to elevate to us the original records in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 02756.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated July 18, 2011, we required Ruelo to submit a certified true copy of Olaco's death certificate from the local civil registrar within five days from notice.<br><br>In compliance with the foregoing Resolution, Ruelo submitted on September 15, 2011 a certified true copy of Olaco's Death Certificate, issued by the Office of the Civil Registrar of Mandaluyong City.<br><br>Given Olaco's death, we must now determine the fate of her appeal before us.<br><br>Olaco's death on February 17, 2010, during the pendency of her appeal, extinguished not only her criminal liability for qualified theft committed against private complainant Ruben Vinluan, but also her civil liability, particularly the award for actual damages, solely arising from or based on said crime.<br><br>According to Article 89(1) of the Revised Penal Code, criminal liability is totally extinguished:<br><br><blockquote><ol><ol><li> By the death of the convict, as to the personal penalties; and as to pecuniary penalties, liability therefor is extinguished only when the death of the offender occurs before final judgment.</li></ol></ol></blockquote>Applying the foregoing provision, we laid down the following guidelines in <i>People v. Bayotas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> Death of the accused pending appeal of his conviction extinguishes his criminal liability as well as the civil liability based solely thereon.&nbsp; As opined by Justice Regalado, in this regard, "the death of the accused prior to final judgment terminates his criminal liability and only the civil liability directly arising from and based solely on the offense committed, <i>i.e</i>., civil liability <i>ex delicto</i> in <i>senso strictiore</i>."<br><br></li><li>Corollarily, the claim for civil liability survives notwithstanding the death of [the] accused, if the same may also be predicated on a source of obligation other than delict.&nbsp; Article 1157 of the Civil Code enumerates these other sources of obligation from which the civil liability may arise as a result of the same act or omission:<br><br>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Law<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Contracts<br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Quasi-contracts<br><br>x x x x<br><br>e) Quasi-delicts<br><br></li><li>Where the civil liability survives, as explained in Number 2 above, an action for recovery therefor may be pursued but only by way of filing a separate civil action and subject to Section 1, Rule 111 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure as amended.&nbsp; This separate civil action may be enforced either against the executor/administrator or the estate of the accused, depending on the source of obligation upon which the same is based as explained above.<br><br></li><li>Finally, the private offended party need not fear a forfeiture of his right to file this separate civil action by prescription, in cases where during the prosecution of the criminal action and prior to its extinction, the private-offended party instituted together therewith the civil action.&nbsp; In such case, the statute of limitations on the civil liability is deemed interrupted during the pendency of the criminal case, conformably with [the] provisions of Article 1155 of the Civil Code, that should thereby avoid any apprehension on a possible privation of right by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Clearly, it is already unnecessary for us to rule on Olaco's appeal. Olaco's appeal was still pending and no final judgment had been rendered against her at the time of her death.&nbsp; Hence, whether or not Olaco was guilty of the crime charged had become irrelevant because even assuming that Olaco did incur criminal liability and civil liability <i>ex delicto</i>, these were totally extinguished by her death, following Article 89(1) of the Revised Penal Code and our disquisition in <i>Bayotas</i>.<br><br>For the same reasons, the appealed Decision dated January 20, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 02756 - finding Olaco guilty of qualified theft, sentencing her to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and ordering her to pay private complainant Ruben Vinluan actual damages in the amount of P200,000.00 - had become ineffectual.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the death of accused-appellant Juliet Olaco y Poler, the Decision dated January 20, 2011 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR.-H.C. No. 02756 is <b>SET ASIDE</b> and Criminal Case No. 04-0746 before the Regional Trial Court of Las Piñas City is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
