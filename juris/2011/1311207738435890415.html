				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At bar are two consolidated Petitions for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> concerning 78 parcels of land located in Barrio Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City. The parties in both cases have been in litigation over these lots for the last two decades in what seems to be an endless exercise of filing&nbsp; repetitious suits before the Court of Appeals and even this Court, questioning the various decisions and resolutions&nbsp; issued by the two separate trial courts involved.&nbsp; With this decision, it is intended that&nbsp; all legal disputes among the parties concerned, particularly over all the issues involved in these cases, will finally come to an end<br><br>In the Petition in <b>G.R.

SP No. 84382 wherein the Special Nineteenth Division of the Court of Appeals annulled and set aside the March 11, 2004 Order of the Lapu-Lapu RTC in Civil Case No. 2203-L.<br><br>Both these cases stem from the same undisputed factual antecedents as follows:<br><br>Lapu-Lapu Development &amp; Housing Corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (LLDHC) was the registered owner of seventy-eight (78) lots (subject lots), situated in Barrio Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City.<br><br>On February 4, 1974, LLDHC and the GSIS entered into a Project and Loan Agreement for the development of the subject lots.&nbsp; GSIS agreed to extend a Twenty-Five Million Peso-loan (P25,000,000.00) to LLDHC, and in return, LLDHC will develop, subdivide, and sell its lots to GSIS members.&nbsp; To secure the payment of the loan, LLDHC executed a real estate mortgage over the subject lots in favor of GSIS.<br><br>For LLDHC's failure to fulfill its obligations, GSIS foreclosed the mortgage.&nbsp; As the lone bidder in the public auction sale, GSIS acquired the subject lots, and eventually was able to consolidate its ownership over the subject lots with the corresponding transfer certificates of title (TCTs) issued in its name.<br><br>On November 19, 1979, GMC offered to purchase on installments the subject lots from GSIS for a total price of One Million One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,100,000.00), with the aggregate area specified as 423,177 square meters.&nbsp; GSIS accepted the offer and on February 26, 1980, executed a Deed of Conditional Sale over the subject lots.&nbsp; However, when GMC discovered that the total area of the subject lots was only 298,504 square meters, it wrote GSIS and proposed to proportionately reduce the purchase price to conform to the actual total area of the subject lots.&nbsp; GSIS approved this proposal and an Amendment to the Deed of Conditional Sale was executed to reflect the final sales agreement between GSIS and GMC.<br><br>On April 23, 1980, LLDHC filed a complaint for Annulment of Foreclosure with Writ of Mandatory Injunction against GSIS before the RTC of Manila (Manila RTC).&nbsp; This became <b>Civil Case No. R-82-3429</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and was assigned to Branch 38.<br><br>On November 3, 1989, GMC filed its own complaint against GSIS for Specific Performance with Damages before the Lapu-Lapu RTC.&nbsp; The complaint was docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 2203-L</b> and it sought to compel GSIS to execute a Final Deed of Sale over the subject lots since the purchase price had already been fully paid by GMC.&nbsp; GSIS, in defense, submitted to the court a Commission on Audit (COA) Memorandum dated April 3, 1989, purportedly disallowing in audit the sale of the subject lots for "apparent inherent irregularities," the sale price to GMC being lower than GSIS's purchase price at the public auction.&nbsp; LLDHC, having been allowed to intervene, filed a Motion to Dismiss GMC's complaint.&nbsp; When this motion was denied, LLDHC filed its Answer-in-Intervention and participated in the ensuing proceedings as an intervenor.<br><br>GMC, on February 1, 1992, filed its own Motion to Intervene with a Complaint-in-Intervention in Civil Case No. R-82-3429.&nbsp; This was dismissed on February 17, 1992 and finally denied on March 23, 1992 by the Manila RTC on the ground that GMC can protect its interest in another proceeding. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On February 24, 1992, after a full-blown trial, the Lapu-Lapu RTC rendered its Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> in Civil Case No. 2203-L, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendant to:<br><br>1. Execute the final deed of absolute sale and deliver the seventy-eight (78) certificates of title covering said seventy-eight (78) parcels of land to the [Group Management Corporation (GMC)];<br><br>2. Pay [GMC] actual damages, plus attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, in the amount of P285,638.88 and P100,000.00 exemplary damages;<br><br>3. [D]ismissing <i>in toto</i> intervenor's complaint-in-intervention for lack of evidence of legal standing and legal interest in the suit, as well as failure to substantiate any cause of action against either [GMC] or [GSIS]. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><br>In deciding in favor of GMC, the Lapu-Lapu RTC held that there existed a valid and binding sales contract between GSIS and GMC, which GSIS could not continue to ignore without any justifiable reason especially since GMC had already fully complied with its obligations. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Lapu-Lapu RTC found GSIS's invocation of COA's alleged disapproval of the sale belated and self-serving.&nbsp; The Lapu-Lapu RTC said that COA, in disapproving GSIS's sale of the subject lots to GMC, violated its own circular which excludes the disposal by a government owned and/or controlled corporation of its "acquired assets" (<i>e.g</i>., foreclosed assets or collaterals acquired in the regular course of business).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; The Lapu-Lapu RTC also held that COA may not intrude into GSIS's charter-granted power to dispose of its acquired assets within five years from acquisition by "preventing/aborting the sale in question by refusing to pass it in audit." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the Lapu-Lapu RTC held that the GSIS-proferred COA Memorandum was inadmissible in evidence not only because as a mere photocopy it failed to measure up to the "best evidence" rule under the Revised Rules of Court, but also because no one from COA, not even the auditor who supposedly prepared it, was ever presented to testify to the veracity of its contents or its due execution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In dismissing LLDHC's complaint-in-intervention, the Lapu-Lapu RTC held that LLDHC failed to prove its legal personality as a party-intervenor and all it was able to establish was a "suggestion of right for [GSIS] to renege [on] the sale for reasons peculiar to [GSIS] but not transmissible nor subject to invocation by [LLDHC]." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>LLDHC and GSIS filed their separate Notices of Appeal but these were dismissed by the Lapu-Lapu RTC on December 6, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On May 10, 1994, the Manila RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in Civil Case No. R-82-3429.&nbsp; The Manila RTC held that GSIS was unable to prove the alleged violations committed by LLDHC to warrant the foreclosure of the mortgage over the subject lots.&nbsp; Thus, the Manila RTC annulled the foreclosure made by GSIS and ordered LLDHC to pay GSIS the balance of its loan with interest, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>1. ANNULLING the foreclosure by the defendant GSIS of the mortgage over the seventy-eight (78) parcels of land here involved:<br><br>2. CANCELLING the consolidated certificates of [title] issued in the name of GSIS and directing the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City to issue new certificates of [title] over those seventy-eight (78) parcels of land in the name of the plaintiff, in exactly the same condition as they were before the foreclosure;<br><br>3. ORDERING the plaintiff to pay the GSIS the amount of P9,200,000.00 with interest thereon at the rate of twelve (12%) percent per annum commencing from October 12, 1989 until fully paid; and<br><br>4. ORDERING defendant GSIS to execute a properly registrable release of discharge of mortgage over the parcels of land here involved after full payment of such amount by the plaintiff.<br><br>All claims and counterclaims by the parties as against each other are hereby dismissed.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Armed with the Manila RTC decision, LLDHC, on July 27, 1994, filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Annulment of Judgment of the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision in Civil Case No. 2203-L. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; LLDHC alleged that the Manila RTC decision nullified the sale of the subject lots to GMC and consequently, the Lapu-Lapu RTC decision was also nullified.<br><br>This petition, docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 34696</b>, was dismissed by the Court of Appeals on December 29, 1994. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals, in finding that the grounds LLDHC relied on were without merit, said:<br><br><blockquote>In fine, there being no showing from the allegations of the petition that the respondent court is without jurisdiction over the subject matter and of the parties in Civil Case No. 2309 [2203-L], petitioner has no cause of action for the annulment of judgment. The complaint must allege ultimate facts for the annulment of the decision (Avendana v. Bautista, 142 SCRA 41).&nbsp; We find none in this case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>No appeal having been taken by LLDHC, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 34696 became final and executory on January 28, 1995, as stated in the Entry of Final Judgment dated August 18, 1995. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On February 2, 1995, LLDHC filed before this Court a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><i> </i>docketed as <b>G.R. No. 118633</b>.&nbsp; LLDHC, in seeking to annul the February 24, 1992 Decision of the Lapu-Lapu RTC, again alleged that the Manila RTC Decision nullified the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision.<br><br>Finding the petition a mere reproduction of the Petition for Annulment filed before the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 34696, this Court, in a Resolution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated September 6, 1996, dismissed the petition in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>In a last ditch attempt to annul the February 24, 1992 Decision of the respondent court, this petition was brought before us on February 2, 1995.<br><br>Dismissal of this petition is inevitable.<br><br>The instant petition which is captioned, For: Certiorari With Preliminary Injunction, is actually another Petition for Annulment of Judgment of the February 24, 1992 Decision of the respondent Regional Trial Court of Lapu-lapu City, Branch 27 in Civil Case No. 2203-L.&nbsp; A close perusal of this petition as well as the Petition for Annulment of Judgment brought by the petitioner before the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 34696 reveals that the instant petition is a mere reproduction of the petition/complaint filed before the appellate tribunal for annulment of judgment. Paragraphs two (2) to eighteen (18) of this petition were copied verbatim from the Petition for Annulment of Judgment earlier filed in the court <i>a quo</i>, except for the designation of the parties thereto, <i>i.e</i>., plaintiff was changed to petitioner, defendant to respondent.&nbsp; In fact, even the prayer in this petition is the same prayer in the Petition for Annulment of Judgment dismissed by the Court of Appeals, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Under Section 9(2) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, otherwise known as "The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980," it is the Court of Appeals (then the Intermediate Appellate Court), and not this Court, which has jurisdiction to annul judgments of Regional Trial Courts, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b> SEC. 9.&nbsp; Jurisdiction</b> -- The Intermediate Appellate Court shall exercise:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) <i>Exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments of Regional Trial Courts; and</i><br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Thus, this Court apparently has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition which is evidently another petition to annul the February 24, 1992 Decision of the respondent Branch 27, Regional Trial Court of Lapu-lapu City, it appearing that jurisdiction thereto properly pertains to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Such a petition was brought before the appellate court, but due to petitioner's failure to nullify Judge Risos' Decision in said forum, LLDHC, apparently at a loss as to what legal remedy to take, brought the instant petition under the guise of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 seeking once again to annul the judgment of Branch 27.<br><br>Instead of filing this petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, which is essentially another Petition to Annul Judgment, petitioner LLDHC should have filed a timely Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court of the decision of the Court of Appeals, dated December 29, 1994, dismissing the Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by the petitioner LLDHC before the court <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; But, this is all academic now.&nbsp; The appellate court's decision had become final and executory on January 28, 1995. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br>Despite such pronouncements, this Court, nevertheless, passed upon the merits of LLDHC's Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in G.R. No. 118633.&nbsp; This Court said that the petition, "which was truly for annulment of judgment," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> cannot prosper because the two grounds on which a judgment may be annulled were not present in the case. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Going further, this Court held that even if the petition were to be given due course as a petition for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, it would still be dismissible for not being brought within a reasonable period of time as it took LLDHC almost three years from the time it received the February 24, 1992 decision until the time it brought this action. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>LLDHC's motion for reconsideration was denied with finality<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on November 18, 1996, and on February 18, 1997, an Entry of Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> was made certifying that the September 6, 1996 Resolution of this Court in G.R. No. 118633 had become final and executory on December 23, 1996.<br><br>Consequently, on November 28, 1996, the Lapu-Lapu RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> directing the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 2203-L.&nbsp; A corresponding Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> was issued on December 17, 1996.&nbsp; The Motions to Stay Execution filed by LLDHC and GSIS were denied by the Lapu-Lapu RTC on February 19, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on December 27, 1996, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> in the separate appeals taken by GSIS and LLDHC from the May 10, 1994 Manila RTC Decision in Civil Case No. R-82-3429. This case, docketed as <b>CA-G.R. CV No. 49117</b>, affirmed the Manila RTC decision with modification insofar as awarding LLDHC attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<br><br>On March 3, 1997, GSIS came to this Court on a Petition for Review of the Court of Appeals' decision in <b>CA-G.R. CV No. 49117</b>.&nbsp; This was docketed as <b>G.R. No. 127732</b> and was dismissed on April 14, 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> due to late filing, the due date being January 31, 1997.&nbsp; This dismissal became final and executory on May 30, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 1997, LLDHC filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction before the Court of Appeals, praying that GMC and the Lapu-Lapu RTC be ordered to cease and desist from proceeding with the execution of its Decision in Civil Case No. 2203-L, on the theory that the Manila RTC decision was a supervening event which made it mandatory for the Lapu-Lapu RTC to stop the execution of its decision.&nbsp; This case was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 44052</b>.<b>&nbsp; </b>On July 16, 1997, the Court of Appeals issued an Order temporarily restraining the Lapu-Lapu RTC and GMC from executing the February 24, 1992 decision in Civil Case No. 2203-L so as not to render the resolution of the case moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On July 21, 1997, because of GSIS's continued refusal to implement the December 17, 1996 Writ of Execution, the Lapu-Lapu RTC, upon GMC's motion, issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> redirecting its instructions to the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the defendant GSIS having refused to implement the Order of this Court dated December 17, 1996 the Court in accordance with Rule 39, Sec. 10-a of the 1997 Rules of Procedure, hereby directs the Register of Deeds of Lapu-lapu City to cancel the Transfer Certificate of Titles of the properties involved in this case and to issue new ones in the name of the plaintiff and to deliver the same to the latter within ten (10) days after this Order shall have become final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>While the TRO issued by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 44052 was in effect, the Manila RTC, on August 1, 1997, issued a Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of its judgment in Civil Case No. R-82-3429. On August 7, 1997, the Sheriff implemented the Writ and ordered the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City to cancel the consolidated certificates of title issued in the name of GSIS and to issue new ones in favor of LLDHC.&nbsp; In conformity with the TRO, the Lapu-Lapu RTC on August 19, 1997, ordered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the suspension of its July 21, 1997 Order. With no similar restraining order against the execution of the Manila RTC Decision, a Writ of Possession was issued on August 21, 1997 to cause GSIS and all persons claiming rights under it to vacate the properties in question and to place LLDHC in peaceful possession thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On October 23, 1997, the Lapu-Lapu RTC, being aware of the events that have taken place while the TRO was in effect, issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> reiterating its previous Orders of November 28, 1996, December 17, 1996, and July 21, 1997.&nbsp; The Lapu-Lapu RTC held that since the restraining order issued by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 44052 had already lapsed by operation of law, and the February 24, 1992 Decision in Civil Case No. 2203-L had not only become final and executory but had been affirmed and upheld by both the Court of Appeals and this Court, the inescapable mandate was to give due course to the efficacy of its decision.&nbsp; The Lapu-Lapu RTC thus directed the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City to effect the transfer of the titles to the subject lots in favor of GMC and declared "any and all acts done by the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City null and void starting with the surreptitious issuance of the new certificates of title in the name of [LLDHC], contrary" to its decision and orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On November 13, 1997, LLDHC filed before the Court of Appeals another Petition for <i>Certiorari </i>with preliminary injunction and motion to consolidate with CA-G.R. SP No. 44052.&nbsp; This case was docketed as <b>CA-G.R.

SP No. 44052 would likewise be dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> by the Court of Appeals on January 9, 1998, but this time, on the merits, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The validity of the decision of the respondent judge in Civil Case No. 2303-L has thus been brought both before this Court and to the Supreme Court by the petitioner.&nbsp; In both instances the respondent judge has been upheld.&nbsp; The instant petition is petitioner's latest attempt to resist the implementation or execution of that decision using as a shield a decision of a Regional Trial Court in the National Capital Region.&nbsp; We are not prepared to allow it.&nbsp; The applicable rule and jurisprudence are clear.

SP No. 34696) on July 27, 1994 and it used therein the Manila RTC Decision as its main ground for annulment of the Lapu-Lapu RTC decision.<br><br>The Court of Appeals nonetheless dismissed LLDHC's Petition for Annulment of Judgment, in CA-G.R. SP No. 34696, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> and that became final and executory on January 28, 1995, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> after LLDHC interposed no appeal.&nbsp; The entry of judgment in this case was issued on August 18, 1995. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the similar petition of LLDHC before this Court in G.R. No. 118633 was decided on September 6, 1996 and became final and executory on December 23, 1996.&nbsp; Therefore, the ruling by the Manila RTC is evidently not a supervening event.&nbsp; It was already in existence even before the decision in Civil Case No. 2203-L attained finality.<br><br>Just as LLDHC and GSIS, as the losing parties, had the right to file their respective appeals within the prescribed period, GMC, as the winning party in Civil Case No. 2203-L, equally had the correlative right to benefit from the finality of the resolution of its case, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>A final judgment vests in the prevailing party a right recognized and protected by law under the due process clause of the Constitution.

No. 141407, penned by former Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban, the Court already passed upon the lack of effect of the Manila RTC Decision on the finality of the Lapu Lapu RTC decision in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>The records of the case clearly show that the Lapulapu Decision has become final and executory and is thus valid and binding upon the parties. Obviously, petitioner [LLDHC] is again trying <b>another backdoor attempt to annul the final and executory</b> <b>Decision of the Lapulapu RTC</b>.<br><br><i>First</i>, it was petitioner that filed on March 11, 1992 a <b>Notice of Appeal</b> contesting the Lapulapu RTC Judgment in Civil Case No. 2203-L rendered on February 24, 1992. The Notice was however <b>rejected by the said RTC for being frivolous and dilatory.</b> Since petitioner had done nothing thereafter, the Decision clearly became final and executory.<br><br><b>However, upon receipt of the Manila RTC Decision, petitioner found a new tool to evade the already final Lapulapu Decision by seeking the annulment of the latter in a Petition with the CA</b>. <b>However, the appellate court dismissed the action</b>, because petitioner had been unable to prove any of the grounds for annulment; namely lack of jurisdiction or extrinsic fraud. Because no appeal had been taken by petitioner, the ruling of the CA also became final and executory.<br><br><i>Second</i>, <b>the Supreme Court likewise recognized the finality of the CA Decision when it threw out LLDHC's Petition for Certiorari in GR No. 118633.</b> This Court ruled thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Instead of filing this petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, which is essentially another Petition to Annul Judgment, petitioner LLDHC should have filed a timely Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court of the decision of the Court of Appeals, dated December 29, 1994, dismissing the Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by the petitioner LLDHC before the court a quo. <i>But this is all academic now. The appellate court's decision had become final and executory on January 28, 1995</i>."</blockquote><br>Jurisprudence mandates that when a decision becomes final and executory, it becomes valid and binding upon the parties and their successors in interest. Such decision or order can no longer be disturbed or reopened no matter how erroneous it may have been. Petitioner's failure to file an appeal within the reglementary period renders the judgment final and executory. The perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is mandatory. Failure to conform to the rules regarding appeal will render the judgment final and executory and, hence, unappealable. <b>Therefore, since the Lapulapu Decision has become final and executory, its execution has become mandatory and ministerial on the part of the judge</b>.<br><br><b>The CA correctly ruled that the Lapulapu Judgment is binding upon petitioner [LLDHC] which, by its own motion, participated as an intervenor</b>. In fact, the latter <b>filed an Answer in Intervention</b> and thereafter <b>actively took part in the trial</b>. Thus, having had an opportunity to be heard and to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling it complained of, it cannot claim that it was denied due process of law. What the law prohibits is the absolute absence of the opportunity to be heard. Jurisprudence teaches that a party cannot feign denial of due process if it has been afforded the opportunity to present its side.<br><br><b>Petitioner likewise claims that Private Respondent GMC cannot escape the adverse effects of the final and executory judgment of the Manila RTC</b>.<br><br><b>Again, we do not agree</b>. A trial court has no power to stop an act that has been authorized by another trial court of equal rank. <b>As correctly stated by the CA, the Decision rendered by the Manila RTC -- while final and executory -- cannot bind herein private respondent [GMC], which was not a party to the case before the said RTC. A personal judgment is binding only upon the parties, their agents, representatives and successors in interest</b>.<br><br><i>Third</i>, <b>petitioner grievously errs in insisting that the judgment of the Manila RTC nullified that of the Lapulapu RTC. As already adverted to earlier, courts of coequal and coordinate jurisdiction may not interfere with or pass upon each other's orders or processes, since they have the same power and jurisdiction</b>. Except in extreme situations authorized by law, they are proscribed from doing so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>It likewise does not escape the attention of this Court that the only reason the Manila RTC Decision was implemented ahead of the Lapu Lapu RTC Decision was that LLDHC successfully secured a TRO from the Court of Appeals through its petition for <i>certiorari</i> docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 44052, which was eventually dismissed by the appellate court.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals ruled that the Manila RTC Decision did not constitute a supervening event that would forestall the execution of the Lapu Lapu RTC Decision.&nbsp; This decision of the Court of Appeals likewise became final and executory in 1998.<br><br>It bears repeating that the issue of whether or not the Manila RTC Decision could nullify or render unenforceable the Lapu Lapu RTC Decision has been litigated many times over in different fora.&nbsp; It would be the height of inequity if the Court were to now reverse the Court of Appeals' and its own final and executory rulings and allow GSIS to prevent the execution of the Lapu Lapu RTC Decision on the same legal grounds previously discredited by the courts.<br><br><center><b><i>Second Issue:</i></b><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Res Judicata</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></center><br>GMC asserts that the September 23, 2005 Decision of the Special Nineteenth Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Yu</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> this Court expounded on the concept of <i>res judicata</i> and explained it in this wise:<br><br><blockquote><i>Res judicata</i> literally means "a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment."<sup>&nbsp; </sup><i>Res judicata</i> lays the rule that an existing final judgment or decree rendered on the merits, and without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon any matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all other actions or suits in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction on the points and matters in issue in the first suit. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Villanueva v.

However, not all of them agree that the matters involved in this case have already been judicially settled. While GMC contends that GSIS's petition is barred by <i>res judicata</i>, both GSIS and LLDHC assert that this Court has not yet decided any similar petition, thus disputing the claim of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br><i>Res judicata</i> has two concepts: (1) "bar by prior judgment" as enunciated in Rule 39, Section 47(b) of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure; and (2) "conclusiveness of judgment" in Rule 39, Section 47(c), which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(b)&nbsp; In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and<br><br>(c)&nbsp; In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto.</blockquote><br>In explaining the two concepts of <i>res judicata</i>, this Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>There is "bar by prior judgment" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered, and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.&nbsp; But where there is identity of parties and subject matter in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is "conclusiveness of judgment."&nbsp; Under the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, facts and issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot again be raised in any future case between the same parties, even if the latter suit may involve a different claim or cause of action.&nbsp; The identity of causes of action is not required but merely identity of issues. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Peñalosa v. Tuason</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> we laid down the test in determining whether or not the causes of action in the first and second cases are identical:<br><br><blockquote>Would the same evidence support and establish both the present and former cause of action?&nbsp; If so, the former recovery is a bar; if otherwise, it does not stand in the way of the former action. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup></blockquote><br><i>Res judicata</i> clearly exists in G.R. No. 167000 and in CA-G.R. SP No. 84382 because both GSIS's and LLDHC's actions put in issue the validity of the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision and were based on the assumption that it has either been modified, altered or nullified by the Manila RTC Decision.<br><br>In CA-G.R. SP No. 84382, LLDHC sought to annul the assailed Orders of the Lapu-Lapu RTC and to order the judge therein to desist from further proceeding in Civil Case No. 2203-L. LLDHC sought for the same reliefs in its Petition for Annulment of Judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 34696 and G.R. No. 118633, in its Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 44052, and in its Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>in G.R. No. 141407, all of which have been decided with finality.<br><br>In G.R. No. 167000, GSIS is praying for the reversal of the November 25, 2004 Decision and January 20, 2005 Resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 85096, wherein the Court of Appeals affirmed the assailed Orders.&nbsp; The validity of these assailed Orders hinges on the validity of the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision, which issue had already been decided with finality by both the Court of Appeals and this Court.<br><br>Notwithstanding the difference in the forms of actions GSIS and LLDHC filed, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> still applies considering that the parties were litigating the same thing, <i>i.e.</i>, the 78 lots in Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City, and more importantly, the same contentions and evidence were used in all causes of action.&nbsp; As this Court held in <i>Mendiola v. Court of Appeals</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>The test of identity of causes of action lies not in the form of an action but on whether the same evidence would support and establish the former and the present causes of action.&nbsp; The difference of actions in the aforesaid cases is of no moment. x x x. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup></blockquote><br>The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> makes a final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies and amounts to an absolute bar to subsequent actions involving the same claim, demand, or cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>&nbsp; Even a finding of conclusiveness of judgment operates as estoppel with respect to matters in issue or points controverted, on the determination of which the finding or judgment was anchored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>Evidently, this Court could dispose of this case simply upon the application of the principle of <i>res judicata</i>.&nbsp; It is clear that GSIS's petition in G.R. No. 167000 and LLDHC's petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 84382 should have never reached those stages for having been barred by a final and executory judgment on their claims.&nbsp; However, considering the nature of the case before us, this Court is compelled to make a final determination of the issues in the interest of substantial justice and to end the wasteful use of our courts' time and resources.<br><br><center><b><i>Third Issue:</i></b><br><b><i>GSIS's Compliance with the </i></b><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Lapu-Lapu RTC Judgment and Orders</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></center><br>GSIS asserts that the assailed Orders cannot be enforced upon it given the physical and legal impossibility for it to comply as the titles over the subject properties were transferred to LLDHC under the Manila RTC writ of execution.<br><br>A closer perusal of the March 11, 2004 and May 7, 2004 Orders shows that GSIS's argument holds no water.&nbsp; The May 7, 2004 Order denied GSIS's and LLDHC's motions for reconsideration of the March 11, 2004 Order.&nbsp; The March 11, 2004 Order resolved GMC's urgent manifestation and motion to proceed with the implementation of the February 24, 1992 final and executory decision and GSIS's and LLDHC's opposition thereto, as well as GSIS's motion to stay the issuance of a writ of execution against it.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Order reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, plaintiff Group Management Corporation's motion is GRANTED, while defendant GSIS' motion to stay the issuance of a writ of execution is denied for lack of merit.&nbsp; Consequently, <b>the Sheriff of this Court is directed to proceed with the immediate implementation of this Court's decision dated February 24, 1992</b>, by enforcing completely this Court's Order of Execution dated November 28, 1996, the writ of execution dated December 17, 1996, the Order dated July 21, 1997, the Order dated October 23, 1997, the Order dated November 28, 1997 and the Order dated December 22, 1997. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>While the previous orders and writs of execution issued by the Lapu-Lapu RTC required the GSIS to execute the final deed of sale and to deliver the subject properties, the Lapu-Lapu RTC, in its subsequent Orders, modified this by directing its order to the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City.&nbsp; In its July 21, 1997 Order, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> the Lapu-Lapu RTC, seeing GSIS's obstinate refusal to implement the court's previous orders, directed the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City to cancel the Transfer Certificates of Title of the subject properties and to issue new ones in the name of GMC, and to deliver the same to GMC.&nbsp; Moreover, in its October 23, 1997 Order, the Lapu-Lapu RTC, noting the implemented judgment of the Manila RTC, declared the issuance of new titles to LLDHC null and void for being contrary to the court's February 24, 1992 decision and directed the Register of Deeds to effect the transfer of the titles to GMC.<br><br>Considering that the assailed Orders merely directed the Lapu-Lapu RTC's Sheriff to proceed with the implementation of the court's previous orders, that is, to make sure that the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City complied with the orders, GSIS had nothing to comply with insofar as the titles to, and possession of, the subject properties were concerned, the Orders being clearly directed towards the Sheriff of the Lapu-Lapu RTC and the Register of Deeds of Lapu-Lapu City.&nbsp; Hence, GSIS's argument of legal and physical impossibility of compliance with the assailed Orders is baseless.<br><br>GSIS also argues that it cannot be the "subject [of any] execution including [the] payment of any damage and other monetary judgments because all GSIS funds and properties are absolutely and expressly exempt from execution and other legal processes under Section 39 of Republic Act No. 8291." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Section 39 of Republic Act No. 8291 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>SECTION 39. Exemption from Tax, Legal Process and Lien.</b> --It is hereby declared to be the policy of the State that the actuarial solvency of the funds of the GSIS shall be preserved and maintained at all times and that contribution rates necessary to sustain the benefits under this Act shall be kept as low as possible in order not to burden the members of the GSIS and their employers. Taxes imposed on the GSIS tend to impair the actuarial solvency of its funds and increase the contribution rate necessary to sustain the benefits of this Act. Accordingly, notwithstanding any laws to the contrary, the GSIS, its assets, revenues including all accruals thereto, and benefits paid, shall be exempt from all taxes, assessments, fees, charges or duties of all kinds. These exemptions shall continue unless expressly and specifically revoked and any assessment against the GSIS as of the approval of this Act are hereby considered paid. Consequently, all laws, ordinances, regulations, issuances, opinions or jurisprudence contrary to or in derogation of this provision are hereby deemed repealed, superseded and rendered ineffective and without legal force and effect.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The funds and/or the properties referred to herein as well as the benefits, sums or monies corresponding to the benefits under this Act shall be exempt from attachment, garnishment, execution, levy or other processes issued by the courts, quasi judicial agencies or administrative bodies including Commission on Audit (COA) disallowances and from all financial obligations of the members, including his pecuniary accountability arising from or caused or occasioned by his exercise or performance of his official functions or duties, or incurred relative to or in connection with his position or work except when his monetary liability, contractual or otherwise, is in favor of the GSIS.</blockquote><br>This Court, in <i>Rubia v. Government Service Insurance System</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> held that the exemption of GSIS is not absolute and does not encompass all of its funds, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>In so far as Section 39 of the GSIS charter exempts the GSIS from execution, suffice it to say that such exemption is not absolute and does not encompass all the GSIS funds. By way of illustration and as may be gleaned from the Implementing Rules and Regulation of the GSIS Act of 1997, one exemption refers to social security benefits and other benefits of GSIS <i>members</i> under Republic Act No. 8291 in connection with financial obligations of the members to other parties. The pertinent GSIS Rule provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Rule XV. Funds of the GSIS</b><br><br>Section 15.7 <b><i>Exemption of Benefits of Members from Tax, Attachment, Execution, Levy or other Legal Processes.</i></b> - The social security benefits and other benefits of GSIS members under R.A. 8291 shall be exempt from tax, attachment, garnishment, execution, levy or other processes issued by the courts, quasi-judicial agencies or administrative bodies <b>in connection with all financial obligations of the member,</b> including his pecuniary accountability arising from or caused or occasioned by his exercise or performance of his official functions or duties or incurred in connection with his position or work, as well as COA disallowances. Monetary liability in favor of the GSIS, however, may be deducted from the benefits of the member.&nbsp; [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>The processual exemption of the GSIS funds and properties under Section 39 of the GSIS Charter, in our view, should be read consistently with its avowed principal purpose: to maintain actuarial solvency of the GSIS in the protection of assets which are to be used to finance the retirement, disability and life insurance benefits of its members. Clearly, the exemption should be limited to the purposes and objects covered. Any interpretation that would give it an expansive construction to exempt all GSIS assets from legal processes absolutely would be unwarranted.<br><br>Furthermore, the declared policy of the State in Section 39 of the GSIS Charter granting GSIS an exemption from tax, lien, attachment, levy, execution, and other legal processes should be read together with the grant of power to the GSIS to invest its "excess funds" under Section 36 of the same Act.&nbsp; Under Section 36, the GSIS is granted the ancillary power to invest in business and other ventures for the benefit of the employees, by using its excess funds for investment purposes. In the exercise of such function and power, the GSIS is allowed to assume a character similar to a private corporation.&nbsp; Thus, it may sue and be sued, as also, explicitly granted by its charter. Needless to say, where proper, under Section 36, the GSIS may be held liable for the contracts it has entered into in the course of its business investments.&nbsp; For GSIS cannot claim a special immunity from liability in regard to its business ventures under said Section.&nbsp; Nor can it deny contracting parties, in our view, the right of redress and the enforcement of a claim, particularly as it arises from a purely contractual relationship, of a private character between an individual and the GSIS. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup></blockquote><br>This ruling has been reiterated in the more recent case of <i>Government Service Insurance System v. Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 71</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> wherein GSIS, which was also the petitioner in that case, asked to reverse this Court's findings in <i>Rubia</i> and grant GSIS absolute immunity.&nbsp; This Court rejected that plea and held that GSIS should not be allowed to hide behind such immunity especially since its obligation arose from its own wrongful action in a business transaction.<br><br>In this case, the monetary judgments against GSIS arose from its failure to comply with its private and contractual obligation to GMC.&nbsp; As such, GSIS cannot claim immunity from the enforcement of the final and executory judgment against it. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Fourth Issue:</i></b><br><b><i>Forum Shopping</i></b><br></center><br>On the issue of forum shopping, this Court already found LLDHC guilty of forum shopping and was adjudged to pay treble costs way back in 2002 in G.R.

Hence, he was found guilty of forum shopping.<br><br>In the present case, after the Lapulapu RTC had rendered its Decision in favor of private respondent, petitioner filed several petitions before this Court and the CA essentially seeking the annulment thereof.&nbsp; True, petitioner had filed its Complaint in the Manila RTC before private respondent filed its own suit in the Lapulapu RTC. Records, however, show that private respondent learned of the Manila case only when petitioner filed its Motion for Intervention in the Lapulapu RTC.&nbsp; When GMC filed its own Motion to Intervene in the Manila RTC, it was promptly rebuffed by the judge therein.&nbsp; On the other hand, petitioner was able to present its side and to participate fully in the proceedings before the Lapulapu RTC.<br><br>On July 27, 1994, almost two years after the dismissal of its appeal by the Lapulapu RTC, petitioner filed in the CA a suit for the annulment of that RTC judgment.&nbsp; On December 29, 1994, this suit was rejected by the CA in a Decision which became final and executory on January 28, 1995, after no appeal was taken by petitioner. However, this action did not stop petitioner.&nbsp; On February 2, 1995, it filed with this Court another Petition deceptively cloaked as <i>certiorari</i>, but which in reality sought the annulment of the Lapulapu Decision. This Court dismissed the Petition on September 6, 1996.&nbsp; Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality on November 18, 1996.<br><br>On November 28, 1996, Judge Risos of the Lapulapu RTC directed the execution of the judgment in the case filed before it.&nbsp; The Motion to Stay Execution filed by petitioner was denied on February 19, 1997.&nbsp; Undaunted, it filed in this Court another Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and Mandamus.&nbsp; On September 21, 1998, we referred the Petition to the CA for appropriate action. This new Petition again essentially sought to annul the final and executory Decision rendered by the Lapulapu RTC. Needless to say, the new suit was unsuccessful.&nbsp; Still, this rejection did not stop petitioner.&nbsp; It brought before this Court the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> alleging the same facts and circumstances and raising the same issues already decided by this Court in G.R. No. 118633.<br><br><i>First Philippine International Bank v. CA</i> stresses that what is truly important to consider in determining whether forum shopping exists is the vexation caused the courts and the parties-litigants by one who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related facts and causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same relief, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting rulings and decisions.<br><br>Petitioner in the present case sued twice before the CA and thrice before this Court, alleging substantially the same facts and circumstances, raising essentially the same issues, and praying for almost identical reliefs for the annulment of the Decision rendered by the Lapulapu RTC.&nbsp; This insidious practice of repeatedly bringing essentially the same action -- albeit disguised in various nomenclatures -- before different courts at different times is forum shopping no less.&nbsp; Because of petitioner's actions, the execution of the Lapulapu Decision has been needlessly delayed and several courts vexed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></blockquote><br>There is forum shopping when two or more actions or proceedings, other than appeal or <i>certiorari</i>, involving the same parties for the same cause of action, are instituted either simultaneously or successively to obtain a more favorable decision. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup>&nbsp; This Court, in <i>Spouses De la Cruz v.

It is the duty of this Court to put an end to this long-delayed litigation and render a decision, which will bind all parties with finality.<br><br>Although it is settled that the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision was not in any way nullified by the Manila RTC Decision, it is this Court's duty to resolve the legal implications of having two conflicting, final, and executory decisions in existence.&nbsp; In <i>Collantes v. Court of Appeals</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> this Court, faced with the similar issue of having two conflicting, final and executory decisions before it, offered three options to solve the dilemma: "the first is for the parties to assert their claims anew, the second is to determine which judgment came first, and the third is to determine which of the judgments had been rendered by a court of last resort." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>In <i>Collantes</i>, this Court applied the first option and resolved the conflicting issues anew.&nbsp; However, resorting to the first solution in the case at bar would entail disregarding not only the final and executory decisions of the Lapu-Lapu RTC and the Manila RTC, but also the final and executory decisions of the Court of Appeals and this Court.&nbsp; Moreover, it would negate two decades' worth of litigating.&nbsp; Thus, we find it more equitable and practicable to apply the second and third options consequently maintaining the finality of one of the conflicting judgments.&nbsp; The primary criterion under the second option is the time when the decision was rendered and became final and executory, such that earlier decisions should prevail over the current ones since final and executory decisions vest rights in the winning party.&nbsp; In the third solution, the main criterion is the determination of which court or tribunal rendered the decision.&nbsp; Decisions of this Court should be accorded more respect than those made by the lower courts. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>Applying these criteria to the case at bar, the February 24, 1992 Decision of the Lapu-Lapu RTC in Civil Case No. 2203-L was not only promulgated first; it also attained finality on January 28, 1995, before the Manila RTC's May 10, 1994 Decision in Civil Case No. R-82-3429 became final on May 30, 1997.&nbsp; It is especially noteworthy that months after the Lapu-Lapu RTC issued its writ of execution on December 17, 1996, the Manila RTC issued its own writ of execution on August 1, 1997.&nbsp; To recall, the Manila RTC writ was only satisfied first because the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 44052 deemed it appropriate to issue a temporary restraining order against the execution of the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision, pending the case before it.&nbsp; Hence, the fact that the Manila RTC Decision was implemented and executed first does not negate the fact that the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision was not only rendered earlier, but had also attained finality earlier.&nbsp; Furthermore, while both judgments reached the Court of Appeals, only Civil Case No. 2203-L was passed upon on the merits by this Court.&nbsp; In G.R. No. 141407, this Court resolved LLDHC's petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>seeking to annul the Court of Appeals' Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 50650.&nbsp; This Court, in dismissing the petition, upheld the validity of the Lapu-Lapu RTC Decision and declared that the Manila RTC Decision cannot bind GMC.
