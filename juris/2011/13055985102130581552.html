				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The identification of the accused as the person responsible for the imputed crime is the primary duty of the State in every criminal prosecution. Such identification, to be positive, need not always be by direct evidence from an eyewitness, for reliable circumstantial evidence can equally confirm it as to overcome the constitutionally presumed innocence of the accused.<br><br>On appeal by the accused is the decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) promulgated on June 6, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> finding Gilberto Villarico, Sr., Gilberto Villarico, Jr., Jerry Ramentos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and Ricky Villarico guilty of murder for the killing of Haide Cagatan, and imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>on each of them, thereby modifying the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 16, in Tangub City that had pronounced them guilty of homicide aggravated by dwelling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>With treachery having attended the killing, we affirm the CA but correct the civil liability to accord with pertinent law and jurisprudence.<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>On October 7, 1999, an information for murder was filed in the Regional Trial Court in Misamis Occidental (RTC) against all the accused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about August 8, 1999, at about 7:50 o'clock in the morning at Barangay Bolinsong, Municipality of Bonifacio, Province of Misamis Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, with intent to kill, armed with a short firearms (sic), did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously suddenly and treacherously shoot HAIDE CAGATAN at the back penetrating through the neck which cause(d) the instant death of said victim and that he had no chance to avoid or defend himself from the attack.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote><br>All the accused pleaded <i>not guilty</i> at their December 15, 1999 arraignment.<br><br><center><b>Version of the Prosecution</b><br></center><br>At around 7:50 p.m. on August 8, 1999, Haide was busy preparing dinner in the kitchen of his family's residence in Bolinsong, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental. The kitchen, located at the rear of the residence, had a wall whose upper portion was made of three-feet high bamboo slats (<i>sa-sa</i>) and whose lower portion was also made of bamboo slats arranged like a chessboard with four-inch gaps in between. At that time, Haide's sister-in-law Remedios Cagatan was attending to her child who was answering the call of nature near the toilet. From where she was, Remedios saw all the accused as they stood at the rear of the kitchen aiming their firearms at the door - Ricky Villarico was at the left side, and Gilberto, Jr. stood behind him, while Gilberto, Sr. was at the right side, with Ramentos behind him. When Gilberto, Jr. noticed Remedios, he pointed his gun at her, prompting Remedios to drop to the ground and to shout to Lolita Cagatan, her mother-in-law and Haide's mother: <i>Nay, Nay tawo Nay </i>(Mother, mother, there are people outside, mother). At that instant, Remedios heard three gunshots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Francisco Cagatan, the father of Haide, also heard the gunshots just as he was coming out of the toilet, making him instinctively jump into a hole, from where he was able to see and recognize Gilberto, Sr., Gilberto, Jr. and Ricky who were then standing by the kitchen door. They were aiming their guns upward, and soon after left together with Ramentos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Lolita also heard the gunshots while she was in the <i>sala.</i> She recalled that Haide then came towards her from the kitchen, asking for help and saying: <i>Tabang kay gipusil ko ni Berting </i>(I was shot by Berting)<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; At that, she&nbsp; and Remedios brought the wounded Haide to Clinica Ozarraga, where he was treated for gunshot wounds on his left scapular region (back of left shoulder) and right elbow. He succumbed shortly thereafter due to hypovolemic shock or massive loss of blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b><br></center><br>The accused denied the accusations and each proffered an alibi.<br><br>Gilberto, Sr. claimed that he was sleeping in his home with a fever when he heard a gunshot. He insisted that he learned that Haide had been shot only in the next morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> His denial and alibi were corroborated by his wife Carmelita<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and his daughter Jersel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Gilberto, Jr. testified that on the day of the incident, he went to Liloan, Bonifacio, Misamis Occidental at around 5:00 p.m. to visit his girlfriend together with Charlie Bacus and Randy Hernan. They stayed there until 9:00 p.m. Thereafter, they proceeded to Tiaman to attend the wake for one Helen Oligario Cuizon, and were there for an hour. They then returned to Bolinsong and spent the night in the house of Randy. It was only in the morning that Randy's father informed them that Haide had been shot. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Ricky declared that he stayed throughout the whole evening of August 8, 1999 in the house of his aunt Flordeliza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Myrna Hernan, a neighbor of Flordeliza, corroborated his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Ramentos alleged that he was drinking <i>tuba</i> with others at the store owned by Cinderella Bacus at the time of the shooting; and that he went home at around 9:00 p.m. after his group was done drinking. He did not recall hearing any gunshots while drinking and came to know of the shooting only from a certain Anecito Duyag on the following morning.<br><br>To discredit the testimony about Haide being able to identify his assailants, the Defense presented Peter Ponggos, who narrated that he had been on board a motorcycle (<i>habal-habal</i>) when Lolita and Remedios asked for his help; and that he then aided Lolita and Remedios in bringing Haide to the hospital. According to Peter, he asked Haide who had shot him, but Haide replied that there had been only one assailant whom he did not recognize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b><br></center><br>After trial, the RTC convicted the four accused of homicide aggravated by dwelling, disposing:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide, with one aggravating circumstance of dwelling, and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, hereby sentences each one of them to a penalty of imprisonment ranging from 6 years and 1 day, as its minimum to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day, as its maximum, to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by law, to pay jointly and solidarily, the heirs of the victim P50,000.00, as civil liability and to pay the costs.<br><br>Let all the accused be credited of the time that they were placed in jail under preventive imprisonment, applying the provisions of Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>The RTC accorded faith to the positive identification of the accused by the Prosecution's witnesses, and disbelieved their denial and alibis due to their failure to show the physical improbability for them to be at the crime scene, for the distances between the crime scene and the places where the accused allegedly were at the time of the commission of the crime were shown to range from only 100 to 700 meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The RTC found, however, that the Prosecution was not able to prove treachery because:<br><br><blockquote>xxx The medical report of "gunshot wound left scapular region" which the doctor interpreted to be at the back of the left shoulder is not sufficient to prove treachery, it being susceptible to 2 different interpretations: one: that victim had his back towards his assailants, and two: that he was actually facing them but he turned around for cover upon seeing the armed "group of Berting". The Court is inclined to believe the second interpretation because the victim was able to see and identify his assailants. Two prosecution witnesses testified that the victim identified to them who shot him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>On intermediate review, the CA modified the RTC's decision, holding instead that murder was established beyond reasonable doubt because the killing was attended by treachery, <i>viz</i>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby MODIFIED. Pursuant to Section 13, paragraph 2 of Rule 124 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, We render JUDGMENT without entering it, as follows:<br><br><ol><li> We find all accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of MURDER. Each accused is hereby SENTENCED TO SUFFER the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br></li><li>The Division Clerk of Court is hereby directed to CERTIFY and ELEVATE the entire records of this case to the Supreme Court for review.</li></ol><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Citing <i>People v. Valdez,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the CA explained that the attendance of treachery did not depend on the position of the victim at the time of the attack, for the essence of treachery was in the element of surprise the assailants purposely adopted to ensure that the victim would not be able to defend himself. Considering that the accused had purposely positioned themselves at night outside the door to the kitchen from where they could see Haide, who was then busy preparing dinner, through the holes of the kitchen wall, the CA concluded that Haide was thus left unaware of the impending assault against him.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>In this recourse, the accused raise the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF MURDER DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THE IDENTITY OF THE ASSAILANT AS WELL AS ACCUSED-APPELLANTS' GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN CONSIDERING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT INDEED ACCUSED-APPELLANTS ARE GUILTY.</blockquote><br>The accused contend that the Prosecution witnesses failed to positively identify them as the persons who had actually shot Haide; that treachery was not attendant because there was no proof showing that they had consciously and deliberately adopted the mode of attacking the victim; and that assuming that they committed the killing, they could only be convicted of homicide.<br><br>The decisive queries are, therefore, the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(<i>a</i>) Should an identification, to be positive, have to be made by a witness who actually saw the assailants?<br><br>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Was treachery attendant in the killing of Haide as to qualify the crime as murder?<br></div><br><center><b>Ruling</b><br></center><br>We affirm the finding of guilt for the crime of murder, but modify the civil liability.<br><br><center><b>1.</b><br><b>Positive identification refers to </b><br><b>proof of identity of the assailant</b><br></center><br>The first duty of the prosecution is not to prove the crime but to prove the identity of the criminal, for, even if the commission of the crime can be established, there can be no conviction without proof of the identity of the criminal beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In that regard, an identification that does not preclude a reasonable possibility of mistake cannot be accorded any evidentiary force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The intervention of any mistake or the appearance of any weakness in the identification simply means that the accused's constitutional right of presumption of innocence until the contrary is proved is not overcome, thereby warranting an acquittal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> even if doubt may cloud his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Indeed, the presumption of innocence constitutionally guaranteed to every individual is forever of primary importance, and every conviction for crime must rest on the strength of the evidence of the State, not on the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The accused contend that the Prosecution witnesses did not actually see who had shot Haide; hence, their identification as the malefactors was not positively and credibly made.<br><br>We cannot uphold the contention of the accused.<br><br>The established circumstances unerringly show that the four accused were the perpetrators of the fatal shooting of Haide. Their identification as his assailants by Remedios and Francisco was definitely positive and beyond reasonable doubt. Specifically, Remedios saw all the four accused near the door to the kitchen immediately <i>before</i> the shots were fired and recognized who they were. She even supplied the detail that Gilberto, Jr. had trained his firearm towards her once he had noticed her presence at the crime scene. On his part, Francisco attested to seeing the accused near the door to the kitchen holding their firearms <i>right after</i> he heard the gunshots, and also recognized them.<br><br>The collective recollections of both Remedios and Francisco about seeing the four accused standing near the door to the kitchen immediately <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> the shooting of Haide inside the kitchen were categorical enough, and warranted no other logical inference than that the four accused were the persons who had just shot Haide. Indeed, neither Remedios nor Francisco needed to have actually seen who of the accused had fired at Haide, for it was enough that they testified that the four armed accused: (<i>a</i>) had strategically positioned themselves by the kitchen door <i>prior to</i> the shooting of Haide; (<i>b</i>) had still been in the same positions <i>after</i> the gunshots were fired; and (<i>c</i>) had continuously aimed their firearms at the kitchen door even as they were leaving the crime scene.<br><br>The close relationship of Remedios and Francisco with the victim as well as their familiarity with the accused who were their neighbors assured the certainty of their identification as Haide's assailants. In <i>Marturillas v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court observed that the familiarity of the witness with the assailant erased any doubt that the witness could have erred; and noted that a witness related to the victim had a natural tendency to remember the faces of the person involved in the attack on the victim, because relatives, more than anybody else, would be concerned with seeking justice for the victim and bringing the malefactor before the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the following portions of Lolita's testimony show that Haide himself recognized and identified his assailants, to wit:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="CENTER"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Atty.

The statement was admissible against the accused as an exception to the hearsay rule under Section 42, Rule 130 of the <i>Rules of Court,</i> which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 42. <i>Part of the res gestae</i>. - Statements made by a person while a startling occurrence is taking place or immediately prior or subsequent thereto with respect to the circumstances thereof, may be given in evidence as part of the <i>res</i> <i>gestae</i>. So, also, statements accompanying an equivocal act material to the issue, and giving it a legal significance, may be received as part of the <i>res gestae.</i> (36 a)</blockquote><br>The term <i>res gestae</i> refers to "those circumstances which are the undesigned incidents of a particular litigated act and which are admissible when illustrative of such act."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In a general way, <i>res gestae</i> includes the circumstances, facts, and declarations that grow out of the main fact and serve to illustrate its character and which are so spontaneous and contemporaneous with the main fact as to exclude the idea of deliberation and fabrication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The rule on <i>res</i><i> gestae</i> encompasses the exclamations and statements made by either the participants, <i>victims</i>, or spectators to a crime immediately <i>before</i>, <i>during</i>, or <i>immediately</i> after the commission of the crime when the circumstances are such that the statements were made as a <i>spontaneous</i> reaction or utterance inspired by the excitement of the occasion and there was no opportunity for the declarant to deliberate and to fabricate a false statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The test of admissibility of evidence as a part of the <i>res gestae</i> is whether the act, declaration, or exclamation is so intimately interwoven or connected with the principal fact or event that it characterizes as to be regarded a part of the principal fact or event itself, and also whether it clearly negatives any premeditation or purpose to manufacture testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> A declaration or an utterance is thus deemed as part of the <i>res gestae</i> that is admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule when the following requisites concur: (<i>a</i>) the principal act, the <i>res gestae</i>, is a startling occurrence; (<i>b</i>) the statements were made before the declarant had time to contrive or devise; and (<i>c</i>) the statements must concern the occurrence in question and its immediately attending circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>We find that the requisites concurred herein. Firstly, the principal act - the shooting of Haide - was a startling occurrence. Secondly, his statement to his mother about being shot by the group of Berting was made<i> before</i> Haide had time to contrive or to devise considering that it was uttered <i>immediately after</i> the shooting. And, thirdly, the statement directly concerned the startling occurrence itself and its attending circumstance (that is, the identities of the assailants). Verily, the statement was reliable as part of the <i>res gestae</i> for being uttered <i>in spontaneity and only in reaction to the startling occurrence</i>.<br><br>In the face of the positive identification of all the four accused, it did not matter whether only one or two of them had <i>actually</i> fired the fatal shots. Their actions indicated that a conspiracy existed among them. Indeed, a conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Direct proof of a previous agreement among the accused to commit the crime is not necessary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> for conspiracy may be inferred from the conduct of the accused at the time of their commission of the crime that evinces a common understanding among them on perpetrating the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, the concerted acts of the four manifested their agreement to kill Haide, resulting in each of them being guilty of the crime regardless of whether he actually fired at the victim or not. It is axiomatic that once conspiracy is established, the act of one is the act of all;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and that all the conspirators are then liable as co-principals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>But did not the fact that the name Berting <i>without any surname</i> being too generic open the identification of the accused as the assailants to disquieting doubt about their complicity?<br><br>We hold that there was no need for a surname to be attached to the nickname Berting in order to insulate the identification by Haide from challenge. The victim's <i>res gestae</i> statement was only one of the competent and reliable pieces of identification evidence. As already shown, the accused were competently incriminated also by Remedios and Francisco in a manner that warranted the logical inference that they, <i>and no others</i>, were the assailants. Also, that Berting was the natural nickname for a person whose given name was Gilberto, like herein accused Gilberto, Sr. and Gilberto, Jr., was a matter of common knowledge in the Philippines. In fine, the pieces of identification evidence, including Haide's <i>res gestae</i> statement, collaborated to render their identification unassailable.<br><br>Relevantly, the Court has distinguished two types of positive identification in<i> People v. Gallarde,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> namely: (<i>a</i>) that by direct evidence, through an eyewitness to the very commission of the act; and (<i>b</i>) that by circumstantial evidence, such as where the accused is last seen with the victim immediately before or after the crime. The Court said:<br><br><blockquote> xxx<b> Positive identification pertains essentially to proof of identity and not <i>per se</i> to that of being an eyewitness to the very act of commission of the crime</b>. There are two types of positive identification. A witness may identify a suspect or accused in a criminal case as the perpetrator of the crime as an eyewitness to the very act of the commission of the crime. This constitutes direct evidence. There may, however, be instances where, <b>although a witness may not have actually seen the very act of commission of a crime, he may still be able to positively identify a suspect or accused as the perpetrator of a crime as for instance when the latter is the person or one of the persons last seen with the victim immediately before and right after the commission of the crime.</b> This is the second type of positive identification, which forms part of circumstantial evidence, which, when taken together with other pieces of evidence constituting an unbroken chain, leads to only fair and reasonable conclusion, which is that the accused is the author of the crime to the exclusion of all others. If the actual eyewitnesses are the only ones allowed to possibly positively identify a suspect or accused to the exclusion of others, then nobody can ever be convicted unless there is an eyewitness, because it is basic and elementary that there can be no conviction until and unless an accused is positively identified. Such a proposition is absolutely absurd, because it is settled that direct evidence of the commission of a crime is not the only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its conclusion and finding of guilt. If resort to circumstantial evidence would not be allowed to prove identity of the accused on the absence of direct evidence, then felons would go free and the community would be denied proper protection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><br>To conclude, the identification of a malefactor, to be positive and sufficient for conviction, does not always require direct evidence from an eyewitness; otherwise, no conviction will be possible in crimes where there are no eyewitnesses. Indeed, trustworthy circumstantial evidence can equally confirm the identification and overcome the constitutionally presumed innocence of the accused.<br><br>Faced with their positive identification, the four accused had to establish convincing defenses. They opted to rely on denial and their respective alibis, however, but both the RTC and the CA rightly rejected such defenses.<br><br>The rejection was warranted. Long judicial experience instructs that their denial and alibis, being too easy to invent, could not overcome their positive identification by credible Prosecution witnesses whose motives for the identification were not shown to be ill or vile. Truly, a positive identification that is categorical, consistent, and devoid of any showing of ill or vile motive on the part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Prosecution witnesses always prevails over alibi and denial that are in the nature of negative and self-serving evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> To be accepted, the denial and alibi must be substantiated by clear and convincing evidence establishing not only that the accused did not take part in the commission of the imputed criminal act but also that it was physically impossible for the accused to be at or near the place of the commission of the act at or about the time of its commission.&nbsp; In addition, their proffered alibis were really unworthy of credit because only the accused themselves and their relatives and other intimates substantiated them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>2.</b><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The essence of treachery is in the mode of attack,</b><br><b>not in the relative position of the victim and the assailant</b></div></blockquote><br>The RTC ruled out the attendance of treachery due to its persuasion that the victim must have been facing his assailants at the time of the assault and was thus not taken by surprise. The CA differed from the RTC, however, and stressed that regardless of the position of the victim, the essence of treachery was the element of surprise that the assailants purposely adopted to ensure that the victim was not able to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>We uphold the ruling of the CA.<br><br>There is treachery when: (<i>a</i>) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (<i>b</i>) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The essence of treachery lies in the suddenness of the attack that leaves the victim unable to defend himself, thereby ensuring the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It is the suddenness of the attack coupled with the inability of the victim to defend himself or to retaliate that brings about treachery; consequently, treachery may still be appreciated even if the victim was facing the assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Here, the elements of treachery were present.

The prosecution was likewise able to prove treachery through the element of surprise rendering the victim unable to defend himself. In this case, the evidence shows that the victim, who was in the kitchen preparing dinner, could be seen from the outside through the holes of the wall. The witnesses consistently described the kitchen's wall as three feet high bamboo splits (sa-sa), accented with bamboo splits woven to look like a chessboard with 4-inch holes in between. The accused-appellants, likewise, positioned themselves outside the kitchen door at night where the victim could not see them.

Thereby, the CA committed a plainly reversible error for ignoring existing laws, like Article 2206 of the <i>Civil Code</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> which prescribes a death indemnity separately from moral damages, and Article 2230 of the <i>Civil Code</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> which requires exemplary damages in case of death due to crime when there is at least one aggravating circumstance; and applicable jurisprudence, specifically, <i>People v.

Nonetheless, a rectification should now be made, for, indeed, gross omissions, intended or not, should be eschewed. It is timely, therefore, to remind and to exhort all the trial and appellate courts to be always mindful of and to apply the pertinent laws and jurisprudence on the kinds and amounts of indemnities and damages appropriate in criminal cases lest oversight and omission will unduly add to the sufferings of the victims or their heirs. Nor should the absence of specific assignment of error thereon inhibit the <i>sua sponte</i> rectification of the omissions, for the grant of <i>all</i> the proper kinds and amounts of civil liability to the victim or his heirs is a matter of law and judicial policy not dependent upon or controlled by an assignment of error.

The increase of the penalty or a shift to a graver felony underscores the exacerbation of the offense by the attendance of aggravating circumstances, whether ordinary or qualifying, in its commission.&nbsp; Unlike the criminal liability which is basically a State concern, the award of damages, however, is likewise, if not primarily, intended for the offended party who suffers thereby.&nbsp; It would make little sense for an award of exemplary damages to be due the private offended party when the aggravating circumstance is ordinary but to be withheld when it is qualifying.</b> <b>Withal, the ordinary or qualifying nature of an aggravating circumstance is a distinction that should only be of consequence to the criminal, rather than to the civil, liability of the offender.&nbsp; </b>In fine, relative to the civil aspect of the case, an aggravating circumstance, whether ordinary or qualifying, should entitle the offended party to an award of exemplary damages within the unbridled meaning of Article 2230 of the <i>Civil Code</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Bersamin, <i>Appeal and Review in the Philippines</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, Central Professional Books, Quezon City, p. 180; citing <i>Hydro Resources Contractors Corporation v.
