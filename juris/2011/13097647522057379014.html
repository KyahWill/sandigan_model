In the instant case, the consent to tenurial arrangement between the parties is inferred from the fact that the plaintiff and her successors-in-interest had received their share of the harvests of the property in dispute from the defendants.<br><br>Moreover, dispossession of agricultural tenants can only be ordered by the Court for causes expressly provided under Sec. 36 of R.A. 3844. However, this Court has no jurisdiction over detainer case involving agricultural tenants as ejectment and dispossession of said tenants is within the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform and Agricultural Board (DARAB).

In her affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> petitioner Lucia declared that she and her late husband occupied the subject land with the consent and permission of the original owners and that their agreement was that she and her late husband would cultivate the subject land, devote it to agricultural production, share the harvest with the landowners on a 50-50 basis, and at the same time watch over the land.&nbsp; Witness Alejandro Arias attested in his affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> that petitioner Lucia and her husband, Serapio, have been cultivating the subject land since 1960; that after the demise of Serapio, petitioner Lucia and her children continued to cultivate the subject land; and that when respondent's predecessors-in-interest were still alive, he would often see them and respondent get some of the harvest.&nbsp; The affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of witness Conseso Muñoz stated, in essence, that petitioner Lucia has been in peaceful possession and cultivation of the subject property since 1960 and that the harvest was divided into two parts, ½ for the landowner and ½ for petitioner Lucia.<br><br>The statements in the affidavits presented by the petitioners are not sufficient to prove the existence of an agricultural tenancy.<br><br>As correctly found by the CA, the element of consent is lacking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Except for the self-serving affidavit of Lucia, no other evidence was submitted to show that respondent's predecessors-in-interest consented to a tenancy relationship with petitioners.&nbsp; Self-serving statements, however, will not suffice to prove consent of the landowner; independent evidence is necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Aside from consent, petitioners also failed to prove sharing of harvest.&nbsp; The affidavits of petitioners' neighbors declaring that respondent and her predecessors-in-interest received their share in the harvest are not sufficient. Petitioners should have presented receipts or any other evidence to show that there was sharing of harvest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and that there was an agreed system of sharing between them and the landowners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>As we have often said, mere occupation or cultivation of an agricultural land will not <i>ipso facto</i> make the tiller an agricultural tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; It is incumbent upon a person who claims to be an agricultural tenant to prove by substantial evidence all the requisites of agricultural tenancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, petitioners failed to prove consent and sharing of harvest between the parties.&nbsp; Consequently, their defense of agricultural tenancy must fail. The MTC has jurisdiction over the instant case. No error can therefore be attributed to the CA in reversing and setting aside the dismissal of respondent's complaint for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Accordingly, the remand of the case to the MTC for the determination of the amount of damages due respondent is proper.<br><br><b><i>Respondent is entitled to the fair rental <br>value or the reasonable compensation for<br> the use and occupation of the subject land.</i></b><br><br>We must, however, clarify that "the only damage that can be recovered [by respondent] is the fair rental value or the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the leased property.&nbsp; The reason for this is that [in forcible entry or unlawful detainer cases], the only issue raised in ejectment cases is that of rightful possession; hence, the damages which could be recovered are those which the [respondent] could have sustained as a mere possessor, or those caused by the loss of the use and occupation of the property, and not the damages which [she] may have suffered but which have no direct relation to [her] loss of material possession."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed August 24, 2005 Decision and the February 20, 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R.
