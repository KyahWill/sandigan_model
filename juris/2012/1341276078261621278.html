				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We review the judgment of conviction for murder of Eduardo Gonzales (<i>appellant</i>) in the decision dated July 28, 2010 of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 03840. The CA affirmed the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 5, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC)</i>, Branch 57, San Carlos City, Pangasinan, in Criminal Case No. 2814 whose decretal portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing, this Court finds accused EDUARDO GONZALES, having failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his act was justified, GUILTY of the crime of Murder and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>. Accused Eduardo Gonzales is directed to pay the heirs of the victim Eligio Donato the sum of P20,000.00 as actual damages; P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (italics ours)</blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The appellant and his brother, co-accused Edmundo Gonzales,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> were charged with murder under a criminal information which alleged conspiracy, evident premeditation and treachery in the killing of Eligio Donato (<i>victim</i>).<br><br>The records<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> show that the victim went to the house of the appellant at the invitation of Edmundo. When the victim arrived, he was met by the appellant who was armed with a .22 caliber firearm. The appellant and Edmundo immediately fired at the victim six (6) times, hitting him three (3) times - in the arm, in his left thigh and in his left chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The victim expired before he could receive medical treatment.<br><br>The appellant denied the charge and claimed that he had acted in self-defense. He narrated that he was at his house watching television when the victim suddenly arrived, armed with a short firearm. The victim shouted invectives at the appellant and threatened to kill him. When efforts by the appellant to pacify the victim proved to be futile, the appellant retrieved his own firearm inside his house. A struggle for the possession of the appellant’s firearm then ensued between the appellant and the victim which caused the appellant’s gun to discharge three times; thus, hitting the victim.<br><br>The RTC found the prosecution’s version more consistent with the physical findings that the victim was not shot at close range, in the absence of powder burns on his skin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The RTC rejected the appellant’s self-defense theory in the absence of evidence of unlawful aggression. The RTC ruled that the appellant was guilty of murder, qualified by treachery and evident premeditation, given the manner and the means employed in attacking the unsuspecting victim, leaving him no time or opportunity to resist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In due course, the appellant appealed his judgment of conviction with the CA, contending that the RTC committed reversible errors in the appreciation of the evidence, namely: (1) in giving weight and credence to the highly inconsistent and questionable testimony of the prosecution eyewitness; (2) in disregarding the justifying circumstance of self-defense; and (3) in finding that the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation attended the killing.<br><br>The CA rejected the appellant’s arguments and affirmed the RTC’s decision holding that the prosecution eyewitness’ account of the shooting was straightforward, categorical and without any established ill-motive. The CA also held that the eyewitness testimony was compatible with the physical evidence showing that the appellant, not the victim, started the attack. The CA agreed with the RTC that the killing was qualified by treachery since the attack was executed in a manner that rendered the victim defenseless and unable to retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The CA did not rule on whether evident premeditation was present in the victim’s killing.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></center><br>On the basis of the same arguments raised before the CA, the appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br><b>We find no reversible error in the CA’s decision and affirm the&nbsp; appellant’s conviction for murder.</b><br><br><i><u>The Claim of Self-Defense</u></i><br><br>Self-defense as a justifying circumstance under Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, implies the admission by the accused that he committed the acts which would have been criminal in character had it not been for the presence of circumstances whose legal consequences negate the commission of a crime. By invoking self-defense in this case, the appellant admitted that he shot the victim. With this admission, the burden of evidence shifted to the appellant to prove that he acted in accordance with the law. The appellant, in this regard, must satisfactorily prove the concurrence of the following requisites under the second paragraph of Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, to relieve him of any criminal liability:<br><br><blockquote><b>First</b>, unlawful aggression;<br><b>Second</b>, reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it;<br><b>Third</b>, lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending.<br></blockquote><br>We find that the appellant failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>(a) <i>Unlawful aggression</i><br><br>The existence of unlawful aggression is the basic requirement in a plea of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In other words, no self-defense can exist without unlawful aggression since there is no attack that the accused will have to prevent or repel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In <i>People v. Dolorido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we held that unlawful aggression “presupposes actual, sudden, unexpected or imminent danger – not merely threatening and intimidating action. <b>It is present ‘only when the one attacked faces real and immediate threat to one’s life.</b>’” The unlawful aggression may constitute an actual physical assault, or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury upon the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In case of a “threat, it must be offensive and strong, positively showing the x x x intent to cause injury.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In this case, the requisite of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is patently absent. The records fail to disclose any circumstance showing that the appellant’s life was in danger when he met the victim. What the evidence shows is that the victim was unarmed when he went to the house of the appellant.&nbsp; Likewise, there was also no evidence proving the gravity of the utterances and the actuations allegedly made by the victim that would have indicated his wrongful intent to injure the appellant.<br><br>We note that the appellant’s claim of self-defense was even disproved by the narration of his own witness, Teofilo Posadas, who came into the scene to witness the ongoing attack by the appellant on the victim. As Posadas testified:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q&nbsp;</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Witness, how did you know Mr. Witness that it was Eligio Donato shouting at Eduardo Gonzales “Anggapo lay Balam” [You have no more bullet]?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When Eduardo fired his gun in the air twice, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Which came first Mr. Witness, Eduardo Gonzales firing his gun in the air twice or Eligio Donato shouting at Eduardo Gonzales “Anggapo lay Balam”?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The firing in the air, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">By the way Mr. Witness, you mentioned a while ago that Eduardo Gonzales fired his gun in the air twice, did you notice what kind of gun did (sic) Eduardo Gonzales used [in] firing two gunshot or two shots in the air?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">[.]22 caliber long barrel, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And how did you know that Eduardo Gonzales fired a [.]22 caliber gun or a long barrel gun?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I saw that gun before while he was using it in targeting fish and birds, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">So Mr. Witness did Eligio Donato and Eduardo Gonzales get near each other?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What did they do when they got close [to] each other, Mr. Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">They scuffled over the possession of the gun, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When they were scuffling over the possession of the gun, what happened Mr. Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The gun fired, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">How many gun burst did you hear Mr. Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Two (2) or more, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">After you heard two (2) or more gun burst Mr. Witness, what happened to Eligio [Donato], if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">He fell down, ma’am.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>The testimony of Posadas reveals that:<b><u> first</u></b>, the appellant who was armed met the victim; <b><u>second</u></b>, while at a distance, the appellant fired twice at the victim’s direction; <b><u>and third</u></b>, the appellant fired at the victim when the latter tried to take away his firearm.<br><br>Posadas’ testimony, taken together with the testimony of prosecution eyewitness Eduardo Rodriguez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> provides a clear picture on how the unlawful aggression was initiated by the appellant, not by the victim. The unlawful aggression started when the appellant immediately fired at the victim as the latter alighted from a tricycle and continued when the appellant fired at the victim six (6) times. The assault ended when the appellant fired at the victim when the latter tried to take away his firearm.<br><br>More importantly, Posadas’ testimony was even corroborated by the physical evidence that should clearly defeat the claim of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, in that:<i> first</i>, it was only the victim who was wounded in the assault; and <span style="font-style: italic;">second, </span>the physical evidence showed that the victim had three (3) gunshot wounds thereby indicating that he had already been shot by the appellant when he tried to gain possession of the appellant’s firearm.<br><br>(b) <i>Reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the victim’s attack</i><br><br>The second requisite of self-defense could not have been present in the absence of any unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. However, even granting that it was the unarmed victim who first acted as the aggressor, we find that the means employed by the appellant in repelling the attack - the use of a firearm, the number of times he fired at the victim and the number of gunshot wounds sustained by the victim - were not reasonably necessary. On the contrary, we find that the number of gunshot wounds reveals a clear intent to kill, not merely to repel the attack of the unarmed victim.<br><br>(c) <i> Lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the appellant<br></i><br>The records disclose that the struggle between the victim and the appellant occurred <b>after</b> the appellant <b>fired</b> at the victim. In other words, the third requisite was not established given the sufficient provocation by the appellant in placing the victim’s life in actual danger. Thus, any aggression made by the victim cannot be considered unlawful as it was made as an act of self-preservation to defend his life.<br><br>In addition to the above considerations, the appellant’s claim of self-defense was also belied by his own conduct after the shooting. The records show that the appellant went into hiding after he was criminally charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He also stayed in hiding for four (4) years and could have continued doing so had it not been for his arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Self-defense loses its credibility given the appellant’s flight from the crime scene and his failure to inform the authorities about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><i><u>Credible Eyewitness Testimony</u></i><br><br>As the appellant failed to prove that he had acted in self-defense, he effectively admitted to the unlawful shooting and the unlawful killing of the victim. Accordingly, we no longer need to examine the issue relating to the credibility of the prosecution witness’ testimony.&nbsp; We reiterate, however, that the findings of the trial court on matters relating to the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies will not be disturbed on appeal unless some weight and serious facts or circumstances have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted so as to materially affect the disposition of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Under the circumstances, we find no compelling reason to deviate from this rule.<br><br><i><u>The Nature of the Killing</u></i><br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, provides that <i>[a]ny person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua, to death if committed with x x x treachery.</i> Both the RTC and the CA ruled that the crime committed was murder, taking into account the presence of the qualifying circumstance of treachery. The CA held:<br><br><blockquote>As established on record and as found by the trial court, <b>the victim lost that opportunity to defend himself because of x x x appellant’s unexpected attack</b>. [The victim], who was then <b>unarmed</b>, was alighting a tricycle <b>when x x x appellant suddenly shot him</b>. Such <b>swiftness of the attack</b> even made it <b>physically impossible for [the victim] to run for his safety</b>. Clearly, the killing of [the victim] was attended by treachery which qualifies the crime to murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>We agree with the CA’s findings. There is treachery (<i>alevosia</i>) when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to ensure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The two elements that must be proven to establish treachery are: “(a) the employment of means of execution which would ensure the safety of the offender from defensive and retaliatory acts of the victim, giving the victim no opportunity to defend himself; and (b) the means, method and manner of execution were deliberately and consciously adopted by the offender.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The two elements are present in this case.<br><br>The first element was established by the prosecution eyewitness’ testimony showing the sudden attack by the appellant on the unsuspecting victim who had just alighted from a tricycle. The victim was then unarmed and had no opportunity to defend himself.<br><br>The second element was established by the prosecution eyewitness’ testimony showing that the appellant deliberately and consciously adopted a pre-conceived plan on how to kill the victim. The evidence showed that the unsuspecting victim was first lured in going to the house of the appellant by Edmundo. The appellant who was armed waited for the arrival of the victim. Afterwards, the appellant immediately fired at the victim.<br><br><i><u>The Penalty and the Civil Liability</u></i><br><br>The CA correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> We find that the prosecution failed to establish that the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation was present in the case. The prosecution failed to prove the concurrence of the following requisites to establish evident premeditation: (1) the time when the offender was determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the offender clung to his determination; and (3) a sufficient interval of time between the determination and the execution of the crime to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act. The prosecution failed to prove how and when the plan to kill the victim was planned and determined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>With respect to damages, the CA correctly awarded the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages, they being consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In <i>People of the Philippines v. David Maningding</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> we ruled that when the circumstances surrounding the crime call for the imposition of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> only, the proper amounts should be P 50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P 50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>However, we modify the CA’s decision on the other awards of damages.<br><br>In accordance with current jurisprudence, we delete the award of P20,000 as actual damages and, in its stead, award P30,000.00 as temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> We also award the heirs of the victim compensatory damages for the loss of the victim’s earning capacity, there being testimonial and documentary evidence on record to support the award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The wife of the victim testified that the victim was 36 years old and was a soldier receiving a monthly salary of more than P9,000.00. The victim’s pay slip was also presented, showing his earnings of P9,576.00 a month.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The award of compensatory damages for loss of earning capacity is computed using the following formula:<br><br><blockquote>Net earning capacity (x)&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life expectancy x gross annual income -<br><div style="margin-left: 200px;">living expenses (50% of gross annual <br>income) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></div></blockquote><br>Under this formula, we award to the heirs of the victim the amount of P1,685,184.48 as compensatory damages for the victim’s loss of earning capacity, calculated as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2(80-36)_</span>&nbsp; x [P 114,912.00 – 57,456.00]<br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">3<br></div>=&nbsp;&nbsp; 29.33 x P 57,456.00<br><br>=&nbsp;&nbsp; P 1,685,184.48</blockquote><br>Finally, we also award P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, since the killing was attended by treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we <b>DISMISS</b> the appeal and <b>AFFIRM with MODIFICATION </b>the decision dated July 28, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 03840. Appellant Eduardo Gonzales is found guilty of murder, penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. He is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of Eligio Donato the following sums:<br><br><blockquote>1)&nbsp; P50,000.00 as civil indemnity;<br>2)&nbsp; P1,685,184.48 as compensatory damages for loss of earning capacity;<br>3)&nbsp; P30,000.00 as temperate damages in lieu of actual damages;<br>4)&nbsp; P50,000.00 as moral damages; and<br>5)&nbsp; P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br></blockquote><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Perez, Sereno</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 2-21; penned by Associate Justice Vicente S.E.
