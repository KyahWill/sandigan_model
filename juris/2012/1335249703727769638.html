The CA reversed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), which upheld the assertion of Spouses Jesus Y. Yujuico and Marietta V. Yujuico (respondents) that they should be paid by the government in the amount of P150,000 per hectare of land distributed by public respondent Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to their farmer-beneficiaries.<br><br>Respondents were the registered owners of eight parcels of land as reflected in the following Transfer Certificates Title (TCT):<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Lot 1 – 52.9200 hectares (TCT No. NT-77818)<br><br>Lot 2 – 53.1741 hectares (TCT No. NT-77819)<br><br>Lot 3 – 44.5588 hectares (TCT No. NT-174919)<br><br>Lot 4 – 49.1347 hectares (TCT No. NT-77820)<br><br>Lot 5 – 52.9200 hectares (TCT No. NT-77821)<br><br>Lot 6 – 45.8068 hectares (TCT No. NT-77822)<br><br>Lot 7 – 37.6290 hectares (TCT No. NT-77823)<br><br>Lot 8 – 20.9027 hectares (TCT No. NT-110213)</blockquote><br>The DAR claims that, following the mandate of Presidential Decree No. 27 (P.D. 27)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and Executive Order No. 228 (E.O. 228),&nbsp; Lots 3, 4, and 7 and parts of Lots 1, 5, and 6 were placed under the Operation Land Transfer (OLT) program of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The remaining parts of Lots 1, 5, and 6 were covered by Republic Act No. 6657 (R.A. 6657), otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 (CARL).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> As a consequence of these moves, the properties were acquired by the DAR and thereafter distributed to the proper farmer-beneficiaries.<br><br>The Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) offered respondents the amount of&nbsp; P2,422,883.88 as payment for their properties. Not satisfied with this amount, respondents filed an action for the payment of just compensation with the DAR Adjudication Board (DARAB) of Nueva Ecija, Cabanatuan City. After several hearings, the hearing adjudicator passed away.<br><br>Realizing that “there are many important and crucial issues related to the payment of just compensation, that are beyond the competence and jurisdiction of DARAB to decide and rule on,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> respondents filed a Complaint for determination and payment of just compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> before the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) of the RTC on 20 August 2001, even before the DARAB could resolve the case. On 29 November 2001, they filed an Amended Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Pending resolution of the Complaint, initial payments for some of the lots were accepted by respondents from the LBP. The parties agreed that these amounts should be deducted from whatever total amount the court would award to respondents. According to the LBP, P2,422,883.88 in the form of cash and bonds had already been deposited in the account of respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, Atty. Leandro Valisno, the lawyer and administrator of their properties, claims that his clients received only the following initial payments: P128,221.36 for Lot 1; P300,483.24 for Lot 4; P176,880.08 for Lot 5; and&nbsp; P205,516.75 for Lot 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> – or a total of&nbsp; P811,101.43. Yet, for no apparent reason, in the Memorandum they filed with this Court, they claim that the total amount they received as payment was only P810,806.43.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the case with the trial court, Jesus Yujuico died. Consequently, his heirs—his surviving spouse and six of his children—were substituted as respondents in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In its Answer to the Amended Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the DAR avers that the determination of the just compensation for the Lots placed under the OLT program should be governed by the provisions of P.D. 27 and E.O. 228.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Paragraph 4 of P.D. 27 reads:<br><br><blockquote>For the purpose of determining the cost of the land to be transferred to the tenant-farmer pursuant to this Decree, the value of the land shall be equivalent to two and one-half (2 1/2) times the average harvest of three normal crop years immediately preceding the promulgation of this Decree;</blockquote><br>Section 2 of E.O. 228 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. Henceforth, the valuation of rice and corn lands covered by P.D. No. 27 shall be based on the average gross production determined by the Barangay Committee on Land Production in accordance with Department Memorandum Circular No. 26, Series of 1973, and related issuances and regulations of the Department of Agrarian Reform. The average gross production per hectare shall be multiplied by two and a half (2.5), the product of which shall be multiplied by Thirty Five Pesos (P35.00), the government support price for one cavan of 50 kilos of palay on October 21, 1972, or Thirty One Pesos (P31.00), the government support price for one cavan of 50 kilos of corn on October 21, 1972, and the amount arrived at shall be the value of the rice and corn land, as the case may be, for the purpose of determining its cost to the farmer and compensation to the landowner.<br><br>Lease rentals paid to the landowner by the farmer beneficiary after October 21, 1972, shall be considered as advance payment for the land. In the event of dispute with the land owner regarding the amount of lease rental paid by the farmer beneficiary, the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Barangay Committee on Land Production concerned shall resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days from its submission pursuant to Department of Agrarian Reform Memorandum Circular No. 26, Series of 1973, and other pertinent issuances. In the event a party questions in court the resolution of the dispute, the landowner's compensation claim shall still be processed for payment and the proceeds shall be held in trust by the Trust Department of the Land Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 hereof, pending the resolution of the dispute before the court.</blockquote><br>The DAR concludes that if the foregoing provisions were reduced to an equation, this would be the resulting formula: “Land Value (LV) = AGP x 2.5 x P35.00 x no. of has.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The LBP concurs and asserts the same formula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>As the taking of the other properties were carried out through the application of the provisions of the CARL, the DAR submits that it is the CARL that should be used or applied in determining the value of these properties.<br><br>The DAR issued Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 (A.O. 5) in order to implement Section 17 of the CARL, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 17</b>. <i>Determination of Just Compensation </i>.---In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors, shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</blockquote><br>The LBP asserts that in determining the value of respondents’ properties, it merely applied and conformed to the mandate of Section 17 of the CARL as implemented by A.O. 5.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Respondents, for their part, explain that the lots expropriated yielded an average of&nbsp; 90-100 cavans per harvest per hectare. They claim that since their properties are surrounded by the Diapo River and the Tamale Creek, these have a natural year-round supply of irrigation water, making it possible for them to have two harvesting periods per year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Respondents thus insist that in determining the just compensation owed to them, the following formula should be adhered to: “90 cavans x 50 kgs. x 204.8507 has. x P6.00/kg. x 2 cropping season = total amount payable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>They further submit that P.D. 27 is inapplicable to this case, since the Emancipation Patents (EPs) issued to the farmer-beneficiaries in Lots 1, 5, and 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> were issued “not in 1972 when P.D. 27 was approved, but just after the approval of CARP.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Since P.D. 27 is not the proper law to be applied, respondents assert thus:<br><br><blockquote>Consequently, the just compensation for the aforementioned titled lands should legally be plugged and anchored in the vicinity of sales of lands thereat in 1988-1991 when said lands were issued E.P.s and other like titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondents presented as a witness the Municipal Assessor, who testified that the prevailing market price of the properties in the area at the time they were taken was from P150,000 to P200,000 per hectare. This testimony was, in petitioner’s opinion, corroborated by the testimonies of their other witness, the manager of a community rural bank in the area. The bank manager testified that he followed the aforementioned appraisal values in processing loan applications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Out of the 357.0461 hectares of agricultural land owned by respondents, the DAR took 204.8507 hectares, for which respondents demand that they be justly compensated in the amount of P30,727,605.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This amount is the product of 204.8507 hectares multiplied by P150,000.<br><br>The DAR claims that with respect to Lot 2 respondents have no cause of action against it, because it never endorsed to the LBP the alleged transfer of this property “for either processing and payment (R.A. 6657) or simply payment (P.D. 27/E.O. 228).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the same vein, the LBP also claims that no cause of action can be imputed to it by respondents in this regard. It contends that, until and unless the DAR endorses the claim folder of a particular landholding to respondents, there arises&nbsp; no obligation to determine the value of the lot—much less, pay the value thereof to the owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The questions that need to be resolved in this case are the following:<br><br><ol><li> The exact land area actually taken by the government from respondents;<br></li><li> The law that should be followed in determining the amount owed by the government to respondents for such taking; and<br></li><li>The amount the government should pay respondents.</li></ol><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated 30 January 2005, the RTC asserted that the Supreme Court had already declared the application of E.O. 228 and P.D. 27 in valuing expropriated properties as “unfair and unjust” to landowners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Tackling the issues formulated by the parties, the Supreme Court has ruled in several decisions that the application of Executive Order No. 228 in conjunction with the provisions of P.D. No. 27, used by defendants DAR and LBP, in arriving at a valuation of properties is unfair and unjust to the landowner. For just compensation means the equivalent for the value of the property at the time of its taking. Anything beyond is more and anything short of that is less, than just compensation.<br><br>The valuation at an average of P3,120.25 per hectare for the lands of plaintiffs covered by PD 27 is ridiculously low. Hence the formula used by the DAR and LBP using that provided under PD 27 and Executive Order No. 228 in arriving at the landholdings’ valuation should be disregarded.<br><br>On the other hand regarding those covered by R.A. 6657, the valuation at an average of P18,000.00 per hectare, more or less, is still low. In this connection the Court is convinced that it is not the just compensation contemplated by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>The trial court found that the actual area of the landholding placed under the coverage of land reform was 179.2302 hectares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Finding that the price of P150,000 per hectare was more reflective of the actual value of the properties, the RTC awarded an amount of P26,884,530 in favor of respondents. The dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, let judgment be rendered ordering defendant Department of Agrarian Reform through the defendant Land Bank of the Philippines to pay plaintiffs the Heirs of Jesus Yujuico, and Marietta Valisno-Yujuico, the total amount of Twenty Six Million Eight Hundred Eighty Four Thousand Five Hundred Thirty (P26,884,530.00) Philippine Currency, representing the just compensation of the property with a total area of 179.2302 hectares, situated at Digmala (formerly Macabaclay), Bongabon, Nueva Ecija, covered by: (1) TCT No. NT-77818; (2) TCT No. NT-77819; (3) TCT No. NT-174919; (4) TCT No. NT-77820; (5) TCT No. NT-77821; (6) TCT No. NT-77822; and (7) TCT No. NT-77823, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from date of taking (which the Court determines to be November 29, 2001) until fully paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC made no pronouncement in its Decision on Lot 8.<br><br>Both the LBP and the DAR filed their Motions for Reconsideration (MR), while respondents filed a partial MR. The trial court denied the MRs of LBP and the DAR on 22 July 2005, but it granted the partial MR of respondents and changed the date from which legal interest shall accrue—from 29 November 2001 to June 1989, because the EPs had been awarded to the land tillers as early as June 1988 until October 2001.<br><br>The LBP and the DAR filed Petitions for Review, which were later consolidated by the appellate court.<br><br>In determining whether to apply the formula ordered by P.D. 27 and E.O. 28 or that found in Section 17 of the CARL in relation to its implementing regulation A.O. 5, the CA ruled that it should be the law in effect on the date of payment and not—as the LBP insists—the law in effect at the time of the taking, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The question of what formula to use in determining the value of the property taken raises the corollary issue of whether the value should be computed as of the time of taking or time of payment. An erudite discussion of the issue in Lubrico vs. Land Bank of the Philippines 507 SCRA 415 underscores the date of payment as the reckoning point in the determination of value. In that case, the landowners were deprived of their property since 1972 but had not yet received payment when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in 2006. The tribunal noted that expropriation proceedings had been initiated under PD 27 but were not completed when RA 6657 was passed. It was held that since the process was to be completed under RA 6657, the method of valuation in that statute must be followed.<br><br>The Land Bank still insists that the lands should be valued under the laws in effect at the time of taking. Hence, for lands taken under PD 27, the formula in PD 27 should be followed, for those under EO 228, the formula in EO 228 should be used, and for those under RA 6657, the formula of that statue should apply. However, from the very records of Land Bank, the earliest payment was made in March 1992 – <i>long after CARP was in effect.</i> Subsequent payments were effected until 2003. Following judicial doctrine, the valuation must be determined under RA 6657 as implemented by AO 5.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>In support of this stance, the CA stated that the date of taking used to be the date when the interest would begin to accrue. However, this <i>Court, in Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> already ruled that “interest is no longer imposed x x x unless there is a finding of delay to justify interest as damages,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> making any final determination—with regard to that date—completely superfluous.<br><br>Thereafter, the appellate court decided to order the return of the records of the case to the trial court “for the re-computation of the valuation of the properties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision subject of review is SET ASIDE. Let this case be remanded to the Special Agrarian Court for it to proceed with dispatch on the computation of the final valuation of the lands in accordance with our decision.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>The LBP filed an MR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the CA Decision, but the motion was denied through a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated 30 September 2008. Hence, this appeal via a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> under Rule 45.<br><br>The LBP presents its own breakdown<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the lots taken by the DAR; the respective land areas thereof; the law used as basis for the taking; the just compensation supposedly due to respondents for the expropriation of the said properties; and the status of the payment, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>1) Lot 1<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; Acquired under P.D. 27 and E.O. 228<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-11.3945 hectares taken<br>-just compensation of P35,553.69 fully paid<br></div><br>b) Acquired under the CARL<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-33.6187 hectares taken<br>-just compensation of P613,174.16 partially paid<br></div></div><br>2) Lot 4<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; Acquired under P.D. 27 and E.O. 228<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-49.1347 hectares<br>-just compensation of P85,476.14 fully paid<br></div></div><br>3) Lot 5<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; Acquired under P.D. 27 and E.O. 228<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-15.17186 hectares<br>-just compensation of P176,880.00 fully paid<br></div><br>b) Acquired under the CARL<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-8.9257 hectares<br>- just compensation of P155,516.75 unpaid<br></div></div><br>4) Lot 6<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; Acquired under P.D. 27 and E.O. 228<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-18.3063 hectares<br>- just compensation of P57,120.23 fully paid<br></div><br>b) Acquired under the CARL<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-13.8215 hectares<br>- just compensation of P303,615.78 fully paid<br></div></div><br>5) Lot 7<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; Acquired under P.D. 27 and E.O. 228<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-27.5143 hectares<br>-just compensation of P480,544.40 unpaid</div></div></blockquote><br>The breakdown shows that only Lots 1(b), 5(b) and 7—all of which were taken pursuant to the CARL—remain unpaid.<br><br>This Court cannot determine, based on the allegations of the LBP, if the latter paid respondents P613,174.16 as part of an undetermined total sum for Lot 1(b), or if the bank has made an undetermined partial payment for the P613,174.16 it owes to respondents for Lot 1(b); the same is true for Lot 5(b). As to Lot 7, respondents claim that the entire amount of P480,544.40 remains unpaid.<br><br>The LBP prays that this Court annul and set aside the CA’s Decision or, in the alternative, resolve the issue of just compensation by upholding the legality of the amount of ?2,422,883.88 deposited in respondents’ favor as just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>The trial court’s finding with respect to the actual land area expropriated is supported by the evidence on record.</i></b> </div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>In the Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> respondents submitted to the RTC on 13 September 2004, the 204.8507 hectares for which they demanded compensation in their original Complaint became 215.7187 hectares; and the P30,727,605 became P87,177,000.&nbsp; In the Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> they submitted to this Court, the total land area was again changed from 215.7187 hectares to 204.8507 hectares.

The trial court examined the annotations at the back of the titles of the properties, the allegations of the LBP in its Answer, and the letters from the Valuation and Landowner’s Compensation Office of the LBP and, from there, arrived at the aforementioned figures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">If the issue of just compensation is not settled prior to the passage of the CARL, the said compensation should be computed in accordance with the said law, even though the property was acquired under P.D. 27.</div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>We shall now rule on the allegation of LBP that the RTC and the appellate court should have used either P.D. 27 in relation to E.O. 228 or the CARL in relation to A.O. 5—depending on which law was used to acquire the properties—in determining just compensation.<br><br>LBP avers that the CA erred when the latter ordered the RTC to determine the value of respondents’ rice lands, following the mandate of the CARL, even though these lots were acquired pursuant to P.D. 27 and E.O. 228.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> LBP argues that E.O. 229, which provides for the mechanism of the CARL, specifically states that P.D. 27 shall continue to operate with respect to rice and corn lands covered thereunder despite the passage of the CARL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The LBP thus insists that the valuation of lands acquired under the OLT should be made in accordance with the mandate of P.D. 27 and E.O. 228, because the CARL did not repeal or supersede P.D. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Resolving these allegations, the trial court boldly proclaimed that this Court, in <i>Export Processing Zone Authority v.

We declared as unconstitutional these provisions in P.D. 76, 464, 794 and 1533. We ruled that the methods of valuation found in those laws&nbsp; may serve only as guiding principles or one of the factors to be considered in determining just compensation, but they may not substitute for the court’s own judgment as to what amount should be awarded and how to arrive at that amount. We held that the determination of just compensation is ultimately a judicial function, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The determination of “just compensation” in eminent domain cases is a judicial function. The executive department or the legislature may make the initial determinations but when a party claims a violation of the guarantee in the Bill of Rights that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation, no statute, decree, or executive order can mandate that its own determination shall prevail over the court’s findings. Much less can the courts be precluded from looking into the “justness” of the decreed compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, this Court ruled that those provisions are unconstitutional insofar as they allow an impermissible encroachment on judicial prerogatives.<br><br><i>Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay</i> never discussed P.D. 27. Contrary to the trial court’s assertion, we had already affirmed the constitutionality of P.D. 27 in Sigre v. Court of Appeals, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> viz:<br><br><blockquote>The objection that P.D. 27 is unconstitutional as it sets limitations on the judicial prerogative of determining just compensation is bereft of merit. P.D. 27 provides:<br><br>“For the purpose of determining the cost of the land to be transferred to the tenant-farmer pursuant to this Decree, the value of the land shall be equivalent to two and one half (2 ½) times the average harvest of three normal crop years immediately preceding the promulgation of this Decree;”<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; </center><br>The determination of just compensation under P.D. No. 27, like in Section 16 (d) of R.A. 6657 or the CARP Law, is not final or conclusive. This is evident from the succeeding paragraph of Section 2 of E.O. 228.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; </center><br>x x x, unless both the landowner and the tenant-farmer accept the valuation of the property by the Barrio Committee on Land Production and the DAR, the parties may bring the dispute to court in order to determine the appropriate amount of compensation, a task unmistakably within the prerogative of the court.</blockquote><br>What is clear from all of these instances is that although a law may suggest or provide a method or formula to be used in determining the value of expropriated properties or just compensation, the value arrived at in applying it is not and should not be considered final and absolute. No law can deprive the courts of the power to review, alter, or modify the amount arrived at if they believe it to be unfair or unjust. The final determination of the proper amount of compensation still rests upon the court.<br><br>This Court has already categorically declared in <i>LBP v. Domingo Soriano</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that if the issue of just compensation is not settled prior to the passage of the CARL, it should be computed in accordance with the said law, although the property was acquired under P.D. 27, viz:<br><br><blockquote>In the instant case, while the subject lands were acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27, the complaint for just compensation was only lodged before the court on 23 November 2000 or long after the passage of Republic Act No. 6657 in 1988. Therefore, Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 should be the principal basis of the computation for just compensation. As a matter of fact, the factors enumerated therein had already been translated into a basic formula by the DAR pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of Republic Act No. 6657. The formula outlined in DAR Administrative Order No. 5, series of 1998 should be applied in computing just compensation, thus:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br><br>Where: LV = Land Value<br></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;">CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br>CS = Comparable Sales<br>MV = Market Value per Tax Declaration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></div></blockquote><br>The same rule holds true for the present case.
