As such, the prosecution can no longer interpose an appeal to the CA, as it would place them in double jeopardy.&nbsp; Petitioners contend that respondent's petition for <i>certiorari </i>with the CA should not have prospered, because the allegations therein, in effect, assailed the trial court's judgment, not its jurisdiction.&nbsp; In other words, petitioners posit that the said Order was in the nature of an error of judgment rendered, which was not correctible by a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA.<br><br>Petitioners aver that although the CA correctly ruled that the prosecution had not been denied due process, however, it erred in ruling that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in granting petitioners' Demurrer to Evidence, on the basis that the prosecution failed to prove that they acted in conspiracy with Ampoloquio, the author of the questioned articles.&nbsp; They added that what the prosecution proved was merely their designations as Editor and Associate Editor of the publication <i>Bandera</i>, but not the fact that they had either control over the articles to be published or actually edited the subject articles.<br><br>Respondent counters that petitioners failed to show special and important reasons to justify their invocation of the Court's power to review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; She avers that the acquittal of petitioners does not preclude their further prosecution if the judgment acquitting them is void for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Further, she points out that contrary to petitioners’ contention, the principle of double jeopardy does not attach in cases where the court's judgment acquitting the accused or dismissing the case is void, either for having disregarded the State's right to due process or for having been rendered by the trial court with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and not merely errors of judgment.<br><br>Respondent also avers that even if the prosecution was deemed to have waived its right to file a Comment on the petitioners’ Motion for Leave of Court to File the Attached Demurrer to Evidence, this did not give the trial court any reason to deprive the prosecution of its right to file a Comment on the petitioners’ Demurrer to Evidence itself, which was a clear violation of the due process requirement.&nbsp; By reason of the foregoing, respondent insists that petitioners cannot invoke violation of their right against double jeopardy.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>At the onset, it should be noted that respondent took a procedural misstep, and the view she is advancing is erroneous. The authority to represent the State in appeals of criminal cases before the Supreme Court and the CA is solely vested in the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG).&nbsp; Section 35 (1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code explicitly provides that the OSG shall represent the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of lawyers.&nbsp; It shall have specific powers and functions to represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme Court and the CA, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The OSG is the law office of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>To be sure, in criminal cases, the acquittal of the accused or the dismissal of the case against him can only be appealed by the Solicitor General, acting on behalf of the State. The private complainant or the offended party may question such acquittal or dismissal only insofar as the civil liability of the accused is concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a catena of cases, this view has been time and again espoused and maintained by the Court.&nbsp; In <i>Rodriguez v. Gadiane,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; it was categorically stated that if the criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, the appeal on the criminal aspect of the case must be instituted by the Solicitor General in behalf of the State. The capability of the private complainant to question such dismissal or acquittal is limited only to the civil aspect of the case.&nbsp; The same determination was also arrived at by the Court in <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Veridiano II</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; In the recent case of <i>Bangayan, Jr. v. Bangayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court again upheld this guiding principle.<br><br>Worthy of note is the case of <i>People v. Santiago</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> wherein the Court had the occasion to bring this issue to rest. The Court elucidated:<br><br><blockquote>It is well-settled that in criminal cases where the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited to the civil liability. Thus, in the prosecution of the offense, the complainant's role is limited to that of a witness for the prosecution. If a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal therefrom on the criminal aspect may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General. Only the Solicitor General may represent the People of the Philippines on appeal. The private offended party or complainant may not take such appeal. However, the said offended party or complainant may appeal the civil aspect despite the acquittal of the accused.<br><br>In a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> filed under Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court wherein it is alleged that the trial court committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction or on other jurisdictional grounds, the rules state that the petition may be filed by the person aggrieved. In such case, the aggrieved parties are the State and the private offended party or complainant. The complainant has an interest in the civil aspect of the case so he may file such special civil action questioning the decision or action of the respondent court on jurisdictional grounds. In so doing, complainant should not bring the action in the name of the People of the Philippines. The action may be prosecuted in name of said complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the Court has definitively ruled that in a criminal case in which the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom. If a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal of the criminal aspect may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, only by the State through the solicitor general. As a rule, only the Solicitor General may represent the People of the Philippines on appeal. The private offended party or complainant may not undertake such appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the petition filed by the respondent before the CA essentially questioned the criminal aspect of the Order of the RTC, not the civil aspect of the case.&nbsp; Consequently, the petition should have been filed by the State through the OSG. Since the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed in the CA was not at the instance of the OSG, the same should have been outrightly dismissed by the CA. Respondent lacked the personality or legal standing to question the trial court’s order because it is only the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), who can bring actions on behalf of the State in criminal proceedings, before the Supreme Court and the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thus, the CA should have denied the petition outright.<br><br>Moreover, not only did the CA materially err in entertaining the petition, it should be stressed that the granting of petitioners’ Demurrer to Evidence already amounted to a dismissal of the case on the merits and a review of the order granting the demurrer to evidence will place the accused in double jeopardy. Consequently, the Court disagrees with the CA’s ruling reversing the trial court’s order dismissing the criminal cases against petitioners.<br><br>Under Section 23,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Rule 119 of the Rules of Court on Demurrer to Evidence, after the prosecution terminates the presentation of evidence and rests its case, the trial court may dismiss the case on the ground of insufficiency of evidence upon the filing of a Demurrer to Evidence by the accused with or without leave of court.&nbsp; If the accused files a Demurrer to Evidence with prior leave of court and the same is denied, he may adduce evidence in his defense.&nbsp; However, if the Demurrer to Evidence is filed by the accused without prior leave of court and the same is denied, he waives his right to present evidence and submits the case for judgment on the basis of the evidence for the prosecution.<br><br>Corollarily, after the prosecution rests its case, and the accused files a Demurrer to Evidence, the trial court is required to evaluate whether the evidence presented by the prosecution is sufficient enough to warrant the conviction of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; If the trial court finds that the prosecution evidence is not sufficient and grants the accused's Demurrer to Evidence, the ruling is an adjudication on the merits of the case which is tantamount to an acquittal and may no longer be appealed.&nbsp; Any further prosecution of the accused after an acquittal would, thus, violate the constitutional proscription on double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Anent the prosecution’s claim of denial of due process.&nbsp; As correctly found by the CA, the prosecution was not denied due process. Suffice it to state that the prosecution had actively participated in the trial and already rested its case, and upon petitioners' filing of their Demurrer to Evidence, was given the opportunity to file its Comment or Opposition and, in fact, actually filed its Comment thereto, albeit belatedly.&nbsp; The CA emphasized that the word “may” was used in Section 23 of Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states that if leave of court is granted, and the accused has filed the Demurrer to Evidence within a non-extendible period of ten (10) days from notice, the prosecution “may” oppose the Demurrer to Evidence within a similar period from its receipt.&nbsp; In this regard, the CA added that the filing of a Comment or Opposition by respondent is merely directory, not a mandatory or jurisdictional&nbsp; requirement, and that in fact the trial court may even proceed with the resolution of the petitioners' Demurrer to Evidence even without the prosecution's Comment.<br><br>One final note.&nbsp; Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code specifies the persons that can be held liable for libel.&nbsp; It provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>ART. 360</b>.&nbsp; <i>Persons responsible</i>. — Any person who shall publish, exhibit or cause the publication or exhibition of any defamation in writing or by similar means, shall be responsible for the same.<br><br><i>The author or editor of a book or pamphlet, or the editor or business manager of a daily newspaper, magazine or serial publication, shall be responsible for the defamation contained therein to the same extent as if he were the author thereof</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>From the foregoing, not only is the person who published, exhibited or caused the publication or exhibition of any defamation in writing shall be responsible for the same, all other persons who participated in its publication are liable, including the editor or business manager of a daily newspaper, magazine or serial publication, who shall be equally responsible for the defamations contained therein to the same extent as if he were the author thereof.&nbsp; The liability which attaches to petitioners is, thus, statutory in nature.<br><br>In <i>Fermin v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> therein petitioner argued that to sustain a conviction for libel under Article 360 of the Code, it is mandatory that the publisher knowingly participated in or consented to the preparation and publication of the libelous article.&nbsp; She also averred that she had adduced ample evidence to show that she had no hand in the preparation and publication of the offending article, nor in the review, editing, examination, and approval of the articles published in <i>Gossip</i> Tabloid.&nbsp; The Court struck down her erroneous theory and ruled that therein petitioner, who was not only the Publisher of <i>Gossip</i> Tabloid but also its President and Chairperson, could not escape liability by claiming lack of participation in the preparation and publication of the libelous article.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>Tulfo v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> therein petitioners, who were Managing Editor, National Editor of Remate&nbsp; publication, President of Carlo Publishing House, and one who does typesetting, editing, and layout of the page, claim that they had no participation in the editing or writing of the subject articles which will hold them liable for the crime of libel and, thus, should be acquitted.&nbsp; In debunking this argument, the Court stressed that an editor or manager of a newspaper, who has active charge and control over the publication, is held equally liable with the author of the libelous article.&nbsp; This is because it is the duty of the editor or manager to know and control the contents of the paper, and interposing the defense of lack of knowledge or consent as to the contents of the articles or publication definitely will not prosper.<br><br>The rationale for the criminal culpability of those persons enumerated in Article 360 was already elucidated as early as in the case of <i>U.S. v. Ocampo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>According to the legal doctrines and jurisprudence of the United States, the printer of a publication containing libelous matter is liable for the same by reason of his direct connection therewith and his cognizance of the contents thereof. With regard to a publication in which a libel is printed, not only is the publisher but also all other persons who in any way participate in or have any connection with its publication are liable as publishers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>Accordingly, Article 360 would have made petitioners Bautista and Alcantara, being the Editor and Assistant Editor, respectively, of <i>Bandera Publishing Corporation</i>, answerable with Ampoloquio, for the latter’s alleged defamatory writing, as if they were the authors thereof.&nbsp; Indeed, as aptly concluded by the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The aforestated provision is clear and unambiguous.&nbsp; It equally applies to an editor of a publication in which a libelous article was published and states that the editor of the same shall be responsible for the defamation in writing as if he were the author thereof.&nbsp; Indeed, when an alleged libelous article is published in a newspaper, such fact alone sufficient evidence to charge the editor or business manager with the guilt of its publication.&nbsp; This sharing of liability with the author of said article is based on the principle that editors and associate editors, by the nature of their positions, edit, control and approve the materials which are to be published in a newspaper.&nbsp; This means that, without their nod of approbation, any article alleged to be libelous would not be published.&nbsp; Hence, by virtue of their position and the authority which they exercise, newspaper editors and associate editors are as much critical part in the publication of any defamatory material as the writer or author thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>Nevertheless, petitioners could no longer be held liable in view of the procedural infirmity that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was not undertaken by the OSG, but instead by respondent in her personal capacity. Although the conclusion of the trial court may be wrong, to reverse and set aside the Order granting the demurrer to evidence would violate petitioners’ constitutionally-enshrined right against double jeopardy.&nbsp; Had it not been for this procedural defect, the Court could have seriously considered the arguments advanced by the respondent in seeking the reversal of the Order of the RTC.<br><br>The granting of a demurrer to evidence should, therefore, be exercised with caution, taking into consideration not only the rights of the accused, but also the right of the private offended party to be vindicated of the wrongdoing done against him, for if it is granted, the accused is acquitted and the private complainant is generally left with no more remedy.&nbsp; In such instances, although the decision of the court may be wrong, the accused can invoke his right against double jeopardy. Thus, judges are reminded to be more diligent and circumspect in the performance of their duties as members of the Bench, always bearing in mind that their decisions affect the lives of the accused and the individuals who come to the courts to seek redress of grievances, which decision could be possibly used by the aggrieved party as basis for the filing of the appropriate actions against them.<br><br>Perforce, the Order dated April 25, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 212, Mandaluyong City, in Criminal Case Nos.
