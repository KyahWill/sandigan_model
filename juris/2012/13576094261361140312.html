The RTC added that its witnesses did not even conduct an actual relocation or verification survey of the subject property to determine its relative position to the timberland area. Thus, the RTC stated, the DENR Region VII’s conclusion with respect to the subject property’s position was inaccurate and unreliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In giving more credit to respondents’ evidence, particularly the CENRO Certificate, the RTC explained:<br><br><blockquote>As against the approved plan of [the subject property] which has been thoroughly verified under the Land Classification Map No. 2124 (Exhibit J-NAMRIA) and which merely conformed to the actual verification/relocation surveys (Exhibits K, K-1) of the Land Evaluation Party of CENRO and PENRO, specifically conducted by CENRO Chief of Survey Unit Engr. Celso Mayol and the Chief of the Land Evaluation Party Anastacio Cabalejo and Forester Justicio Nahid (Exhibits L, L-1), the relocation survey and map prepared by Engineer Icoy are simply undeserving of any weight. DENR-7 Regional Executive Director Jeremias Dolino and Director Estanislao Galano of the Regional Management Services of DENR-7, themselves, admitted that the task of determining whether a parcel of land is within the alienable and disposable area of the public domain falls within the Land Evaluation Party of the Forest Management Services of CENRO and PENRO of the DENR. In this case, the CENRO/PENRO Land Evaluation Party headed by Forester Anastacio Cabalejo, together with the Chief of the Survey Unit of CENRO, Engr. Celso Mayol, actually conducted a segregation survey of Cadastral Lot 18590 on November 4, 1995 to determine the alienable and disposable portion of Cadastral Lot 18590 and on the ground that they located three (3) Forest Reserve (FR) monuments marked as FR 67, FR 69 and FR 70. Thus, after the said verification survey, a survey plan was prepared by Engr. Celso Mayol and at the back portion thereof, he certified to the following, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The [CENRO Certificate], having been issued by the proper government officers tasked with the duty of certifying as to land classifications in the region, the same should be given weight and believed, especially so that the results of the actual ground survey of November 4, 1996 were re-verified and re-checked upon the order of PENRO Isabelo Montejo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>The CENRO Certificate relied on by the respondents and given much weight by the RTC reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>Republic of the Philippines <br>Department of Environment and Natural Resources <br>COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES OFFICE <br>Cebu City</center> <br>CENRO, Cebu City/Lands Verification <br>CARMELINA CUIZON, et al.

The Public Land Act or Commonwealth Act No. 141, until this day, is the existing general law governing the classification and disposition of lands of the public domain, except for timber and mineral lands. “Under the <i>Regalian</i> doctrine embodied in our Constitution, land that has not been acquired from the government, either by purchase, grant, or any other mode recognized by law, belongs to the State as part of the public domain.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Thus, it is indispensable for a person claiming title to a public land to show that his title was acquired through such means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1073,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 48.

The applicant for land registration must prove that the DENR Secretary had approved the land classification and released the land of the public domain as alienable and disposable, and that the land subject of the application for registration falls within the approved area per verification through survey by the PENRO or CENRO. In addition, the applicant for land registration must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records. These facts must be established to prove that the land is alienable and disposable</b>. Respondent failed to do so because the certifications presented by respondent do not, by themselves, prove that the land is alienable and disposable. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote><br>Although the survey and certification were done in accordance with Forestry Administrative Order No. 4-642, issued by the then Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources declaring certain portions of the public domain situated in Cebu City as alienable and disposable, an actual copy of such classification, certified as true by the legal custodian of the official records, was not presented in evidence. This was a crucial mistake. What was presented was the certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of Nicomedes R. Armilla, the Land Evaluation Party Coordinator, that the Cebu CENRO had on file a certified photocopy of the administrative order.
