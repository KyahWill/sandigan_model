No. 00-5-03-SC dated September 28, 2004, which became effective on October 15, 2004, this judgment of the Court of Appeals may be appealed to the Supreme Court by notice of appeal, filed with the Clerk of Court of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, the instant appeal.<br><br>Accused-appellant asserts in his appeal

in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>All these elements were established beyond reasonable doubt in the cases against accused-appellant.&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses consistently and categorically testified that pursuant to a search warrant duly issued by a judge, they found and seized from accused-appellant’s house and actual possession a brick of marijuana leaves and heat-sealed sachets of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>SPO1 Carrera related before the RTC how they secured a Search and Seizure Warrant for accused-appellant’s house, how the Search and Seizure Warrant was implemented, who inventoried the dangerous drugs and paraphernalia confiscated from accused-appellant, and to whom said confiscated items were submitted for forensic examination.<br><br>Corroborating SPO1 Carrera’s testimony was Kagawad Udani who personally witnessed the execution of the Search and Seizure Warrant at accused-appellant’s house.&nbsp; Kagawad Udani

the brick of marijuana leaves found in the bedroom of accused-appellant’s house.<br><br>In contrast, accused-appellant only proffered the defenses of denial and frame-up, that the dangerous drugs and paraphernalia were planted by the police officers.&nbsp; However, other than accused-appellant's bare allegations, there is no other evidence on record to corroborate his version of the events that transpired at his house on July 13, 2000.&nbsp; “[D]enial as a rule is a weak form of defense, particularly when it is not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; The defense of denial or frame-up, like alibi, has been invariably viewed by the courts with disfavor for it can just as easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Moreover, “in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, credence is given to prosecution witnesses who are

witnesses, particularly, as to how the door of the house was opened and who actually witnessed the search conducted in the bedroom of the house.&nbsp; These alleged inconsistencies pertain to minor details and are so inconsequential that they do not in any way affect the credibility of the witnesses nor detract from the established fact of illegal possession of a brick of marijuana leaves, sachets of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, and paraphernalia by accused-appellant, without authorization or prescription.&nbsp; We have previously held that “discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses referring to minor details, and not in actuality touching upon the central fact of the crime, do not impair their credibility.&nbsp; Testimonies of witnesses need only corroborate each other on important and relevant details concerning the principal occurrence.”&nbsp; In fact, “such minor inconsistencies may even serve to strengthen the witnesses’ credibility as they negate any suspicion that the testimonies have been rehearsed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In a prosecution for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Law, a case becomes “a contest of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies. When it comes to credibility, the trial court's assessment deserves great weight, and is even conclusive and binding, if not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence.&nbsp; The reason is obvious.&nbsp; Having the full opportunity to observe directly the witnesses' deportment and manner of testifying, the trial court is in a better position than the appellate court to evaluate testimonial evidence properly.&nbsp; The rule finds an even more stringent application where the said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>We find no cogent reason herein to differ from the findings and conclusion of the RTC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Sections 8 and 16, in relation to Section 20, of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 8. <i>Possession or Use of Prohibited Drugs</i>. — The penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall possess or use any prohibited drug subject to the provisions of Section 20 hereof.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 16. <i>Possession or Use of Regulated Drugs.</i> — The penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos shall be imposed upon any person who shall possess or use any regulated drug without the corresponding license or prescription, subject to the provisions of Section 20 hereof.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 20.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Application of Penalties, Confiscation and Forfeiture of the Proceeds or Instruments of the Crime</span>. — The penalties for offenses under Sections 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II and Sections 14, 14-A, 15 and 16 of Article III of this Act shall be applied if the dangerous drugs involved is in any of the following quantities:<br><br>1. 40 grams or more of opium;<br><br>2. 40 grams or more of morphine;<br><br>3. 200 grams or more of shabu or methylamphetamine hydrochloride;<br><br>4. 40 grams or more of heroin;<br><br>5. 750 grams or more of Indian hemp or marijuana;<br><br>6. 50 grams or more of marijuana resin or marijuana resin oil;<br><br>7. 40 grams or more of cocaine or cocaine hydrocholoride; or<br><br>8.
