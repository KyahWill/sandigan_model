This was docketed as Civil Case No. CBB-13447.<br><br>CBIC, in its Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> said that Cebu Shipyard’s complaint states no cause of action.&nbsp; CBIC alleged that the surety bond was issued by its agent, Quinain, in excess of his authority.&nbsp; CBIC claimed that Cebu Shipyard should have doubted the authority of Quinain to issue the surety bond based on the following:<br><br><ol><li> The nature of the bond undertaking (guarantee payment), and the amount involved.<br><br></li><li>The surety bond could only be issued in favor of the Department of Public Works and Highways, as stamped on the upper right portion of the face of the bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp;

CBIC also averred that Cebu Shipyard’s claim had already prescribed as the endorsement that extended the surety bond’s expiry date, was not reported to CBIC.&nbsp; Finally, CBIC asseverated that if it were held to be liable, its liability should be limited to the face value of the bond and not for exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, and costs of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, CBIC filed a Motion to Admit Cross and Third Party Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> against Unimarine, as cross defendant;

He further denied having any participation in the Indemnity Agreement executed in favor of CBIC, and alleged that his signature therein was forged, as he neither signed it nor appeared before the Notary Public who acknowledged such undertaking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Various witnesses were presented by the parties during the course of the trial of the case.&nbsp; Myrna Obrinaga testified for Cebu Shipyard.&nbsp; She was the Chief Accountant in charge of the custody of the documents of the company.&nbsp; She corroborated Cebu Shipyard’s allegations and produced in court the documents to support Cebu Shipyard’s claim.&nbsp; She also testified that while it was true that the proceeds of the sale of Unimarine’s vessel, M/V Headline, were assigned to Cebu Shipyard, nothing was turned over to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Paul Rodriguez admitted that Unimarine failed to pay Cebu Shipyard for the repairs it did on M/V Pacific Fortune, despite the extensions granted to Unimarine.&nbsp;

Paul Rodriguez also alleged to not having noticed the limitation “Valid only in favor of DPWH” stamped on the surety bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; However, Paul Rodriguez did not contradict the fact that Unimarine failed to pay Cebu Shipyard its obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>CBIC presented Dakila Rianzares, the Senior Manager of its Bonding Department.&nbsp; Her duties included the evaluation and approval of all applications for and reviews of bonds issued by their agents, as authorized under the Special Power of Attorney and General Agency Contract of CBIC.&nbsp; Rianzares testified that she only learned of the existence of CBIC Surety Bond No. G (16) 29419 when she received the summons for this case.&nbsp; Upon investigation, she found out that the surety bond was not reported to CBIC by Quinain, the issuing agent, in violation of their General Agency Contract, which provides that all bonds issued by the agent be reported to CBIC’s office within one week from the date of issuance.&nbsp; She further stated that the surety bond issued in favor of Unimarine was issued beyond Quinain’s authority.&nbsp; Rianzares added that she was not aware that an endorsement pertaining to the surety bond was also issued by Quinain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>After the trial, the RTC was faced with the lone issue of whether or not CBIC was liable to Cebu Shipyard based on Surety Bond No. G (16) 29419.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On February 10, 1997, the RTC rendered its Decision, the<i> fallo</i> of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff Cebu Shipyard &amp;

Ordering the defendants Unimarine Shipping Lines, Incorporated, Country Bankers Insurance Corporation and Plaridel Surety and Insurance Corporation to pay plaintiff jointly and severally the amount of P4,620,000.00 equivalent to the value of the surety bonds;<br><br>2. Ordering further defendant Unimarine to pay plaintiff the amount of P259,458.00 to complete its entire obligation of P4,859,458.00;<br><br>3. To pay plaintiff jointly and severally the amount of P100,000.00 in attorney’s fees and litigation expenses;<br><br>4.

It argued that the Special Power of Attorney granted to Quinain clearly set forth the extent and limits of his authority with regard to businesses he can transact for and in behalf of CBIC.&nbsp; CBIC added that it was incumbent upon Cebu Shipyard to inquire and look into the power of authority conferred to Quinain.&nbsp; CBIC said:<br><br><blockquote>The authority to bind a principal as a guarantor or surety is one of those powers which requires a Special Power of Attorney pursuant to Article 1878 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; <b>Such power could not be simply assumed or inferred from the mere existence of an agency.</b>&nbsp; A person who enters into a contract of suretyship with an agent without confirming the extent of the latter’s authority does so at his peril. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote><br>CBIC claims that the foregoing is true even if Quinain was granted the authority to transact in the business of insurance in general, as <b>“the authority to bind the principal in a contract of suretyship could nonetheless never be presumed.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, CBIC claims, that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]hird persons seeking to hold the principal liable for transactions entered into by an agent should establish the following, in case the same is controverted:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">6.6.1.&nbsp; The fact or existence of the agency.<br>6.6.2.&nbsp; The nature and extent of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></div></blockquote><br>To go a little further, CBIC said that the correct Civil Code provision to apply in this case is Article 1898.&nbsp; CBIC asserts that “Cebu Shipyard was charged with knowledge of the extent of the authority conferred on Mr. Quinain by its failure to perform due diligence investigations.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Cebu Shipyard, in its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> first assailed the propriety of the petition for raising factual issues.&nbsp; In support, Cebu Shipyard claimed that the Court of Appeals’ application of Article 1911 of the Civil Code was founded on findings of facts that CBIC now disputes.&nbsp; Thus, the question is not purely of law.<br><br><center><i>Discussion</i><br></center><br>The fact that Quinain was an agent of CBIC was never put in issue.&nbsp; What has always been debated by the parties is the extent of authority or, at the very least, apparent authority, extended to Quinain by CBIC to transact insurance business for and in its behalf.<br><br>In a contract of agency, a person, the agent, binds himself to represent another, the principal, with the latter’s consent or authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp;

The Court of Appeals agreed that CBIC could not be permitted to abandon its obligation especially since third persons had relied on Quinain’s representations.&nbsp; It based its decision on Article 1911 of the Civil Code and found CBIC to have been negligent and less than prudent in conducting its insurance business for its failure to supervise and monitor the acts of its agents, to regulate the distribution of its insurance forms, and to devise schemes to prevent fraudulent misrepresentations of its agents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><b>This Court does not agree. </b> Pertinent to this case are the following provisions of the Civil Code:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 1898</b>.
