(EPCIB), George L. Go and the individual shareholders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of Bankard, Inc. (Bankard) for the sale to RCBC of 226,460,000 shares (Subject Shares) of Bankard, constituting 67% of the latter’s capital stock. After completing payment of the contract price (P1,786,769,400), the corresponding deeds of sale over the subject shares were executed in January 2001.<br><br>The dispute between the parties arose sometime in May 2003 when RCBC informed EPCIB and the other selling shareholdersof an overpayment of the subject shares, claiming there was an overstatement of valuation of accounts amounting to P478 million and that the sellers violated their warrantyunder Section 5(g)of the SPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>As no settlement was reached, RCBC commenced arbitration proceedings with the ICC-ICA in accordance with Section 10 of the SPA which states:<br><br><blockquote>Section 10. <b><u>Arbitration</u></b><br><br>Should there be any dispute arising between the parties relating to this Agreement including the interpretation or performance hereof which cannot be resolved by agreement of the parties within fifteen (15) days after written notice by a party to another, such matter shall then be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in force as of the time of arbitration, by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such rules. The venue of arbitration shall be in Makati City, Philippines and the arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in the English language. Substantive aspects of the dispute shall be settled by applying the laws of the Philippines. The decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and the expenses of arbitration (including without limitation the award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party) shall be paid as the arbitrators shall determine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>In its Request for Arbitration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated May 12, 2004, Claimant RCBC charged Bankard with deviating from and contravening generally accepted accounting principles and practices, due to which the financial statements of Bankard prior to the stock purchase were far from fair and accurate, and resulted in the overpayment of P556 million. For this violation of sellers’representations and warranties under the SPA, RCBC sought its rescission, as well as payment of actual damages in the amount of P573,132,110, legal interest on the purchase price until actual restitution, moral damages and litigation and attorney’s fees, with alternative prayer for award of damages in the amount of at least P809,796,082 plus legal interest.<br><br>In their Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> EPCIB, Go and the other selling individual shareholders (Respondents) denied RCBC’s allegations contending that RCBC’s claim is one for overpayment or price reduction under Section 5(h) of the SPA which is already time-barred, the remedy of rescission is unavailable, and even assuming that rescission is permitted by the SPA, RCBC failed to file its claim within a reasonable time. They further asserted that RCBC is not entitled to its alternative prayer for damages, being guilty of laches and failing to set out the details of the breach as required under Section 7 of the SPA. A counterclaim for litigation expenses and costs of arbitration in the amount of US$300,000, as well as moral and exemplary damages, was likewise raised by the Respondents.<br><br>RCBC submitted a Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to the aforesaid Answer.<br><br>Subsequently, the Arbitration Tribunal was constituted. Mr. Neil Kaplan was nominated by RCBC; Justice Santiago M. Kapunan (a retired Member of this Court) was nominated by the Respondents; and Sir Ian Barker was appointed by the ICC-ICA as Chairman.<br><br>On August 13, 2004, the ICC-ICA informed the parties that they are required to pay US$350,000 as advance on costs pursuant to Article 30 (3) of the ICC Rules of Arbitration (ICC Rules). RCBC paid its share of US$107,000, the balance remaining after deducting payments of US$2,500 and US$65,000 it made earlier. Respondents’ share of the advance on costs was thus fixed at US$175,000.<br><br>Respondents filed an Application for Separate Advances on Costs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated September 17, 2004 under Article 30(2) of the ICC Rules, praying that the ICC fix separate advances on the cost of the parties’ respective claims and counterclaims, instead of directing them to share equally on the advance cost of Claimant’s (RCBC) claim. Respondents deemed this advance cost allocation to be proper, pointing out that the total amount of RCBC’s claim is substantially higher – more than 40 times –the total amount of their counterclaims, and that it would be unfair to require them to share in the costs of arbitrating what is essentially a price issue that is now time-barred under the SPA.<br><br>On September 20, 2004, the ICC-ICAinformed Respondents that their application for separate advances on costs was premature pending the execution of the Terms of Reference (TOR).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The TOR was settled by the parties and signed by the Chairman and Members of the Arbitral Tribunal by October 11, 2004. On December 3, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the ICC-ICA denied the application for separate advances on costs and invited anew the Respondents to pay its share in the advance on costs.However, despite reminders from the ICC-ICA, Respondents refused to pay their share in the advance cost fixed by the ICC-ICA. On December 16, 2004, the ICC-ICA informed the parties that if Respondents still failed to pay its share in the advance cost, it would apply Article 30(4) of the ICC Rules and request the Arbitration Tribunal to suspend its work and set a new time limit, and if such requested deposit remains unpaid at the expiry thereof, the counterclaims would be considered withdrawn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In a fax-letter dated January 4, 2005, the ICC-ICA invited RCBC to pay the said amount in substitution of Respondents.It also granted an extension until January 17, 2005 within which to pay the balance of the advance cost (US$175,000). RCBC replied that it was not willing to shoulder the share of Respondents in the advance on costs but nevertheless requested for a clarification as to the effect of such refusal to substitute for Respondents’ share.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On March 10, 2005, the ICC-ICA instructed the Arbitration Tribunal to suspend its work and granted the parties a final time-limit of 15 days to pay the balance of the advance on costs, failing which the claims shall be considered withdrawn, without prejudice to their reintroduction at a later date in another proceeding. The parties were advised that if any of them objects to the measure, it should make a request in writing within such period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> For the same reason of non-receipt of the balance of the advance cost, the ICC-ICA issued Procedural Order No. 3 for the adjournment of the substantive hearings and granting the Respondents a two-month extension within which to submit their brief of evidence and witnesses.<br><br>RCBC objected to the cancellation of hearings, pointing out that Respondents have been given ample time and opportunity to submit their brief of evidence and prepare for the hearings and that their request for postponement serves no other purpose but to delay the proceedings. It alleged that Respondents’ unjustified refusal to pay their share in the advance on costs warrants a ruling that they have lost standing to participate in the proceedings. It thus prayed that Respondents be declared as in default, the substantive hearings be conducted as originally scheduled, and RCBC be allowed to submit rebuttal evidence and additional witness statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On December 15, 2005, the ICC-ICA notified the parties of its decision to increase the advances on costs from US$350,000 to US$450,000 subject to later readjustments, and again invited the Respondents to pay the US$100,000 increment within 30 days from notice. Respondents, however, refused to pay the increment, insisting that RCBC should bear the cost of prosecuting its own claim and that compelling the Respondents to fund such prosecution is inequitable. Respondents reiterated that it was willing to pay the advance on costs for their counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On December 27, 2005, the ICC-ICA advised that it was not possible to fix separate advances on costs as explained in its December 3, 2004 letter, and again invited Respondents to pay their share in the advance on costs.<br><br>Respondents’ response contained in the letter dated January 6, 2006 was still the same: it was willing to pay only the separate advance on costs of their counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In view of Respondents’ continuing refusal to pay its equal share in the advanceon costs and increment, RCBC wrote the ICC-ICA stating that the latter should compel the Respondents to pay as otherwise RCBC will be prejudiced and the inaction of the ICC-ICA and the Arbitration Tribunal will detract from the effectiveness of arbitration as a means of settling disputes. In accordance with Article 30(4) of the ICC Rules, RCBC reiterated its request to declare the Respondents as in default without any personality to participate in the proceedings not only with respect to their counterclaims but also to the claim of RCBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Chairman Ian Barker, in a letter dated January 25, 2006, stated in part:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>2. <b>The Tribunal has no power under the ICC Rules to order the Respondents to pay the advance on costs sought by the ICC or to give the Claimant any relief against the Respondents’ refusal to pay</b>. The ICC Rules differ from, for example, the Rules of the LCIA (Article 24.3) which enables a party paying the share of costs which the other party has refused to pay, to recover “<i>that amount as a debt immediately due from the defaulting party.”</i><br><br>3. The only sanction under the ICC Rules is contained within Article 30 (4). Where a request for an advance on costs has not been complied with, after consultation with the Tribunal, the Secretary-General may direct the Tribunal to suspend its work. After expiry of a time limit, all claims and counterclaims are then considered as withdrawn. This provision cannot assist a Claimant who is anxious to litigate its claim. Such a Claimant has to pay the sums requested (including the Respondents’ share) if it wishes the arbitration to proceed.<br><br>4. <b>It may be possible for a Claimant in the course of the arbitral hearing (or whenever costs are being considered by the Tribunal) to make submissions based on the failure of the Respondents to pay their share of the costs advance.What relief, if any, would have to be then determined by the Tribunal after having heard submissions from the Respondents.</b><br><br>5. I should be pleased if the Claimant will advise the Tribunal of its intention in relation to the costs advance. If the costs are not paid, the arbitration cannot proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>RCBC paid the additional US$100,000 under the second assessment to avert suspension of the Arbitration Tribunal’s proceedings.<br><br>Upon the commencement of the hearings, the Arbitration Tribunal decided that hearings will be initially confined to issues of liability (<i>liability phase</i>) while the substantial issues will be heard on a later date (<i>quantum phase</i>).<br><br>Meanwhile, EPCIB’s corporate name was officially changed to Banco De Oro (BDO)-EPCIB after its merger with BDO was duly approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As such, BDO assumed all the obligations and liabilities of EPCIB under the SPA.<br><br>On September 27, 2007, the Arbitration Tribunal rendered a Partial Award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (First Partial Award) in ICC-ICA Case No. 13290/MS/JB/JEM, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>15 AWARD AND DIRECTIONS</b><br><br>15.1 The Tribunal makes the following declarations by way of Partial Award:<br><br><table width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">(a) </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">The Claimant’s claim is not time-barred under the provisions of this SPA. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(b)</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The Claimant is not estopped by its conduct or the equitable doctrine of laches from pursuing its claim.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(c) </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">As detailed in the Partial Award, the Claimant has established the following breaches by the Respondents of clause 5(g) of the SPA:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">i) </div></td> <td width="85%"><div align="JUSTIFY">the assets, revenue and net worth of Bankard were overstated by reason of its policy on and recognition of Late Payment Fees;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">ii) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">reported receivables were higher than their realisable values by reason of the ‘bucketing’ method, thus overstating Bankard’s assets; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">iii)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">the relevant Bankard statements were inadequate and misleading in that their disclosures caused readers to be misinformed about Bankard’s accounting policies on revenue and receivables.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(d)</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Subject to proof of loss the Claimant is entitled to damages for the foregoing breaches.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(e) </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">The Claimant is not entitled to rescission of the SPA.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(f) </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">All other issues, including any issue relating to costs, will be dealt with in a further or final award.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>15.2 A further Procedural Order will be necessary subsequent to the delivery of this Partial Award to deal with the determination of quantum and in particular, whether there should be an Expert appointed by the Tribunal under Article 20(4) of the ICC Rules to assist the Tribunal in this regard.<br><br>15.3 This Award is delivered by a majority of the Tribunal (Sir Ian Barker and Mr. Kaplan).

Case No. M-6046 confirming the First Partial Award and denying Respondents’ separate motions to vacate and to suspend and inhibit Barker and Kaplan. Respondents’ motion for reconsideration was likewise denied. Respondents directly filed with this Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, docketed as <b>G.R. No. 182248</b> and entitled<i> Equitable PCI Banking Corporation v. RCBC Capital Corporation.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In our Decision dated December 18, 2008, we denied the petition and affirmed the RTC’s ruling confirming the First Partial Award.<br><br>On January 18, 2008, the Arbitration Tribunal set a timetable for the filing of submission by the parties on whether it should issue a Second Partial Award in respect of the Respondents’ refusal to pay an advance on costs to the ICC-ICA.<br><br>In compliance, RCBC filed on February 7, 2008an Application for Reimbursement of Advance on Costs Paid, praying for the issuance of a partial award directing the Respondents to reimburse its payment in the amount of US$290,000 representing Respondents’ share in the Advance on Costs and to consider Respondents’ counterclaim for actual damages in the amount of US$300,000, and moral and exemplary damages as withdrawn for their failure to pay their equal share in the advance on costs. RCBC invoked the plain terms of Article 30 (2) and (3) to stress the liability of Respondents to share equally in paying the advance on costs where the Arbitration Tribunal has fixed the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, filed their Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to the said application alleging that the Arbitration Tribunal has lost its objectivity in an unnecessary litigation over the payment of Respondents’ share in the advance costs. They pointed out that RCBC’s letter merely asked that Respondents be declared as in default for their failure to pay advance costs but the Arbitration Tribunal, while denying the request offered an alternative to RCBC: a Partial Award for Respondents’ share in the advance costs even if it was clear from the language of RCBC’s December 11, 2007 letter that it had no intention of litigating for the advance costs. Chairman Barker, after ruling earlier that it cannot grant RCBC’s request to declare the Respondents as having no right to participate in the proceedings concerning the claim, interpreted RCBC’s letter as an application for the Arbitration Tribunal to issue a partial award in respect of such refusal of Respondents to pay their share in the advance on costs, and subsequently directed the parties to make submissions on the matter. Aside from violating their right to due process and to be heard by an impartial tribunal, Respondents also argued that in issuing the award for advance cost, the Arbitration Tribunal decided an issue beyond the terms of the TOR.<br><br>Respondents also emphasized that the parties agreed on a two-part arbitration: the first part of the Tribunal’s proceedings would determine Respondents’ liability, if any, for alleged violation of Section 5(g) and (h) of the SPA; and the second part of the proceedings would determine the amounts owed by one party to another as a consequence of a finding of liability or lack thereof. An award for “reimbursement of advances for costs” clearly falls outside the scope of either proceedings. Neither can the Tribunal justify such proceedings under Article 23 of the ICC Rules (Conservatory and Interim Measures) because that provision does not contemplate an award for the reimbursement of advance on costs in arbitration cases. Respondents further asserted that since the advances on costs have been paid by the Claimant (RCBC), the main claim and counterclaim may both be heard by the Arbitration Tribunal.<br><br>In his letter dated March 13, 2008, Chairman Barker advised the parties, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>The Tribunal acknowledges the Respondents’ response to the Claimant’s application for a Partial Award, based on the Respondents’ failure to pay their share of the costs, as requested by the ICC.<br><br></li><li><b>The Tribunal notes that neither party has referred to an article by Mat[t]hew Secomb on this very subject which appears in the ICC Bulletin Vol. 14 No.1 (Spring 2003)</b>. To assist both sides and to ensure that the Tribunal does not consider material on which the parties have not been given an opportunity to address, I attach a copy of this article, which also contains reference to other scholarly works on the subject.<br><br></li><li>The Tribunal will give each party seven days within which to submit further written comments as a consequence of being alerted to the above authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Additional emphasis supplied)</li></ol></blockquote><br>The parties complied by submitting their respective comments.<br><br>RCBC refuted Respondents’ allegation of partiality on the part of Chairman Barker and reiterated the prayer in its application for reimbursement of advance on costs paid to the ICC-ICA. RCBC contended <i>that based on Mr. Secomb’s article</i>, whether the “contractual” or “provisional measures” approach is applied, the Arbitration Tribunal is vested with jurisdiction and authority to render an award with respect to said reimbursement of advance cost paid by the non-defaulting party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, maintained that RCBC’s application for reimbursement of advance cost has no basis under the ICC Rules. They contended that no manifest injustice can be inferred from an act of a party paying for the share of the defaulting party as this scenario is allowed by the ICC Rules. Neither can a partial award for advance cost be justified under the “contractual approach” since the matter of costs for arbitration is between the ICC and the parties, not the Arbitration Tribunal and the parties. An arbitration tribunal can issue decisions on costs only for those costs not fixed by the ICC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Respondents reiterated their position that Article 30(3) envisions a situation whereby a party would refuse to pay its share on the advance on costs and provides a remedy therefor – the other party “shall be free to pay the whole of the advance on costs.” Such party’s reimbursement for payments of the defaulting party’s share depends on the final arbitral award where the party liable for costs would be determined. This is the only remedy provided by the ICC Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 2008, the Arbitration Tribunal rendered the Second Partial Award,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">7 </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>AWARD</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">7.1</div></td> <td colspan="2"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Having read and considered the submissions of both parties, the Tribunal AWARDS, DECLARES AND ORDERS as follows:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The Respondents are forthwith to pay to the Claimant the sum of US$290,000.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The Respondents’ counterclaim is to be considered as withdrawn.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(c) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">All other questions, including interest and costs, will be dealt with in a subsequent award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The above partial award was received by RCBC and Respondents on June 12, 2008.<br><br>On July 11, 2008, EPCIB filed a Motion to Vacate Second Partial Award<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> in the Makati City RTC, Branch 148 (SP Proc. Case No. M-6046). On July 10, 2008, RCBC filed in the same court a Motion to Confirm Second Partial Award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>EPCIB raised the following grounds for vacating the Second Partial Award: (a) the award is void <i>ab initio</i> having been rendered by the arbitrators who exceeded their power or acted without it; and (b) the award was procured by undue means or issued with evident partiality or attended by misbehavior on the part of the Tribunal which resulted in a material prejudice to the rights of the Respondents. EPCIB argued that there is no express agreement either in the SPA or the ICC Rules for such right of reimbursement. There is likewise no implied agreement because from the ICC Rules, the only inference is that the parties agreed to await the dispositions on costs liability in the Final Award, not before.<br><br>On the ruling of the Arbitration Tribunal that Respondents’ application for costs are not counterclaims, EPCIB asserted that this is contrary to Philippine law as it is basic in our jurisdiction that counterclaims for litigation expenses, moral and exemplary damages are proper counterclaims, which rule should be recognized in view of Section 10 of the SPA which provides that “substantive aspects of the dispute shall be settled by applying the laws of the Philippines.” Finally, EPCIB takes issue with Chairman Barker’s interpretation of RCBC’s December 11, 2007 letter as an application for a partial award for reimbursement of the substituted payments. Such conduct of Chairman Barker is prejudicial and proves his evident partiality in favor of RCBC.<br><br>RCBC filed its Opposition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> asserting that the Arbitration Tribunal had jurisdiction to consider Respondents’ counterclaim as withdrawn, the same having been abandoned by not presenting any computation or substantiation by evidence, their only computation relates only to attorney’s fees which are simply cost of litigation properly brought at the conclusion of the arbitration. It also pointed out that the Arbitration Tribunal was empowered by the parties’ arbitral clause to determine the manner of payment of expenses of arbitration, and that the Second Partial Award was based on authorities and treatiseson the mandatory and contractual nature of the obligation to pay advances on costs.<br><br>In its Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> EPCIB contended that RCBC had the option to agree to its proposal for separate advances on costs but decided against it; RCBC’s act of paying the balance of the advance cost in substitution of EPCIB was for the purpose of having EPCIB defaulted and the latter’s counterclaim withdrawn. Having agreed to finance the arbitration until its completion, RCBC is not entitled to immediate reimbursement of the amount it paid in substitution of EPCIB under an interim award, as its right to a partial or total reimbursement will have to be determined under the final award. EPCIB asserted that the matter of reimbursement of advance cost paid cannot be said to have properly arisen during arbitration. EPCIB reiterated that Chairman Barker’s interpretation of RCBC’s December 11, 2007 letter as an application for interim award for reimbursement is tantamount to a promise that the award will be issued in due course.<br><br>After a further exchange of pleadings, and other motions seeking relief from the court in connection with the arbitration proceedings (quantum phase), the Makati City RTC, Branch 148 issued the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated June 24, 2009 confirming the Second Partial Award and denying EPCIB’s motion to vacate the same. Said court held that since the parties agreed to submit any dispute under the SPA to arbitration and to be bound by the ICC Rules, they are also bound to pay in equal shares the advance on costs as provided in Article 30 (2) and (3). It noted that RCBC was forced to pay the share of EPCIB in substitution of the latter to prevent a suspension of the arbitration proceedings, while EPCIB’s non-payment seems more like a scheme to delay such proceedings. On the Arbitration Tribunal’s ruling on EPCIB’s counterclaim, no error was committed in considering it withdrawn for failure of EPCIB to quantify and substantiate it with supporting evidence. As to EPCIB’s claim for attorney’s fees, the RTC agreed that these should be brought only at the close of arbitration.<br><br>EPCIB moved to reconsider the June 24, 2009 Order and for the voluntary inhibition of the Presiding Judge (Judge Oscar B.

Rule 19.36 of said Rules specified the conditions for the exercise of this Court’s discretionary review of the CA’s decision.<br><br><blockquote><b>Rule 19.36</b>. <i>Review discretionary.</i>—A review by the Supreme Court is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, which will be granted only for <b>serious and compelling reasons resulting in grave prejudice to the aggrieved party</b>.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The applicable standard for judicial review of arbitral awards in this jurisdiction is set forth in Rule 19.10 which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Rule 19.10</b>. <i>Rule on judicial review on arbitration in the Philippines</i>.--As a general rule, the court can only vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal upon a <b>clear showing</b> that the award suffers from <b>any of the infirmities or grounds for vacating an arbitral award under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876 or under Rule 34 of the Model Law</b> in a domestic arbitration, or for setting aside an award in an international arbitration under Article 34 of the Model Law, or for such other grounds provided under these Special Rules.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The court shall not set aside or vacate the award of the arbitral tribunal merelyon the ground that the arbitral tribunal committed errors of fact, or of law, or of fact and law, as the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the arbitral tribunal. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The above rule embodied the stricter standard in deciding appeals from arbitral awards established by jurisprudence. In the case of <i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>As a rule, the award of an arbitrator cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or as to the facts.Courts are without power to amend or overrule merely because of disagreement with matters of law or facts determined by the arbitrators.They will not review the findings of law and fact contained in an award, and will not undertake to substitute their judgment for that of the arbitrators, since any other rule would make an award the commencement, not the end, of litigation.Errors of law and fact, or an erroneous decision of matters submitted to the judgment of the arbitrators, are insufficient to invalidate an award fairly and honestly made. Judicial review of an arbitration is, thus, more limited than judicial review of a trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></blockquote><br>Accordingly, we examine the merits of the petition before us solely on the statutory ground raised for vacating the Second Partial Award: evident partiality, pursuant to Section 24 (b) of the Arbitration Law (RA 876) and Rule 11.4 (b) of the Special ADR Rules.<br><br><center><b><i>Evident Partiality</i></b></center><br>Evident partiality is not defined in our arbitration laws. As one of the grounds for vacating an arbitral award under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) in the United States (US), the term “encompasses both an arbitrator’s explicit bias toward one party and an arbitrator’s inferred bias when an arbitrator fails to disclose relevant information to the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>From a recent decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of the Court of Appeals of Oregon, we quote a brief discussion of the common meaning of evident partiality:<br><br><blockquote>To determine the meaning of “evident partiality,” we begin with the terms themselves. The common meaning of “partiality” is “the <b>inclination to favor one side</b>.” <i>Webster’s Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 1646 (unabridged ed 2002); <i>see also id.</i> (defining “partial” as “inclined to favor one party in a cause or one side of a question more than the other: biased, predisposed” (formatting in original)). “Inclination,” in turn, means “a particular disposition of mind or character : propensity, bent” or “a tendency to a particular aspect, state, character, or action.” <b>Id</b>. at 1143 (formatting in original); see also <i>id.</i> (defining “inclined” as “having inclination, disposition, or tendency”).<br><br>The common meaning of “evident” is “capable of being perceived esp[ecially] by sight : distinctly visible : being in evidence : discernable[;] * * * clear to the understanding : obvious, manifest, apparent.”Id. at 789 (formatting in original); <i>see also id</i>. (stating that synonyms of “evident” include “apparent, patent, manifest, plain, clear, distinct, obvious, [and] palpable” and that, “<b>[s]ince evident rather naturally suggests evidence, it may imply the existence of signs and indications that must lead to an identification or inference</b>” (formatting in original)). (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Evident partiality in its common definition thus implies “the existence of <i>signs and indications</i> that must lead to an identification or inference” of partiality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Despite the increasing adoption of arbitration in many jurisdictions, there seems to be no established standard for determining the existence of evident partiality. In the US, evident partiality “continues to be the subject of somewhat conflicting and inconsistent judicial interpretation when an arbitrator’s failure to disclose prior dealings is at issue.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>The first case to delineate the standard of evident partiality in arbitration proceedings was <i>Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> decided by the US Supreme Court in 1968. The Court therein addressed the issue of whether the requirement of impartiality applies to an arbitration proceeding. The plurality opinion written by Justice Black laid down the rule that the arbitrators must disclose to the parties “any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> and that underlying such standard is “the premise that any tribunal permitted by law to try cases and controversies not only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the appearance of bias.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In a separate concurring opinion, Justice White joined by Justice Marshall, remarked that “[t]he Court does not decide today that arbitrators are to be held to the standards of judicial decorum of Article III judges, or indeed of any judges.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> He opined that arbitrators should not automatically be disqualified from an arbitration proceeding because of a business relationship where both parties are aware of the relationship in advance, or where the parties are unaware of the circumstances but the relationship is trivial. However, in the event that the arbitrator has a “substantial interest” in the transaction at hand, such information must be disclosed.<br><br>Subsequent cases decided by the US Court of Appeals Circuit Courts adopted different approaches, given the imprecise standard of evident partiality in <i>Commonwealth Coatings.</i><br><br>In <i>Morelite Construction Corp. v. New York District Council Carpenters Benefit Funds,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court and remanded with instructions to vacate the arbitrator’s award, holding that the existence of a father-son relationship between the arbitrator and the president of appellee union provided strong evidence of partiality and was unfair to appellant construction contractor. After examining prior decisions in the Circuit, the court concluded that –<br><br><blockquote>x x x we cannot countenance the promulgation of a standard for partiality as insurmountable as “proof of actual bias” -- as the literal words of Section 10 might suggest. Bias is always difficult, and indeed often impossible, to “prove.” Unless an arbitrator publicly announces his partiality, or is overheard in a moment of private admission, it is difficult to imagine how “proof” would be obtained. Such a standard, we fear, occasionally would require that we enforce awards in situations that are clearly repugnant to our sense of fairness, yet do not yield “proof” of anything.<br><br>If <b>the standard of "appearance of bias" is too low for the invocation of <i>Section 10</i>, and "proof of actual bias" too high</b>, with what are we left? Profoundly aware of the competing forces that have already been discussed, we hold that <b>"evident partiality" within the meaning of 9 U.S.C. § 10 will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration</b>.x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Apperson v. Fleet Carrier Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> the Sixth Circuit agreed with the <i>Morelite </i>court’s analysis, and accordingly held that to invalidate an arbitration award on the grounds of bias, the challenging party must show that “a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial” to the other party to the arbitration.<br><br>This “myriad of judicial interpretations and approaches to evident partiality” resulted in a lack of a uniform standard, leaving the courts “to examine evident partiality on a case-by-case basis.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The case at bar does not present a non-disclosure issue but conduct allegedly showing an arbitrator’s partiality to one of the parties.<br><br>EPCIB/BDO, in moving to vacate the Second Partial Award claimed that the Arbitration Tribunal exceeded its powers in deciding the issue of advance cost not contemplated in the TOR, and that Chairman Barker acted with evident partiality in making such award. The RTC held that BDO failed to substantiate these allegations. On appeal, the CA likewise found that the Arbitration Tribunal did not go beyond the submission of the parties because the phrasing of the scope of the agreed issues in the TOR (“[t]he issues to be determined by the Tribunal are those issues arising from the said Request for Arbitration, Answer and Reply and such other issues as may properly arise during the arbitration”)is broad enough to accommodate a finding on the liability and the repercussions of BDO’s failure to share in the advances on costs. Section 10 of the SPA also gave the Arbitration Tribunal authority to decide how the costs should be apportioned between them.<br><br>However, the CA found factual support in BDO’s charge of partiality, thus:<br><br><blockquote>On the issue on evident partiality, the rationale in the American case of <i>Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co.</i> appears to be very prudent. In Commonwealth, the United States Supreme Court reasoned that courts “should…be even more scrupulous to safeguard the impartiality of arbitrators than judges, since the former have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts, and are not subject to appellate review” in general. This taken into account,<b> the Court applies the standard demanded of the conduct of magistrates by analogy</b>. After all, the ICC Rules require that an arbitral tribunal should act fairly and impartially. Hence, <b>an arbitrator’s conduct should be beyond reproach and suspicion. His acts should be free from the appearances of impropriety.</b><br><br>An examination of the circumstances claimed to be illustrative of Chairman Barker’s partiality is indicative of bias. Although RCBC had repeatedly asked for reimbursement and the withdrawal of BDO’s counterclaims prior to Chairman Barker’s December 18, 2007 letter, it is baffling why <b>it is only in the said letter that RCBC’s prayer was given a complexion of being an application for a partial award. To the Court, the said letter signaled a preconceived course of action that the relief prayed for by RCBC will be granted</b>.<br><br>That there was an action to be taken beforehand is confirmed by Chairman Barker’s furnishing the parties with a copy of the Secomb article.<b> This article ultimately favored RCBC by advancing its cause. Chairman Barker makes it appear that he intended good to be done in doing so but due process dictates the cold neutrality of impartiality</b>. This means that “it is not enough…[that] cases [be decided] without bias and favoritism. Nor is it sufficient that…prepossessions [be rid of].<br><br>[A]ctuations should moreover inspire that belief.” These put into the equation, the furnishing of the Secomb article further marred the trust reposed in Chairman Barker. The suspicion of his partiality on the subject matter deepened. Specifically, his act established that he had pre-formed opinions.<br><br>Chairman Barker’s providing of copies of the said text is easily interpretable that he had prejudged the matter before him. In any case, the Secomb article tackled bases upon which the Second Partial Award was founded. <b>The subject article reflected in advance the disposition of the ICC arbitral tribunal.</b> The award can definitely be viewed as an affirmation that the bases in the Secomb article were adopted earlier on. To the Court, actuations of arbitrators, like the language of judges, “must be guarded and measured lest the best of intentions be misconstrued.”<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>We affirm the foregoing findings and conclusion of the appellate court save for its reference to the <i>obiter</i> in <i>Commonwealth Coatings</i> that arbitrators are held to the same standard of conduct imposed on judges. Instead, the Court adopts the <i>reasonable impression of partiality</i> standard, which requires a showing that a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to the other party to the arbitration. Such interest or bias, moreover, “must be direct, definite and capable of demonstration rather than remote, uncertain, or speculative.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> When a claim of arbitrator’s evident partiality is made, “the court must ascertain from such record as is available whether the arbitrators’ conduct was so biased and prejudiced as to destroy fundamental fairness.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Applying the foregoing standard, we agree with the CA in finding that Chairman Barker’s act of furnishing the parties with copies of Matthew Secomb’s article, considering the attendant circumstances,is indicative of partiality such that a reasonable man would have to conclude that he was favoring the Claimant, RCBC. Even before the issuance of the Second Partial Award for the reimbursement of advance costs paid by RCBC, Chairman Barker exhibited strong inclination to grant such relief to RCBC, notwithstanding his categorical ruling that the Arbitration Tribunal “has no power <i>under the ICC Rules</i> to order the Respondents to pay the advance on costs sought by the ICC or to give the Claimantany relief against the Respondents’ refusal to pay.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>  That Chairman Barker was predisposed to grant relief to RCBC was shown by his act of interpreting RCBC’s letter, which merely reiterated its plea to declare the Respondents in default and consider all counterclaims withdrawn – as what the ICC Rules provide -- as an application to the Arbitration Tribunal to issue a partial award in respect of BDO’s failure to share in the advance costs. It must be noted that RCBC in said letter did not contemplate the issuance of a partial order, despite Chairman Barker’s previous letter which mentioned the possibility of granting relief upon the parties making submissions to the Arbitration Tribunal. Expectedly, in compliance with Chairman Barker’s December 18, 2007 letter, RCBC formally applied for the issuance of a partial award ordering BDO to pay its share in the advance costs.<br><br>Mr. Secomb’s article, “<i>Awards and Orders Dealing With the Advance on Costs in ICC Arbitration: Theoretical Questions and Practical Problems</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> specifically dealt with the situation when one of the parties to international commercial arbitration refuses to pay its share on the advance on costs. After a brief discussion of the provisions of ICC Rules dealing with advance on costs, which did not provide for issuance of a partial award to compel payment by the defaulting party, the author stated:<br><br><blockquote>4. As we can see, the Rules have certain mechanisms to deal with defaulting parties. Occasionally, however, parties have sought to use other methods to tackle the problem of a party refusing to pay its part of the advance on costs. These have included seeking an order or award from the arbitral tribunal condemning the defaulting party to pay its share of the advance on costs. Such applications are the subject of this article.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></blockquote><br>By furnishing the parties with a copy of this article, Chairman Barker practically armed RCBC with supporting legal arguments under the “contractual approach” discussed by Secomb. True enough, RCBC in its Application for Reimbursement of Advance Costs Paid utilized said approach as it singularly focused on Article 30(3)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> of the ICC Rules and fiercely argued that BDO was contractually bound to share in the advance costs fixed by the ICC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> But whether under the “contractual approach” or “provisional approach” (an application must be treated as an interim measure of protection under Article 23 [1] rather than enforcement of a contractual obligation), both treated in the Secomb article, RCBC succeeded in availing of a remedy which was not expressly allowed by the Rules but in practice has been resorted to by parties in international commercial arbitration proceedings. It may also be mentioned that the author, Matthew Secomb, is a member of the ICC Secretariat and the “Counsel in charge of the file”, as in fact he signed some early communications on behalf of the ICC Secretariat pertaining to the advance costs fixed by the ICC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> This bolstered the impression that Chairman Barker was predisposed to grant relief to RCBC by issuing a partial award.<br><br>Indeed, fairness dictates that Chairman Barker refrainfrom suggesting to or directing RCBC towards a course of action to advance the latter’s cause, by providing it with legal arguments contained in an article written by a lawyer who serves at the ICC Secretariat and was involved or had participation -- insofar as the actions or recommendations of the ICC -- in the case. Though done purportedly to assist both parties, Chairman Barker’s act clearly violated Article 15 of the ICC Rules declaring that “[i]n all cases, the Arbitral Tribunal shall act fairly and impartially and ensure that each party has a reasonable opportunity to present its case.” Having pre-judged the matter in dispute, Chairman Barker had lost his objectivity in the issuance of the Second Partial Award.<br><br>In fine, we hold that the CA did not err in concluding that the article ultimately favored RCBC as it reflected in advance the disposition of the Arbitral Tribunal, as well as “signalled a preconceived course of action that the relief prayed for by RCBC will be granted.” This conclusion is further confirmed by the Arbitral Tribunal’s pronouncements in its Second Partial Award which not only adopted the “contractual approach” but even cited Secomb’s article along with other references, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">6.1 </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">It appears to the Tribunal that the issue posed by this application is essentially a contractual one. x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">6.5 </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Matthew Secomb, considered these points in the article in 14 ICC Bulletin No. 1 (2003) which was sent to the parties.

Courts are generally without power to amend or overrule merely because of disagreement with matters of law or facts determined by the arbitrators. They will not review the findings of law and fact contained in an award, and will not undertake to substitute their judgment for that of the arbitrators. A contrary rule would make an arbitration award the commencement, not the end, of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> It is the finding of evident partiality which constitutes legal ground for vacating the Second Partial Award and not the Arbitration Tribunal’s application of the ICC Rules adopting the “contractual approach” tackled in Secomb’s article.<br><br>Alternative dispute resolution methods or ADRs – like arbitration, mediation, negotiation and conciliation – are encouraged by this Court.

But more important, since BOO had already paid P637,941,185.55 m manager's check, albeit under protest, and which payment was accepted by RCBC as full and complete satisfaction of the writ of execution, there is no more act to be enjoined.<br><br>Settled is the rule that injunctive reliefs are preservative remedies for the protection of substantive rights and interests.
