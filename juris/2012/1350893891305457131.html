However, the recorded total number of votes obtained by Ceron in written words and figures is fifty-six (56).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> There is therefore a discrepancy of six (6) votes between the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> and the written words and figures.

No. 07-4-15-SC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The election protest was dismissed for failure of the petition of Arcilla to “specifically state the total number of precincts of the x x x Barangay concerned,” as required under Section 11(d) of A.M.

Antonio (Antonio), in their capacity as members of the Board of Election Tellers (BET) of Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B of Barangay 201, Pasay City, filed a verified petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> with the COMELEC docketed as SPC No. 10-205 (BRGY). Valdez, Pauig and Antonio were the Chairman, Poll Clerk and Third Member, respectively, of the said BET.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> They alleged that on 17 November 2010 they received a letter from the winning Barangay Chairman of Barangay 201, Pasay City, inviting them to explain the discrepancy between the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> and the written words and figures pertaining to the number of votes received by Ceron in the Election Return for Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Valdez, Pauig and Antonio further alleged that upon reviewing the said Election Return, they discovered that they made an erroneous entry therein with respect to the total number of votes received by Ceron.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> They claimed that Valdez dictated the total number of votes received by each candidate, and that Pauig did not properly hear the dictation of the total number of votes received by Ceron possibly due to “too much noise created by the watchers inside and outside of the polling precinct.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, through honest mistake, Pauig recorded in written words and figures a total of 56 votes for Ceron, instead of the 50 votes dictated by Valdez corresponding to the total number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> recorded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Valdez, Pauig and Antonio prayed that the COMELEC direct the members of the BET of Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B and the members of the BBOC of Barangay 201, Pasay City to reconvene, in order for the BET to prepare a corrected Election Return for the said clustered precincts, and for the BBOC to prepare a corrected Statement of Votes by Precinct and a corrected Certificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of Winning Candidates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They further prayed that the COMELEC set aside the proclamation of Ceron as the sixth winning Barangay Kagawad, and proclaim Carla Canlas (Canlas) as the sixth winning Barangay Kagawad and Arcilla as the seventh winning Barangay Kagawad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On 20 January 2011, Arcilla filed an Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> to the petition of the members of the BET.

She reiterated that the issues raised in the petition were moot and academic, and further alleged that Valdez, Pauig and Antonio did not possess the requisite legal personality since they would not be affected nor stand to benefit from the resolution of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Furthermore, Ceron argued that the petition was filed beyond the period allowed by law for any alteration or correction in the election return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the COMELEC First Division</b><br></center><br>The COMELEC First Division promulgated on 1 July 2011 a Resolution in SPC No. 10-205 (BRGY).

Ceron argued that the proper procedure to resolve the dispute is for the COMELEC to order the opening of the ballot box to recount the votes cast, pursuant to Section 236 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 or the Omnibus Election Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This procedure is also mandated under Section 68 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Ceron further argued that it is improper to categorize the alleged error in the Election Return as a manifest error since this did not occur in the tabulation or tallying of the election returns during canvassing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The alleged error in the Election Return is not one of the instances of manifest error provided under Section 69 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Finally, Ceron argued that the dismissal of the election protest filed by Arcilla bars the resolution of the issues raised in the petition under the principle of <i>res judicata.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the COMELEC<span style="font-style: italic;"> En Banc</span></u></b></center><br>The COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> denied the Motion for Reconsideration of Ceron in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> promulgated on 11 October 2011.

The COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> observed that the error in the Election Return of Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B is evident to the eye, and a mere recounting of the number of <i>taras</i> reveals the disparity with the written words and figures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> explained the procedure in rectifying the manifest error in the said Election Return, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The error in the said Election Returns affects the computation of the total number of votes received by [Ceron] during the canvassing and eventually, the final result or the determination of the winning candidates. This is a clear case of manifest error.<br><br>However, to correct such error, there is no need to open the ballot box and recount the votes cast. The mistake in the Election Returns can be easily traced and there is no need to seek additional evidence to rectify such error. The expedient course of action is for COMELEC to direct the board of canvassers to reconvene and, after notice and hearing in accordance with Section 7, Rule 27 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, to effect the necessary corrections and on the basis thereof, proclaim the winning candidate. It has been ruled that in case of discrepancy, the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span>/tally would prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>The COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> ruled that the procedures under Section 236 of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 68 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030 are only applicable in the event that there is a discrepancy among the authentic copies of the same election returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>With respect to the application of the principle of<i> res judicata</i>, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> determined that there was no identity of parties in the election protest filed by Arcilla and the petition filed by the members of the BET.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Furthermore, the dismissal of the election protest was not based on merit but on technicality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Hence, this instant petition filed by Ceron assailing the Resolution promulgated by the COMELEC First Division on 1 July 2011 and the Resolution promulgated by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> on 11 October 2011.<br><br><center><u><b>The Issues</b></u></center><br><br>Ceron raises the following issues:<br><br>1.

The section states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 69. <i>Manifest Error</i>. - (a) Where it is clearly shown before proclamation that manifest errors were committed in the tabulation or tallying [of] election returns during the canvassing, the BBOC may <i>motu proprio</i>, or upon verified petition by any candidate, after due notice and hearing, correct the errors committed.<br><br>There is manifest error in the tabulation or tallying of the result during the canvassing when:<br><br>1) A copy of the election returns was tabulated more than once;<br><br>2) Two or more copies of the election returns for one precinct were tabulated;<br><br>3) There was a mistake in the copying of the figures from the election returns to the statement of votes;<br><br>4) Election returns from non-existent precincts were included in the canvass;<br><br>5) Election returns from precinct of one barangay were included in the canvass for another barangay; and<br><br>6) There was a mistake in the addition of the votes of any candidate.<br><br>(b) If the manifest error is discovered before proclamation, the BBOC shall promulgate an order in writing for the correction of the manifest error.

The appeal shall be heard and immediately decided by the Commission en banc.<br><br>(c) Manifest errors discovered after proclamation the same [sic] shall be filed by the board or any aggrieved party with the Commission.</blockquote><br>Similarly, Arcilla claims that the COMELEC may order the BBOC of Barangay 201, Pasay City to reconvene and make the proper correction in the subject Election Return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> He argues that the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> prevail in case of a discrepancy between the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> and the written words and figures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The applicable provision is Section 69(3) of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030 since the BBOC “should not have copied the figures from the election returns but should have given credit to the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span>, this being the prevailing rule in canvassing.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>This Court disagrees with Ceron and respondents as to the statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to this case. The applicable provisions are Section 216 of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 51 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030. Section 216 of the Omnibus Election Code outlines the procedure for alterations and corrections in the election returns, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 216. <i>Alterations and corrections in the election returns.</i> — Any correction or alteration made in the election returns by the board of election inspectors before the announcement of the results of the election in the polling place shall be duly initialed by all the members thereof. <br><br>After the announcement of the results of the election in the polling place has been made, the board of election inspectors shall not make any alteration or amendment in any of the copies of the election returns, unless so ordered by the Commission upon petition of the members of the board of election inspectors within five days from the date of the election or twenty-four hours from the time a copy of the election returns concerned is opened by the board of canvassers, whichever is earlier. The petition shall be accompanied by proof of service upon all candidates affected. If the petition is by all members of the board of election inspectors and the results of the election would not be affected by said correction and none of the candidates affected objects thereto, the Commission, upon being satisfied of the veracity of the petition and of the error alleged therein, shall order the board of election inspectors to make the proper correction on the election returns.<br><br>However, if a candidate affected by said petition objects thereto, whether the petition is filed by all or only a majority of the members of the board of election inspectors and the results of the election would be affected by the correction sought to be made, the Commission shall proceed summarily to hear the petition. If it finds the petition meritorious and there are no evidence or signs indicating that the identity and integrity of the ballot box have been violated, the Commission shall order the opening of the ballot box. After satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has also been duly preserved, the Commission shall order the recounting of the votes of the candidates affected and the proper corrections made on the election returns, unless the correction sought is such that it can be made without need of opening the ballot box. (<i>Sec. 169, 1978 EC</i>)<br></blockquote><br>Section 51 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030 states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 51. <i>Alterations and Corrections in the Election Returns.</i><br>— Any correction or alteration made on the election returns by the BET before the announcement of the results of the elections in the precinct shall be duly initialed by all the members thereof. <br><br>After the announcement of the results of the elections in the precinct, the BET shall not make any alteration or amendment in any copy of the election returns, unless so ordered by the Commission.</blockquote><br><br>Although Section 216 of the Omnibus Election Code refers to the Board of Election Inspectors, the provision is equally applicable to the BET. Section 51 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030, promulgated by the COMELEC<i> En Banc </i>for the conduct of the 25 October 2010 Synchronized Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections, adopts Section 216 of the Omnibus Election Code. Furthermore, the primary duties of the Board of Election Inspectors and the BET are identical. In the conduct of regular or special elections, Section 168(a) of the Omnibus Election Code provides that the Board of Election Inspectors shall “[c]onduct the voting and counting of votes in their respective polling places.” In the conduct of barangay elections, Section 40(2) of the Omnibus Election Code states that the BET “shall supervise and conduct the election in their respective polling places, count the votes and thereafter prepare a report in triplicate on a form prescribed by the Commission.”<br><br>The Court considers the verified petition as one filed pursuant to Section 216 of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 51 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9030. The verified petition was filed with the COMELEC by all the members of the BET after the announcement of the results of the election has been made in Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B. It seeks to correct the erroneous entry in the Election Return of Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B, particularly the written words and figures which do not correspond to the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span>. In the verified petition, Valdez, Pauig and Antonio, in their capacity as members of the BET, admitted that they made an erroneous entry in the said Election Return with respect to the total number of votes received by Ceron.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> They explained that through honest mistake, Pauig as the Poll Clerk recorded in written words and figures a total of fifty-six (56) votes for Ceron, instead of the 50 votes corresponding to the total number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> recorded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> They claimed that Pauig incorrectly heard the number of votes dictated by the Chairman of the BET possibly due to “too much noise created by the watchers inside and outside of the polling precinct.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In correcting the erroneous entry, the COMELEC need not order the opening of the ballot box for the purpose of recounting the votes of the candidates affected. Section 216 of the Omnibus Election Code dispenses with the requirement of opening the ballot box and conducting a recount of the ballots if “<b>the correction sought is such that it can be made without the need of opening the ballot box.</b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The Court observes that the discrepancy between the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> and the written words and figures is apparent on the face of the subject Election Return. The discrepancy can be corrected by the BET without the necessity of opening the ballot box. The correction can be carried out by recounting the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> in the Election Return and revising the written words and figures to conform to the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span>.<br><br>The correction of the discrepancy in the Election Return will therefore result in the deduction of six (6) votes from the total votes previously recorded for Ceron, particularly the previous 921 votes will be reduced to 915 votes. The resulting ranking of the three candidates affected, as correctly tabulated by the COMELEC First Division, will be as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="15%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>RANK</strong></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>NAME </strong></div></td> <td width="35%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>VOTES OBTAINED </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>6th </strong></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>CANLAS, Carla </strong></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>Nine Hundred Twenty (920)</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>7th </strong></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>ARCILLA, Romeo </strong></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"><strong>Nine Hundred Nineteen (919)</strong></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="15%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Dislodged </strong></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>CERON, Antonia <br> (previously proclaimed as 6th in rank) </strong></div></td> <td width="35%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>Nine Hundred Fifteen (915)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></strong></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Consequently, the previous proclamation of Ceron and Canlas as the sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) and seventh (7<sup>th</sup>) ranked Barangay Kagawads, respectively, must be annulled. After the BET has corrected the subject Election Return and the BBOC has corrected the corresponding Statement of Votes by Precinct, Canlas and Arcilla should be proclaimed as the duly elected sixth (6<sup>th</sup>) and seventh (7<sup>th</sup>) ranked Barangay Kagawads, respectively.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>Ceron further claims that the COMELEC does not have jurisdiction over the verified petition filed by Valdez, Pauig and Antonio in their capacity as members of the BET.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> According to Ceron, the Order of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 47, Pasay City in Case No. E-03-10 dismissing the election protest filed by Arcilla has attained finality and therefore constitutes <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Ceron avers that the issues raised in the verified petition were already raised in the election protest filed by Arcilla.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the COMELEC and Arcilla similarly argue that the dismissal of the election protest does not amount to <i>res judicata</i>. They claim that there is no identity of parties between the election protest and the verified petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> In addition, the dismissal of the election protest was not based on the merits but on technicality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the arguments of the COMELEC and Arcilla. The Order of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 47, Pasay City in Case No. E-03-10 does not constitute <i>res judicata.</i> Although the issue on the discrepancy between the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> and the written words and figures in the Election Return was raised both in the election protest and the verified petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> some of the requisites of <i>res judicata</i> are not present.<br><br>The doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> provides that “a final judgment or decree on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits and on all points and matters determined in the previous suit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The following are the requisites of r<span style="font-style: italic;">es judicata </span>as a bar by prior judgment: (1) finality of the former judgment; (2) the court which rendered the judgment had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be, between the first and second actions, identity of parties, subject matter and causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The third and fourth requisites of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> as a bar by prior judgment are not present in the case.<br><br>The Order of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 47, Pasay City in Case No. E-03-10 is not a judgment on the merits. The Order dismissed the election protest filed by Arcilla based on technicality for failure of his petition to “specifically state the total number of precincts of the x x x Barangay concerned,” as required under Section 11(d) of A.M. No. 07-4-15SC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Section 13(b) of A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC states that the court shall summarily dismiss an election protest if “[t]he petition is insufficient in form and content as required in Section 11 hereof.”<br><br>There is also an absence of identity of parties between the election protest filed by Arcilla and the verified petition filed by Valdez, Pauig and Antonio. Identity of parties exists “where the parties in both actions are the same, or there is privity between them, or they are successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The parties in the first and second actions are clearly not the same. There is also no privity between them and they are not successors-in-interest. The election protest was filed solely by Arcilla as a candidate in the 25 October 2010 Synchronized Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections, while the verified petition was filed by Valdez, Pauig and Antonio in their capacity as members of the BET of Clustered Precinct Nos. 844A and 844B of Barangay 201, Pasay City.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.
