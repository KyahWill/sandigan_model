(Goldline), of which he is an officer, is operating sixty (60) units of Goldline buses. That the Goldline buses are used in the operations of defendant company is obvious from Mr. Cheng’s admission. The Amended Articles of Incorporation of Gold Line Tours, Inc. disclose that the following persons are the original incorporators thereof: Antonio O. Ching, Maribel Lim Ching, witness William Ching, Anita Dy Ching and Zosimo Ching. (Rollo, pp. 105-106) We see no reason why defendant company would be using Goldline buses in its operations unless the two companies are actually one and the same.<br><br>Moreover, the name Goldline was added to defendant’s name in the Complaint. There was no objection from William Ching who could have raised the defense that Gold Line Tours, Inc. was in no way liable or involved. Indeed, it appears to this Court that rather than Travel &amp; Tours Advisers, Inc., it is Gold Line Tours, Inc., which should have been named party defendant.<br><br>Be that as it may, We concur in the trial court’s finding that the two companies are actually one and the same, hence the levy of the bus in question was proper.<br><br>WHEREFORE, for lack of merit, the petition is <i>DISMISSED</i> and the assailed Orders are <i>AFFIRMED</i>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote><br>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> which the CA denied on June 25, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal, in which petitioner faults the CA for holding that the RTC did not act without jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion in finding that petitioner and Travel &amp; Tours Advisers, Inc., the defendant in Civil Case No. 5917, were one and same entity, and for sustaining the propriety of the levy of the tourist bus with Plate No. NWW-883 in satisfaction of the writ of execution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, respondents filed in the RTC a motion to direct the sheriff to implement the writ of execution in view of the non-issuance of any restraining order either by this Court or the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> On February 23, 2007, the RTC granted the motion and directed the sheriff to sell the Goldline tourist bus with Plate No. NWW-883 through a public auction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Did the CA rightly find and conclude that the RTC did not gravely abuse its discretion in denying petitioner’s verified third-party claim?<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b><br></center><br>We find no reason to reverse the assailed CA decision.<br><br>In the order dated August 2, 2001, the RTC rendered its justification for rejecting the third-party claim of petitioner in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>The main contention of Third Party Claimant is that it is the owner of the Bus and therefore, it should not be seized by the sheriff because the same does not belong to the defendant Travel &amp; Tours Advises, Inc. (GOLDLINE) as the third party claimant and defendant are two separate corporation with separate juridical personalities. Upon the other hand, this Court had scrutinized the documents submitted by the Third party Claimant and found out that William Ching who claimed to be the operator of the Travel &amp; Tours Advisers, Inc. (GOLDLINE) is also the President/Manager and incorporator of the Third Party Claimant Goldline Tours Inc. and he is joined by his co-incorporators who are “Ching” and “Dy” thereby this Court could only say that these two corporations are one and the same corporations. This is of judicial knowledge that since Travel &amp; Tours Advisers, Inc. came to Sorsogon it has been known as GOLDLINE.<br><br>This Court is not persuaded by the proposition of the third party claimant that a corporation has an existence separate and/or distinct from its members insofar as this case at bar is concerned, for the reason that whenever necessary for the interest of the public or for the protection of enforcement of their rights, the notion of legal entity should not and is not to be used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime.<br><br>Apposite to the case at bar is the case of Palacio vs. Fely Transportation Co., L-15121, May 31, 1962, 5 SCRA 1011 where the Supreme Court held:<br><br><blockquote>“Where the main purpose in forming the corporation was to evade one’s subsidiary liability for damages in a criminal case, the corporation may not be heard to say that it has a personality separate and distinct from its members, because to allow it to do so would be to sanction the use of fiction of corporate entity as a shield to further an end subversive of justice (<i>La Campana Coffee Factory, et al. v. Kaisahan ng mga Manggagawa, etc., et al., L-5677, May 25, 1953)</i>. The Supreme Court can even substitute the real party in interest in place of the defendant corporation in order to avoid multiplicity of suits and thereby save the parties unnecessary expenses and delay. (<i>Alfonso vs. Villamor</i>, 16 Phil. 315).” <br></blockquote><br>This is what the third party claimant wants to do including the defendant in this case, to use the separate and distinct personality of the two corporation as a shield to further an end subversive of justice by avoiding the execution of a final judgment of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>As we see it, the RTC had sufficient factual basis to find that petitioner and Travel and Tours Advisers, Inc. were one and the same entity, specifically:– (a) documents submitted by petitioner in the RTC showing that William Cheng, who claimed to be the operator of Travel and Tours Advisers, Inc., was also the President/Manager and an incorporator of the petitioner; and (b) Travel and Tours Advisers, Inc. had been known in Sorsogon as Goldline. On its part, the CA cogently observed:<br><br><blockquote>As stated in the (RTC) decision <i>supra</i>, William Ching disclosed during the trial of the case that defendant Travel &amp; Tours Advisers, Inc. (Goldline), of which he is an officer, is operating sixty (60) units of Goldline buses. That the Goldline buses are used in the operations of defendant company is obvious from Mr. Cheng’s admission. The Amended Articles of Incorporation of Gold Line Tours, Inc. disclose that the following persons are the original incorporators thereof: Antonio O. Ching, Maribel Lim Ching, witness William Ching, Anita Dy Ching and Zosimo Ching. (Rollo, pp. 105-108) We see no reason why defendant company would be using Goldline buses in its operations unless the two companies are actually one and the same.<br><br>Moreover, the name Goldline was added to defendant’s name in the Complaint. There was no objection from William Ching who could have raised the defense that Gold Line Tours, Inc. was in no way liable or involved. Indeed it appears to this Court that rather than Travel &amp; Tours Advisers, Inc. it is Gold Line Tours, Inc., which should have been named party defendant.<br><br>Be that as it may, We concur in the trial court’s finding that the two companies are actually one and the same, hence the levy of the bus in question was proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC thus rightly ruled that petitioner might not be shielded from liability under the final judgment through the use of the doctrine of separate corporate identity. Truly, this fiction of law could not be employed to defeat the ends of justice.<br><br>But petitioner continues to challenge the RTC orders by insisting that the evidence to establish its identity with Travel and Tours Advisers, Inc. was insufficient.<br><br>We cannot agree with petitioner. As already stated, there was sufficient evidence that petitioner and Travel and Tours Advisers, Inc. were one and the same entity. Moreover, we remind that a petition for the writ of <i>certiorari </i>neither deals with errors of judgment nor extends to a mistake in the appreciation of the contending parties’ evidence or in the evaluation of their relative weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It is timely to remind that the petitioner in a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>commenced against a trial court that has jurisdiction over the proceedings bears the burden to demonstrate not merely reversible error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the respondent trial court in issuing the impugned order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The term <i>grave abuse of discretion</i> is defined as a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner because of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Yet, here, petitioner did not discharge its burden because it failed to demonstrate that the CA erred in holding that the RTC had not committed grave abuse of discretion. A review of the records shows, indeed, that the RTC correctly rejected petitioner’s third-party claim. Hence, the rejection did not come within the domain of the writ of <i>certiorari’s</i> limiting requirement of excess or lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DENIES</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari,</i> and <b>AFFIRMS</b> the decision promulgated by the Court of Appeals on October 30, 2002.
