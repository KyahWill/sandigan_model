The Court cannot grant equity where it is clearly undeserved by a grossly negligent party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; As the Court pronounced in another case:<br><br><blockquote>x x x Both parties have a right to a speedy resolution of their case.&nbsp; Not only petitioners, but also the respondents, have a right to have the case finally settled without delay.<br><br>Furthermore, the failure to file x x x on time was due primarily to petitioners’ unwise choices x x x.&nbsp; [T]hey hired their subsequent lawyers too late.<br><br>It must be pointed out that petitioners had a choice of whether to continue the services of their original lawyer or consent to let him go. x x x [T]hey delayed in engaging their replacement lawyer.

While the commissioners denied VCP’s request, VCP’s action betrays its lack of consideration for deadlines.<br><br>Further, VCP did not file a timely appeal from the RTC Order denying its Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; VCP received the said Order on August 24, 2005.&nbsp; Instead of appealing under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, VCP filed, on the 58th day from its receipt of the RTC Order, a MOTEX to file a Petition for Certiorari.<br><br>While the CA granted VCP’s MOTEX,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> it was correct in ultimately denying VCP’s Petition for Certiorari on the ground that VCP cannot exploit the remedy of <i>certiorari </i>after it had lost its right to appeal.<br><br><i>Appeal is a sufficient and adequate remedy <br>unless the party proves otherwise.</i><br><br>VCP attempts to extricate itself from the effects of its negligence by alleging that an appeal would not have been speedy and adequate for its purpose.&nbsp; The Court, however, finds no merit in its contention.<br><br>A court with appellate jurisdiction can review both the facts and the law, including questions of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; It can set aside an erroneous decision and even nullify the same, if warranted.&nbsp; Appeal is a speedy remedy, as an adverse party can file its appeal from a final decision or order immediately after receiving it.&nbsp; A party, who is alleging that an appeal will not promptly relieve it of the injurious effects of the judgment, should establish facts to show how the appeal is not speedy or adequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; VCP’s empty protestations, therefore, fail to impress.&nbsp; There is no reason, and VCP cannot explain, why an appeal would not be speedy and adequate to address its assigned errors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; VCP cannot complain of delay because it was guilty of delay itself, and it even waited until the 58<sup>th</sup> day of its receipt of the CA Decision before taking action.&nbsp; Clearly, petitioner resorted to <i>certiorari</i> as a substitute for its lost appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; The CA did not err in dismissing the same.<br><br>In sum, VCP’s continued negligence, and its resort to the wrong remedy, placed all perceived errors in the decisions below beyond the CA’s and this Court’s grasp.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The March 23, 2007 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
