–&nbsp; The aggrieved party on any legal ground and upon payment of the review fee, may file with the Regional Office a verified petition for review of the arbiter’s decision within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt thereof.</blockquote><br>After a review of the decision of the arbiter, the aggrieved party may also file a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Board of Commissioners and eventually appeal the same to the Office of the President.&nbsp; Rule XVIII of the same Rules provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i>.&nbsp; –&nbsp; Within the period for filing an appeal from a Board decision, order or ruling of the Board of Commissioners, any aggrieved party may file a motion for reconsideration with the board x x x.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Section 2.&nbsp; <i>Appeal.</i>&nbsp; –&nbsp; Any party may upon notice to the Board and the other party appeal a decision rendered by the Board of Commissioners <i>en banc</i> or by one of its divisions to the Office of the President xxx.</blockquote><br>Accordingly, inasmuch as <i>certiorari</i> cannot be a substitute for lost appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> for that matter, “especially if one’s own negligence or error in one’s choice of remedy occasioned such loss or lapse,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> its petition before the Court of Appeals must fail.<br><br>In addition, even assuming that <i>certiorari</i> is the only remedy left to petitioner, we sustain the Court of Appeals’ denial of the petition for failure to comply with Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><i>Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court in relation to Section 4, Rule 65 of the same Rule must be strictly observed;

Instead, on page 4 of the petition, [Petitioner alleged that,] the assailed decision of the Public Respondent HLURB “<i>was never served upon petitioner Bethel Realty &amp; Development Corporation</i>” but was only informed by one Atty. Carbon of the existence of the decision and the writs of execution.&nbsp; <b>Still, Petitioner failed to mention when was it informed of the decision.&nbsp; As explicitly stated in the aforementioned Rule, failure to indicate the material dates shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>)</blockquote><br>We are thus confronted with the issue of whether or not the allegation that petitioner was never served a copy of the judgment sought to be reviewed excuses compliance with the express requirement that the date of receipt of the notice of the judgment or final order should be indicated in the petition.&nbsp; We rule in the negative.<br><br>That petitioner was never served a copy of the assailed decision does not necessarily mean that he was unable to secure a copy thereof.&nbsp; If that were true, there would not have been any petition before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; A certified true copy of the decision is a required attachment to the petition otherwise its petition may be dismissed in accordance with Section 1, paragraph 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Moreover, if we allow petitioner’s excuse from the statement of material dates, we will disregard the constitutional right of parties to a speedy disposition of their case.&nbsp; This Court, in a number of cases, ratiocinated:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The 60-day period is deemed reasonable and sufficient time for a party to mull over and to prepare a petition asserting grave abuse of discretion by a lower court.&nbsp; The period was specifically set to avoid any unreasonable delay that would violate the constitutional rights of the parties to a speedy disposition of their case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>For these reasons, the 60-day period within which to file the petition must be strictly observed such that, in this case where there is an allegation that the petitioner did not receive a copy of the judgment, and for the purpose of determining the timeliness of the filing of the petition, that is, “sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the phrase “when notice of the judgment or final order or resolution subject thereof was received” under Sec. 3, Rule 46 of the same Rules should be taken to mean <i>knowledge of the existence</i> of the judgment.<br><br>In the case at bar, records would show that in its first petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> filed on 29 October 2003 and docketed as CA-G.R.

SP No. 82579, <u>or more than five (5) months from September 2003 when it supposedly learned of the issuance of the adverse decision and writs of execution</u>, it omitted such material information.&nbsp; In its stead, for appearances of validity and timeliness in the re-filing of its petition, which was obviously re-filed way beyond the 60-day prescribed period, it merely stated that it was informed of the adverse judgment only when the writ of execution was already being implemented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Interestingly, a closer examination of the documents would reveal that petitioner submitted machine copies of the HLURB’s Notice of Decision and Decision dated 11 September 2000 and 8 September 2000, respectively, stamped “Certified True Copies” by the Acting Head, Expanded National Capital Region Field Office, Records and Information Unit, HLURB on 12 August 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Certainly then, as early as 12 August 2003, petitioner had already secured a copy of the questioned decision.<br><br>All considered, we are left with one conclusion – both the first and second petitions were filed beyond the 60-day prescribed period counted from 12 August 2003.<br><br><i>Relaxation of procedural rules is allowed only when exceptional circumstances are obtaining in the case</i><br><br>We find in this case no justifiable reason to be liberal in the application of procedural rules.<br><br>On the contrary, there must be exactness rather than latitude in compliance with the rules considering the circumstances that show petitioner’s conscious disregard of procedure:<br><br>1.&nbsp; Petitioner did not attach to its petition filed on 29 October 2003 copies of all pleadings and documents, and other material portions of the record relevant and pertinent thereto in violation of Section 1, Rule 65 and Section 3, Rule 46;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the petitioner re-filed the petition on 5 March 2004, it did attach copies of the required documents but the same were neither duplicate originals nor certified true copies still in violation of Section 1, paragraph 2, Rule 65;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Court of Appeals, in its Resolution dated 11 March 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> afforded it an opportunity to comply with the rules within five (5) days from notice under pain of dismissal of the petition, it stated in its<i> Compliance and Motion for Issuance of TRO or Status Quo Order</i> dated 29 April 2004:<br><br><blockquote>In compliance with the Resolution of March 11, 2004, we are submitting CERTIFIED TRUE COPIES OF Annexes “A” to “F” of our petition, which are enclosed herewith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>However, only Annexes “B” to “D” were certified true copies of the documents;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>4. When the Court of Appeals, instead of dismissing the case, again extended its leniency by giving petitioner another chance and ordered anew the submission of certified true copies of Annexes “A,” “E,” “F,” and “F-1,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> petitioner once again impressed upon the court that it was submitting certified true copies of all the aforesaid annexes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; An examination of the submitted documents would show, however, that it merely re-submitted a machine copy of Annex “F-1.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; This time, the Court of Appeals did not notice the said omission; and<br><br>5. Most of the annexes attached to the instant petition are again mere machine copies of the original.<br><br>For these reasons, we resolve to strictly observe the Rules of Court guided by the following pronouncements of this Court:<br><br><blockquote>It is true that a litigation is not a game of technicalities and that the rules of procedure should not be strictly enforced at the cost of substantial justice.&nbsp; However, it does not mean that the Rules of Court may be ignored at will and at random to the prejudice of the orderly presentation and assessment of the issues and their just resolution.&nbsp; It must be emphasized that procedural rules should not be belittled or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party’s substantial rights.&nbsp; Like all rules, they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>We see in petitioner’s actions a deliberate intent to avoid a determination of whether or not the Court of Appeals may still take cognizance of its petition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
