Mateo.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, in its assailed Decision dated April 25, 2007, recounted the prosecution’s version of events as follows:<br><br><blockquote>AAA was born on May 3, 1983, as evidenced by a Certification dated January 18, 2000 issued by the Office of the City Civil Registrar of Santiago City and is the eldest child of accused-appellant.&nbsp; AAA and her parents, together with her three (3) sisters and four (4) brothers, reside in a one room house in Sinsayon, Santiago City.&nbsp; AAA, [CCC], her six (6) year old sister, and accused-appellant sleep in one bed, while her mother and her other siblings sleep in a bigger bed.<br><br>In the evening of January 11, 2000, AAA was awakened by her father, AAA, who told her he wanted to have sex with her.&nbsp; AAA did not say anything and accused-appellant got angry and threatened to hurt her.&nbsp; Accused-appellant went on top of AAA, removed his short pants, as well as AAA’s shorts, spread one of her legs and inserted his penis inside her vagina.&nbsp; Because of the pain, AAA cried and tried to struggle with accused-appellant while the latter made a push and pull movement.&nbsp; After removing his penis from the vagina of AAA, he wiped it and the vagina of the latter and then slept beside her.&nbsp; In the evening of January 12, 2000, AAA was again awakened and raped by accused-appellant as what happened the night before.&nbsp; The same sexual molestation was repeated by accused-appellant on AAA at about 2:00 o’clock and 3:00 o’clock in the morning of January 14, 2000.&nbsp; All of the incidents took place while AAA’s mother and other siblings were asleep.<br><br>On January 14, 2000, accused-appellant brought AAA with him to Cordon, Isabela, to the house of their relative, Lilia Tabuñar.&nbsp; That evening, AAA and Lilia went to a wake and the former took the opportunity to tell the latter what her father had done to her.&nbsp; On January 18, 2000, Lilia accompanied AAA to the Philippine National Police in Santiago City, where she executed a sworn statement before PO1 Arlyn Malabad Guray narrating the sexual molestations of accused-appellant.&nbsp; Said sworn statement was signed by AAA in the presence of Lilia Tabuñar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals also presented a summary of accused-appellant’s defenses, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Accused-appellant denied having molested AAA.&nbsp; He claimed that on January 11, 2000, AAA left their house after he scolded her because she wanted to marry Freddie Fragata, who is already a married man.&nbsp; He went to Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, which is his province, to look for AAA, because she told her mother that she would go there.&nbsp; He stayed in the house of his father until the morning of January 13, 2000 to wait for AAA, but the latter did not arrive.&nbsp; He then returned to his house in Sinsayon, Santiago City.&nbsp; In the afternoon of January 13, 2000, accused-appellant was called to the house of his brother-in-law in order to discuss the marriage of AAA.&nbsp; He went to the house of his brother-in-law where he saw AAA and Freddie.&nbsp; He told AAA not to get married yet and brought her home.&nbsp; He stated that AAA filed the cases against him because she wanted him to go to jail so that she could do whatever she wanted.&nbsp; He tried to show that they have three (3) beds in the house, one bed is occupied by his two (2) sons, the big bed is occupied by him, his wife and their other children, including AAA, and that no one occupies the small bed.<br><br>Accused-appellant’s sister, Mary Marquez, testified that accused-appellant stayed in her house at Tukal, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya on January 11, 2000 while looking for AAA, who stowed away; that accused-appellant left the following day; and that her house is quite far from the house of her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>After its evaluation of the foregoing evidence, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision on April 25, 2007 affirming accused-appellant’s conviction for the four counts of rape, but modifying the penalty and awards for damages rendered against him.&nbsp; The decretal portion of said decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Paterno Samandre y Sarmiento is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole in each case and is likewise ordered to pay AAA, in each case, the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, in addition to the award of moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 in each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated March 5, 2008, the Court gave the parties an opportunity to file their respective supplemental briefs.&nbsp; However, both plaintiff-appellee and accused-appellant manifested that they had already exhausted their arguments before the Court of Appeals and, thus, would no longer file any supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In his lone assignment of error, accused-appellant professes his innocence of the crimes charged.&nbsp; Accused-appellant highlights the inconsistencies in AAA’s testimony, particularly, on whether or not she has a suitor/boyfriend.&nbsp; Accused-appellant asserts that AAA’s initial concealment of the fact that she already has a boyfriend supports accused-appellant’s contention that AAA accused him of rape so he could go to jail and no longer prevent AAA from marrying her boyfriend.<br><br>The Court sustains accused-appellant’s conviction for raping his minor daughter on all four counts.<br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code provides that the crime of rape is committed by a man having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: (1) through force, threat or intimidation; (2) when the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious; (3) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and (4) when the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Orillosa,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court held that “in incestuous rape of a minor, actual force or intimidation need not even be employed where the overpowering moral influence of appellant, who is private complainant’s father, would suffice.”<br><br>The prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant, taking advantage of his moral ascendancy as a father, had carnal knowledge of his 16-year-old daughter, AAA.<br><br>In her Sworn Statement, executed in question-and-answer form, on January 18, 2000, AAA narrated to Police Officer (PO) Arlyn Malabad Guray that she had been sexually abused by her own father, accused-appellant, since she was 10 years old, and the latest incidents took place in January 2000.&nbsp; Below are relevant portions of AAA’s Sworn Statement:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">What prompted you to appear before the Office of the Investigation section?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">To file a complaint against my father Paterno Samandre, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What is your complaint against Paterno Samandre?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He sexually abused and molested me, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When and where did the incident happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Since when I was still 10 years old up to January 14, 2000 in our house and even in the river bank, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">How many times did your father sexually abused/molested you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He did it for many times, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When was the last time that your father sexually abused you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">On January 14, 2000 at about 2:00 to 3:00 o’clock in the morning, ma’am.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Will you please narrate how the incident happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Sometime on the year 1993 we were then living at Tucal, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, and I was then grade 3, while I was in our house one daylight sewing my cloth, my mother and younger brother and sister were out, my father came to me and wanted me to lay down and he will do something to me.

on January 18, 2000, Lilia accompanied AAA to the Philippine National Police in Santiago City, where AAA executed her Sworn Statement before PO2 Guray.<br><br>AAA’s Certificate of Live Birth issued by the Office of the City Civil Registrar of Santiago City establishes that she was born on May 3, 1983.&nbsp; The Medico-Legal Certificate dated January 17, 2000 reports that AAA sustained old hymenal

Torres:</span><br><br><blockquote>“The attempt of accused-appellant to impute ill-motive on complainant for fabricating the charge of rape against him cannot succeed.&nbsp; Not a few persons accused of rape have attributed the charges brought against them to resentment or revenge, but such alleged motives have not prevented the Court from lending full credence to the testimony of a complainant who remained steadfast throughout her direct and cross-examination.&nbsp; Given the naivete of complainant who was only 14 years old at the time of the incident, we are hard put to believe that she could have concocted a tale of pure fantasy, if only to get back at her father for not allowing her to live and study in Manila.&nbsp; Well-settled is the doctrine that no young and decent lass will publicly cry rape, particularly against her alleged father, if such were not the truth, or if justice was not her sole objective.&nbsp; The revelation of a young girl that she was sexually abused cannot be easily dismissed as a mere concoction, considering her willingness to undergo a public trial and relate the details of her defilement.&nbsp; Normally, no woman would be willing to undergo the arduous stages and embarrassing consequences of a rape trial, if not to condemn an injustice and obtain retribution.”</blockquote><br>We thus agree with the following observations of the court a quo:<br><br>“What does it take for a young daughter to wish her father to stay in jail possibly for the rest of his life or even executed to death?&nbsp; Certainly not for the reason that her father refused to let her marry someone.&nbsp; According to the accused in this case his daughter charged him of raping her because he scolded her and prohibited her to marry her boyfriend who is a married man.&nbsp; This is absurd especially as he did not try to show that his daughter has evil ways.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>What lends credence to her accusation is that she immediately reported the matter at the first chance she had.&nbsp; Unfortunately not to her mother because according to her she did not have a chance to do so because her father was always around watching her.&nbsp; This turned out to be right because it happened that her mother was fool enough to side with her husband when the denouncement was made.&nbsp; [AAA] reported the matter to her cousin (or aunt) Lilia Tabuñar when her father brought her to Cordon, Isabela, on January 19, (<i>sic</i>) 2000.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>People v. Crespo</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we emphasized:<br><br><blockquote>It bears stressing once again that no woman would concoct a story of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts and subject herself to public trial or ridicule if she has not, in truth, been a victim of rape and impelled to seek justice for the wrong done to her.&nbsp; It is settled jurisprudence that when a woman says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed.&nbsp; A woman would think twice before she concocts a story of rape, especially against her own father, unless she is motivated by a patent desire to seek justice for the wrong committed against her.</blockquote><br>The issue of credibility of witnesses is “a question best addressed to the province of the trial court because of its unique position of having observed that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying, which opportunity is denied to the appellate courts”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and “[a]bsent any substantial reason which would justify the reversal of the trial court's assessments and conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the former's findings, particularly when no significant facts and circumstances are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded which when considered would have affected the outcome of the case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals further affirmed the findings of the RTC. In this regard, it is settled that when the findings of the trial court have been affirmed by the appellate court, said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The Court finds no compelling reason herein to deviate from said findings.<br><br>Finally, the Court adopts the penalties imposed by the Court of Appeals upon accused-appellant but modifies the damages awarded to AAA.&nbsp; With the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346, the Court of Appeals properly imposed upon accused-appellant the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole for each of the four (4) counts of qualified rape for which he is hereby convicted.&nbsp; In line with current jurisprudence, however, accused-appellant is liable to pay AAA for each of the four (4) counts of qualified rape the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity, another Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) as moral damages, and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Exemplary damages should be awarded “in order to deter fathers with perverse tendencies and aberrant sexual behavior from preying upon their young daughters.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated April 25, 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
