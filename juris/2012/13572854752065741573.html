These requisites are: “(a) the parties [must be] landowner and tenant; (b) the subject matter is agricultural land; (c) there is consent by the landowner; (d) the purpose is agricultural production; (e) there is personal cultivation by the tenant; and (f) there is sharing of harvests between the [landowner and the tenant].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The CA concluded that there is no evidence supporting the DARAB’s conclusion that a tenancy relationship exists between Ladano and Neri.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, Ladano himself admitted that he entered and tilled the subject property without the knowledge and consent of the landowner.&nbsp; Such admission negates the requisites of consent and of an agreement to share harvests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The CA also faulted the DARAB for considering Ladano’s lengthy occupation of the land as an indication of the existence of a leasehold relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Since respondents did not deny petitioner’s factual allegations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court granted petitioner’s motion and issued a TRO on February 18, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp;

He attached pictures of bulldozed earth to his motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Respondents denied the allegations.&nbsp; They maintained that the pictures attached to petitioner’s motion were taken way back in 2003 and were not truthful representations of the current state of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>(1)&nbsp;

</i><br><br>A charge for indirect contempt, such as disobedience to a court’s lawful order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> is initiated either <i>motu proprio </i>by order of or a formal charge by the offended court, or by a verified petition with supporting particulars and certified true copies of documents or papers involved therein, and upon full compliance with the requirements for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the court concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; It cannot be initiated by a mere motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> such as the one that petitioner filed.<br><br>Further, petitioner failed to substantiate his allegation that respondents violated the TRO.&nbsp; The entries in the <i>barangay</i> and police blotters attached to his motion carry little weight or probative value as they are not conclusive evidence of the truth thereof but merely of the fact that these entries were made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The pictures depicting bulldozing activities likewise contained no indication that they were taken after the Court’s issuance of the restraining order.&nbsp; Simply, the Court has no way of gauging the veracity of petitioner’s factual allegations.&nbsp; On the basis of the foregoing, the Court resolves to deny petitioner’s motion.<br><br><i>Procedural aspects; improper <br>verification and incomplete payment <br>of docket fees before the CA</i><br><br>Petitioner assails the CA for giving due course to respondents’ appeal despite the latter’s failure to pay the complete docket fees when they filed their motion for extension of time to file a petition for review and to properly verify their petition for review.&nbsp; These omissions were allegedly sufficient grounds for the dismissal of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The Court finds the allegations of procedural missteps unfounded.&nbsp; It appears from the CA <i>rollo</i> that the respondents paid the complete docket fees on the day that they filed their motion for extension of time to file a petition for review on March 28, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; There was also a proper verification of the petition for review.&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner’s allegation that the verification was based on “knowledge and belief,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> which is violative of Section 4, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, the verification actually stated that it was based on “own personal knowledge,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> which complied with the requirements of the said provision.<br><br><i>The CA Decision correctly ruled that<br>there is no tenancy relationship between the parties</i><br><br>Ladano faults the CA for ruling that there was no tenancy relationship between himself and landowner Neri.&nbsp; He avers that they have an implied tenancy arrangement as shown by his delivery of the landowner’s agricultural share to the latter’s caretaker.&nbsp; Such actual sharing of harvest creates a tenancy relationship despite the absence of a written leasehold contract.&nbsp; The same has been pronounced in <i>Santos v. Vda. De Cerdenola</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> which states that an implied contract of tenancy is created if the landowner, represented by his overseer, permits the tilling of the land by another for a period of six (6) years.<br><br>The Court notes petitioner’s sudden change of thesis in the case.&nbsp; He insisted in his Complaint and in the proceedings before the Provincial Adjudicator, as well as before the DARAB, that the property is a public land and that no one has ever claimed ownership over the same.&nbsp; He maintained that he was in good faith when he cultivated the land because he believed that the land does not belong to anyone.&nbsp; This contention is in stark contrast with his new assertion, raised for the first time in his Motion for Reconsideration before the CA, that he consistently paid rentals to the landowner’s caretaker.&nbsp; The belatedness of the factual assertion raises doubts as to its truthfulness.&nbsp; Moreover, his bare assertion is bereft of evidentiary support.&nbsp; He did not name the alleged caretaker or the landowner for whom the caretaker was allegedly collecting rentals.&nbsp; He did not state the quantity of harvests collected as rental or the terms of payment.&nbsp; Given the belatedness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and flimsiness of petitioner’s factual allegation, the CA cannot be faulted for not accepting it in its assailed Decision and Resolution.<br><br>“A tenancy relationship arises between a landholder and a tenant once they agree, expressly or impliedly, to undertake jointly the cultivation of a land belonging to the landholder, as a result of which relationship the tenant acquires the right to continue working on and cultivating the land.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> For a tenancy relationship, express or implied, to exist, the following requisites must be present:&nbsp; (1) the parties must be landowner and tenant or agricultural lessee; (2) the subject matter is agricultural land; (3) there is consent by the landowner; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation by the tenant; and (6) there is sharing of harvests between the landowner and the tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; Independent and concrete evidence of the foregoing elements must be presented by the party asserting the existence of such a relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; They cannot be arrived at by mere conjectures or by presumptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; “Unless a person has established his status as a <i>de jure</i> tenant, he is not entitled to security of tenure [nor is he] covered by the Land Reform Program of the Government under existing tenancy laws.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the DARAB held that there is an implied tenancy because Ladano had been occupying and cultivating the subject property for more than 30 years.&nbsp; From such a lengthy occupation, the DARAB concluded that the landowner must have consented to petitioner’s occupation.<br><br>The CA rightfully reversed this conclusion.&nbsp; The DARAB failed to consider that one’s occupancy and cultivation of an agricultural land, no matter how long, will not <i>ipso facto</i> make him a <i>de jure</i> tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; It should not have considered such occupation as a basis for assuming the landowner’s consent, especially when the occupant himself never alleged that he obtained the landowner’s consent.&nbsp; Petitioner did not even allege in his Complaint that he is a tenant of the landowner.&nbsp; Neither did he allege that he shared his harvests with the landowner.&nbsp; Without such factual assertions from Ladano, the DARAB arrived at a conclusion that is utterly bereft of factual bases.&nbsp; Petitioner is not a tenant on the land and is not entitled to security of tenure nor to disturbance compensation.&nbsp; His Complaint was properly dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>There is another ground for dismissing Ladano’s Complaint. The Department of Agrarian Reform and its adjudication boards have no jurisdiction over Ladano’s Complaint.&nbsp; “For the DARAB to acquire jurisdiction over the case, there must exist a tenancy [relationship] between the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; But a careful reading of Ladano’s Complaint shows that Ladano did not claim to be a leasehold tenant on the land.&nbsp; The Complaint reads:<br><br><blockquote>COMES NOW, the Complainant, most respectfully avers and states:<br><br>1. That complainant is of legal age, a resident of Manalite I, Brgy.&nbsp; Sta.

That complainant and his family have been in peaceful possession and occupation, open, exclusive and uninterrupted from any claimants or intruders for several years, HOWEVER, on the 7th day of May 2003, respondents (Edwin Soto and Adan Espanola) upon strength [sic] instruction of respondent, Felino Neri, claiming ownership over the subject property, forcibly entered thereon and strongly threatened herein complainant and his family to vacate immediately thereat, otherwise, any members [sic] of the complainant [sic] might be killed;<br><br>4. That immediately thereafter, complainant sought the assistance of the DAR Municipal Office of Antipolo City, HOWEVER, pending mediation-conference proceedings, purposely to exhaust possible settlement, the RESPONDENTS on the 29th day of May 2003 at 9:00 in the morning, in a total wanton disregard of the complainant’s rights, destroyed/cut down several guava trees and kawayans [sic], with force and threat, respondents constructed a fence purposely to deprive herein complainant from ingress and egress on the subject property;<br><br>5. That as a result, complainant and his family could hardly move freely, they are terribly and seriously disturbed from their peaceful and enjoyment [sic] possession causing so much irreparable damage and injury;<br><br>6.

The issues that he wanted resolved are who between himself and the respondents have a better right to possess the property, and whether he has a right to be compensated for the improvements he introduced on the property.&nbsp; Clearly, the nature of the case he filed is one for forcible entry<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and for indemnification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; neither of which is cognizable by the DARAB, but by the regular courts.&nbsp; While neither of the parties challenged the jurisdiction of the DARAB, the Court can consider the issue of jurisdiction <i>motu proprio</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>DENIED.</b>&nbsp; The Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the dismissal of petitioner’s Complaint in the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
