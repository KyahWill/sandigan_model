Public officers and employees must, at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The clerk of court of a court of justice is an essential officer in any judicial system. The office is the hub of activities, both adjudicative and administrative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Clerks of court are judicial officers entrusted with the delicate function with regard to collection of legal fees. They are expected to correctly and effectively implement regulations relating to proper administration of court funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> As the chief administrative officers of their respective courts, they must act with competence, honesty and probity in accordance with their duty of safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, there is no doubt that Acedo committed infractions that warranted the withholding of her salaries. She even admitted and took full responsibility for all her shortcomings. Being a judicial officer, it was highly expected of her to competently and efficiently discharge her duties as a clerk of court to maintain proper administration of justice. She was the custodian of court funds and was duty-bound to promptly and regularly report the collections and immediately deposit the funds collected in their respective accounts.<br><br>The violations that Acedo committed were offenses that merit serious and harsh penalties. “The failure to remit the funds in due time amounts to dishonesty and grave misconduct, which the Court cannot tolerate for they diminish the people’s faith in the Judiciary. The act of misappropriating judiciary funds constitutes dishonesty and grave misconduct which are punishable by dismissal from the service even if committed for the first time.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> For those who have fallen short of their accountabilities, the Court has not hesitated to impose the ultimate penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The ultimate penalty of dismissal carries with it the penalty of forfeiture of retirement benefits. Sec. 58(a) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service provides:<br><br><blockquote>a. The penalty of dismissal shall carry with it that of cancellation of eligibility, <b>forfeiture of retirement benefits</b>, and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service, unless otherwise provided in the decision. [Emphasis supplied] </blockquote><br>Although Acedo cannot be dismissed from the service anymore because she was supposed to have retired in January 2003, she asked for leniency from the Court insofar as her retirement benefits and method of payment for her accountabilities were concerned. In several administrative cases, mitigating circumstances such as length of service in the Judiciary, acknowledgment of infractions and feeling of remorse, and family circumstances, among other things, merited the leniency of the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is, however, to be emphasized that these mitigating circumstances are not loosely appreciated especially in cases of serious offenses. The mitigating circumstances remain to be the exception, the general rule being the full imposition of the accessory penalties of forfeiture of retirement benefits and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service pursuant to the above-mentioned rule.<br><br>In this case, as per the November 17, 2008 Memorandum of the OCA, Acedo rendered almost forty (40) years of service in the Judiciary, starting in January 1965 as a Clerk, then as a Stenographer, and later as Clerk of Court in 1979 until her retirement in January 2003. These facts, however, rather aggravate the offenses committed by Acedo. Length of service is an alternative circumstance which can mitigate or possibly even aggravate the penalty, depending on the circumstances of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Acedo's almost forty (40) years of service should be taken against her. Having been accorded full trust and confidence for such a length of time, Acedo was expected to discharge her duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, which unfortunately she failed to do.<br><br>Moreover, records show that Acedo clearly took advantage of her official position to misappropriate the court funds entrusted to her. Further, the misappropriation proved to be habitual. These circumstances likewise aggravate her infractions, pursuant to Sec. 53 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, thus, supporting this Court's conclusion that Acedo's retirement benefits should be forfeited.<br><br>The OCA took into consideration Acedo's admission of sole responsibility and her promise to restitute her shortages in installment basis, which the OCA concluded as her effort to keep the institution whole and to speed up the healing process which the MCTC, Abuyog-Leyte needed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, the OCA recommended, for humanitarian consideration, that Acedo be allowed to retire to enable her to pay her remaining cash accountabilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The Court cannot agree.<br><br>The Court does not discount the fact that Acedo indeed admitted her infractions and promised to restitute her shortages. This admission, however, does not suffice to warrant the Court's leniency. Sec. 54 of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 54. <b><i>Manner of Imposition</i></b>. When applicable, the imposition of the penalty may be made in accordance with the manner provided herein below:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>The minimum of the penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present. <br></li><li>The medium of the penalty shall be imposed where no mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present. <br></li><li>The maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present. <br></li><li><b>Where aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present, paragraph</b> [a] shall be applied where there are more mitigating circumstances present; paragraph [b] shall be applied when the circumstances equally offset each other; and paragraph <b>[c] shall be applied when there are more aggravating circumstances.</b> </li></ol></blockquote><br>Here, it has been clearly shown that there are more aggravating than mitigating circumstances present in the case. For said reason, the Court cannot find the OCA's recommendation as proper and in accord with law and jurisprudence. Thus, Acedo's retirement benefits should be forfeited, except for her accrued/terminal leave benefits which shall be applied in payment of her shortages.<br><br>Further, the Court deems it proper to modify the computation of the total shortage in Fiduciary Fund.<br><br>The audit team earlier revealed a total shortage in the amount of P964,577.20, inclusive of the undocumented withdrawals, computed as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="76%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Collections from June 13, 1996 to Jan. 18, 2003 </div></td> <td width="24%"><div align="RIGHT">P1,242,467.20 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Total refunded cash bond – withdrawals (same period) </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">661,442.20</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Balance of Unwithdrawn FF as of Jan. 18, 2003 </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P551,025.00 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Bank Balance as of Jan. 18, 2003</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"> <div align="RIGHT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="JUSTIFY">Sub-Total </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="RIGHT">P 551,025.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Add: Undocumented withdrawals </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">413,552.20</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Shortage </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">P 964,577.20</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>A careful scrutiny of the computation bared a miscalculation in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">balance of unwithdrawn FF</span>. Deducting the total refunded cash bond from the total collections should have resulted in the amount of <span style="font-weight: bold;">P581,025.00</span> instead of P551,025.00. There was clearly a difference of P30,000.00. The correct amount of total shortage should be <span style="font-weight: bold;">P994,577.20</span>. Therefore, the correct computation after deducting the amount of P144,000.00 which was already complied with, through the submission of court orders, shall be the following:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Collections from June 13, 1996 to Jan. 18, 2003 </div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="RIGHT">P1,242,467.20</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Total refunded cash bond – withdrawals (same period)</div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"> <div align="RIGHT">661,442.20 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Balance of Unwithdrawn FF as of Jan. 18, 2003 </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P581,025.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Bank Balance as of Jan. 18, 2003 </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Sub-Total </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold;"><div align="RIGHT">P581,025.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Add: Undocumented withdrawals </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P413,552.20</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="55%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Less: Complied </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">144,000.00 </div><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">269,552.20</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Total Shortage </div></td> <td style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">P850,577.20</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Consequently, in the application of payments, priority should be given to the Fiduciary Account as the funds therein are only held in trust by the Court and are subject to refund upon presentation of appropriate documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The OCA was, therefore, correct in stating that the FF shall be deducted first from the withheld salaries and accrued leave credits of Acedo.
