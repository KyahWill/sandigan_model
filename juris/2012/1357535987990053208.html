Mendoza, Ignacio A. Galindez, Wilson E. Sagadraca, and Filipinas Menzen, together with now deceased Justino R. Vigilia, Castulo Villanueva, Samuel F. Erana and Socorro Cabanilla, filed a case against the&nbsp; respondents before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; When the SEC was reorganized pursuant to Republic Act 8799,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the case was transferred to the RTC of Nueva Vizcaya for further proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Pre-trial thereafter ensued and a Pre-Trial Order was issued enumerating the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>[a] which of the contending trustees and officers are legally elected in accordance with the 1970 By-Laws;<br>[b] whether the withdrawals and disbursements are in accordance with the By-Laws;<br>[c] whether there was a complete, audited report and accounting of all the corporate funds;<br>[d] whether respondents Gauuan, Villaluz, Arreola and the banks, are jointly and severally liable to indemnify the school for all sums of money withdrawn, disbursed, paid, diverted and unaccounted for without the approval and counter-signature of the chairman;<br>[e] whether there was a demand of a right of inspection and a refusal to allow inspection, and<br>[f] whether respondents are liable for damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>In a motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; dated August 10, 2003, respondents sought the dismissal of the complaint or the issuance of a summary judgment dismissing the case.&nbsp; On February 16, 2004, the RTC denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; the motion on the ground that “there are several issues raised which would still need the presentation of evidence to determine the rights of the parties.”&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years later, respondents-intervenors also sought the dismissal of the complaint in their Answer-in-Intervention with Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated February 27, 2008 raising the lack of capacity, personality or authority to sue the individual petitioners in behalf of Aldersgate College, Inc.&nbsp;

Under Section 8, Rule 1 of the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> a motion to dismiss is a prohibited pleading.<br><br>As this case involves an intra-corporate dispute, the motion to dismiss is undeniably a prohibited pleading.
