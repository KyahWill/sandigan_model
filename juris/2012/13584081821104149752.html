CV No. 70928, which affirmed with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated June 17, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Marawi City, Branch 8 in Civil Case No. 1499-97 by deleting the actual and moral damages, attorney’s fees, and costs of litigation awarded to respondents Marawi-Marantao General Hospital, Inc. (MMGHI) and Atty. Macapanton K. Mangondato.<br><br>On October 16, 1970, the MMGHI obtained a loan in the total amount of P548,000.00 from the Social Security System (SSS). The loan was secured by a mortgage on the property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-379, including the hospital building standing on it. For failure of the MMGHI to pay the monthly amortizations, the SSS extrajudicially foreclosed on the mortgage. The mortgaged property was subsequently sold on March 8, 1991 in a public auction where the SSS was the highest bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On October 16, 1991, the sheriff’s certificate of sale was registered. However, the SSS was not able to have a new certificate of title issued in its name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 1992, Atty. Mangondato, Acting Chairman of the MMGHI board of directors and representing MMGHI, negotiated with the SSS for the repurchase of the property and asked for an additional six (6) months within which to make the redemption. As a sign of good faith, Atty. Mangondato tendered P200,000.00 as partial payment on November 6, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After further negotiation, the Social Security Commission (SSC) approved Atty. Mangondato’s offer to repurchase/redeem the property during its Regular Meeting No. 42 on December 10, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In particular, the SSC adopted SSC Resolution No. 984-s.96<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated December 10, 1996:<br><br><blockquote>Proposal to repurchase/redeem <br>the Marawi-Marantao General <br>Hospital, approved; Management <br>directed to submit a report on the<br>bidding process for the said property.<br><br>Wherefore, on motion duly seconded,<br><br>RESOLVED, That the proposal of Atty.

Mangondato, and the SSS, represented by Atty. Godofredo S. Sison, its Senior Deputy Administrator.

Mangondato issued in favor of the SSS a PNB Check No. 002412 in the amount of P500,000.00 representing the full payment of the subject property under the Deed of Conditional Sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, in a letter dated April 7, 1997, Atty. Mangondato demanded the SSS to immediately implement the transfer of the subject property in his favor considering that he had already paid the purchase price in full.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>However, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated May 5, 1997, the SSS informed Atty. Mangondato about the adoption by the SSC of SSC Resolution No. 224-s.97 dated March 20, 1997 declaring the conditional sale a nullity and directing the return of the P2.7 million payment made by Atty. Mangondato. SSC Resolution No. 224-s.97<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 20, 1997 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sale of the foreclosed assets<br>of Marawi-Marantao General <br>Hospital, Inc., pursuant to SSC <br>Resolution No. 984, dated <br>December 10, 1996, declared a <br>nullity based on certain grounds,<br>approved; Rescission of the<br>Deed of Conditional Sale between<br>the SSC for the SSS and Atty. <br>Macapanton K.

Macapanton K. Mang[o]ndato, be, as it is hereby declared a nullity based on the following grounds:<br><br><ol><li>There was no full disclosure of facts to the SSCommission.<br><br></li><li>Violation of the standard operating procedure requiring the conduct of a bidding in the sale of an SSS-acquired asset.<br><br></li><li>Non-compliance with office procedure requiring two signatories in the Deed of Conditional Sale.<br><br></li><li>Title to the property has not been consolidated in the name of [the] SSS.</li></ol><br>RESOLVED, LIKEWISE, That Management be, as it is hereby, directed to return the total amount of P2.2 million tendered by Atty.

Approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Aggrieved by the action of the SSS, the MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato filed on August 12, 1997 a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for specific performance and damages against the SSS in the RTC of Marawi City, Branch 8. The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 1499-97.<br><br>In its answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the SSS specifically denied the material allegations in the complaint and averred that the redemption by MMGHI was made long after the expiration of the period of redemption on October 15, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The SSS also alleged that the deed of conditional sale entered into by the parties was subsequently annulled pursuant to SSC Resolution No. 224-s.97 dated March 20, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>After trial, the trial court rendered a Decision dated June 17, 1999 in favor of MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato. Its dispositive portion reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs Marawi-Marantao General Hospital[,] Inc., and Atty. Macapanton K. Mangondato and against defendant Social Security System [SSS] directing the latter (SSS) to:<br><br>1.

Pay plaintiffs the sum of P12,487,271.00 by way of actual damages or unrealized income;<br><br>3. Pay plaintiffs the sum of P500,000.00 by way of moral damages;<br><br>4. Pay plaintiffs the sum of P100,000.00 by way of attorney’s fees; and<br><br>5. Pay the cost of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>Aggrieved, the SSS appealed the trial court’s Decision to the Court of Appeals. The appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 70928.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On January 25, 2002, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the SSS, filed its appellant’s brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in CA-G.R. CV No. 70928. It asserted that the trial court erred in directing the SSS to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato despite the nullity of the conditional sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It also claimed that the trial court erred in holding the SSS liable for actual damages, moral damages, attorney’s fees, and costs of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato failed to file their brief. Thus, the Court of Appeals declared the case submitted for decision without the appellees’ brief. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision dated June 19, 2003 affirming with modification the trial court’s Decision dated June 17, 1999:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the assailed Decision dated June 17, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 8, Marawi City in Civil Case No. 1499-97 is <b>AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION</b>, deleting the awards of damages, attorney’s fees and liability to pay costs of litigation, specifically, items nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the dispositive portion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Hence, this “Petition for Partial Review.” It assails the Court of Appeals Decision for failing to nullify the deed of conditional sale and instead directing the Republic to execute an absolute deed of sale in favor of MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato pursuant to the provision of the said deed of conditional sale.<br><br>The Republic basically argues in this petition that no valid redemption could have been effected by entering into the deed of conditional sale as the period of redemption had already expired. It further alleges that certain requirements were not complied with, such as the office procedure requiring the counter-signature of another Deputy Administrator in a contract and public bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Republic states:<br><br><blockquote>the deed of conditional sale was executed on January 16, 1997, long after the redemption period had expired on December 21, 1992. It will be recalled that the subject property was foreclosed by petitioner and sold at public auction on March 8, 1991, wherein petitioner was declared the winning bidder. The Sheriff issued a certificate of sale on the same date which was registered on October 16, 1991. In October 1992, respondents manifested their intention to repurchase the subject property and asked for a period of six months within which to repurchase the same. Atty. Godofredo S. Sison, gave respondents instead a period of sixty (60) days or until December 21, 1992, within which to repurchase the subject property. It was only after five (5) years, or on August 5, 1996 that respondents (thru Atty. Macapanton K. Mangondato) reiterated their proposal to repurchase the subject property. The deed of conditional sale was executed on January 16, 1997 between Atty. Sison and Atty. Mangondato. Clearly, redemption was made after the period of redemption had long expired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>The Republic further claims that then SSS Senior Deputy Administrator Atty. Godofredo Sison exceeded his authority when he alone signed the deed of conditional sale which he entered in behalf of the SSS. This was allegedly in violation of SSC Resolution No. 207-s.91 dated April 5, 1991 approving Office Order No. 15-V dated April 2, 1991 which requires the counter-signature of another Deputy Administrator in a contract. Moreover, the redemption or repurchase was made without public bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In their comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato assert that the arguments presented by the Republic in this case have been adequately discussed and disposed of by the Court of Appeals Decision. As regards the issue of Atty. Sison’s alleged lack of authority to enter into the deed of conditional sale without the signature of another Deputy Administrator, it simply rendered the contract unenforceable pursuant to Article 1317 of the Civil Code. Unenforceable contracts are susceptible of ratification and the Republic, through the SSS, ratified the deed of conditional sale when it accepted the repurchase price.<br><br>Had MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato validly redeemed the property under the deed of conditional sale? That is the issue to be determined by this Court in this petition.<br><br>Upon careful consideration of the contentions of the parties, this Court answers the issue affirmatively.<br><br>The alleged nullity of the deed of conditional sale because the period of redemption had expired is wrong. When SSC Resolution No. 984-s.96 dated December 10, 1996 approved the proposal of Atty. Mangondato to “redeem/repurchase” the property, the SSC is deemed to have waived, or even agreed to extend, the original limited period of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As this Court held in <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. West Negros College, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>The right of legal redemption must be exercised within specified time limits. However, the statutory period of redemption can be extended by agreement of the parties. x x x. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Also, this Court’s ruling in <i>Ramirez v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> is relevant:<br><br><blockquote>The Court of Appeals unfortunately was not entirely correct since the PNB accepted the redemption price from the petitioner after the one (1) year period had expired. By accepting the redemption price after the statutory period for redemption had expired, PNB is considered to have waived the one (1) year period within which Ramirez could redeem the property.&nbsp; There is nothing in the law which prevents such a waiver. Allowing a <b>redemption after the lapse of the statutory period, when the buyer at the foreclosure does not object but even consents to the redemption, will uphold the policy of the law</b> recognized in such cases as <i>Javellana v. Mirasol and Nuñez</i>, and in the more recent case of <i>Tibajia, et al. v. Honorable Court of Appeals, et al., </i>which is to aid rather than defeat the right of redemption. Thus, there is no doubt that the redemption made by petitioner Ramirez is valid. x x x. (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>It is also worthy to note that the grounds mentioned in Resolution No. 224.-s.97 dated March 20, 1997 as basis for the declaration of nullity of the deed of conditional sale did not include the alleged expiration of the redemption period. Clearly, the inclusion of that ground has been belatedly made and appears to be a mere afterthought.<br><br>The violation of an alleged requirement for the conduct of bidding in the sale of an SSS-acquired asset merely referred to “standard operating procedure.” The Republic failed to point to a specific law, rule or public policy that has been violated by the resale to the previous owner of a property acquired by foreclosure. In view of such failure on the part of the Republic, the execution of the deed of conditional sale enjoys the presumptions that the ordinary course of business has been followed and that the law has been obeyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> More importantly, the transaction between the parties involves the redemption by MMGHI of the property covered by TCT No. T-379 mortgaged to and foreclosed by the SSS. The policy of the law is to aid rather than defeat the right of redemption;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> thus, public bidding is not a condition for redemption.<br><br>The alleged lack of authority on the part of Atty. Sison is flimsy. MMGHI and its representative, Atty. Mangondato, could not have been faulted for non-compliance with the so-called office procedure as they could not have been reasonably expected to know that the signature of only one Deputy Administrator is insufficient because the said office procedure seems to be internal in nature. Moreover, even the very resolution invoked by the Republic, SSC Resolution No. 207-s.91 dated April 5, 1991 approving Office Order No. 15-V dated April 2, 1991, negates the contention of the Republic:<br><br><blockquote><center>RESOLUTION NO. 207-s.91</center><br>Office Order No. 15-V,<br>dated April 2, 1991,<br>approved.<br><br>This refers to Office Order No. 15-V, dated April 2, 1991, pertaining to the rules to be observed in connection with the signing of contracts entered into by the SSS with other parties, after the same have been approved by the Social Security Commission. The following rules shall be observed.<br><br>The Administrator has the authority to sign any contract with or without a co-signatory.

Approved. (As amended by Res. 428-s.1991)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>Atty. Sison as then Senior Deputy Administrator of the SSS enjoys the presumption of regularity in the performance of his duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In accordance with that presumption, he is presumed to have complied with SSC Resolution No. 207-s.91 dated April 5, 1991 approving Office Order No. 15- V dated April 2, 1991. In the absence of competent countervailing evidence, the presumption stands,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> especially since the records show that, from the earliest stage of the effort of Atty. Mangondato to redeem the property in October 1992, it has always been Atty. Sison who has represented the SSS thereby giving a reasonable expectation that the subject of the contract is within his area of responsibility and that he may be a sole signatory as the Senior Deputy Administrator because the contract is not over P5 million. In other words, the Republic should have presented competent evidence to rebut the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties by Atty. Sison. Unfortunately, other than the bare allegation that Atty. Sison failed to comply with SSC Resolution No. 207-s.<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[91]</span>, no evidence was shown to discharge the Republic’s burden of proof.<br><br>Furthermore, assuming that Atty. Sison lacked authority when he signed the deed of conditional sale, the SSS ratified his act when it accepted the P2.7 million payment made by MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato. In <i>Tacalinar v. Corro</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this Court considered the act of a father, whose children sold his 40-hectare hacienda without his authority, of collecting the purchase price as “ratifying and approving the said sale,” and this Court further took such act as a waiver of his right of action to avoid the contract as it “implies the tacit, if not express, confirmation of the said sale.”<br><br>In view of the validity of the redemption made by MMGHI and Atty. Mangondato through the contract of conditional sale between the parties, the SSS must faithfully comply with its obligations under the said contract.&nbsp; This is in accordance with the principle of obligatoriness of contracts, that obligations arising from contract have the force of law between the parties and should be complied with in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>What obligation must the SSS perform in good faith under the deed of conditional sale? Paragraphs 10 and 12 of the deed hold the answer:<br><br><blockquote>10. Title to the property [subject] of this Contract remains with the <b>VENDOR</b> and shall pass to, and be transferred in the name of the <i>VENDEE</i> only upon the former’s execution of the [F]inal Deed of Sale mentioned in the next succeeding paragraphs;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>12. Upon the full payment by the <b>VENDEE</b> of the purchase price of above referred to, together with all the interests, penalties, taxes and other charges due thereon, and upon his faithful compliance with all the conditions of this Contract, the <b>VENDOR</b> agrees to execute in favor of the <b>VENDEE</b> or his heirs and successors-in-interest such Deed of Absolute Sale as full performance by the <b>VENDEE</b> of the covenants and undertakings in the Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>The above provisions provide that title to the property remains with the seller and will only be transferred to the buyer-redemptioner upon the execution of a final deed of sale and that upon full payment of the purchase price by the buyer-redemptioner, the SSS as seller has the obligation to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of the former. The above provisions further reveal that the true nature of the deed of conditional sale between the parties is a contract to sell. It is established case law that where the seller promises to execute a deed of absolute sale upon the completion by the buyer of the payment of the price, the contract is only a contract to sell. Thus, while the contract is denominated as a Deed of Conditional Sale, the presence of the above-quoted provisions identifies the contract as being a mere contract to sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>A contract to sell is defined as a bilateral contract whereby the prospective seller, while expressly reserving the ownership of the property despite delivery thereof to the prospective buyer, <b>binds himself to sell the property exclusively to the prospective buyer</b> upon fulfillment of the condition agreed, <i>i.e.</i>, full payment of the purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In a contract to sell, the prospective seller explicitly reserves the transfer of title to the prospective buyer, meaning, the prospective seller does not as yet agree or consent to transfer ownership of the property subject of the contract to sell until the happening of an event, which for present purposes we shall take as the full payment of the purchase price. <b>What the seller agrees or obliges himself to do is to fulfill his promise to sell the subject property when the entire amount of the purchase price is delivered to him</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The SSS acknowledges that the purchase price of P2.7 million had already been paid in full. Pursuant to paragraph 12 of the deed of conditional sale and the nature of the parties’ agreement as a contract to sell, therefore, the SSS has the obligation to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of MMGHI/Atty. Mangondato.<br><br>All told, the trial court and the Court of Appeals did not err when they ordered the SSS to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of MMGHI/Atty.

Mangondato for partial execution of the appealed decision dated June 17, 1999. The SSS challenged the Special Order in the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 53502 where it was annulled in a Decision dated August 16, 1999. (Penned by Associate Justice Hector L. Hofileña and concurred in by Associate Justices Omar U. Amin and Jose L.

There is an attempt to cast a cloud of doubt on the authority of Atty. Sison to grant the extension (id. at 61). Such lack of authority, however, had been cured by the SSC’s ratification of Atty.
