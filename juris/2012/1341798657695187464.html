If at all, the only difference between the two is that the second affidavit is more detailed than the first one. This, however, is understandable considering that the first affidavit was executed by Lobitaña during petitioner’s initial investigation, when it was still verifying the information it received from Moralda, while the second affidavit, which contains Lobitaña’s testimony during respondent’s administrative hearing, was executed long after the investigation was conducted.<br><br>Also, there appears to be no ill-motive on the part of Lobitaña to falsely accuse respondent of accepting commissions and/or “kickbacks.”&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; it was not Lobitaña but Moralda who reported the irregularities to petitioner.&nbsp; Lobitaña came forward only during petitioner’s initial investigation to confirm the testimony of Moralda that some personnel were indeed receiving commissions and/or “kickbacks.”<br><br>Moreover, as between the positive testimony of Lobitaña that he gave respondent commissions and/or “kickbacks” on two separate occasions, and the negative testimony of respondent’s witnesses Cedeño and Banzon that no such meeting took place, we are more inclined to give credence to the former.&nbsp; It bears stressing that a positive testimony prevails over a negative one,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> more especially in this case where respondent’s witnesses did not even execute affidavits to attest to the truthfulness of their statements.&nbsp; Thus, it was error on the part of the Labor Arbiter and the CA to disregard the testimony of Lobitaña.<br><br>Likewise erroneous is the reasoning of the Labor Arbiter and the CA that since respondent was not involved in the procurement process, he could not be guilty of violating Section 2.04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of petitioner’s Company Rules and Regulations, which prohibits employees from:<br><br>Obtaining or accepting money or anything of value by entering into unauthorized arrangements(s) with supplier (s), client(s) or other outsiders(s).<br><br>This is a non sequitur.&nbsp; As aptly pointed out by the NLRC, although he was not directly involved in the procurement process, respondent, as the then Power Plant Manager, had some power or authority “vital and indispensable to the procurement process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Quoted below is the NLRC’s ratiocination, which we approve and adopt:<br><br><blockquote>After going through the records, we are afraid the Labor Arbiter completely missed the point.&nbsp; While canvassing, awarding, and approving of purchase orders for company supplies, materials and equipment may not strictly be the official functions of the [respondent], these being the concerns of the Procurement Department, nevertheless as the then Power Plant Manager,&nbsp; [respondent] actually wielded some authority which is vital and indispensable to the “procurement process.”&nbsp; As is usual in any industrial firm, the procurement of company supplies, materials, and equipment is being handled by its procurement department, then headed by Mr. Romeo Tinoco, Jr. The procurement department is tasked with the duty to “canvass” and place “purchase orders” for supplies, materials, and equipment sought to be procured by the other departments, from which the purchase request originated. The requesting department which generated the Purchase Request is called the “end-user” or “requestor.”<br><br>Being more familiar with the particulars of the supplies, materials and equipment that their respective department[s] need, especially the technical aspect of it, the “end-users” are tasked with the duty to provide the specifications of the supplies, materials, equipment sought to be procured for their respective department[s].&nbsp; Since the “end-users” are the ones [who] provide for specifications, they are necessarily empowered to determine whether the materials or equipment delivered by the supplier have complied with the given specifications.&nbsp; If the item delivered fails to meet the given specifications, the end-user has the discretion to reject the delivery and demand for replacement.<br><br>One of the end-users that often generates purchase requests is the Power Plant, of which [respondent] was then the manager.&nbsp; Being then the manager of the Power Plant, it was [respondent’s] duty to approve purchase requisition[s] and prepare or caused to be prepared the desired specifications of the item sought to be procured for the Power Plant, especially on the technical side of the items.&nbsp; Upon the delivery, [respondent] has the authority to determine if the items or equipment delivered are in accordance with the specifications given.<br><br>In performing this function, [respondent] would exercise some discretion either to accept the items delivered if he finds them to have complied with the desired specifications or reject the same if to his judgment the items delivered failed to meet the desired specifications. In fact, [respondent] himself categorically admitted during the administrative investigation that in the event the item is rejected, the end-user has the right to demand for replacement:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, to the mind of any supplier, the role of the end-user, like the Power Plant then headed by [respondent], in the entire procurement process is as important and indispensable as that of the procurement personnel.&nbsp; Since the final acceptance of the items and/or equipment delivered/supplied by a supplier lies with the “end-user,” the “end-user” equally wields the power to “make&nbsp; or break”&nbsp; a supplier, and therefore, the suppliers have all the reasons in the world to “bribe” the “end-users” if only to smoothen the acceptance of the items supplied/ delivered.<br><br>Consequently, just because [respondent’s] signature cannot be found in Annexes “10,” “10-A,” “10-B,” “12,” “12-A,” “13” and “13-A”, it does not necessarily mean that “he has absolutely nothing to do” with the entire procurement process.&nbsp; As said, while [respondent] may not have been empowered, “to canvass and award purchase orders to suppliers,” he was empowered, as an end-user, to determine whether to accept or reject any item delivered by any supplier, which authority is part and parcel of the entire procurement mechanism put in place by the company.<br><br>It is obviously because of this inherent power to accept or reject any item delivered that Mr. Lobitaña had to give 10% kickbacks to the [respondent]. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote><br>All told, we find that the testimony of Lobitaña constitutes substantial evidence to prove that respondent, as the then Power Plant Manager, accepted commissions and/or “kickbacks” from suppliers, which is a clear violation of Section 2.04 of petitioner’s Company Rules and Regulations. Jurisprudence consistently holds that for managerial employees “the mere existence of a basis for believing that such employee has breached the trust of his employer would suffice for his dismissal.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As we then see it, respondent’s termination was for a just and valid cause.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby<b> GRANTED</b>.
