No. 7832, various associations of rural electric cooperatives throughout the Philippines filed on behalf of their members applications for approval of amended PPA Clauses. On 8 February 1996, ASTEC filed on behalf of its members (including BATELEC I, QUEZELCO I and QUEZELCO II) a verified petition for the approval of the amended PPA Clause. The verified petition of ASTEC was docketed as ERB Case No. 96-35.9 On 9 February 1996, CLECA also filed on behalf of its members (including PRESCO) a verified petition for the approval of the amended PPA Clause. The verified petition of CLECA was docketed as ERB Case No. 96-37.10<br><br>The ERB issued Orders on 19 February 199711 and 25 April 199712 provisionally authorizing the petitioners and the other rural electric cooperatives to use and implement the following PPA formula, subject to review, verification and confirmation by the ERB:<br><br><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>PPA = &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">__ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> A&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> &nbsp; -E&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-(C + C1 + D)<br><br>Where:<br><br>A = Cost of Electricity purchased and generated for the previous month less amount recovered from pilferages, if any<br><br>B = Total Kwh purchased and generated for the previous month<br><br>C = Actual system loss but not to exceed the maximum recoverable rate of system loss in Kwh<br><br>C1 = Actual company use in Kwhrs but not to exceed 1% of total Kwhrs purchased and generated<br><br>D = Kwh consumed by subsidized consumers<br><br>E = Applicable base cost of power equal to the amount incorporated into their basic rate per Kwh</blockquote><br>The ERB further directed petitioners to submit relevant documents regarding the monthly implementation of the PPA formula for review, verification and confirmation. The Orders dated 19 February 1997 and 25 April 1997 commonly provide:<br><br><blockquote>Accordingly, all electric cooperatives are hereby directed to submit to the Board within ten (10) days from notice hereof their monthly implementation of the PPA formula from the February, 1996 to January, 1997 for the Board’s review, verification and confirmation.

No. 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA) was enacted. Section 38 of the EPIRA abolished the ERB, and created the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). The ERC is an independent and quasi-judicial regulatory body mandated to “promote competition, encourage market development, ensure customer choice and penalize abuse of market power in the restructured electricity industry.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The powers and functions of the ERB not inconsistent with the provisions of the EPIRA were transferred to the ERC, together with the applicable funds and appropriations, records, equipment, property and personnel of the ERB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>As a result, ERB Case No. 96-35 involving ASTEC and its members (including BATELEC I, QUEZELCO I and QUEZELCO II) was renamed and renumbered as ERC Case No. 2001-338.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> ERB Case No. 96-37 involving CLECA and its members (including PRESCO) was also renamed and renumbered as ERC Case No. 2001-340.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The records further show that these two cases were consolidated, together with the other cases previously consolidated with then ERB Case No. 96-35.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the ERC issued an Order dated 17 June 2003. The ERC noted therein “that the PPA formula which was approved by the ERB was silent on whether the calculation of the cost of electricity purchased and generated in the formula should be ‘gross’ or ‘net’ of discounts.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The cost of electricity is computed at “gross” if the discounts extended by the power supplier to the rural electric cooperative are not passed on to end-users, while the cost of electricity is computed at “net” if the discounts are passed on to end-users.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The ERC ruled:<br><br><blockquote>To attain uniformity in the implementation of the PPA formulae, the Commission has resolved that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>In the confirmation of past PPAs, the power cost shall still be based on “gross”; and <br></li><li> In the confirmation of future PPAs, the power cost shall be based on “net”.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Relative thereto, petitioners are directed to implement their respective PPA using the power cost based on net at the next billing cycle upon receipt of this Order until such time that their respective rates have already been unbundled.<br><br>Petitioners are hereby directed to submit to the Commission on or before the 20th day of the following month, their implementation of the PPA formula for review, verification and confirmation by the Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>On 29 March 2004, the ERC issued an Order in the consolidated cases resolving the motions for reconsideration filed by several rural electric cooperatives. In the said Order, the ERC explained the general framework of the new PPA confirmation scheme to be adopted by the regulatory body. The ERC stated:<br><br><blockquote>Majority of the issues raised in the motions for reconsideration can be properly addressed by the new PPA confirmation scheme to be adopted by this Commission. Under this scheme, the electric cooperatives shall be allowed to collect/refund the true cost of power due them vis-a-vis the amount already collected from their end-users. In turn, the end-users shall only be charged the true cost of power consumed.<br><br>The Commission recognizes that the electric cooperatives implemented their PPA in the manner by which majority of them were implementing the same. Thus, they had no alternative but to adopt the most recent available data for the respective billing months which were based on estimates due to time lag differences. Under the new scheme, the actual data for the billing month shall be adopted as they are available at the time the verification is undertaken.</blockquote><br>In this regard, all the other issues raised by the electric cooperatives shall be properly addressed in the confirmation of their respective PPAs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Several rural electric cooperatives subsequently filed motions for clarification and/or reconsideration with respect to the ERC’s process of computation and confirmation of the PPA. The rural electric cooperatives advanced the following allegations:<br><br><blockquote>1. They are non-profit organizations and their rate components do not include any possible extra revenue except the discounts; and <br><br>2. They are burdened with expenses in their continuing expansion programs of rural electrification to the remotest barangays and sitios of their respective franchise areas and could not give any benefit or incentive to their employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </blockquote><br>On 14 January 2005, the ERC issued an Order addressing the motions for clarification and/or reconsideration filed by the rural electric cooperatives. In the said Order, the ERC expounded on the general framework of the new PPA confirmation scheme. The ERC stated that “the new PPA scheme creates a venue where both the [electric cooperatives] can recover and the end-users can be charged the true cost of power.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The ERC stressed that “[t]he purchased power cost is a pass through cost to customers and as such, the same should be revenue neutral.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In other words, rural electric cooperatives should only recover from their members and patrons the actual cost of power purchased from power suppliers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the same Order, the ERC clarified certain aspects of the new PPA confirmation scheme. With respect to the data to be utilized in the confirmation of the PPA, the ERC stated:<br><br><blockquote>All electric cooperatives were directed to implement the PPA in the manner the then Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) had prescribed. In calculating their respective PPAs, the [electric cooperatives] had no alternative but to adopt the most available data for the respective billing months, i.e. the previous month, due to time lag differences. Under the new PPA confirmation scheme, the actual data for the billing month shall be adopted primarily because they reflect the true cost of power, they are available at the time the confirmation is undertaken and they have already been charged to the end-users. Thus, the new PPA scheme creates a venue where both the [electric cooperatives] can recover and the end-users can be charged the true cost of power. There will also be proper matching of revenue and cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>As regards the cap on the recoverable rate of system loss, the ERC explained:<br><br><blockquote>The caps on the recoverable system loss provided in R.A. 7832 were established to encourage distribution utilities to operate efficiently. Since the PPA is merely a cost recovery mechanism, the [electric cooperatives] are not supposed to earn revenue nor suffer losses therefrom. To allow them to adopt the caps even in cases where the system losses are actually lower would be contrary to the underlying principle of a recovery mechanism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>Finally, with respect to the Prompt Payment Discount (PPD) extended by power suppliers to rural electric cooperatives, the ERC reiterated that rural electric cooperatives should only recover the actual costs of purchased power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, any discounts extended to rural electric cooperatives must necessarily be extended to end-users by charging only the “net” cost of purchased power.<br><br>In light of the foregoing clarifications, the ERC outlined the following directives in the said Order:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>The computation and confirmation of the PPA prior to the Commission’s Order dated June 17, 2003 shall be based on the approved PPA formula;<br><br></li><li>The computation and confirmation of the PPA after the Commission’s Order dated June 17, 2003 shall be based on the power cost “net” of discount; and <br><br></li><li>If the approved PPA formula is silent on the terms of discount, the computation and confirmation of the PPA shall be based on the power cost at “gross”, subject to the submission of proofs that said discounts are being extended to the end-users.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Subsequently, the ERC issued the following Orders:<br><br>1. 22 March 2006 Order in ERC Case No. 2001-338 regarding the monthly PPA implementation of BATELEC I;<br><br>2. 16 February 2007 Order in ERC Case No. 2001-338 regarding the monthly PPA implementation of QUEZELCO I;<br><br>3. 7 December 2005 Order in ERC Case No. 2001-338 regarding the monthly PPA implementation of QUEZELCO II; and<br><br>4. 27 March 2006 Order in ERC Case No. 2001-340 regarding the monthly PPA implementation of PRESCO.<br><br>In the said Orders, the ERC clarified its policy on the PPA confirmation scheme previously adopted in its Order dated 14 January 2005. For the distribution utilities to recover only the actual costs of purchased power, the ERC stated the following principles governing the treatment of the PPD granted by power suppliers to distribution utilities including rural electric cooperatives:<br><br><blockquote>I. The over-or-under recovery will be determined by comparing the Allowable Power Cost with the Distribution Utility’s Actual Revenue (AR) billed to end-users.<br><br>II. Calculation of the Allowable Power Cost as prescribed in the PPA Formula: <br><br><blockquote>a. For a Distribution Utility which PPA formula explicitly provides the manner by which discounts availed from the power supplier/s shall be treated, the allowable power cost will be computed based on the specific provision of the formula, which may either be at “net” or “gross”; and<br><br>b. For a Distribution Utility which PPA formula is silent in terms of discounts, the allowable power cost will be computed at “net” of discounts availed from the power supplier/s, if there is any.</blockquote><br>III. Calculation of the Distribution Utility’s Actual Revenues/Actual Amount Billed to End-users. <br><br><blockquote>a. On Actual PPA Computed at Net of Discounts Availed from Power Supplier/s:<br><blockquote>a.1. If a Distribution Utility bills at net of discounts availed from the power supplier/s (i.e. Gross power cost minus discounts from power supplier/s) and the Distribution Utility is not extending discounts to end-users, the actual revenue should be equal to the allowable power cost; and<br><br>a.2. If a Distribution Utility bills at net of discounts availed from the power supplier/s (i.e. Gross power cost minus discounts from power supplier/s) and the Distribution Utility is extending discounts to end-users, the discount extended to end-users will be added back to actual revenue.<br></blockquote>b. On Actual PPA Computed at Gross<br><br><blockquote>b.1. If a Distribution Utility bills at gross (i.e. Gross power cost not reduced by discounts from power supplier/s) and the Distribution Utility is extending discounts to end-users, the actual revenue will be calculated as: Gross Power Revenue less Discounts extended to end-users. The result will then be compared to the allowable power cost; and <br><br>b.2. If a Distribution Utility bills at gross (i.e. Gross power cost not reduced by discounts from power supplier/s) and the distribution utility is not extending discounts to end-users, the actual revenue will be taken as is which shall be compared to the allowable power cost.</blockquote></blockquote><br>IV. In calculating the Distribution Utility’s actual revenues, in no case shall the amount of discounts extended to end-users be higher than the discounts availed by the Distribution Utility from its power supplier/s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>The ERC then directed petitioners to refund their respective over-recoveries to end-users arising from the implementation of the PPA Clause under R.A. No. 7832 and its IRR, as follows:<br><br>1. <u>22 March 2006 Order</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the Order dated 22 March 2006, the ERC evaluated the monthly PPA implementation of BATELEC I covering the period from February 1996 to September 2004. The verification and confirmation of the PPA implementation was based on the monthly implementation reports, documents and information submitted by BATELEC I in compliance with the Order dated 19 February 1997 issued by the ERB. The ERC determined that there were over-recoveries amounting to <b>Fifty Nine Million Twenty One Thousand Nine Hundred Five Pesos (P59,021,905.00)</b> equivalent to P0.0532/kWh. The ERC outlined the following bases for the over- recoveries:<br><br><blockquote>1. For the period August 1998 to May 1999, NPC made an erroneous reading on BATELEC I’s meter which resulted to the application of PPA charges at higher sales volume vis-a-vis those utilized in the PPA computation. The system loss adopted in the PPA formula was the running average of the preceding twelve (12) months, which is the period when the erroneous meter reading had not yet occurred. As a result, the PPA formula’s denominator which represents the sales volume was lower than the actual sales for the period when the PPA was implemented and the impact of the different “E” (basic charge power cost component) on the said period resulted to a net over-recovery of PhP38,317,933.00; <br><br>2. For the period July 2003 to August 2004, BATELEC I erroneously added back the Power Act Reduction amounting to PhP20,565,981.00 to its total power cost; and <br><br>3. The new grossed-up factor mechanism adopted by the Commission which provided a true-up mechanism that allows the distribution utilities to recover the actual cost of purchased power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote> <br>The ERC confirmed the PPA of BATELEC I covering the period from February 1996 to September 2004, and directed BATELEC I “to refund the amount of P0.0532/kWh starting on the next billing cycle from receipt of this Order until such time that the full amount shall have been refunded.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>2. <u>16 February 2007 Order</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <br><br>In the Order dated 16 February 2007, the ERC evaluated the monthly PPA implementation of QUEZELCO I for the period from January 1999 to April 2004. QUEZELCO I previously submitted its monthly implementation reports, documents and information for review, verification and confirmation pursuant to the Order dated 19 February 1997 issued by the ERB. The ERC determined that there were over-recoveries amounting to <b>Twenty Million Twenty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Fifty Two Pesos (P20,027,552.00)</b> equivalent to P0.0486/kWh. The ERC outlined the following bases for the over-recoveries:<br><br><blockquote>1. For the period July 2003 to April 2004, QUEZELCO I’s power cost was not reduced by the PPD availed from its suppliers resulting to an over- recovery of PhP8,457,824.00; <br><br>2. QUEZELCO I failed to comply with the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 7832 x x x which provides that the pilferage recoveries should be deducted from the total purchased power cost used in the PPA computation. Thus, QUEZELCO I’s actual PPA should have been reduced by the pilferage recoveries amounting to PhP580,855.00; <br><br>3. QUEZELCO I failed to reflect the power cost adjustments on its PPA as a result of the billing adjustments of NPC under the Credit Memo for the month of June 2003 amounting to PhP4,210,855.00;<br><br>4. QUEZELCO I’s power supply agreement with Camarines Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (CANORECO) was not approved by the Commission. Thus, the Commission pegged CANORECO’s power cost at NPC’s total average rate which resulted to an over-recovery of PhP849,324.00; <br><br>5. In computing its PPA, QUEZELCO I included the subsidized consumptions of 2,051,753 kWh which resulted to an over-recovery of PhP1,611,036.00;<br><br>6.

The ERC established that there were over-recoveries amounting to <b>Five Million Two Hundred Forty Eight Thousand Two Hundred Eighty Two Pesos (P5,248,282.00)</b> equivalent to P0.1000/kWh. The bases of the over-recoveries are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>1. QUEZELCO II treated the penalty on excess/below contracted demand in April 2000 as a discount;<br><br>2.

Since PRESCO sources its power from the National Power Corporation (NPC) and Angeles Power Incorporated (API), the Commission used PRESCO’s actual power cost from API for the years 1998, 1999 (except August), 2000, 2001 and 2002 (January to April only) being lower than NPC’s rate. However, for the years 2002 (May to December), 2003 and 2004, the Commission applied NPC’s rate being lower than API. x x x x <br><br>3. For the period February 1996 to April 1999, PRESCO utilized the 1.4 multiplier scheme which is roughly equivalent to 29% system loss which resulted to an over-recovery of PhP5,701,173.00; and<br><br>4. The Commission computed PRESCO’s allowable power cost at “net” of the Power Factor Discount (PFD) and Prompt Payment Discount (PPD) availed from NPC at PhP2,185,812.00.

Thus, the Commission considered PRESCO’s actual revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </blockquote><br>The ERC confirmed the PPA of PRESCO for the period of February 1996 to June 2004, and directed PRESCO “to refund the amount of P0.1851/kWh starting the next billing cycle from receipt of this Order until such time that the full amount shall have been refunded.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioners thereafter filed their respective motions for reconsideration of the foregoing Orders.

At the outset, the Court of Appeals stated that “to the extent that the administrative agency has not been arbitrary or capricious in the exercise of its power, the time-honored principle is that courts should not interfere.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>With respect to the constitutionality of Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832, the Court of Appeals ruled that the challenge amounts to a collateral attack that is prohibited by public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>With regard to the imposition of the system loss caps after the effectivity of the EPIRA, the Court of Appeals recognized the amendment to Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832. Section 43 (f) of the EPIRA provides that “the cap on the recoverable rate of system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be determined by the ERC based on load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations it may promulgate.” The Court of Appeals, however, stated:<br><br><blockquote>[W]hile the <b>EPIRA</b> had already specifically amended the system loss caps mandated under Section 10 of <b>R.A. No. 7832</b>, respondent <b>ERC</b> still had to go through the tedious process of determining the technical considerations in order to come up with the rate-setting methodology that shall promote the efficiency of distribution utilities as envisioned by the law. Before they could be replaced, however, the caps used in the <b>ERB</b> formula remain, as asserted by the <b>OSG</b>. For this reason, petitioners cannot insist that the reinforcement of said system loss caps be discontinued after the passage of the <b>EPIRA</b> on June 8, 2001. In fact, as already stated, it was only in October, 2004 that respondent <b>ERC</b> was able to promulgate the AGRA [or the Automatic Adjustment of Generation Rates and System Loss Rates by Distribution Utilities], which could effectively replace the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PPA</span>. Thus, for the periods covered by the <b>ERC</b> confirmation (February 1996 to September 2004), respondent <b>ERC</b> did not abuse its discretion in using the system loss caps in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ERB</span> formula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals likewise rejected the contention of petitioners that the ERC issued rules and regulations for the implementation of the provisions of R.A. No. 7832 by way of orders or decisions with retroactive effect. According to the Court of Appeals, the confirmation process of the ERC encompassed PPA implementation periods after the effectivity of R.A. No. 7832, particularly from February 1996 to September 2004.63 Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that there was no retroactive application of the law.<br><br>The Court of Appeals further rejected the claim of denial of due process. The Court of Appeals ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners likewise failed to show to Our satisfaction that the guidelines contained in the assailed Orders of respondent <b>ERC</b> went beyond merely providing for the means that can facilitate or render less cumbersome the implementation of the law. Interpretative rules give no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed, and are designed merely to provide guidelines to the law which the administrative agency is in charge of enforcing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>As regards the validity of the denial of petitioners’ motions for reconsideration, the Court of Appeals noted that the Orders specifically indicated that the signature of the Commissioner was “FOR AND BY AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSION.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The Court of Appeals stated that the ERC examined the motions for reconsideration as a collegial body.66 It further emphasized that the interests of substantial justice prevail over the strict application of technical rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals further ruled that the ERC had legal and factual bases in charging petitioners with over-recoveries. The Court of Appeals stated:<br><br><blockquote>Prior to the enactment of <b>R.A. No. 7832</b>, petitioners used the <b>Multiplier Scheme</b> implemented by the <b>NEA</b> [National Electrification Administration] to recover incremental costs in the power purchased from <b>NPC</b> – the sole agency authorized to generate electric power before the enactment of the <b>EPIRA</b> – and consequent system losses that are not included in their respective approved basic rates. With the use of multipliers ranging from 1.2 to 1.4, depending on their actual system losses, petitioners were allowed to automatically adjust their rates when cost of power purchased from <b>NPC</b> changes, thus:<br><blockquote>1.2 Multiplier – For ECs with system loss of 15% and below; <br>1.3 Multiplier – For ECs with system loss ranging from 16% to 22%; and<br>1.4 Multiplier – For ECs with system loss ranging from 23% and above.<br></blockquote>The <b>NEA</b> likewise approved the inclusion in the basic rates of a separate item for <b>Loss Levy Charge </b>for those electric cooperatives (<b>ECs</b>) whose loan covenants with financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (<b>ADB</b>) limit their recoverable system loss to 15%. Thus, petitioners charged their consumers “System Loss Levy” for system losses in excess of 15%.<br><br>Petitioners admitted having continued to use the pricing mechanisms authorized by the <b>NEA </b>even after the passage of <b>R.A. No. 7832</b>, which repealed the same. Needless to say, the use of said mechanisms allowed the recovery of system losses beyond the caps set by the said law. Petitioners cannot, therefore, successfully argue that respondent <b>ERC</b> had no basis in charging them of over-recoveries as a result of their failure to comply with the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>With respect to the PPD and other discounts extended by power suppliers, the Court of Appeals emphasized that rural electric cooperatives may only recover the actual cost of purchased power. The Court of Appeals stated:<br><br><blockquote>[N]o error can likewise be attributed to respondent <b>ERC</b> in directing the implementation of the respective <b>PPA</b> of the petitioners using the power cost net of discounts. As held in the case of <i>National Power Corporation vs. Philippine Electric Plant Owners Associaton (PEPOA), Inc.,</i> discounts are not amounts paid or charged for the sale of electricity, but are reductions in rates. Moreover, We emphasized here that rate fixing calls for a technical examination and specialized review of specific details which the courts are ill-equipped to enter, hence, such matters are primarily entrusted to the administrative or regulating authority. Towards this end, the administrative agency, respondent <b>ERC</b> in this case, possesses the power to issue rules and regulations to implement the statute which it is tasked to enforce, and whatever is incidentally necessary to a full implementation of the legislative intent should be upheld as germane to the law. Respondent <b>ERC</b> is mandated to prescribe a rate-setting methodology “in the public interest” and “to promote efficiency”, hence its goal of fixing purchased power at actual cost should be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals further rejected the claim that petitioners were deprived of the opportunity to be heard. The Court of Appeals gave credence to the assertion of the Office of the Solicitor General that “petitioners were allowed to justify their <span style="font-weight: bold;">PPA</span> charges through the documents that they were required to file; that the technical staff of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ERC</span> conducted exit conferences with petitioners’ representatives to discuss preliminary figures and they were authorized to go over the working papers to check out inaccuracies; and that petitioners were allowed to file their respective motions for reconsideration after the issuance of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PPA</span> confirmation Orders.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The rural electric cooperatives thereafter filed their respective motions for reconsideration of the 23 December 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals. In its 26 April 2010 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied the motions for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals observed that the issues raised in the motions for reconsideration were “mere reiterations” of the issues addressed in the 23 December 2008 Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The Court of Appeals further stated:<br><br><blockquote>Nonetheless, We find that the following disquisition of the Office of the Solicitor General amply supports the affirmance of the assailed Decision, thus:<br><br><blockquote>“12. Notably, respondent did not impose rules to set new rates, rather, it merely confirmed whether petitioners have faithfully complied with the requirements of recoveries under the provisionally approved PPA formula. There is therefore nothing new or novel about the confirmation policies of respondent as to give any occasion to retroactivity.<br><br>13. Equally significant, it should be underscored that from the beginning, petitioners’ authority to recover their losses based on the PPA formula were <u>PROVISIONAL</u>, that is, the authority granted to petitioners for recoveries and the mode of its implementation is <u>subject to further reconfirmation by respondent ERC</u>. The erstwhile ERB earlier allowed electric cooperatives to implement their PPA based on the PPA formula that the ERB <u>provisionally approved</u>. As spelled out in the Order of approval, however, such authorization was provisional and temporary, that is, it is subject to regulation and post hoc review, verification and confirmation by the ERB. x x x<br><br>14. By its very nature, the PPA confirmation process is a post hoc review of charges already implemented. It is therefore crystal clear from the approval of the application of the PPA that such authorization was conditioned on subsequent review by the regulating body. Thus, the Order did not only approve the implementation of the PPA but also (a) directed the electric cooperatives ‘to submit their monthly implementation of the PPA formula for the board’s review, verification and confirmation;’ and (b) directed the Commission on Audit to cause an audit of all the accounts and other records of all the electric cooperatives to aid the Board in the determination of rates. <br><br>15. That the electric cooperatives were allowed to implement their PPA after the provisional approval of the PPA formula did not divest the regulator of the power to determine the reasonableness of the said charges or the electric cooperatives’ entitlement thereto. Such power necessarily includes the power to adopt such policies as would assist the regulator in its determination of the ‘reasonableness’ of such PPA charges implemented by electric cooperatives. The implementation was provisionally approved and subject to the changes that the regulator can make, in the exercise of its rate-setting authority and subject to the ‘reasonableness’ standard under the law x x x.”</blockquote><br>Suffice to state that with regard to rate-determination, the government is not hidebound to apply any particular method or formula. What is a just and reasonable rate cannot be fixed by any immutable method or formula. In other words, no public utility has the vested right to any particular method of valuation. The administrative agency is not duty bound to apply any one particular formula or method simply because the same method has been previously used and applied.<br><br>The issues on the alleged retroactive application and denial of due process had been adequately addressed in the Decision dated December 23, 2008. We reiterate that the periods covered by the ERC confirmation subject of the petitions, spanning from February 1996 to September 2004, fell after the effectivity of R.A. No. 7832, the constitutionality of which petitioners continue, albeit erroneously, to assail in the instant motions. With respect to the alleged lack of trial-type hearing, it is settled that the essence of due process in administrative proceedings is merely the opportunity to explain one’s side or to seek reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. Where an opportunity to be heard is accorded, as in this case, there is no denial of due process. Neither was there a need for the assailed Orders of the ERC to be published as petitioners so adamantly insist. As pointed out by the OSG, said Orders did not create a new obligation, impose a new duty, or attach a new disability on the electric cooperatives. They merely clarified the policy guidelines adopted in the implementation of the PPA. As We have said, interpretative rules give no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, this instant petition filed by BATELEC I, QUEZELCO I, QUEZELCO II and PRESCO.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br><br>Petitioners raise the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>1.

For a Distribution Utility which PPA formula is silent in terms of discounts, the allowable power cost will be computed at “net” of discounts availed from the power supplier/s, if there is any. </blockquote><br>III. Calculation of the Distribution Utility’s Actual Revenues/Actual Amount Billed to End-users. <br><br><blockquote>a. On Actual PPA Computed at Net of Discounts Availed from Power Supplier/s: <br><br><blockquote>a.1. If a Distribution Utility bills at net of discounts availed from the power supplier/s (i.e. Gross power cost minus discounts from power supplier/s) and the distribution utility is not extending discounts to end-users, the actual revenue should be equal to the allowable power cost; and<br><br>a.2. If a Distribution Utility bills at net of discounts availed from the power supplier/s (i.e. Gross power cost minus discounts from power supplier/s) and the distribution utility is extending discounts to end-users, the discount extended to end-users will be added back to actual revenue. </blockquote><br>b. On Actual PPA Computed at Gross <br><br><blockquote>b.1. If a Distribution Utility bills at gross (i.e. Gross power cost not reduced by discounts from power supplier/s) and the distribution utility is extending discounts to end-users, the actual revenue will be calculated as: Gross Power Revenue less Discounts extended to end-users. The result will then be compared to the allowable power cost; and<br><br>b.2. If a Distribution Utility bills at gross (i.e. Gross power cost not reduced by discounts from power supplier/s) and the distribution utility is not extending discounts to end-users, the actual revenue will be taken as is which shall be compared to the allowable power cost.</blockquote> </blockquote><br>IV. In calculating the Distribution Utility’s actual revenues, in no case shall the amount of discounts extended to end-users be higher than the discounts availed by the Distribution Utility from its power supplier/s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></blockquote> <br>The above-stated policy guidelines of the ERC on the treatment of discounts merely interpret the cost of purchased power as a component of the PPA formula provided in Section 5, Rule IX of the IRR of R.A. No. 7832. The cost of purchased power is denominated as the variable “A” in the numerator of the PPA formula, particularly:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Automatic Cost Adjustment Formula</i>. – <br><br>x x x x The automatic cost adjustment of every electric cooperative shall be guided by the following formula: Purchased Power Adjustment Clause<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><br>(PPA) =&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A____</span> &nbsp; -E<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B- (C + D)<br><br>Where:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A = Cost of electricity purchased and generated for the previous month</span><br><br>B = Total Kwh purchased and generated for the previous month<br><br>C = The actual system loss but not to exceed the maximum recoverable rate of system loss in Kwh plus actual company use in Kwhrs but not to exceed 1% of total Kwhrs purchased and generated<br><br>D = Kwh consumed by subsidized consumers<br><br>E = Applicable base cost of power equal to the amount incorporated into their basic rate per Kwh (Boldfacing supplied)</blockquote><br>The cost of purchased power expressed as the variable “A” in the numerator of the PPA formula is plain and unambiguous. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines the term “cost” as “an item of outlay incurred in the operation of a business enterprise (as for the purchase of raw materials, labor, services, supplies) including the depreciation and amortization of capital assets.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term “cost” as “[t]he amount paid or charged for something; price or expenditure.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> When the policy guidelines of the ERC directed the exclusion of discounts extended by power suppliers in the computation of the cost of purchased power, the guidelines merely affirmed the plain and unambiguous meaning of “cost” in Section 5, Rule IX of the IRR of R.A. No. 7832. “Cost” is an item of outlay, and must therefore exclude discounts since these are “<i>not</i> amounts paid or charged for the sale of electricity, but are <i>reductions in rates.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the policy guidelines of the ERC uphold and preserve the nature of the PPA formula. The nature of the PPA formula precludes an interpretation that includes discounts in the computation of the cost of purchased power. The PPA formula is an adjustment mechanism the purpose of which is purely for the recovery of cost. In <i>National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms (NASECORE) v. Energy Regulatory Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> this Court noted the explanation of the ERC on the nature and purpose of an adjustment mechanism:<br><br><blockquote>It is clear from the foregoing that “escalator” or “tracker” or any other similar automatic adjustment clauses are merely cost recovery or cost “flow-through” mechanisms; that what they purport to cover are operating costs only which are very volatile and unstable in nature and over which the utility has no control; and that the use of the said clauses is deemed necessary to enable the utility to make the consequent adjustments on the billings to its customers so that ultimately its rate of return would not be quickly eroded by the escalations in said costs of operation. The total of all rate adjustments should not operate to increase overall rate of return for a particular utility company above the basic rates approved in the last previous rate case (<i>Re Adjustment Clause in Telephone Rate Schedules, 3 PUR 4<sup>th</sup> 298, N.J. Bd. of Pub. Util.Comm’rs., 1973. Affirmed 66 N.J. 476, 33 A.2d 4, 8 PUR 4<sup>th</sup> 36, N.J.,1975</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></blockquote><br>Rural electric cooperatives cannot therefore incorporate in the PPA formula costs that they did not incur. Consumers must not shoulder the gross cost of purchased power; otherwise, rural electric cooperatives will unjustly profit from discounts extended to them by power suppliers. In the Consolidated Comment of the ERC, the Solicitor General correctly pointed out:<br><br><blockquote>34.4. Second, [t]he ERC’s PPA confirmation policies were in consonance with the rule that electric cooperatives may only recover costs to the extent of the amount they actually incurred in the purchase of electricity. <b>The PPA remained to be the difference between the electric cooperative’s actual allowable power costs as translated to PhP/kWh and the electric cooperative’s approved Basic Rate. This was also how the Cost Adjustment Formula was defined in the IRR of R.A. No. 7832. </b><br><br>34.5. Contrary to petitioners’ assertions, therefore, the policy did not deviate from the ERB’s provisionally-approved PPA formula but merely implemented the policy set out in R.A. No. 7832, that is, it is <i>strictly for the purpose of cost recovery only</i>. Obviously, if the PPA is computed without factoring the discounts given by power suppliers to electric cooperatives, electric cooperatives will impermissibly retain or even earn from the implementation of the PPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></blockquote> <br>Thus, the policy guidelines of the ERC on the treatment of discounts extended by power suppliers “give[] no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Publication is not necessary for the effectivity of the policy guidelines.<br><br>As interpretative regulations, the policy guidelines of the ERC on the treatment of discounts extended by power suppliers are also not required to be filed with the U.P. Law Center in order to be effective. Section 4, Chapter 2, Book VII of the Administrative Code of 1987 requires every rule adopted by an agency to be filed with the U.P. Law Center to be effective. However, in <i>Board of Trustees of the Government Service Insurance System v.

The recoverable amount derived from applying the gross-up factor is still the maximum allowable cost to be recovered from the electric cooperative’s customers for a given month. <b>If the PPA collected exceeded the recoverable cost, the difference should be refunded back to the consumers.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115 ]</sup></blockquote><br>This Court agrees with the ERC that the grossed-up factor mechanism “did not modify the [PPA] formula or state how the PPA is to be computed.”116 However, the grossed-up factor mechanism <b>amends</b> the IRR of R.A. No. 7832 as it serves as an <b>additional numerical standard</b> that must be observed and applied by rural electric cooperatives in the implementation of the PPA. While the IRR explains, and stipulates, the PPA formula, the IRR neither explains nor stipulates the grossed-up factor mechanism. The reason is that the grossed-up factor mechanism is admittedly “<b>new</b>” and provides a <b>“different result,”</b> having been formulated only <b><i>after</i></b> the issuance of the IRR.<br><br>The grossed-up factor mechanism is not the same as the PPA formula provided in the IRR of R.A. No. 7832. Neither is the grossed-up factor mechanism subsumed in any of the five variables of the PPA formula. Although both the grossed-up factor mechanism and the PPA formula account for system loss and use of electricity by cooperatives, they serve different quantitative purposes.<br><br>The grossed-up factor mechanism serves as a threshold amount to which the PPA formula is to be compared. According to the ERC, any amount collected under the PPA that exceeds the Recoverable Cost computed under the grossed-up factor mechanism shall be refunded to the consumers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> The Recoverable Cost computed under the grossed-up factor mechanism is “the maximum allowable cost to be recovered from the electric cooperative’s customers for a given month.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> <b>In effect, the PPA alone does not serve as the variable rate to be collected from the consumers.</b> The PPA formula <b>and</b> the grossed-up factor mechanism will both have to be observed and applied in the implementation of the PPA.<br><br>Furthermore, the grossed-up factor mechanism accounts for a variable that is not included in the five variables of the PPA formula. In particular, the grossed-up factor mechanism accounts for the amount of power sold in proportion to the amount of power purchased by a rural electric cooperative, expressed as the Gross-Up Factor. It appears that the Gross-Up Factor limits the Recoverable Cost by allowing recovery of the Cost of Purchased Power only in proportion to the amount of power sold. This is shown by integrating the formula of the Gross-Up Factor with the formula of the Recoverable Cost, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The grossed-up factor mechanism consists of the following formulas:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gross-Up Factor =</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kwh Sales + Coop Use&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kwh Purchased (1 - % System Loss)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recoverable Cost = Gross-Up Factor x Cost of Purchased Power</span><br><br>Integrating the above-stated formulas will result in the following formula:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recoverable Cost =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Kwh Sales + Coop Use&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost of Purchased</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Kwh Purchased (1–%System Loss)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power</span></blockquote><br>On the other hand, the PPA formula provided in the IRR of R.A. No. 7832 does not account for the amount of power sold. It accounts for the amount of power purchased and generated, expressed as the variable “B” in the following PPA formula:<br><br><blockquote>Purchased Power Adjustment Clause<br><br><br>(PPA) =&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - E<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - (C + D)<br><br>Where:<br><br>A = Cost of electricity purchased and generated for the previous month<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">B = Total Kwh purchased and generated for the previous month</span><br><br>C = The actual system loss but not to exceed the maximum recoverable rate of system loss in Kwh plus actual company use in Kwhrs but not to exceed 1% of total Kwhrs purchased and generated<br><br>D = Kwh consumed by subsidized consumers<br><br>E = Applicable base cost of power equal to the amount incorporated into their basic rate per Kwh<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119</sup>] (Boldfacing supplied)</blockquote><br>In light of these, the grossed-up factor mechanism does not merely interpret R.A. No. 7832 or its IRR. It is also not merely internal in nature. <b>The grossed-up factor mechanism amends the IRR by providing an additional numerical standard that must be observed and applied in the implementation of the PPA.</b> The grossed-up factor mechanism is therefore an administrative rule that should be published and submitted to the U.P. Law Center in order to be effective.<br><br>As previously stated, it does not appear from the records that the grossed-up factor mechanism was published and submitted to the U.P. Law Center. Thus, it is ineffective and may not serve as a basis for the computation of over-recoveries. The portions of the over-recoveries arising from the application of the mechanism are therefore invalid.<br><br>Furthermore, the application of the grossed-up factor mechanism to periods of PPA implementation prior to its publication and disclosure renders the said mechanism invalid for having been applied retroactively. The grossed-up factor mechanism imposes an additional numerical standard that clearly “creates a new obligation and imposes a new duty x x x in respect of transactions or consideration already past.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>Rural electric cooperatives cannot be reasonably expected to comply with and observe the grossed-up factor mechanism without its publication. This Court recognizes that the mechanism aims to reflect the actual cost of purchased power for the benefit of consumers. However, this objective must at all times be balanced with the viability of rural electric cooperatives. The ERB itself made the following observation regarding the operational and economic condition of rural electric cooperatives in its Order dated 19 February 1997:<br><br>Electric [c]oopcratives are created under Presidential Degree No. 269 in the natured nun-profit organizations.

Tuvera,</i> 230 Phil. 528, 534-536 (1986). In <i>Tañada v. Tuvera</i>, this Court expounded on the reason for the requirement of publication in this wise:<br><br>“It is not correct to say that under the disputed clause publication may be dispensed with altogether. The reason is that such omission would offend due process insofar as it would deny the public knowledge of the laws that are supposed to govern it. Surely, if the legislature could validly provide that a law shall become effective immediately upon its approval notwithstanding the lack of publication (or after an unreasonably short period after publication), it is not unlikely that persons not aware of it would be prejudiced as a result; and they would be so not because of a failure to comply with it but simply because they did not know of its existence. x x x x<br><br>We note at this point the conclusive presumption that every person knows the law, which of course presupposes that the law has been published if the presumption is to have any legal justification at all. It is no less important to remember that Section 6 of the Bill of Rights recognizes ‘the right of the people to information on matters of public concern,’ and this certainly applies to, among others, and indeed especially, the legislative enactments of the government.” <i>Tañada v.
