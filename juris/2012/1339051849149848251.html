Arias (Arias) who allegedly acted as petitioner’s agent.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 3201-MN and raffled off to Branch 170.&nbsp; In their complaint, respondent-spouses prayed that petitioner and Arias be ordered to:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Pay the principal amount of P3,500,000.00 plus interest of 12% compounded annually starting October 1, 1993 or an estimated amount of P8,558,591.65;<br><br></li><li>Pay the following items of damages:<br><br>a)&nbsp; Moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00;<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual damages in the amount of&nbsp; P100,000.00;<br>c)&nbsp; Exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00;<br>d)&nbsp; [Attorney’s] fee in the amount of P50,000.00 plus 20% of recoverable amount from the [petitioner].<br>e)&nbsp; [C]ost of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>In their Answer with Counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> petitioner and Arias averred that they are willing to return the principal amount of P3.5 million but without any interest as the same was not agreed upon.&nbsp; In their Pre-Trial Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> they reiterated that the only remaining issue between the parties is the imposition of interest.&nbsp; They argued that since the Conditional Deed of Sale provided only for the return of the downpayment in case of breach, they cannot be held liable to pay legal interest as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In its Pre-Trial Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated June 29, 2001, the RTC noted that “the parties agreed that the principal amount of 3.5 million pesos should be returned to the [respondent-spouses] by the [petitioner] and the issue remaining [is] whether x x x [respondent-spouses] are entitled to legal interest thereon, damages and attorney’s fees.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Trial ensued thereafter.

More importantly, there was even no showing that Arias was authorized to act as agent of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Anent the award of attorney’s fees, the CA found the award by the trial court (P50,000.00 plus 20% of the recoverable amount) excessive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; and thus reduced the same to P100,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is MODIFIED.

Moreover, it is undisputed that petitioner failed to perform her obligations to relocate the house outside the perimeter of the subject property and to complete the necessary documents.&nbsp; As regards the attorney’s fees, they claim that they are entitled to the same because they were forced to litigate when petitioner unjustly withheld the amount. Besides, the amount awarded by the CA is even smaller compared to the filing fees they paid.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><b><i>Interest may be imposed even in the absence of stipulation in the contract.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>We sustain the ruling of both the RTC and the CA that it is proper to impose interest notwithstanding the absence of stipulation in the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 2210 of the Civil Code expressly provides that “[i]nterest may, in the discretion of the court, be allowed upon damages awarded for breach of contract.”&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, there is no question that petitioner is legally obligated to return the P3.5 million because of her failure to fulfill the obligation under the Conditional Deed of Sale, despite demand.&nbsp; She has in fact admitted that the conditions were not fulfilled and that she was willing to return the full amount of P3.5 million but has not actually done so.&nbsp; Petitioner enjoyed the use of the money from the time it was given to her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> until now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, she is already in default of her obligation from the date of demand, i.e., on September 27, 2000.<br><br><b><i>The interest at the rate of 12% is applicable in the instant case.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>Anent the interest rate, the general rule is that the applicable rate of interest “shall be computed in accordance with the stipulation of the parties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Absent any stipulation, the applicable rate of interest shall be 12% per annum “when the obligation arises out of a loan or a forbearance of money, goods or credits.&nbsp; In other cases, it shall be six percent (6%).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the parties did not stipulate as to the applicable rate of interest.&nbsp; The only question remaining therefore is whether the 6% as provided under Article 2209 of the Civil Code, or 12% under Central Bank Circular No. 416, is due.<br><br>The contract involved in this case is admittedly not a loan but a Conditional Deed of Sale.&nbsp; However, the contract provides that the seller (petitioner) must return the payment made by the buyer (respondent-spouses) if the conditions are not fulfilled.&nbsp; There is no question that they have in fact, not been fulfilled as the seller (petitioner) has admitted this.&nbsp; Notwithstanding demand by the buyer (respondent-spouses),&nbsp; the&nbsp; seller&nbsp; (petitioner)&nbsp; has&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; return&nbsp; the money and<br><br>should be considered in default from the time that demand was made on September 27, 2000.<br><br>Even if the transaction involved a Conditional Deed of Sale, can the stipulation governing the return of the money be considered as a forbearance of money which required payment of interest at the rate of 12%?&nbsp; We believe so.<br><br>In <i>Crismina Garments, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> “forbearance” was defined as a “contractual obligation of lender or creditor to refrain during a given period of time, from requiring the borrower or debtor to repay a <u>loan or debt</u> then due and payable.”&nbsp; This definition describes a loan where a debtor is given a period within which to pay a loan or debt.&nbsp; In such case, “forbearance of money, goods or credits” will have no distinct definition from a loan.&nbsp; We believe however, that the phrase “forbearance of money, goods or credits” is meant to have a separate meaning from a loan, otherwise there would have been no need to add that phrase as a loan is already sufficiently defined in the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Forbearance of money, goods or credits should therefore refer to arrangements other than loan agreements, where a person acquiesces to the temporary use of his money, goods or credits pending happening of certain events or fulfillment of certain conditions.&nbsp; In this case, the respondent-spouses parted with their money even before the conditions were fulfilled.&nbsp; They have therefore allowed or granted forbearance to the seller (petitioner) to use their money pending fulfillment of the conditions.&nbsp; They were deprived of the use of their money for the period pending fulfillment of the conditions and when those conditions were breached, they are entitled not only to the return of the principal amount paid, but also to compensation for the use of their money.&nbsp; And the compensation for the use of their money, absent any stipulation, should be the same rate of legal interest applicable to a loan since the use or deprivation of funds is similar to a loan.<br><br>Petitioner’s unwarranted withholding of the money which rightfully pertains to respondent-spouses amounts to forbearance of money which can be considered as an involuntary loan.&nbsp; Thus, the applicable rate of interest is 12% per annum.&nbsp; In <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>cited in <i>Crismina Garments, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; the Court suggested the following guidelines:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>When an obligation, regardless of its source, i.e., law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages.&nbsp; The provisions under Title XVIII on ‘Damages’ of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.<br><br></li><li><b>With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows</b>:<br><br><ol><li><b>When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing.&nbsp; Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. </b> <u><b>In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.</b></u><br><br></li><li>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum.&nbsp; No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).&nbsp; The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br></li><li>When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></li></ol><br></li></ol></blockquote><i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.

Tongol</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> both involved torts cases and hence, there was no forbearance of money, goods, or credits.&nbsp; Further, the amount claimed (<i>i.e.</i>, damages) could not be established with reasonable certainty at the time the claim was made.&nbsp; Hence, we arrived at a different ruling in those cases.<br><br>Since the date of demand which is September 27, 2000 was satisfactorily established during trial, then the interest rate of 12% should be reckoned from said date of demand until the principal amount and the interest thereon is fully satisfied.<br><br><i><b>The award of attorney’s fees is warranted.</b></i><br><br>Under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, attorney’s fees may be recovered:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(2) When the defendant’s act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.<br><br>In all cases, the attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation must be reasonable.</blockquote><br>Considering the circumstances of the instant case, we find respondent-spouses entitled to recover attorney’s fees.&nbsp; There is no doubt that they were forced to litigate to protect their interest, <i>i.e.</i>, to recover their money.&nbsp; However, we find the amount of P50,000.00 more appropriate in line with the policy enunciated in Article 2208 of the Civil Code that the award of attorney’s fees must always be reasonable.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition for Review is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The May 12, 2006 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
