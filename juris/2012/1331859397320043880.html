The legality of the manner of dismissal constitutes procedural due process, while the legality of the act of dismissal constitutes substantive due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Procedural due process in dismissal cases consists of the twin requirements of notice and hearing. The employer must furnish the employee with two written notices before the termination of employment can be effected: (1) the first notice apprises the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which his dismissal is sought; and (2) the second notice informs the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him. Before the issuance of the second notice, the requirement of a hearing must be complied with by giving the worker an opportunity to be heard. It is not necessary that an actual hearing be conducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Substantive due process, on the other hand, requires that dismissal by the employer be made under a just or authorized cause under Articles 282 to 284 of the Labor Code.<br><br>In this case, there was no written notice furnished to De Gracia, et al. regarding the cause of their dismissal. Cosmoship furnished a written notice (telex) to Skippers, the local manning agency, claiming that De Gracia, et al. were repatriated because the latter voluntarily pre-terminated their contracts. This telex was given credibility and weight by the Labor Arbiter and NLRC in deciding that there was pre-termination of the employment contract "akin to resignation" and no illegal dismissal. However, as correctly ruled by the CA, the telex message is "a biased and self-serving document that does not satisfy the requirement of substantial evidence." If, indeed, De Gracia, et al. voluntarily pre-terminated their contracts, then De Gracia, et al. should have submitted their written resignations.<br><br>Article 285 of the Labor Code recognizes termination by the employee of the employment contract by "serving written notice on the employer at least one (1) month in advance." Given that provision, the law contemplates the requirement of a written notice of resignation. In the absence of a written resignation, it is safe to presume that the employer terminated the seafarers. In addition, the telex message relied upon by the Labor Arbiter and NLRC bore conflicting dates of 22 January 1998 and 22 January 1999, giving doubt to the veracity and authenticity of the document. In 22 January 1998, De Gracia, et al. were not even employed yet by the foreign principal. For these reasons, the dismissal of De Gracia, et al. was illegal.<br><br>On the issue of home allotment pay, Skippers effectively admitted non-remittance of home allotment pay for the month of December 1998 in its Position Paper. Skippers sought the repatriation expenses to be offset with the home allotment pay. However, since De Gracia, et al.'s dismissal was illegal, their repatriation expenses were for the account of Skippers and could not be offset with the home allotment pay.<br><br>Contrary to the claim of the Labor Arbiter and NLRC that the home allotment pay is in "the nature of extraordinary money where the burden of proof is shifted to the worker who must prove he is entitled to such monetary benefit," Section 8 of POEA Memorandum Circular No. 55, series of 1996, states that the allotment actually constitutes <b><u>at least eighty percent (80%) of the seafarer's salary</u></b>:<br><br><blockquote>The seafarer is required to make an allotment which is payable once a month to his designated allottee in the Philippines through any authorized Philippine bank. The master/employer/agency shall provide the seafarer with facilities to do so at no expense to the seafarer. The allotment shall be <b><u>at least eighty percent </u>(80%) </b>of the seafarer's monthly basic salary including backwages, if any. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Paragraph 2 of the employment contracts of De Gracia, Lata and Aprosta incorporated the provisions of above Memorandum Circular No. 55, series of 1996, in the employment contracts. Since said memorandum states that home allotment of seafarers actually constitutes at least eighty percent (80%) of their salary, home allotment pay is not in the nature of an extraordinary money or benefit, but should actually be considered as salary which should be paid for services rendered. For this reason, such non-remittance of home allotment pay should be considered as unpaid salaries, and Skippers shall be liable to pay the home allotment pay of De Gracia, et al. for the month of December 1998.<br><br><center><u><b>Damages</b></u></center><br>As admitted by Skippers in its Position Paper, the home allotment pay for December 1998 due to De Gracia, Lata and Aprosta is:<br><br><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <colgroup><col width="128*"><col width="128*"> </colgroup><tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"> <div align="CENTER">Seafarer </div></td> <td width="50%"> <div align="CENTER">Home Allotment Pay </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="CENTER">De Gracia </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER">US$900.00 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="CENTER">Aprosta </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER">US$600.00 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="CENTER">Lata </div></td> <td> <div align="CENTER">US$600.00 </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>The monthly salary of De Gracia, according to his employment contract, is only US$800.00. However, since Skippers admitted in its Position Paper a higher home allotment pay for De Gracia, we award the higher amount of home allotment pay for De Gracia in the amount of US$900.00. Since the home allotment pay can be considered as unpaid salaries, the peso equivalent of the dollar amount should be computed using the prevailing rate at the time of termination since it was due and demandable to De Gracia, et al. on 28 January 1999.<br><br>Section 10 of Republic Act No. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act) provides for money claims in cases of unjust termination of employment contracts:<br><br><blockquote>In case of termination of overseas employment without just, valid or authorized cause as defined by law or contract, the workers shall be entitled to the full reimbursement of his placement fee with interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum, plus his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract or for three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less.</blockquote><br>The Migrant Workers Act provides that salaries for the unexpired portion of the employent contract or three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less, shall be awarded to the overseas Filipino worker, in cases of illegal dismissal. However, in 24 March 2009, <i>Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services and Marlow Navigation Co. Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court, in an En Banc Decision, declared unconstitutional the clause "or for three months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less" and awarded the entire unexpired portion of the employment contract to the overseas Filipino worker.<br><br>On 8 March 2010, however, Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10022 (RA 10022) amended Section 10 of the Migrant Workers Act, and once again reiterated the provision of awarding the unexpired portion of the employent contract or three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less.<br><br>Nevertheless, since the termination occurred on January 1999 before the passage of the amendatory RA 10022, we shall apply RA 8042, as unamended, without touching on the constitutionality of Section 7 of RA 10022.<br><br>The declaration in March 2009 of the unconstitutionality of the clause "or for three months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less" in RA 8042 shall be given retroactive effect to the termination that occurred in January 1999 because an unconstitutional clause in the law confers no rights, imposes no duties and affords no protection.

Exemplary or corrective damages are imposed, by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages.</blockquote><br>In this case, we agree with the CA in not awarding moral and exemplary damages for lack of factual basis.<br><br>Lastly, Article 2208 of the Civil Code provides for recovery of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) When exemplary damages are awarded;<br>(2) When the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest;<br>(3) In criminal cases of malicious prosecution against the plaintiff;<br>(4) In case of a clearly unfounded civil action or proceeding against the plaintiff;<br>(5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable claim;<br>(6) In actions for legal support;<br>(7) In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;<br>(8) In actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws;<br>(9) In a separate civil action to recover civil liability arising from a crime;<br>(10) When at least double judicial costs are awarded;<br>(11) In any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.<br><br></div>In all cases, the attorney's fees and expenses of litigation must be reasonable.<br></blockquote><br>Article 111 of the Labor Code provides for a maximum award of attorney's fees in cases of recovery of wages:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 111.
