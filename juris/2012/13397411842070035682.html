Clearly, under the said resolution, petitioner’s authority to operate the cockpit would end on December 31, 1992 or upon compliance by the winning bidder with the legal requirements for operating a cockpit, whichever comes first.&nbsp; As we see it, the only reason he was able to continue operating until July 1997 was because the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Mabini failed to monitor the status of the cockpit in their municipality.<br><br>And even if he was able to get a business permit from respondent mayor for the period January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997, this did not give him a license to operate a cockpit.&nbsp; Under Section 447(a)(3)(v) of the LGC, it is the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> which is empowered to “authorize and license the establishment, operation and maintenance of cockpits, and regulate cockfighting and commercial breeding of gamecocks.”&nbsp; Considering that no public bidding was conducted for the operation of a cockpit from January 1, 1993 to December 31, 1997, petitioner cannot claim that he was duly authorized by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> to operate his cockpit in the municipality for the period January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997.&nbsp; Respondent members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan,</i> therefore, had every reason to suspend the operation of petitioner’s cockpit by enacting Municipal Resolution No. 065, series of 1997. As the chief executive of the municipal government, respondent mayor was duty-bound to enforce the suspension of the operation of petitioner’s cockpit pursuant to the said Resolution.<br><br>It bears stressing that no evidence was presented to show that upon review by the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Bohol, the resolution was declared invalid or that the resolution was issued beyond the powers of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> or mayor. Jurisprudence consistently holds that an ordinance, or in this case a resolution, is “presumed valid in the absence of evidence showing that it is not in accordance with the law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, we find no reason to invalidate Municipal Resolution No. 065, series of 1997.<br><br><b><i>License to operate a cockpit is a mere privilege.&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>In addition, it is well enshrined in our jurisprudence that “a license authorizing the operation and exploitation of a cockpit is not property of which the holder may not be deprived without due process of law, but a mere privilege that may be revoked when public interests so require.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Having said that, petitioner’s allegation that he was deprived of due process has no leg to stand on.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner not entitled to damages</i></b><br><br>Without any legal right to operate a cockpit in the municipality, petitioner is not entitled to damages.&nbsp; Injury alone does not give petitioner the right to recover damages; he must also have a right of action for the legal wrong inflicted by the respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; We need not belabor that “in order that the law will give redress for an act causing damage, there must be <i>damnum et injuria</i> – that act must be not only hurtful, but wrongful.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>All told, we find no error on the part of the CA in dismissing petitioner’s case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision dated July 11, 2006 and the Resolution dated October 4, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
