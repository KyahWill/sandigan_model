Valdez), received an information from a confidential informant about the illegal drug trade operations conducted by the Fundales brothers. P/Supt. Valdez thus formed a buy-bust team composed of PO1 Ariel Ilagan, PO1 Cesarie Soquiña (PO1 Soquiña), PO1 Emmanuel Salvaloza, PO3 Regalado Adriatico and CE Ronald Tangcoy. The group then proceeded to 008 Jordan Street, Sitio Nazareth, <i>Barangay</i> San Isidro, Parañaque City for the buy-bust operation.<br><br>The group arrived in the vicinity of the target area at around 9:00 p.m.8 PO1 Soquiña, who was designated as the poseur-buyer, and the informant proceeded to the house of the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The team remained inside their vehicles about 20 meters away from the target area. The informant then introduced PO1 Soquiña to the appellant as the person interested in buying <i>shabu</i> worth P500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After PO1 Soquiña handed the P500.00 marked money to the appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the latter then went inside his house and when he reappeared, he handed to PO1 Soquiña five plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> PO1 Soquiña then lit a cigarette which was the pre-arranged signal to inform the rest of the team that the buy-bust operation had been consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Hence, the team of back-up police officers proceeded to appellant’s house to apprehend him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Inside the house, the police officers saw Jerico, Ricardo, Chulo, and Joel who appeared to be engaged in a pot session hence they were also arrested along with the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The five sachets of white crystalline substance sold by appellant, together with one sachet obtained from the group and the drug paraphernalia, were immediately marked and inventoried. The same were then submitted to the crime laboratory of the Philippine National Police (PNP) for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> After conducting a forensic examination, P/Insp. Richard Allan B. Mangalip (Mangalip), Chief of the Physical Science Section and Forensic Chemical Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, issued Physical Science Report No. D-1402-03S<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> confirming that the specimen submitted yielded positive for the presence of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride.<br><br><i><b>Version of the Defense</b></i><br><br>On December 2, 2003, appellant was at home with Ricardo, Chulo, Joel, and Jerico repairing a washing machine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> At around 4:30 p.m., eight persons suddenly entered his house without warning and permission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Aside from their weapons and handcuffs, there was no indication that the men were police officers since they were all in civilian clothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Once inside, the men shouted, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Walang gagalaw, sumama kayo sa amin</span>”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> They were then brought to the Coastal Police Station and detained there for two days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On March 18, 2006, the RTC rendered its Decision convicting appellant in Criminal Case No. 03-1425 for illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> and dismissing Criminal Case No. 03-1426 for illegal possession of dangerous drugs and Criminal Case No. 03 1427 for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia, for insufficiency of evidence.

The object of the transaction was the five sachets of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i> and the consideration was the P500.00 marked money. Both such object and consideration have also been sufficiently established by testimonial and documentary evidence presented by the prosecution. As to the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor, PO1 Soquiña caught appellant<i> in flagrante delicto</i> selling and delivering the prohibited substance during a buy- bust operation. He also personally handed to appellant the marked money as payment for the same. Clearly, the above-mentioned elements are present in this case.<br><br>Appellant insists that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He argues that the prosecution’s failure to present the forensic chemist during trial was fatal to its cause. According to the appellant, the laboratory report has no probative value since the forensic chemist did not attest to the report’s authenticity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In view of this, he points out that the prosecution failed to establish the <i>corpus delicti.</i><br><br>This Court is not persuaded. We have already ruled in a number of cases that non-presentation of the forensic chemist in illegal drugs cases is an insufficient cause for acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Quebral</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we held thus:<br><br><blockquote>The accused-appellants also point out that, since the chemist who examined the seized substance did not testify in court, the prosecution was unable to establish the indispensable element of <i>corpus delicti.</i> But this claim is unmeritorious. This Court has held that the non-presentation of the forensic chemist in illegal drug cases is an insufficient cause for acquittal. The<i> corpus delicti</i> in dangerous drugs cases constitutes the dangerous drug itself. This means that proof beyond doubt of the identity of the prohibited drug is essential.<br><br>Besides, <i>corpus delicti </i>has nothing to do with the testimony of the laboratory analyst. In fact, this Court has ruled that the report of an official forensic chemist regarding a recovered prohibited drug enjoys the presumption of regularity in its preparation. Corollarily, under Section 44 of Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court, entries in official records made in the performance of official duty are <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts they state. Therefore, the report of Forensic Chemical Officer Sta. Maria that the five plastic sachets PO3 Galvez gave to her for examination contained <i>shabu </i>is conclusive in the absence of evidence proving the contrary. x x x (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>Thus, it is of no moment that Forensic Chemical Officer Mangalip was not presented as witness. The non-presentation as witnesses of other persons who had custody of the illegal drugs is not a crucial point against the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> “It is the prosecution which has the discretion as to how to present its case and it has the right to choose whom it wishes to present as witnesses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> What is important is that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs are properly preserved as it had been so in this case.<br><br>Besides, it has not escaped our attention that during the proceedings before the trial court, both the prosecution and the defense agreed to dispense with the testimony of the forensic chemist. During the trial held on August 19, 2004, the parties stipulated as regards the probative value of the documents and physical evidence marked as Exhibits “A” to “C.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Exhibit “A” pertained to the letter request for laboratory examination of the specimens. Exhibit “B” was the specimen subject to laboratory examination; while Exhibit “C” was the Physical Science Report No. D-1402-03S submitted by the forensic chemist. The parties likewise stipulated that it was Forensic Chemical Officer Mangalip who conducted a qualitative examination on the specimens.<br><br>Appellant next claims that the pieces of evidence adduced by the prosecution were obtained in violation of Sections 21 and 86(a) of RA No. 9165 regarding the proper custody and disposition of seized narcotic substances and dangerous drugs. He also avers that the prosecution failed to prove that the police officers coordinated and reported the buy-bust operation with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).<br><br>The provisions of RA No. 9165 cited by the appellant are meant to safeguard the accused in drugs cases against abuses of law enforcement officers. They provide for the proper handling of confiscated dangerous drugs in order to prevent malicious imputations of guilt upon an unsuspecting accused.<br><br>However, as correctly ruled by the CA, this Court has already held in<i> People v. Sta. Maria</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he failure of the law enforcers to comply strictly with Section 21 was not fatal. It did not render [the] appellant’s arrest illegal nor the evidence adduced against him inadmissible.<br><br>The law excuses non-compliance under justifiable grounds. However, whatever justifiable grounds may excuse the police officers involved in the buy- bust operation in this case from complying with Section 21 will remain unknown, because appellant did not question during trial the safekeeping of the items seized from him. Indeed, the police officers’ alleged violations of Sections 21 and 86 of Republic Act No. 9165 were not raised before the trial court but were instead raised for the first time on appeal. In no instance did appellant least intimate at the trial court that there were lapses in the safekeeping of seized items that affected their integrity and evidentiary value. Objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; when a party desires the court to reject the evidence offered, he must so state in the form of objection. Without such objection he cannot raise the question for the first time on appeal.</blockquote><br>As in the above-quoted case, the appellant here did not question during trial the alleged improper handling of the items seized from him, it being the proper time for him to raise such objections. We cannot thus accept such belated argument of the appellant especially so when the integrity of the items seized from him was shown to have been preserved. Evidence on record shows that the seized drugs were inventoried. “Slight infractions or nominal deviations by the police from the prescribed method of handling the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> should not exculpate an otherwise guilty defendant.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Appellant further claims that the police officers failed to coordinate and report the buy-bust operation with the PDEA. To appellant, this tainted the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty of the police officers. He likewise posits that the arresting officers had insufficient authority to conduct the said operation. <br><br>Section 86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of RA No. 9165 deals with inter-agency relations of the PNP and other law enforcement agencies with the PDEA. It is an administrative provision designating the PDEA as the lead agency in dangerous drugs cases. We have already ruled that nothing in RA No. 9165 suggests that it is the intention of the legislature to make an arrest in drugs cases illegal if made without the participation of the PDEA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In the implementing rules and regulations of RA No. 9165, Section 86(a) clearly states:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Relationship/Coordination between the PDEA and Other Agencies. – <b>The PDEA shall be the lead agency in the enforcement of the Act, while the PNP, the NBI and other law enforcement agencies shall continue to conduct antidrug operations in support of the PDEA xxx</b> Provided, finally, that nothing in this IRR shall deprive the PNP, the NBI, other law enforcement personnel and the personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) from effecting lawful arrests and seizures in consonance with the provisions of Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court. (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote><br>Suffice it to state that in this case, the danger of abuse that the provision seeks to prevent is not present. We therefore see no reason why the non- participation of the PDEA would render the arrest illegal and the evidence obtained therein inadmissible considering that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized prohibited substances and dangerous drugs have been properly preserved.<br><br>Appellant further asserts that no buy-bust operation took place contrary to the testimony of the arresting officers. He claims that on the day of the alleged buy-bust operation, he was at home repairing a washing machine.<br><br>Appellant’s contention does not deserve serious consideration. It is well- settled that the testimonies of the police officers in dangerous drugs cases carry with it the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions. “Law enforcers are presumed to have performed their duties regularly in the absence of evidence to the contrary.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, PO1 Soquiña narrated in a straightforward manner the circumstances leading to the sale of <i>shabu</i>. He positively and categorically identified appellant as the seller of the drugs. Absent any clear showing that the arresting officers had ill motive to falsely testify against the appellant, their testimonies must be respected and the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties must be upheld. Appellant himself testified that he never had any personal encounter with the police prior to his arrest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> thus negating any ill-motive on the part of the police officers.<br><br>The appellant, on the other hand, offers mere denial as his defense. He claims that he was merely fixing a washing machine at the time of the arrest and that the alleged buy-bust operation was fictitious. However, other than his own self-serving testimony, appellant has not offered any evidence to support this claim. We have held that “[a] bare denial is an inherently weak defense x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Appellant’s denial is unsubstantiated by any credible and convincing evidence. Between the positive and categorical testimonies of the arresting officers on one hand, and the unsubstantiated denial of the appellant on the other, we are inclined to uphold the former.<br><br>All told, this Court thus sustains the RTC's conviction of the appellant for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA No. 9165, as affirmed by the CA.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
