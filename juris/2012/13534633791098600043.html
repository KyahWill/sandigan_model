SP No. 76147, directing respondent judge “to continue with the proceedings in [LRC Case No. 2128-02] and eventually to issue the required writ of possession in favor of [Metrobank] over the foreclosed properties.”&nbsp; The foregoing directive was anchored on the second paragraph of Section 47 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8741.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding the Rehabilitation Plan submitted by TCEI feasible, on the other hand, the rehabilitation court issued the Order dated 29 March 2004 in SEC Case No. 023-02,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the decretal portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote>CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby approves the Rehabilitation Plan of [TCEI] thereby granting [TCEI] a moratorium of five (5) years from today in the payment of all its obligations, together with the corresponding interests, to its creditor banks, subject to the modification that the interest charges shall be reduced from 36% to 24% per annum.&nbsp; After the five-year grace period, [TCEI] shall commence to pay its existing obligations with its creditor banks monthly within a period of three (3) years.<br><br>[TCEI] is enjoined to comply strictly with the provisions of the Rehabilitation Plan, perform its obligations thereunder and take all actions necessary to carry out the Plan, failing which, the Court shall either, upon motion, motu proprio or upon the recommendation of the Rehabilitation Receiver, terminate the proceeding pursuant to SECTION 27, Rule 4 of the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation.<br><br>The Rehabilitation Receiver is directed to strictly monitor the implementation of the Plan and submit a quarterly report on the progress thereof.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On 11 January 2005, the RTC issued in LRC Case No. 2128-02 an order granting Metrobank’s petition for issuance of a writ of possession and directing the Clerk of Court to issue the writ therein sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Aggrieved, TCEI and the Spouses Campos perfected the appeal which was docketed before the CA as CA-G.R.

SP No. 76147.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Insisting that the transfers of title in Metrobank’s name was violative of the Stay Order issued in SEC Case No. 023-02, TCEI filed the 17 June 2005 Rule 43 petition for review which was docketed before the CA as CA-G.R. SP No. 90311.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; On 24 May 2006, said court’s Sixteenth Division rendered the second assailed decision, dismissing TCEI’s petition for lack of merit on the ground that Metrobank was already the owner of the foreclosed properties by the time the Stay Order was issued on 8 October 2002.&nbsp; For this purpose, the CA took appropriate note of the fact that, in the 30 January 2004 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 76147, Metrobank’s ownership of the foreclosed properties was considered consolidated for failure of TCEI to exercise its right of redemption within three months from the foreclosure sale or the registration of the certificate of sale in accordance with Sec. 47 of Republic Act (RA) No. 8791.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Considering that said 30 January 2004 Decision had already attained finality, the CA also ruled that the determinations therein made already amounted to <i>res judicata</i> and that, as a consequence, TCEI’s petition for review was equivalent to forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; TCEI’s motion for reconsideration was likewise denied for lack of merit in the CA’s Resolution dated 14 August 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> hence its Rule 45 petition for review now docketed before us as G.R. No. 174132.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In G.R. No. 173610, <b><i>petitioners</i></b> TCEI and the Spouses Campos seek the reversal of the CA’s 30 November 2005 Decision in CA-G.R.

No. 174132, on the other hand, the setting aside of the CA’s 24 May 2006 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 90311 is urged by TCEI on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote><b></b><ol style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><li>The Register of Deeds cannot legally transfer the titles subject matter of the Petition for Rehabilitation in favor of Metrobank on 26 June 2003 in view of the existence of the Stay Order on 8 October 2002 prohibiting the enforcement of claims and the subsequent judgment approving the Rehabilitation Plan in favor of Petitioner.<br><br></li><li>The Register of Deeds should cancel the titles issued to Metrobank on 26 June 2003 and re-issue titles in favor of TCEI as the same was made in violation of the Stay Order and the Rehabilitation Proceedings as the Decision therein binds the whole world being a proceeding in rem.<br><br></li><li>The Decision of the CA failed to take into consideration the far reaching effects of a Petition for Rehabilitation as against a Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Possession which is ex-parte and not a judicial proceeding.</li></ol><b></b></blockquote><br>We find both petitions bereft of merit.<br><br>Corporate rehabilitation contemplates a continuance of corporate life and activities in an effort to restore and reinstate the corporation to its former position of successful operation and solvency, the purpose being to enable the company to gain a new lease on life and allow its creditors to be paid their claims out of its earnings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; A principal feature of corporate rehabilitation is the Stay Order which defers all actions or claims against the corporation seeking corporate rehabilitation from the date of its issuance until the dismissal of the petition or termination of the rehabilitation proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Under Section 24, Rule 4 of the <i>Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation</i> which was in force at the time TCEI filed its petition for rehabilitation a quo, the approval of the rehabilitation plan also produces the following results:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>The plan and its provisions shall be binding upon the debtor and all persons who may be affected by it, including the creditors, whether or not such persons have participated in the proceedings or opposed the plan or whether or not their claims have been scheduled;<br><br></li><li>The debtor shall comply with the provisions of the plan and shall take all actions necessary to carry out the plan;<br><br></li><li>Payments shall be made to the creditors in accordance with the provisions of the plan;<br><br></li><li>Contracts and other arrangements between the debtor and its creditors shall be interpreted as continuing to apply to the extent that they do not conflict with the provisions of the plan; and<br><br></li><li>Any compromises on amounts or rescheduling of timing of payments by the debtor shall be binding on creditors regardless of whether or not the plan is successfully implemented.</li></ol></blockquote><br>In addition to the issuance of the Stay Order in SEC Case No. 023-02 on 8 October 2002, petitioners call attention to the fact that the Rehabilitation Court approved TCEI’s rehabilitation plan in the Order dated 29 March 2004.&nbsp; Considering that orders issued by the Rehabilitation Court are immediately executory under Section 5, Rule 3 of the <i>Interim Rules</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> petitioners argue that the subject properties were placed in <i>custodia legis</i> upon approval of TCEI’s rehabilitation plan and that the grant of the writ of possession in favor of Metrobank was tantamount to taking said properties away from the rehabilitation receiver.&nbsp; Petitioners maintain that the rehabilitation receiver, as an officer of the court empowered to take possession, control and custody of the debtor’s assets,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> should have been considered a third person whose possession of the foreclosed properties was an exception to the rule that the grant of a writ of possession is ministerial.&nbsp; For these reasons, petitioners claim that the writ of possession issued in favor of Metrobank is invalid and unenforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The dearth of merit in petitioners’ position is, however, evident from the fact that, Metrobank had already acquired ownership over the subject realties when TCEI commenced its petition for corporate rehabilitation on 1 October 2002.&nbsp; Although Metrobank concededly invoked Act No. 3135 in seeking the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages executed by TCEI, the second paragraph of Section 47 of RA 8791 – the law in force at said time – specifically provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 47.<i> Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage.</i> – x x x x<br><br>Notwithstanding Act 3135, juridical persons whose property is being sold pursuant to an extrajudicial foreclosure, shall have the right to redeem the property in accordance with this provision until, but not after, the registration of the certificate of foreclosure sale with the applicable Register of Deeds which in no case shall be more than three (3) months after foreclosure, whichever is earlier.&nbsp; Owners of property that has been sold in a foreclosure sale prior to the effectivity of this Act shall retain their redemption rights until their expiration.<br></blockquote><br>Having purchased the subject realties at public auction on 7 November 2001, Metrobank undoubtedly acquired ownership over the same when TCEI failed to exercise its right of redemption within the three-month period prescribed under the foregoing provision. With ownership already vested in its favor as of 6 February 2002, it matters little that Metrobank caused the certificate of sale to be registered with the Cavite Provincial Registry only on 10 April 2002 and/or executed an affidavit consolidating its ownership over the same properties only on 25 April 2003. The rule is settled that the mortgagor loses all interest over the foreclosed property after the expiration of the redemption period and the purchaser becomes the absolute owner thereof when no redemption is made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; By the time that the Rehabilitation Court issued the 8 October 2002 Stay Order in SEC Case No. 023-02, it cannot, therefore, be gainsaid that Metrobank had long acquired ownership over the subject realties.<br><br>Viewed in the foregoing light, the CA cannot be faulted for upholding the RTC’s grant of a writ of possession in favor of Metrobank on 11 January 2005.&nbsp; If the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, upon posting of the requisite bond, is entitled to a writ of possession even during the redemption period under Section 7 of Act 3135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> as amended, it has been consistently ruled that there is no reason to withhold said writ after the expiration of the redemption period when no redemption is effected by the mortgagor.&nbsp; Indeed, the rule is settled that the right of the purchaser to the possession of the foreclosed property becomes absolute after the redemption period, without a redemption being effected by the property owner.&nbsp; Since the basis of this right to possession is the purchaser's ownership of the property, the mere filing of an <i>ex parte </i>motion for the issuance of the writ of possession would suffice, and no bond is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Considering that Metrobank acquired ownership over the mortgaged properties upon the expiration of the redemption period on 6 February 2002, TCEI is also out on a limb in invoking the Stay Order issued by the Rehabilitation Court on 8 October 2002 and the approval of its rehabilitation plan on 29 March 2004.&nbsp; An essential function of corporate rehabilitation is, admittedly, the Stay Order which is a mechanism of suspension of all actions and claims against the distressed corporation upon the due appointment of a management committee or rehabilitation receiver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stay Order issued by the Rehabilitation Court in SEC Case No. 023-02 cannot, however, apply to the mortgage obligations owing to Metrobank which had already been enforced even before TCEI’s filing of its petition for corporate rehabilitation on 1 October 2002.<br><br>In <i>Equitable PCI Bank, Inc v. DNG Realty and Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court upheld the validity of the writ of possession procured by the creditor despite the subsequent issuance of a stay order in the rehabilitation proceedings instituted by the debtor.&nbsp; In said case, Equitable PCI Bank (<i>Equitable</i>) foreclosed on 30 June 2003 the mortgage executed in its favor by DNG Realty and Development Corporation (DNG) and was declared the highest bidder at the 4 September 2003 public auction of the property.&nbsp; On 21 October 2003, DNG also instituted a petition for corporate rehabilitation which resulted in the issuance of a Stay Order on 27 October 2003.&nbsp; Having caused the recording of the Certificate of Sale on 3 December 2003, on the other hand, Equitable executed an affidavit of consolidation of its ownership which served as basis for the issuance of a new title in its favor on 10 December 2003.&nbsp; Equitable subsequently filed an action for the issuance of a writ of possession on 17 March 2004 which was eventually granted on 6 September 2004.&nbsp; In affirming the validity of the certificate of sale, certificate of title and writ of possession issued in favor of Equitable, the Court ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In RCBC, we upheld the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of the mortgage properties of BF Homes wherein RCBC emerged as the highest bidder as it was done before the appointment of the management committee. Noteworthy to mention was the fact that the issuance of the certificate of sale in RCBC’s favor, the consolidation of title, and the issuance of the new titles in RCBC’s name had also been upheld notwithstanding that the same were all done after the management committee had already been appointed and there was already a suspension of claims. Thus, applying RCBC v. IAC in this case, since the foreclosure of respondent DNG's mortgage and the issuance of the certificate of sale in petitioner EPCIB's favor were done prior to the appointment of a Rehabilitation Receiver and the Stay Order, all the actions taken with respect to the foreclosed mortgage property which were subsequent to the issuance of the Stay Order were not affected by the Stay Order. Thus, <i>after the redemption period expired without respondent redeeming the foreclosed property, petitioner becomes the absolute owner of the property and it was within its right to ask for the consolidation of title and the issuance of new title in its name as a consequence of ownership; thus, it is entitled to the possession and enjoyment of the property.</i> (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br>A similar dearth of merit may be said of TCEI’s claim that the subject properties were in <i>custodia legis</i> upon the issuance of the Stay Order and the approval of the rehabilitation plan fails to persuade.&nbsp; As early as 7 February 2002 or three months after the foreclosure sale on 7 November 2001, Metrobank acted well-within its rights in applying for a writ of possession, the issuance of which has consistently been held to be a ministerial function which cannot be hindered by an injunction or an action for the annulment of the mortgage or the foreclosure itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; While it is true that the function ceases to be ministerial where the property is in the possession of a third party claiming a right adverse to that of the judgment debtor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the rehabilitation receiver’s power to take possession, control and custody of TCEI’s assets is far from adverse to the latter.&nbsp; A rehabilitation receiver is an officer of the court who is appointed for the protection of the interests of the corporate investors and creditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; It has been ruled that there is nothing in the concept of corporate rehabilitation that would <i>ipso facto</i> deprive the officers of a debtor corporation of control over its business or properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Neither are we inclined to hospitably entertain TCEI’s harping on the supposed primacy of the one-year redemption period provided under Act 3135 over the three-month redemption period provided under the second paragraph of Section 47 of RA 8791 where the property being sold pursuant to an extrajudicial foreclosure is owned by a juridical person.&nbsp; As may be gleaned from the record, Metrobank’s acquisition of the subject properties would still pass muster even if tested alongside the longer redemption period provided under Act 3135.&nbsp; Having purchased the same properties at public auction on 7 November 2001, Metrobank was issued a 13 December 2001 certificate of sale which it caused to be registered on 10 April 2002.&nbsp; Despite the shorter redemption period provided under RA 8791, Metrobank also executed an affidavit of consolidation of ownership over the subject realties on 25 April 2003 or after the lapse of the one-year redemption period provided under Act 3135.<br><br>Not having exercised its right of redemption in the intervening period, TCEI cannot be heard to complain about the cancellation of its titles and the issuance of new ones in favor of Metrobank on 26 June 2003.&nbsp; In <i>Union Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court ruled that, after the purchaser’s consolidation of title over foreclosed property, the issuance of a certificate of title in his favor is ministerial upon the Register of Deeds, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In real estate mortgage, when the principal obligation is not paid when due, the mortgage has the right to foreclose the mortgage and to have the property seized and sold with a view to applying the proceeds to the payment of the principal obligation. Foreclosure may be effected either judicially or extrajudicially. In a public bidding during extra-judicial foreclosure, the creditor-mortgagee, trustee, or other person authorized to act for the creditor may participate and purchase the mortgaged property as any other bidder. Thereafter the mortgagor has one year within which to redeem the property from and after registration of sale with the Register of Deeds. In case of non-redemption, the purchaser at foreclosure sale shall file with the Register of Deeds, either a final deed of sale executed by the person authorized by virtue of the power of attorney embodied in the deed or mortgage, or his sworn statement attesting to the fact of non-redemption; whereupon, the Register of Deeds shall issue a new certificate of title in favor of the purchaser after the owner's duplicate of the certificate has been previously delivered and cancelled. Thus, upon failure to redeem foreclosed realty, consolidation of title becomes a matter of right on the part of the auction buyer, and the issuance of a certificate of title in favor of the purchaser becomes ministerial upon the Register of Deeds.</blockquote><br>In upholding the RTC’s denial of its motion for the cancellation of the certificates of title issued in favor of Metrobank, TCEI, finally, argues that the CA erroneously gave more premium to the <i>ex-parte</i> proceedings for the issuance of a writ of possession over those in the corporate rehabilitation case which, being <i>in rem</i>, binds the whole world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the fact that this matter had already been addressed in the 30 January 2004 Decision earlier rendered in CA-G.R. SP No. 76147, TCEI loses sight of the fact, that the proceedings in corporate rehabilitation cases are also summary and non-adversarial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and do not impair the debtor’s contracts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> or diminish the status of preferred creditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Concededly, the issuance of the Stay Order suspends the enforcement of all claims against the debtor, whether for money or otherwise, and whether such enforcement is by court action or otherwise, effective from the date of its issuance until the dismissal of the petition or the termination of the rehabilitation proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not, however, apply to&nbsp; Metrobank&nbsp; which&nbsp; already acquired ownership&nbsp; over the subject realties even before TCEI filed its petition for rehabilitation <i>a quo</i>.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, both petitions for review on certiorari are <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Brion</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> As per Special Order No. 1308 dated 21 September 2012.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Penned by Justice Ruben T.
