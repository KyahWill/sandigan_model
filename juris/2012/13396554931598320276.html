				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal filed by the accused-appellant Joseph Asilan y Tabornal (Asilan) to challenge the February 25, 2009 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in <b>CA-G.R. CR.-H.C.

Mesa, Manila, heard a gunshot nearby.&nbsp; He then went to the place where the sound came and from where he was standing which was about three (3) to four (4) meters away, he saw a uniformed policeman, who seemed to be arresting someone and ordering the latter to lay on the ground.<br><br>The police officer pushed the man to the wall, poked the gun on him and was about to handcuff the latter when another man, herein appellant Asilan arrived, drew something from his back and stabbed the police officer on his back several times until the latter fell to the ground.<br><br>The man who was being arrested by the police officer held the latter’s hand while he was being stabbed repeatedly by [Asilan].&nbsp; The man who was being arrested then took the officer’s gun and shot the latter with it.<br><br>The fellow barker of Joselito Binosa then threw stones at the malefactors who subsequently left the place.<br><br>Joselito Binosa secretly followed [Asilan] and his companion who walked towards the railroad track taking Teresa St., Sta. Mesa, Manila.&nbsp; [Asilan] entered an alley and thereafter returned to the place of the incident.&nbsp; The other man walked on to the tracks.<br><br>At that moment, a policeman passed by and Binosa pointed [Asilan] to him.&nbsp; [Asilan] was arrested and the knife which was used in the<br><br>stabbing was confiscated by the policeman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>The above narration of events was largely corroborated by Pol Justine San Diego (San Diego), a student, who also witnessed the events that transpired on March 27, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also submitted as evidence Medico Legal Report No. M-219-06,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> accomplished and testified to by Dr. Vladimir V.

Asilan claimed that Binosa seemed to have recalled more details on cross-examination, thus “improving” on the version he gave during his direct examination.&nbsp; Asilan further claims that Binosa’s suggestion that Asilan returned to the scene of the crime after he committed the alleged crime is very unlikely.&nbsp; Asilan avers that San Diego’s testimony was likewise not credible as it was clearly only a more refined version of Binosa’s account of the events.&nbsp; Moreover, Asilan says that San Diego’s testimony is too good to be true as he is unlikely to have a detailed recollection of an event, which according to him happened within a span of two minutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b><i>Credibility of Witnesses</i></b><br><br>It is a well-settled rule that the assessment of the trial court regarding the credibility of witnesses will generally not be disturbed on appeal.&nbsp; The rationale for this doctrine is that the trial court is in a better position to decide the issue, as it heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; The only exceptions to this rule are the following:<br><br><ol><li>When patent inconsistencies in the statements of witnesses are ignored by the trial court; or<br></li><li>When the conclusions arrived at are clearly unsupported by the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></li></ol>This Court sees no reason to apply the above exceptions and disturb the findings of the RTC, which were affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Our perusal of the records showed that the RTC was vigilant in its duty to ascertain the truth.&nbsp; The RTC itself propounded clarificatory questions to Binosa and San Diego while they were testifying.&nbsp; At the end of the trial, the RTC found these witnesses credible, and believed their eyewitness accounts because they were categorical in their identification of Asilan as one of Adovas’s assailants.&nbsp; The RTC also pointed out that it could not find any dubious reason for Binosa and San Diego to falsely implicate Asilan in a heinous crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b><i>Alleged Inconsistencies</i></b><br><br>The alleged inconsistency in Binosa’s testimony does not render his testimony fictitious.&nbsp; The fact that he was able to provide more details of the events only during cross-examination is not unusual, and on the contrary tends to buttress, rather than weaken, his credibility, since it shows that he was neither coached nor were his answers contrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; After all, “[w]itnesses are not expected to remember every single detail of an incident with perfect or total recall.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As for San Diego’s testimony, it is not unnatural for him to have a detailed recollection of the incident.&nbsp; “Different persons have different reactions to similar situations.&nbsp; There is no typical reaction to a sudden occurrence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; It is worthy to note that San Diego was only sixteen years old when he witnessed the stabbing of Adovas.&nbsp; It was his first time to witness a person being stabbed right before his very eyes.&nbsp; He testified that three months after that night, the events were still vividly imprinted in his mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; It is thus not improbable that he could, with certainty, identify Asilan as the man who stabbed Adovas that fateful night.<br><br>Likewise, our scrutiny of the so-called inconsistencies relied upon by Asilan showed that they only referred to minor details, which did not affect the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Albarido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> this Court said:<br><br><blockquote>It is elementary in the rule of evidence that inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect the substance of their declaration nor the veracity or weight of their testimony.&nbsp; In fact, these minor inconsistencies enhance the credibility of the witnesses, for they remove any suspicion that their testimonies were contrived or rehearsed.&nbsp; In <i>People vs. Maglente,</i> this Court ruled that inconsistencies in details which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime are not grounds for acquittal. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Credibility of the evidence</i></b><br><br>Asilan further asseverates that it is perplexing how none of the witnesses, who were present during the incident, warned Adovas of the impending danger to his life.&nbsp; He contends that “for evidence to be believed, it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstance.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>This Court would like to reiterate that no standard form of behavior is expected of an individual who witnesses something shocking or gruesome like murder.&nbsp; This is especially true when the assailant is near.&nbsp; It is not unusual that some people would feel reluctant in getting involved in a criminal incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the same manner, it is also not surprising that Asilan returned to the scene of the crime after stabbing Adovas.&nbsp; His “failure to flee and the apparent normalcy of his behavior subsequent to the commission of the crime do not imply his innocence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; This Court, elucidating on this point, declared:<br><br><blockquote>Flight is indicative of guilt, but its converse is not necessarily true.&nbsp; Culprits behave differently and even erratically in externalizing and manifesting their guilt.&nbsp; Some may escape or flee -- a circumstance strongly illustrative of guilt -- while others may remain in the same vicinity so as to create a semblance of regularity, thereby avoiding suspicion from other members of the community.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Defense of Denial</i></b><br><br>Unfortunately, Asilan’s bare denial, when juxtaposed with the prosecution witnesses’ positive declarations, is not worthy of credence.&nbsp; Denial, which is the usual refuge of offenders, is an inherently weak defense, and must be buttressed by other persuasive evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.&nbsp; The defense of denial fails even more when the assailant, as in this case, was positively identified by credible witnesses, against whom no ulterior motive could be ascribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Asilan not only admitted that he was at the scene of the crime when he was arrested by the police authorities, he also admitted that he did not know any of the prosecution witnesses prior to his trial.&nbsp; Moreover, he had filed no case against the police officers whom he accused of mauling him to make him admit to the stabbing of Adovas.&nbsp; Asilan’s “self-serving statements deserve no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value over the testimony of the witnesses who testified on positive points.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b><i>Qualifying Circumstance of Treachery</i></b><br><br>Asilan pleads that treachery cannot be appreciated in the present case as the prosecution failed to establish that he had consciously or deliberately adopted or chosen the mode of attack employed upon Adovas to deprive him of an opportunity to defend himself or retaliate.&nbsp; Asilan argues that mere suddenness of the attack is not enough to constitute treachery.&nbsp; He further posits that while it may be true that he allegedly came from behind, the “mode of attack could have occurred in a spur of the moment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The RTC correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery in the killing of Adovas.<br><br>The prosecution was able to sufficiently establish the attendance of treachery in the case at bar.&nbsp; “It is basic in our penal law that treachery is present when the offender employs means, methods or forms which tend directly and especially to insure the execution of the crime, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Tan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> this Court expounded on the concept of treachery as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack, without the slightest provocation on the part of the person attacked.&nbsp; Treachery is present when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof, which tend directly and especially to insure its execution, without risk arising from the defense which the offended party might make.&nbsp; In the case at bar, the attack on Magdalino Olos was treacherous, because he was caught off guard and was therefore unable to defend himself, as testified to by the prosecution witnesses and as indicated by the wounds inflicted on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>Both eyewitnesses testified on how Asilan attacked Adovas from behind.&nbsp; Adovas could not have defended himself because Asilan stabbed him at his back repeatedly <i>sans</i> provocation or warning.&nbsp; The deciding factor is that Asilan’s execution of his attack made it impossible for Adovas to defend himself or retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b><i>Sufficiency of the Information</i></b><br><br>Asilan also claims that his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him was infringed when he was convicted for Murder, since the manner by which he carried out the killing with the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not alleged in the Information against him.&nbsp; Thus, he asserts, he was effectively only charged with Homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>This Court does not find merit in Asilan’s contention that he cannot be convicted of murder because his acts of treachery were not alleged with specificity in the Information.&nbsp; Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 6. </b> <i>Sufficiency of complaint or information</i>. – A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time of the commission of the offense; and the place wherein the offense was committed.<br><br>When the offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information.</blockquote><br>This Court held that “[u]nder Section 6, the Information is sufficient if it contains the full name of the accused, the designation of the offense given by the statute, the acts or omissions constituting the offense, the name of the offended party, the approximate date, and the place of the offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; The Information herein complied with these conditions.&nbsp; Contrary to Asilan’s contention, the qualifying circumstance of “treachery” was specifically alleged in the Information.&nbsp; “The rule is that qualifying circumstances must be properly pleaded in the Information in order not to violate the accused’s constitutional right to be properly informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Asilan never claimed that he was deprived of his right to be fully apprised of the nature of the charges against him due to the insufficiency of the Information.<br><br>This Court completely agrees with the Court of Appeals’ pronouncement that “since treachery was correctly alleged in the Information and duly established by the prosecution, x x x [Asilan]’s conviction for the crime of murder is proper.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In any case, it is now too late for Asilan to assail the sufficiency of the Information on the ground that there was failure to specifically allege therein how treachery was carried out.&nbsp; Section 9, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 9.</b>&nbsp; <i>Failure to move to quash or to allege any ground therefor.</i>- The failure of the accused to assert any ground of a motion to quash before he pleads to the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of any objections except those based on the grounds provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (g), and (i) of section 3 of this Rule.</blockquote><br>Moreover, in <i>People v. Candaza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> this Court held that “[a]n Information which lacks essential allegations may still sustain a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial, and the deficiency was cured by competent evidence presented therein.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, Asilan not only failed to question the sufficiency of the Information at any time during the pendency of his case before the RTC, he also allowed the prosecution to present evidence, proving the elements of treachery in the commission of the offense.&nbsp; Asilan is thus deemed to have waived any objections against the sufficiency of the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> this Court is increasing the award of civil indemnity from Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) to Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00), and the moral damages from Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00) to Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00).&nbsp; Moreover, in view of the presence of the qualifying circumstance of treachery, an additional award of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00), as exemplary damages, in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> should be awarded to the heirs of Adovas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>As to actual damages, Adovas’s widow, Irene Adovas, presented the receipts showing that she paid P25,224.00 to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Inc., as hospital expenses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> P35,000.00 to Marulas Memorial Homes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and P20,000.00 to Funeraria Saranay as funeral expenses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; or a total of P80,224.00.<br><br>Both the RTC and the Court of Appeals failed to consider that under Article 2206 of the Civil Code, Asilan is also liable for the loss of the earning capacity of Adovas, and such indemnity should be paid to his heirs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 2206</b>.
