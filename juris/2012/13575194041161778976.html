In all transactions or contracts involving the sale or financing of real estate on installment payments, including residential condominium apartments but excluding industrial lots, commercial buildings and sales to tenants under Republic Act Numbered Thirty-eight hundred forty-four, as amended by Republic Act Numbered Sixty-three hundred eighty-nine, where the buyer has paid at least two years of installments, the buyer is entitled to the following rights in case he defaults in the payment of succeeding installments:<br><br>(a) To pay, without additional interest, the unpaid installments due within the total grace period earned by him which is hereby fixed at the rate of one month grace period for every one year of installment payments made: Provided, That this right shall be exercised by the buyer only once in every five years of the life of the contract and its extensions, if any.<br><br>(b) <b> If the contract is canceled, the seller shall refund to the buyer the cash surrender value of the payments on the property equivalent to fifty percent of the total payments made</b>, and, after five years of installments, an additional five per cent every year but not to exceed ninety per cent of the total payments made: Provided, That the actual cancellation of the contract shall take place after thirty days from receipt by the buyer of the notice of cancellation or the demand for rescission of the contract by a notarial act and upon full payment of the cash surrender value to the buyer.<br><br>Down payments, deposits or options on the contract shall be included in the computation of the total number of installment payments made. (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br><b>Section 4</b>.&nbsp; In case where less than two years of installments were paid, the seller shall give the buyer a grace period of not less than sixty days from the date the installment became due.<br><br>If the buyer fails to pay the installments due at the expiration of the grace period, the seller may cancel the contract after thirty days from receipt by the buyer of the notice of cancellation or the demand for rescission of the contract by a notarial act.<br><br><b>Section 5</b>.&nbsp; Under Sections 3 and 4, the buyer shall have the right to sell his rights or assign the same to another person or to reinstate the contract by updating the account during the grace period and before actual cancellation of the contract. The deed of sale or assignment shall be done by notarial act.</blockquote><br>In this connection, we deem it necessary to point out that, under the Maceda Law, the actual cancellation of a contract to sell takes place after 30 days from receipt by the buyer of the notarized notice of cancellation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and upon full payment of the cash surrender value to the buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, before a contract to sell can be validly and effectively cancelled, the seller has (1) to send a notarized notice of cancellation to the buyer and (2) to refund the cash surrender value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Until and unless the seller complies with these twin mandatory requirements, the contract to sell between the parties remains valid and subsisting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the buyer has the right to continue occupying the property subject of the contract to sell,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and may “still reinstate the contract by updating the account during the grace period and before the actual cancellation”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the contract.<br><br>In this case, petitioner complied only with the first condition by sending a notarized notice of cancellation to the respondent-spouses. It failed, however, to refund the cash surrender value to the respondent-spouses.&nbsp; Thus, the Contract to Sell remains valid and subsisting and supposedly, respondent-spouses have the right to continue occupying the subject property.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we cannot reverse the Decision of the RTC directing respondent-spouses to vacate and turn-over possession of the subject property to petitioner because respondent-spouses never appealed the order.&nbsp; The RTC Decision as to respondent-spouses is therefore considered final.<br><br>In addition, in view of respondent-spouses’ failure to appeal, they can no longer reinstate the contract by updating the account.&nbsp; Allowing them to do so would be unfair to the other party and is offensive to the rules of fair play, justice, and due process.&nbsp; Thus, based on the factual milieu of the instant case, the most that we can do is to order the return of the cash surrender value.&nbsp; Since respondent-spouses paid at least two years of installment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> they are entitled to receive the cash surrender value of the payments they had made which, under Section 3(b) of the Maceda Law, is equivalent to 50% of the total payments made.<br><br><b><i>Respondent-spouses are entitled to <br>reimbursement of the improvements<br> made on the property.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner posits that Article 448 of the Civil Code does not apply and that respondent-spouses are not entitled to reimbursement of the value of the improvements made on the property because they were builders in bad faith.&nbsp; At the outset, we emphasize that the issue of whether respondent-spouses are builders in good faith or bad faith is a factual question, which is beyond the scope of a petition filed under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, petitioner is deemed to have waived all factual issues since it appealed the case directly to this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> instead of elevating the matter to the CA.&nbsp; It has likewise not escaped our attention that after their failed preliminary conference, the parties agreed to submit the case for resolution based on the pleadings and exhibits presented.&nbsp; No trial was conducted.&nbsp; Thus, it is too late for petitioner to raise at this stage of the proceedings the factual issue of whether respondent-spouses are builders in bad faith.&nbsp; Hence, in view of the special circumstances obtaining in this case, we are constrained to rely on the presumption of good faith on the part of the respondent-spouses which the petitioner failed to rebut.&nbsp; Thus, respondent-spouses being presumed builders in good faith, we now rule on the applicability of Article 448 of the Civil Code.<br><br>As a general rule, Article 448 on builders in good faith does not apply where there is a contractual relation between the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> such as in the instant case.&nbsp; We went over the records of this case and we note that the parties failed to attach a copy of the Contract to Sell.&nbsp; As such, we are constrained to apply Article 448 of the Civil Code, which provides <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 448. The owner of the land on which anything has been built, sown or planted in good faith, shall have the right to appropriate as his own the works, sowing or planting, after payment of the indemnity provided for in Articles 546 and 548, or to oblige the one who built or planted to pay the price of the land, and the one who sowed, the proper rent. However, the builder or planter cannot be obliged to buy the land if its value is considerably more than that of the building or trees. In such case, he shall pay reasonable rent, if the owner of the land does not choose to appropriate the building or trees after proper indemnity. The parties shall agree upon the terms of the lease and in case of disagreement, the court shall fix the terms thereof.</blockquote><br>Article 448 of the Civil Code applies when the builder believes that he is the owner of the land or that by some title he has the right to build thereon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> or that, at least, he has a claim of title thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; Concededly, this is not present in the instant case.&nbsp; The subject property is covered by a Contract to Sell hence ownership still remains with petitioner being the seller.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there were already instances where this Court applied Article 448 even if the builders do not have a claim of title over the property.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>This Court has ruled that this provision covers only cases in which the builders, sowers or planters believe themselves to be owners of the land or, at least, to have a claim of title thereto.&nbsp; It does not apply when the interest is merely that of a holder, such as a mere tenant, agent or usufructuary.&nbsp; From these pronouncements, good faith is identified by the belief that the land is owned; or that – by some title – one has the right to build, plant, or sow thereon.<br><br>However, in some special cases, this Court has used Article 448 by recognizing good faith beyond this limited definition.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>Del Campo v. Abesia</i>, this provision was applied to one whose house – despite having been built at the time he was still co-owner – overlapped with the land of another.&nbsp; This article was also applied to cases wherein a builder had constructed improvements with the consent of the owner.&nbsp; The Court ruled that the law deemed the builder to be in good faith.&nbsp; In <i>Sarmiento v. Agana</i>, the builders were found to be in good faith despite their reliance on the consent of another, whom they had mistakenly believed to be the owner of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court likewise applied Article 448 in <i>Spouses Macasaet v. Spouses Macasaet</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> notwithstanding the fact that the builders therein knew they were not the owners of the land.&nbsp; In said case, the parents who owned the land allowed their son and his wife to build their residence and business thereon.&nbsp; As found by this Court, their occupation was not by mere tolerance but “upon the invitation of and with the complete approval of (their parents), who desired that their children would occupy the premises.&nbsp; It arose from familial love and a desire for family solidarity x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; Soon after, conflict between the parties arose.&nbsp; The parents demanded their son and his wife to vacate the premises.&nbsp; The Court thus ruled that as owners of the property, the parents have the right to possession over it.&nbsp; However, they must reimburse their son and his wife for the improvements they had introduced on the property because they were considered builders in good faith even if they knew for a fact that they did not own the property, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Based on the aforecited special cases, Article 448 applies to the present factual milieu.&nbsp; The established facts of this case show that respondents fully consented to the improvements introduced by petitioners.&nbsp; In fact, because the children occupied the lots upon their invitation, the parents certainly knew and approved of the construction of the improvements introduced thereon.&nbsp; Thus, petitioners may be deemed to have been in good faith when they built the structures on those lots.<br><br>The instant case is factually similar to<i> Javier v. Javier.</i>&nbsp; In that case, this Court deemed the son to be in good faith for building the improvement (the house) with the knowledge and consent of his father, to whom belonged the land upon which it was built.&nbsp; Thus, Article 448 was applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>In fine, the Court applied Article 448 by construing good faith beyond its limited definition.&nbsp; We find no reason not to apply the Court’s ruling in <i>Spouses Macasaet v. Spouses Macasaet</i> in this case.&nbsp; We thus hold that Article 448 is also applicable to the instant case.&nbsp; First, good faith is presumed on the part of the respondent-spouses.&nbsp; Second, petitioner failed to rebut this presumption.&nbsp; Third, no evidence was presented to show that petitioner opposed or objected to the improvements introduced by the respondent-spouses.&nbsp; Consequently, we can validly presume that petitioner consented to the improvements being constructed.&nbsp; This presumption is bolstered by the fact that as the subdivision developer, petitioner must have given the respondent-spouses permits to commence and undertake the construction.&nbsp; Under Article 453 of the Civil Code, “[i]t is understood that there is bad faith on the part of the landowner whenever the act was done with his knowledge and without opposition on his part.”<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find no error on the part of the RTC in requiring petitioner to pay respondent-spouses the value of the new house minus the cost of the old house based on Article 448 of the Civil Code, subject to succeeding discussions.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner has two options under <br>Article 448 and pursuant to the <br>ruling in Tuatis v. Escol</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In<i> Tuatis,</i> we ruled that the seller (the owner of the land) has two options under Article 448: (1) he may appropriate the improvements for himself after reimbursing the buyer (the builder in good faith) the necessary and useful expenses under Articles 546<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; and 548<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of the Civil Code; or (2) he may sell the land to the buyer, unless its value is considerably more than that of the improvements, in which case, the buyer shall pay reasonable rent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; Quoted below are the pertinent portions of our ruling in that case:<br><br><blockquote>Taking into consideration the provisions of the Deed of Sale by Installment and Article 448 of the Civil Code, Visminda has the following options:<br><br>Under the first option, Visminda <b>may appropriate for herself the building on the subject property after indemnifying Tuatis for the necessary and useful expenses the latter incurred for said building, as provided in Article 546 of the Civil Code.</b><br><br>It is worthy to mention that in Pecson v. Court of Appeals, the Court pronounced <b>that the amount to be refunded to the builder under Article 546 of the Civil Code should be the current market value of the improvement</b>, thus:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Until Visminda appropriately indemnifies Tuatis for the building constructed by the latter, Tuatis may retain possession of the building and the subject property.<br><br>Under the second option, Visminda <b>may choose not to appropriate the building and, instead, oblige Tuatis to pay the present or current fair value of the land</b>.&nbsp; The P10,000.00 price of the subject property, as stated in the Deed of Sale on Installment executed in November 1989, shall no longer apply, since Visminda will be obliging Tuatis to pay for the price of the land in the exercise of Visminda’s rights under Article 448 of the Civil Code, and not under the said Deed. Tuatis’ obligation will then be statutory, and not contractual, arising only when Visminda has chosen her option under Article 448 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Still under the second option, <b>if the present or current value of the land, the subject property herein, turns out to be considerably more than that of the building built thereon, Tuatis cannot be obliged to pay for the subject property, but she must pay Visminda reasonable rent for the same. Visminda and Tuatis must agree on the terms of the lease; otherwise, the court will fix the terms.</b><br><br>Necessarily, the RTC should conduct additional proceedings before ordering the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. S-618. Initially, the RTC should determine which of the aforementioned options Visminda will choose. Subsequently, the RTC should ascertain: (a) under the first option, the amount of indemnification Visminda must pay Tuatis; or (b) under the second option, the value of the subject property vis-à-vis that of the building, and depending thereon, the price of, or the reasonable rent for, the subject property, which Tuatis must pay Visminda.<br><br>The Court highlights that the options under Article 448 are available to Visminda, as the owner of the subject property. There is no basis for Tuatis’ demand that, since the value of the building she constructed is considerably higher than the subject property, she may choose between buying the subject property from Visminda and selling the building to Visminda for P502,073.00. Again, the choice of options is for Visminda, not Tuatis, to make. And, depending on Visminda’s choice, Tuatis’ rights as a builder under Article 448 are limited to the following: (a) under the first option, a right to retain the building and subject property until Visminda pays proper indemnity; and (b) under the second option, a right not to be obliged to pay for the price of the subject property, if it is considerably higher than the value of the building, in which case, she can only be obliged to pay reasonable rent for the same.<br><br>The rule that the choice under Article 448 of the Civil Code belongs to the owner of the land is in accord with the principle of accession, i.e., that the accessory follows the principal and not the other way around. Even as the option lies with the landowner, the grant to him, nevertheless, is preclusive. The landowner cannot refuse to exercise either option and compel instead the owner of the building to remove it from the land.<br><br>The raison d’etre for this provision has been enunciated thus: Where the builder, planter or sower has acted in good faith, a conflict of rights arises between the owners, and it becomes necessary to protect the owner of the improvements without causing injustice to the owner of the land. In view of the impracticability of creating a state of forced co-ownership, the law has provided a just solution by giving the owner of the land the option to acquire the improvements after payment of the proper indemnity, or to oblige the builder or planter to pay for the land and the sower the proper rent. He cannot refuse to exercise either option. It is the owner of the land who is authorized to exercise the option, because his right is older, and because, by the principle of accession, he is entitled to the ownership of the accessory thing.<br><br>Visminda’s Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution cannot be deemed as an expression of her choice to recover possession of the subject property under the first option, <b>since the options under Article 448 of the Civil Code and their respective consequences were also not clearly presented to her by the 19 April 1999 Decision of the RTC. She must then be given the opportunity to make a choice between the options available to her after being duly informed herein of her rights and obligations under both.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In conformity with the foregoing pronouncement, we hold that petitioner, as landowner, has two options.&nbsp; It may appropriate the new house by reimbursing respondent Angeles the current market value thereof minus the cost of the old house. Under this option, respondent Angeles would have “a right of retention which negates the obligation to pay rent.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; In the alternative, petitioner may sell the lots to respondent Angeles at a price equivalent to the current fair value thereof.&nbsp; However, if the value of the lots is considerably more than the value of the improvement, respondent Angeles cannot be compelled to purchase the lots.&nbsp; She can only be obliged to pay petitioner reasonable rent.<br><br>In view of the foregoing disquisition and in accordance with <i>Depra v.

The assailed Decision dated December 29, 2006 and the Order dated February 12, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 18, in Civil Case No. 2005-158 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> that petitioner Communities Cagayan, Inc. is hereby ordered to <b>RETURN</b> the cash surrender value of the payments made by respondent-spouses on the properties, which is equivalent to 50% of the total payments made, in accordance with Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 6552, otherwise known as the Maceda Law.<br><br>The case is hereby <b>REMANDED</b> to the Regional Trial Court,&nbsp; Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 18, for further proceedings consistent with the proper application of Articles 448, 546 and 548 of the Civil Code, as follows:<br><br>1. The trial court shall determine:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) the present or current fair value of the lots;<br>b) the current market value of the new house;<br>c)&nbsp; the cost of the old house; and<br>d) whether the value of the lots is considerably more than the current market value of the new house minus the cost of the old house.<br></div><br>2. After said amounts shall have been determined by competent evidence, the trial court shall render judgment as follows:<br>&nbsp;<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Petitioner shall be granted a period of 15 days within which to exercise its option under the law (Article 448, Civil Code), whether to appropriate the new house by paying to respondent Angeles the current market value of the new house minus the cost of the old house, or to oblige respondent Angeles to pay the price of the lots. The amounts to be respectively paid by the parties, in accordance with the option thus exercised by written notice to the other party and to the court, shall be paid by the obligor within 15 days from such notice of the option by tendering the amount to the trial court in favor of the party entitled to receive it.<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; If petitioner exercises the option to oblige respondent Angeles to pay the price of the lots but the latter rejects such purchase because, as found by the trial court, the value of the lots is considerably more than the value of the new house minus the cost of the old house, respondent Angeles shall give written notice of such rejection to petitioner and to the trial court within 15 days from notice of petitioner’s option to sell the land. In that event, the parties shall be given a period of 15 days from such notice of rejection within which to agree upon the terms of the lease, and give the trial court formal written notice of the agreement and its provisos. If no agreement is reached by the parties, the trial court, within 15 days from and after the termination of the said period fixed for negotiation, shall then fix the period and terms of the lease, including the monthly rental, which shall be payable within the first five days of each calendar month.&nbsp; Respondent Angeles shall not make any further constructions or improvements on the building. Upon expiration of the period, or upon default by respondent Angeles in the payment of rentals for two consecutive months, petitioner shall be entitled to terminate the forced lease, to recover its land, and to have the new house removed by respondent Angeles or at the latter’s expense.<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, respondent Angeles shall pay petitioner reasonable compensation for the occupancy of the property for the period counted from the time the Decision dated December 29, 2006 became final as to respondent Angeles or 15 days after she received a copy of the said Decision up to the date petitioner serves notice of its option to appropriate the encroaching structures, otherwise up to the actual transfer of ownership to respondent Angeles or, in case a forced lease has to be imposed, up to the commencement date of the forced lease referred to in the preceding paragraph.<br><br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp; The periods to be fixed by the trial court in its decision shall be non-extendible, and upon failure of the party obliged to tender to the trial court the amount due to the obligee, the party entitled to such payment shall be entitled to an order of execution for the enforcement of payment of the amount due and for compliance with such other acts as may be required by the prestation due the obligee.<br></div><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Perez, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Perlas-Bernabe, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 17-29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 30-35; penned by Presiding Judge Edgardo T.
