				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve the petition for review on certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by Nancy L.

SP No. 107104. The CA decision dismissed the petitioner’s petition for certiorari for lack of merit. The CA resolution denied the petitioner’s subsequent motion for reconsideration.<br><br><center><b><u>THE FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS</u></b><br></center><br>Sometime in 1979, the Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank (<i>respondent</i>) wanted to purchase real properties as new branch sites for its expansion program. Since the General Banking Act<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> limits a bank’s real estate holdings to no more than 50% of its capital assets, the respondent’s Board of Directors decided to warehouse some of its existing properties and branch sites to allow more flexibility in the opening of branches, and to enable it to acquire new branch sites.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The petitioner, a major stockholder and a director of the respondent, persuaded two other major stockholders, Pedro Aguirre and his brother Tomas Aguirre, to organize and incorporate Tala Realty Services Corporation (<i>Tala Realty</i>) to hold and purchase real properties in trust for the respondent. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Remedios A. Dupasquier prodded her brother Tomas to endorse to her his shares in Tala Realty and she registered them in the name of her controlled corporation, Add International Services, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The petitioner, Remedios, and Pedro controlled Tala Realty through their respective nominees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In implementing their trust agreement, the respondent sold to Tala Realty some of its properties. Tala Realty simultaneously leased to the respondent the properties for 20 years, renewable for another 20 years at the respondent’s option with a right of first refusal in the event Tala Realty decides to sell them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, in August 1992, Tala Realty repudiated the trust, claimed the titles for itself, and demanded payment of rentals, deposits, and goodwill, with a threat to eject the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Thus, from 1995 to 1996, the respondent filed 17 complaints against Tala Realty, the petitioner, Pedro, Remedios, and their respective nominees for reconveyance of different properties with 17 Regional Trial Courts (<i>RTCs</i>) nationwide, including Civil Case No. 2506-MN before Branch 170 of the RTC of Malabon (<i>Malabon case</i>), subject of the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The petitioner and her co-defendants moved to dismiss the Malabon case for forum shopping and litis pendentia, citing the 16 other civil cases filed in various courts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> involving the same facts, issues, parties, and reliefs pleaded in the respondent’s complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Malabon RTC denied the motion to dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> finding no commonality in the 16 other civil cases since they involved different causes of action.

No. 127611<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that assailed the denial of their motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 4521 before the Batangas City RTC (Branch 84), and also prayed for a writ of prohibition to order the 17 RTC branches and the three CA divisions, where the same cases were pending, to desist from further proceeding with the trial of the cases.<br><br>The Malabon RTC granted to hold proceedings in abeyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When the Malabon RTC denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the respondent’s motion for reconsideration, the respondent elevated its case to the CA via a Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The CA initially dismissed the petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> but on motion for reconsideration, it modified its ruling, setting aside the RTC’s order to hold proceedings in abeyance for mootness, due to this Court’s dismissal of G.R.

No. 137533.<br><br><center><b><u>THE CASE FOR THE RESPONDENT</u></b></center><br>The respondent submits that the petitioner is estopped from amending the issues since she never raised the pendency of the consolidated cases of G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 155171, 155201 and 166608 in her CA petition, which was based only on the Court’s rulings in G.R. No. 137533 and G.R. No. 177865.<br><br><center><b><u>THE ISSUE</u></b><br></center><br>The core issues boil down to whether the Court’s ruling in G.R. No. 137533 applies as<i> stare decisis</i> to the present case.<br><br><center><b><u>OUR RULING</u></b><br></center><br><b><i>We grant the petition.</i></b><br><br>The case at bar presents the same issue that the Court already resolved on April 7, 2009 in G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 155171, 155201 and 166608, wherein we applied the Court’s November 22, 2002 decision in G.R. No. 137533, one of several ejectment cases filed by Tala Realty against the respondent arising from the same trust agreement in the reconveyance case subject of the present petition, that the trust agreement is void and cannot thus be enforced. We quoted therein the Court’s ruling in G.R. No. 137533, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The Bank alleges that the sale and twenty-year lease of the disputed property were part of a larger implied trust "warehousing agreement." Concomitant with this Court's factual finding that the 20-year contract governs the relations between the parties, we find the Bank's allegation of circumstances surrounding its execution worthy of credence; the Bank and Tala entered into contracts of sale and lease back of the disputed property and created an implied trust "warehousing agreement" for the reconveyance of the property. In the eyes of the law, however, this implied trust is inexistent and void for being contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>An implied trust could not have been formed between the Bank and Tala as this Court has held that "where the purchase is made in violation of an existing statute and in evasion of its express provision, no trust can result in favor of the party who is guilty of the fraud."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>x x x [T]he bank cannot use the defense of nor seek enforcement of its alleged implied trust with Tala since its purpose was contrary to law. As admitted by the Bank, it "warehoused" its branch site holdings to Tala to enable it to pursue its expansion program and purchase new branch sites including its main branch in Makati, and at the same time avoid the real property holdings limit under Sections 25(a) and 34 of the General Banking Act which it had already reached x x x .<br><br>Clearly, the Bank was well aware of the limitations on its real estate holdings under the General Banking Act and that its "warehousing agreement" with Tala was a scheme to circumvent the limitation. Thus, the Bank opted not to put the agreement in writing and call a spade a spade, but instead phrased its right to reconveyance of the subject property at any time as a "first preference to buy" at the "same transfer price". This agreement which the Bank claims to be an implied trust is contrary to law. Thus, while we find the sale and lease of the subject property genuine and binding upon the parties, we cannot enforce the implied trust even assuming the parties intended to create it. In the words of the Court in the Ramos case, "the courts will not assist the payor in achieving his improper purpose by enforcing a resultant trust for him in accordance with the 'clean hands' doctrine." The Bank cannot thus demand reconveyance of the property based on its alleged implied trust relationship with Tala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (italics supplied.)<br><br><b>The Bank and Tala are <i>in pari delicto</i>, thus, no affirmative relief should be given to one against the other.</b> The Bank should not be allowed to dispute the sale of its lands to Tala nor should Tala be allowed to further collect rent from the Bank. The clean hands doctrine will not allow the creation or the use of a juridical relation such as a trust to subvert, directly or indirectly, the law. <b>Neither the Bank nor Tala came to court with clean hands; neither will obtain relief from the court as the one who seeks equity and justice must come to court with clean hands</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (emphases ours; citation omitted)</blockquote><br>G.R. No. 137533, as reiterated in G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 155171, 155201 and 166608, is binding and applicable to the present case following the salutary doctrine of <i>stare decisis et non quieta movere</i>, which means "to adhere to precedents, and not to unsettle things which are established."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Under the doctrine, when this Court has once laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle, and apply it to all future cases, where facts are substantially the same; regardless of whether the parties and property are the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> is based upon the legal principle or rule involved and not upon the judgment, which results therefrom. In this particular sense, <i>stare decisis</i> differs from <i>res judicata</i>, which is based upon the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The doctrine of<i> stare decisis </i>is one of policy grounded on the necessity for securing certainty and stability of judicial decisions, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Time and again, the Court has held that it is a very desirable and necessary judicial practice that when a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same. <i>Stare decisis et non quieta movere.</i> Stand by the decisions and disturb not what is settled. Stare decisis simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same [issue].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (italics supplied)<br></blockquote><br>It bears stressing that the basic facts of the present case and those of G.R. No. 137533 and G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 155171, 155201 and 166608 are the same. Clearly, in light of G.R. No. 137533 and G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 155171, 155201 and 166608, which the Court follows as precedents, the present action for reconveyance cannot prosper. It is the Court's duty to apply the previous rulings in G.R. No. 137533 and in G.R. Nos. 130088, 131469, 155171, 155201 and 166608 to the present case. <b>Once a case has been decided one way, any other case involving exactly the same point at issue, as in the present case, should be decided in the same manner.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
