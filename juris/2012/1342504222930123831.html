That the [BCDA] has no cause or causes of action against the private defendant and public defendant PARO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>The respondents argued that since the subject properties, which were part of the landholdings of the National Housing Authority, were awarded to the private respondents as the <i>bona fide</i> and <i>de jure</i> farmer-beneficiaries under Republic Act No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, jurisdiction over the cancellation of their titles fall under the DAR through its Adjudication Board known as the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The BCDA, commenting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> on the Motions to Dismiss, averred that it was erroneous to state that the DARAB had jurisdiction over the cases as they do not involve an agrarian reform issue.<br><br>On September 24, 2002, the RTC issued one Order/Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dismissing the eight cases, without prejudice, for being prematurely filed.<br><br>The RTC, in dismissing the cases, declared that while it had jurisdiction to cancel CLOAs, questions on the legality of their issuance should be addressed to the DARAB.&nbsp; The RTC added:<br><br><blockquote>Evident on the allegations in the complaint that plaintiff BCDA impugned the validity of the issuances of the subject CLOAs to private respondents and questioned the act of public respondent PARO to be beyond of its authority in awarding the subject parcels of land to said respondents on the ground that the subject parcels of land are outside the areas allocated to the Department of Agrarian Reform to be distributed to farmer-beneficiaries and that the same is registered in the name of the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; These allegations alone had divested this court from acquiring jurisdiction over the subject matter of the cases, much less to decide and delve into the issue of the legality of the issuances of the subject CLOAs, which original jurisdiction is vested with an administrative tribunal (DARAB).<br><br>x x x x<br><br>This Court believes that it is the Department of Agrarian Reform which is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to try and decide the instant controversy.&nbsp; It is not a simple cancellation of registration of title as the same involves agrarian reform issues.&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>Aggrieved, the BCDA elevated its cause to this Court.&nbsp; However, before this Court could resolve the petition, private respondent Benjamin Poy Lorenzo, on February 23, 2004, filed a Motion to Cite the Petitioner in Contempt of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> for certifying before two branches of the RTC in Angeles City, wherein it filed eminent domain cases against him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and Lavernie Poy Lorenzo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that it has not commenced any other action before this Court.<br><br>Opposing the motion, the BCDA argued that the complaints for expropriation involve issues that are completely different from the one posed in this petition.&nbsp; Moreover, the BCDA said, it had no intention at all to mislead the RTCs of Angeles City as it mentioned, in both complaints for expropriation, that the private respondents’ titles were subject to pending complaints at the RTC for Cancellation of Title.&nbsp; The BCDA went on to point out Benjamin Poy Lorenzo’s improper initiation of a contempt proceeding, as it was done through a mere motion instead of a verified petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Issue</i></b><br></center><br>The resolution of this petition boils down to the determination of the following lone issue as presented by the BCDA:<br><br><blockquote>THE SOLE ISSUE SUBMITTED FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THIS HONORABLE SUPREME COURT IS WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATION BOARD (DARAB), HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE AS RULED BY THE HON. RTC JUDGE PHILBERT ITURALDE, OR THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>The BCDA asseverates that for the case to fall within the ambit of DARAB’s jurisdiction, there must exist a tenancy relationship between the parties.&nbsp; The BCDA believes that since it had no tenurial relationship with the private respondents, it should not submit itself to the jurisdiction of the DARAB.&nbsp; The BCDA further contends that under Sections 78 and 112 of the Land Registration Act, the RTC has the authority to decide petitions for cancellation of titles.&nbsp; Corollarily, the BCDA claims, since the TCTs of the private respondents, as holders of CLOAs, were issued by the Register of Deeds, these titles are governed by the Torrens system, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the private respondents reiterated their position that under Section 50 of Republic Act No. 6657, and Section 1, Rule II of the DARAB New Rules of Procedure, the jurisdiction over their cases falls under the DARAB.<br><br><center><b><i>Anent the Motion to Cite the BCDA in Contempt</i></b><br></center><br>This Court, at the outset, would like to resolve Benjamin Poy Lorenzo’s motion to cite the BCDA in contempt, for allegedly certifying before the RTCs in Angeles City, that it had not commenced a similar action before the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Since the alleged misconduct falls under indirect contempt, proceedings should be initiated either <i>motu proprio</i> by order of or a formal charge by the offended court, or by a verified petition with supporting particulars and certified true copies of documents or papers involved therein, and upon full compliance with the requirements for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the court concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It is clear that Benjamin Poy Lorenzo has missed out on all of the above requirements.&nbsp; Moreover, as the BCDA has shown, it did not hide the fact that it had commenced a separate action involving his lot before RTC Branch 58 of Angeles City.&nbsp; In fact, the BCDA mentioned it both in its Complaint for Expropriation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and in its Verification and Certification as to Non-Forum Shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; This Court is, therefore, denying the motion of Benjamin Poy Lorenzo and will not belabor the point that such is not in keeping with the rules and jurisprudence.<br><br><center><b>This Court’s Ruling on the Main Issue</b></center><br>This case properly falls within the jurisdiction of the RTC.<br><br>Rule II, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Procedure of the DARAB provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 1. <i>Primary, Original and Appellate Jurisdiction.</i></b> ---The Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board shall have primary jurisdiction, both original and appellate, to determine and adjudicate all agrarian disputes, cases, controversies, and matters or incidents involving the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program under Republic Act No. 6657, Executive Order Nos. 229, 228 and 129-A, Republic Act No. 3844 as amended by Republic Act No. 6389, Presidential Decree No. 27 and other agrarian laws and their implementing rules and regulations.</blockquote><br>Under Section 3(d) of Republic Act No. 6657 an “agrarian dispute” is defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(d) <i>Agrarian Dispute</i> refers to any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farmworkers associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.<br><br>It includes any controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under this Act and other terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farmworkers, tenants and other agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of farm operator and beneficiary, landowner and tenant, or lessor and lessee.</blockquote><br>This Court agrees with the BCDA for this case to fall within the ambit of DARAB’s jurisdiction, the issue must be one that involves an agrarian dispute, which is not attendant in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>It is a basic rule that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; The BCDA’s complaints did not contain any allegation that would, even in the slightest, imply that the issue to be resolved in this case involved an agrarian dispute.&nbsp; In the action filed by the BCDA, the issue to be resolved was who between the BCDA and the private respondents and their purported predecessors-in-interest, have a valid title over the subject properties in light of the relevant facts and applicable laws.&nbsp; The case thus involves a controversy relating to the ownership of the subject properties, which is beyond the scope of the phrase “agrarian dispute.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The RTC, therefore, gravely erred when it dismissed the complaints on the grounds that they were prematurely filed.&nbsp;
