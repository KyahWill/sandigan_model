Benguet, by submitting the complete requirements for an MPSA application in MPSA-P-III-16, fully complied with the requirements of Sections 112 and 113 of Republic Act No. 7942.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Thus, petitioner still has the preferential right over any other similar applicants to pursue the area covered by the subject 57 mining claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>3. While MPSA-P-III-03-05 was filed during the subsistence of the MLCs, such fact does not suffice to totally nullify said application. The claims under the MLCs, which are supposedly not open to mining applications, all but occupy only a small portion of the area covered in MPSA-P-III-03-05.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also accuses the DENR Secretary of “<i>hastily</i>” approving MPSA-P-III-05-05 into MPSA No. 227-2006-III.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Petitioner alleges that MPSA-P-III-05-05 was approved despite noncompliance by the respondent with the “<i>mandatory</i>” requirements under Sections 37 and 38 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act No. 7942.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center><br>We deny the appeal.<br><br><i><u>MPSA-P-III-16 is Not a Valid MPSA Application</u></i><br><br>Before discussing the merits of MPSA-P-III-16 as an MPSA application, it is significant to point out that as of 22 December 2005, the DENR Secretary had already issued a <i>Memorandum</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> sustaining the denial by the Forest Management Service of DENR Region III to issue an <i>area status and clearance</i> for MPSA-P-III-16. Among the reasons set forth by the DENR in refusing to issue such clearance were:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><blockquote>1. x x x. <br><br>2. The application for clearance was denied two times by the Technical Director of the Forest Management Service of DENR Region III which is the “Government Agency concerned” with the authority in the regions which has jurisdiction over the applied for as far as Forest management is concern [sic]. The first denial was on November 9, 1998 and the second on February 25, 1999. <br><br><b>3. The area is within both a “DENR Project Area” – The President Ramon Magsaysay Reforestation Project of CENRO – Olongapo; and, “The Southern Zambales Forest Reserve established under Republic Act No. 3092” with the latter encompassing most of the entire area of the MPSA application.</b> (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>Verily, the DENR Secretary excluded <i>“most of the entire area”</i> originally covered by MPSA-P-III-16 as closed to mining applications for being within the “<i>President Ramon Magsaysay Reforestation Project of CENRO–Olongapo</i>” and “<i>The Southern Zambales Forest Reserve.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The Memorandum, as the Court takes it, effectively leaves the mining claims of petitioner as the only point of contention left in MPSA-P-III-16.<br><br>Now, to the issue at hand.<br><br>As can be culled from the facts, Benguet filed MPSA-P-III-16 in order to place the mining claims and interests operated by it, <i>which includes those of the petitioner, </i>under MPSAs. The application, in effect, seeks to enforce a <i>right</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> belonging to holders of existing mining claims and others interests to enter into mineral agreements with the government. As mere operator, therefore, Benguet cannot file MPSA-P-III-16 in its name without authorization from the holders of the mining claims and interests included therein.<br><br>Petitioner argues in favor of the validity of MPSA-P-III-16, at least insofar as its mining claims are concerned, on the assertion that it duly authorized Benguet to file the application under their <i>Operating Agreement and its Letter dated 14 June 1991</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br><i>First</i>. It must be clarified at the outset that the inclusion of the 6 mining claims under MLCs in MPSA-P-III-16 is not valid. The records of this case are definite that the MLCs covering 6 of the subject claims were actually issued by the government in the names of Maria Dizon, Helen Dizon and the heirs of Celestino—<i>not</i> in favor of the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Hence, such mining leases could not be included in MPSA-P-III-16 for possible <i>conversion</i> into MPSAs without securing the individual consent of the recognized lessees thereof. Needless to state, authorization by the petitioner in connection with the mining claims covered by the MLCs, if there was any, would not be material.<br><br><i>Second.</i> With respect to the remaining 51 mining claims not under MLCs, this Court finds absolutely nothing in the<i> Operating Agreement</i> between petitioner and Benguet that can reasonably be construed as giving the latter authority to file an MPSA application thereon. After perusal of the records, this Court finds that the provisions of the <i>Operating Agreement </i>relied upon by petitioner in arguing otherwise, were taken out of context:<br><br>1. Benguet’s authority “<i>to acquire real rights”</i> under Section 1.01(b) is actually limited only to such rights “as indicated in the Development Program” of the Operating Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Unfortunately, an MPSA was never shown to have been contemplated by, much less included in, such Development Program.<br><br>2. Section 1.03 only grants Benguet authority to <i>“apply for patent or lease and/or patent or lease surveys</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> However, as will be discussed below, a mining patent, lease or any survey thereof is substantially different from an MPSA.<br><br>3. Section 7.01(j), on the other hand, premises the authority of Benguet to “<i>enter into contracts, agreements</i>” on Section 7.03 of the Operating Agreement that actually requires prior authorization from petitioner in the event the former enters into any “<i>major contracts</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> An MPSA may be considered as falling under the term “<i>major contracts</i>” for the simple reason that it will re-define the very relations between the owners of the existing mining claims and the government with respect to such claims.<br><br>In connection with the foregoing, the <i>Letter dated 14 June 1991</i>, appended in MPSA-P-III-16, cannot be considered as valid authorization from petitioner. There was no showing that the board of directors of petitioner approved of Benguet’s proposal to file an MPSA application.<br><br>4. Neither can Section 9.04, which constituted Benguet as attorney-in-fact of petitioner, be construed as sufficient authorization. The said section confines the authority of Benguet “<i>to prepare, execute, amend, correct, supplement and register any document</i>” relating to the 57 mining claims, only to those documents “<i>necessary to carry out the intents and purposes</i>” of the <i>Operating Agreement</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Entering into MPSAs, however, could not have been included in the “<i>intents and purposes”</i> of the <i>Operating Agreement</i>. It must be pointed out that the <i>Operating Agreement</i> was executed way back in 1975, during which Presidential Decree No. 463 still governed mining operations in the country. Presidential Decree No. 463, as previous mining laws before it, sanctioned a system of exploitation of natural resources based on “<i>license, concession or lease</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> <b>MPSAs, on the other hand, deviate drastically from this system.</b><br><br>An MPSA is one of the mineral agreements innovated by the 1987 Constitution by which the State takes on a broader and more dynamic role in the exploration, development and utilization of the country’s mineral resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> <b>By such agreements, the government does not become a mere licensor, concessor or lessor of mining resources—but actually assumes “full control and supervision” in the exploration, development and utilization of the concerned mining claims in consonance with Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The policy introduced by the 1987 Constitution, therefore, represents a significant shift in the hitherto existing relations between the government and mining claimants. This considerable change in the former system of mining leases under previous mining laws, in turn, makes it difficult for this Court to fathom that petitioner and Benguet contemplated the execution of MPSAs as part of their <i>Operating Agreement.</i> To hold otherwise, would simply stretch the limits of reason and human foresight.<br><br>Accordingly, this Court agrees with the finding of the DENR and the Court of Appeals that MPSA-P-III-16 was filed by Benguet without any valid authorization and, therefore, cannot be considered as a valid MPSA application.<br><br><i><u>Effect of the Invalidity of MPSA-P-III-16</u></i><br><br>In order to fully understand the effect of the invalidity of MPSA-P-III-16 on the mining claims of the petitioner and its rights thereto, the relevant provisions of Republic Act No. 7942 as well as its IRR must be considered.<br><br>In so far as the <b>6 mining claims under MLCs</b> are concerned, <b>Section 112</b> of Republic Act No. 7942 applies. The provision provides for the <i>non-impairment and continued recognition</i> of existing valid mining leases, which means that the subject leases will remain valid until their expiration, <i>i.e</i>. on 31 January 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the <b>51 mining claims not covered by MLCs</b> are subject to<b> Section 113</b> of Republic Act No. 7942. The said section gives “<i>holders of existing mining claims, lease or quarry applications</i>” with <i>“preferential rights to enter into any mode of mineral agreement with the government</i>” within two (2) years from the promulgation of the rules and regulations implementing said law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Section 113 was further clarified by Section 273 of the IRR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> of Republic Act No. 7942 and by DENR Memorandum Order (M.O.) No. 97-07. The pertinent provisions of DENR M.O. 97-07 states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 4. Date of Deadline Under Sections 272 and 273 of the IRR</b><br><br>Consistent with pertinent national policy, the September 13, 1997 deadline under Section 272 of the IRR and the September 14, 1997 deadline under Section 273 of the IRR, which fall on a Saturday and Sunday, respectively, shall be imposed on <b>September 15, 1997.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Section 8. Claimants/Applicants Required to File Mineral Agreement<br><br>Only holders of mining claims and lease/quarry applications filed prior to the effectivity of the Act which are valid and existing as defined in Section 5 hereof <u>who have not filed any Mineral Agreement applications</u> over areas covered by such mining claims and lease/quarry applications are required to file Mineral Agreement applications pursuant to Section 273 of the IRR on or before September 15, 1997;</b> <i>Provided</i>, that the holder of such a mining claim or lease/quarry application involved in a mining dispute/ease shall instead file on or before said deadline a Letter of Intent to file the necessary Mineral Agreement application; <i>Provided, further</i>, That if the mining claim or lease/quarry application is not determined to be invalid in the dispute/case, the claimant or applicant shall have thirty (30) days from the final resolution of the dispute/case to filed the necessary Mineral Agreement application; <b><i>Provided, finally</i>, that failure by the claimant or applicant to file the necessary Mineral Agreement application within said thirty (30)-day period shall result in the abandonment of such claim or application, after which, any area covered by the same shall be opened for Mining Applications.</b><br><br>Holders of such valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications who had filed or been granted applications other than those for Mineral Agreements prior to September 15, 1997 shall have until such date to file/convert to Mineral Agreement applications, otherwise, such previously filed or granted applications shall be cancelled. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).</blockquote><br>Per the above-cited provisions of DENR M.O. No. 97-07, holders of existing mining claims or lease/quarry applications have only until <b>the 15<sup>th</sup> of September 1997 to file an appropriate mineral agreement application</b> in the exercise of their <i>“preferential rights to enter into mineral agreements with the government”</i> involving their claims. DENR M.O. No. 97-07 also provides that <b>failure of the said holders to exercise such preferential right is deemed an abandonment of their existing mining claims or applications.</b><br><br>In the instant case, MPSA-P-III-16 was the <i>only </i>MPSA application that was filed before the mandatory deadline. Aside from it, petitioner filed no other <i>valid</i> MPSA application covering its mining claims before 15 September 1997.<br><br>Given the foregoing, it becomes clear that a finding of invalidity of MPSA-P-III-16 has a profound effect on petitioner’s rights as to the<b> 51 mining claims <i>not</i> covered by MLCs:<br></b><br><i>First</i>. The invalidity of MPSA-P-III-16 necessarily meant that <b>petitioner was not able to validly exercise its preferential rights under Section 113 of Republic Act No. 7942. As a result, petitioner is already deemed to have abandoned its mining claims as of 15 September 1997.</b><br><br><i>Second. </i>The assignment of MPSA-P-III-16 in favor of petitioner has also been rendered of no consequence. Such assignment was made by Benguet, and then approved by the DENR, only in 2004—which is well beyond the 15 September 1997 deadline.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> At that time, petitioner had already lost any legal vested interest it had in the subject mining claims.<br><br><i>Third</i>. Petitioner’s MPSA-P-III-03-05, filed on 31 January 2005, is considered as a new application insofar as the subject 51 mining claims are concerned. <b>Petitioner thereby enjoys no preference regarding the said application’s approval</b>.<br><br>We now come to the final issue raised.<br><br><i><u>MPSA-P-III-05-05 over MPSA-P-III-03-05<br></u></i><br>Petitioner next argues that the Court of Appeals erred in sustaining the DENR’s approval of respondent’s MPSA-P-III-05-05 into MPSA No. 227-2006-III.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Petitioner alleges that the appellate court failed to recognize that the DENR Secretary had adopted a “<i>hasty</i>” procedure in assessing the merits of respondent’s MPSA-PIII- 05-05 and had approved the same without requiring the latter to comply with Sections 37 and 38 of the IRR of Republic Act No. 7942.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Petitioner thus asks this Court to set aside MPSA No. 2272006- III and to order the DENR to instead make a re-evaluation of its own application, MPSA-P-III-03-05.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>To begin with, petitioner’s postulation that respondent did not comply with Sections 37 and 38 of the IRR of Republic Act No. 7942,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> raises a factual issue that was never raised in the proceedings <i>a quo.</i> The procedural norm is that factual issues are barred in appeals by <i>certiorari</i>, with more reason if such issues are only being raised for the first time before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Anent the issue regarding the approval of MPSA-P-III-05-05, it must be emphasized herein that under Republic Act No. 7942, the DENR Secretary has been conferred with the exclusive and primary jurisdiction to approve mineral agreements, such as MPSAs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In the seminal case<i> Celestial Nickel Mining Exploration Corporation v. Macroasia Corporation</i>, this Court described such function as purely administrative in nature and one that is fully within the DENR Secretary’s competence and discretion. Concededly, it is the DENR Secretary, thru the MGB, who is in the best position to determine to whom mineral agreements are granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction finds application to the case at bench. <b><i>Celestial</i></b> captures the doctrine in the context of mining applications in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that the courts will defer to the decisions of the administrative offices and agencies by reason of their expertise and experience in the matters assigned to them pursuant to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Administrative decisions on matter within the jurisdiction of administrative bodies are to be respected and can only be set aside on proof of grave abuse of discretion, fraud, or error of law. <b>Unless it is shown that the then DENR Secretary has acted in a wanton, whimsical, or oppressive manner, giving undue advantage to a party or for an illegal consideration and similar reasons, this Court cannot look into or review the wisdom of the exercise of such discretion</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>In the case at bench, this Court finds no such arbitrariness on the part of the DENR Secretary in approving respondent’s MPSA-PIII- 05-05 at the expense of petitioner’s MPSA-P-III-03-05. Contrary to the allegations of petitioner, there was never any <i>“hasty”</i> approval of MPSA-P-III-05-05. The records attest that the approval of MPSAP- III-05-05 by the DENR Secretary came a full ten (10) months after such application was filed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and was, in fact, based from the evaluation of the DENR MGB Regional Office III that petitioner’s MPSA-P-III-03-05 was filed at a time when the 6 mining claims covered therein were still under subsisting MLCs in favor of the Dizons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> and, hence, still closed to mining applications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>In choosing to act favorably on MPSA-P-III-05-05, the DENR Secretary merely exercised its rightful discretion to determine who among competing mining applicants is more qualified for a mining agreement. This consideration, aside from the fact that petitioner’s MPSA-P-III-03-05 covers areas still closed to mining applications when it was filed, underscores the reasonableness of the orders of the DENR Secretary. This Court finds itself heavy-handed to disturb them.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>DENIED</b>.

[italics and emphases ours]</blockquote><br>Dizon Mines claims to hold two sets of mining rights under repealed mining laws, both are the subjects of its two MPSA applications: (1) the six mining claims covered by Mining Lease Contracts (MLCs), and (2) the 51 mining claims assigned to it by Celestino M. Dizon and his heirs in 1967. The recognitions of these two mining rights are separetely governed by Sections 112 and 113 of RA No. 7942, and should be treated accordingly.<br><br><b><i>a. The mining rights under the MLCs </i></b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> pointed out that the six mining claims covered by the MLCs were in the names of Celestino and his heirs, not Dizon Mines. Hence, these mining claims cannot be included in MPSA-P-III-16 for conversion to MPSA by Dizon Mines, without the individual consent of Celestino and his heirs. Accordingly, any authorization by Dizon Mines for conversion of the MLCs to MPSAs would not be material.<br><br>Justice Caprio dissented from the <i>ponencia</i> by pointing out that long before the issuance of the MLCs (in 1978), all the 57 mining claims have been assigned by Celestino and his heirs in favor of Dizon Mines (in 1966). Although the MLCs were issued in the names of Celestino and his heirs, these were held in trust for Dizon Mines which acquired all the mining claims by virtue of the assignment. Justice Carpio thus claims that Dizon Mines was not required to secure the consent of Celestino and his heirs to file the MPSA applications with respect to the six mining claims covered by the MLCs.<br><br>With due respect, I find the need for authorization from Celestino and his heirs with respect to the six mining claims covered by the MLCs irrelevant. These MLCs were to expire on January 31, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Section 19 of RA No. 7942, however, prohibits mineral agreement applications involving areas that are covered by valid and existing mining rights. Section 112 of RA No. 7942 specifically provides that “[a]ll valid and existing mining lease contracts x x x at the date of effectivity of [the] Act, shall remain valid, shall not be impaired, and shall be recognized by the Government[.]” Hence, under the law, <b>any application <i>filed by any entity</i> involving areas covered by the MLCs filed on or before January 31, 2005 is premature and should be denied</b>. Dizon Mines’ MPSA-P-III-16 and MPSA-P-III-0305 were filed on December 16, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and January 31, 2005, respectively; as both MPSA applications were filed before the opening of the period for application, the dismissal of the applications with respect to the areas covered by the MLCs is thus proper.<br><br><b><i>b. The mining rights under the remaining 51 mining claims&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b><br><br>What, therefore, remains is the validity of the two MPSA applications insofar as they involve the other 51 mining claims. The recognition and protection guaranteed under Section 19 of RA No. 7942 similarly extend to these 51 mining claims, but Section 113 of the same law limits the guarantee to a two-year period, counted from the date of promulgation of RA No. 7942’s implementing rules and regulations. Within this two-year period, two rules should be observed: (1) no application for mineral agreements may be filed involving the areas covered by the mining claims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and (2) the holder of the mining claims has the preferential right to enter into a mineral agreement with the government involving the areas covered by the holder’s mining claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In other words, for the duration that the holder of mining claims has preferential rights to enter into a mineral agreement, no application for mineral agreements may be filed by other interested entities.<br><br>Section 273 of DENR Administrative Order No. 96-40 or the <i>Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 7942 Otherwise Known as the "Philippine Mining Act of 1995"</i> sets the two-year cut off period on September 14, 1997. Since September 14, 1997 fell on a Sunday, the DENR clarified in its Memorandum Order No. 97-07 (dated August 27, 1997) that holders of existing and valid mining claims would have until September 15, 1997 to exercise their preferential rights. As the <i>ponencia</i> pointed out, only Benguet Corporation’s MPSA application (MPSA-P-III16) was filed before the September 15, 1997 deadline. The problem, however, was that Benguet Corporation was not a holder of the 57 mining claims but a mere operator, and it did not have the proper authority to file MPSA applications in behalf of Dizon Mines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On this point, I agree with the <i>ponencia’s</i> finding that Benguet Corporation did not have the proper authority to file the MPSA applications. While Benguet was authorized “to prepare, execute, amend, correct, supplement and register any document x x x necessary to carry out the intents and purposes”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the Operating Agreement, entering into an MPSA with the government could not have been among those contemplated. The Operating Agreement was executed in 1975 when the mining laws provided only minimal participation by the State in mining activities; the passage of the 1987 Constitution, on one hand, and of RA No. 7942, on the other hand, drastically changed the system by giving the State full control and supervision over exploration, development and utilization of natural resources, and allowing only limited forms of mining agreements. Such dynamic change in the relationship between the State and the mining right holder could not have been among those that Benguet Corporation was authorized to enter into under the Operating Agreement.<br><br>A corporation can only exercise its powers and transact its business through its board of directors and through its officers and agents<i> when authorized by a board resolution or its bylaws</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Dizon Mines never submitted proof that Juvencio Dizon, Dizon Mines’ President, was authorized by the Board or its bylaws. While the letter dated June 14, 1991, addressed to Benguet Corporation and signed by Juvencio Dizon, states that –<br><br><blockquote>We hereby confirm and approve the filing of the MPSA proposal in accordance with plan presented in your letter dated June 3, [1991,]</blockquote><br>it was not accompanied by a resolution from Dizon Mines’ Board of Directors, either agreeing with Benguet Corporation’s MPSA application or granting its President the authority to agree with the application.<br><br>Thus, at the time of filing, Benguet Corporation’s MPSA application could not validly be considered as filed in behalf of Dizon Mines in the absence of a proper authorization from the latter. By the time Benguet Corporation assigned to Dizon Mines its MPSA application on October 22, 2004, the September 15, 1997 deadline had already lapsed. Hence, Dizon Mines was unable to exercise its preferential rights within the period set by law.<br><br>Under Section 10 of DENR Memorandum Order No. 97-07, “any valid and existing mining claim x x x for which the concerned holder failed to file [the necessary] Mineral Agreement application by September 15, 1997, shall [be] considered <b>automatically abandoned and the area covered thereby rendered open to Mining Applications effective September 16, 1997</b>[.]” Since MPSA-P-III-16 and MPSA-P-III-03-05 were transferred to/filed by Dizon Mines after the September 15, 1997 cut-off date, the <i>ponencia</i> considered these as new MPSA applications. However, the same administrative issuance disqualifies holders who failed to exercise their preferential rights from applying for MPSAs on areas covered by their abandoned mining claims:<br><br><blockquote>DENR Memorandum Order No. 97-07. Section 11. <i>Acceptance of Mining Application Over the Areas Subject to Mining Claims and Lease/Quarry Applications Abandoned After September 15, 1997.</i><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The holder or a valid and existing mining claim or lease/quarry application who <b>failed to file the necessary Mineral Agreement Application</b> on or before September 15, 1997 shall be disqualified from thereafter filing a Mining Application over the same area covered by such abandoned claim or application.</blockquote><br>Accordingly, Dizon Mines is disquialified from filing any Mineral Production Sharing Agreement application involving the areas covered by the 57 mining claims.&nbsp; Given the foregoing consideration, I agree that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary's denial of Dizon Copper-Silver Mines, Inc.'s MPSA-P-III-16 and MPSA-P-III-03-05 is proper.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Miners Association of the Philippines&nbsp; v.

(BCI) to file the MPSA-P-III-16 application on behalf of&nbsp; Dizon Copper Silver Mines, Inc. (Dizon Copper).<br><br>The first point raised is that a corporate officer cannot bind the corporation without authorization from the board of directors. Juvencio D. Dizon, President or Dizon Copper, was allegedly not acting within any express or implied authority from Dizon Copper's board in writing the 14 June 1991 letter to BCI giving nuthority to BCI to file the MPSA-P-III-16 application.&nbsp; Further, there was allegedly no ratification on the part of Dizon Copper to Juvencio's act of giving such authority to BCI.<br><br>Generally, in the absence of authority from the board or directors, no person can validly bind a corporation, not even its corporate officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> However, the board of directors may validly delegate some of its functions and powers to its officers, committees, or agents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The authority of the officers, committees, or agents to bind the corporation can be derived from law, the corporate by-laws <b>or from authorization from the board, expressly or<i> impliedly by habit, custom or acquiescence in the general course of business</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> This Court has ruled:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [R]atification can be made by the corporate board either expressly or impliedly. <b>Implied ratification may take various forms – like silence or acquiescence;</b> by acts showing approval or adoption of the contract; or by acceptance and retention of benefits flowing therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>From the time Juvencio issued the authorization letter on 14 June 1991 to the present, <b>or over a period of more than 20 years,</b> Dizon Copper never questioned Juvencio’s authority to write the 14 June 1991 letter to BCI authorizing BCI to file the MPSA-P-III-16 application. Justice Perez points out that “when there exists <u>other facts that clearly deny or contradict any such intent</u> on the part of the principal – implied ratification cannot be inferred from such <i>mere</i> silence.”<br><br>The fact is, there was <b>no mere silence</b> by Dizon Copper. In its Memorandum dated 22 April 2009, Dizon Copper stated that “[o]n 04 July 1991, Benguet filed,<b> in behalf of Petitioner DCSMI </b>and other claim owners, a[n] MPSA application, known as “MPSA-P-III-16,” over existing mining claims with a total area of 8,576 hectares, inclusive of Petitioner DCSMI’s 57 existing mining claims covering 513 hectares.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thus, <b>Dizon Copper <i>expressly acknowledged</i> in its Memorandum that BCI was acting on its behalf in filing the MPSA-P-III-16 application.</b>&nbsp; Dizon Copper never questioned the authorization given by Juvencio to BCI file the application on Dizon Copper’s behalf. More importantly, the statement in Dizon Copper’s Memorandum showed its <b>approval of Juvencio’s act </b>as well as its acceptance and retention of the benefits flowing from such act.<br><br>In short, no one can say that Juvencio was not acting within any express or implied authority because Dizon Copper never questioned Juvencio’s authority to issue the authorization letter to BCI, and in fact Dizon Copper <b>expressly acknowledged</b> that BCI was acting on Dizon Copper’s behalf in filing the MPSA-P-III-16 application.<br><br>More importantly, it would be self-defeating and self-destructive for Dizon Copper to disown Juvencio’s 14 June 1991 letter to BCI for it would mean the loss of Dizon Copper’s valuable preferential right to a mineral agreement with the government. In fact, any act of Dizon Copper’s board disowning Juvencio’s letter to BCI would be contrary to the best interest of Dizon Copper, and would subject the board to suit for damages by stockholders of Dizon Copper. Juvencio’s act in giving authority to BCI was both <b>necessary and appropriate</b> to preserve a valuable preferential right of Dizon Copper, as well as to continue the core business of Dizon Copper. Such act bears the <b>implied authority of the board</b> of Dizon Copper, in accordance with well-settled jurisprudence, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Corporate officers, in their case, may act on such matters as may be authorized either expressly by the By-laws or Board Resolutions or impliedly such as by general practice or policy or as are implied by express powers. When officers are allowed to act in certain particular cases, their acts conformably therewith can bind the company. <b>Hence, a corporate officer entrusted with general management and control of the business has the implied authority to act or contract for the corporation which may be <i>necessary or appropriate </i>to conduct the ordinary business.</b> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Boldfacing and italicization supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Justice Perez states that the Operating Agreement prohibited BCI from entering into any major contract. In this case, BCI filed the MPSA-P-III-16 application in order to continue its operations under the Operating Agreement and it acted on behalf of Dizon Copper upon authority from Juvencio. Justice Perez further states that the doctrine of apparent authority has no application because BCI cannot be considered an innocent party who has no knowledge of Juvencio’s lack of authority to bind the corporation. Again, Juvencio’s supposed lack of authority is negated by the fact that Dizon Copper expressly acknowledged in its Memorandum that BCI was acting in its behalf in filing the MPSA-P-III-16 application. Besides, Juvencio’s act in giving BCI the authority is both necessary and appropriate to protect and continue Dizon Copper’s main business.<br><br>The second point raised, this time by Justice Brion, is that the authorization from Celestino and his heirs with respect to the six minings claims covered by the MLCs, is irrevelant. Justice Brion states:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. These MLCs were to expire on January 31, 2005. Section 19 of RA No. 7942, however, prohibits mineral agreement applications involving areas that are covered by valid and existing mining rights. Section 112 of RA No. 7942 specifically provides that “[a]ll valid and existing mining lease contracts x x x at the date of effectivity of [the] Act, shall remain valid, shall not be impaired, and shall be recognized by the Government[.]” Hence, under the law,<b> any application <i>filed by any entity</i> involving areas covered by the MLCs filed on or before January 31, 2005 is premature and should be denied.</b> Dizon Mines’ MPSA-P-III-16 and MPSA-P-III-03-05 were filed on December 16, 2004 and January 31, 2005, respectively; as both applications were filed before the opening of the period for application, the dismissal of the applications with respect to 7 the areas covered by the MLCs is thus proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>The rule that no application for mineral agreements may be filed involving areas covered by existing MLCs applies to <b><i>third persons</i></b> other than the holder of the MLCs. This is precisely to protect the preferential right of existing holders of MLCs before opening the application to the public or third parties.<br><br>In his <i>ponencia</i>, Justice Perez stated:<br><br><blockquote>Per x x x DENR M.O. No. 97-07, holders of existing mining claims or lease/quarry applications have only until <b>the 15<sup>th</sup> of September 1997 to file an appropriate mineral agreement application</b> in the exercise of their “<i>preferential rights to enter into mineral agreements with the government</i>” involving their claims. DENR M.O. No. 97-07 also provides that <b>failure of the said holders to exercise such preferential right is deemed an abandonment of their existing mining claims or applications.</b><br><br>In the instant case, MPSA-P-III-16 was the only MPSA application that was filed before the mandatory deadline. Aside from it, petitioner filed no other <i>valid</i> MPSA application covering its mining claims before 15 September 1997.<br><br>Given the foregoing, it becomes clear that a finding of invalidity of MPSA-P-III-16 has a profound effect on petitioner's rights as to the <b>51 mining claims not covered by MLCs:</b><br><br><i>First</i>: The validity of MPSA-P-III-16 necessarily meant that <b>petitioner was not able to validly exercise its preferential rights under Section 113 of R.A. 7924</b>. As a result, <b>petitioner is already deemed to have abandoned its mining claims as of 15 September 1997.</b><br><br><i>Second</i>: The assignment of MPSA-P-III-16 in favor of petitioner has also been rendered of no consequence. Such assignment was made by Benguet, and then approved by the DENR, only in 2004-which is well beyond the 15 September 1997 deadline. At that time, petitioner has already lost any legal vested interest it has in the subject mining claims.<br><br><i>Third:</i> Petitioner's MPSA-III-03-05, filed on 31 January 2005, is considered as a new application insofar as the subject 51 mining claims are concerned. <b>Petitioner thereby enjoys no preference regarding the said application's approval.</b></blockquote><br>The <i>ponencia</i> and Justice Brion admit that the holder of MLCs has the preferential right to enter into a mineral agreement with the government involving areas covered by the holder of MLCs. However, the ponencia and Justice Brion point out that only BCI filed an MPSA application before the 15 September 1997 deadline and that BCI did not have authority to file the MPSA-P-III-16 application on behalf of Dizon Copper.<br><br>Again, it boils down to whether Juvencio had authority to write the 14 June 1991 letter to BCI. BCI’s authority to file the MPSA-P-III-16 application on behalf of Dizon Copper has been duly established in this case. As such, BCI’s assignment of the MPSA-P-III-16 application to Dizon Copper should be reckoned from the time BCI filed the application before the 15 September 1997 deadline and not from the time of the assignment of the MPSA-P-III-16 application to Dizon Copper. Dizon Copper did not abandon its valid and existing mining claim because BCI filed the MPSA-P111- 16 application on its behalf, an act necessary and appropriate to continue the main business of Dizon Copper.<br><br>Hence, the petit ion should be granted.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>People's Aircargo and Warehouseng Co., Inc. v.
