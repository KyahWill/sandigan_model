				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case is about the evidence required for proving conspiracy and the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength in a murder case.<br><br><center><b>The Facts and the Case</b><br></center><br>The Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila charged the accused Chito Nazareno and Fernando Saliendra, a <i>barangay tanod</i>, of murder before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of that city in Criminal Case 94-133117.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Since Saliendra remained at-large, only Nazareno was tried. The prosecution presented Roy Magallanes, Roger Francisco, SPO1 Teodoro Sinag, SPO1 Julian Bustamante, Dr. Antonio E. Rebosa, and Jovelo Valdez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On November 10, 1993 David Valdez (David), Magallanes, and Francisco attended the wake of a friend.&nbsp; While there, they drank liquor with accused Nazareno and Saliendra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; A heated argument ensued between Magallanes and Nazareno but their companions pacified them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On the following day, November 11, David, Magallanes, and Francisco returned to the wake.&nbsp; Accused Nazareno and Saliendra also arrived and told the three not to mind the previous night’s altercation.&nbsp; At around 9:30 in the evening, while David, Francisco, and their friend, Aida Unos were walking on the street, Nazareno and Saliendra blocked their path.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Nazareno boxed Francisco who fled but Saliendra went after him with a <i>balisong</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Francisco, who succeeded in hiding saw Nazareno hit David on the body with a stick while Saliendra struck David’s head with a stone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; David ran towards a gasoline station but Nazareno and Saliendra, aided by some <i>barangay tanods</i>, caught up with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; As David fell, the <i>barangay tanods </i>took over the assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; This took place as Magallanes stood about five meters across the highway unable to help his friend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Afterwards, Unos brought David to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Dr. Rebosa performed surgery on David’s head but he died on November 14, 1993 of massive intra-cranial hemorrhage secondary to depressed fracture on his right temporal bone<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in a form of blunt trauma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On November 12, 1993 after David’s relatives reported the killing to the police, SPO1 Sinag investigated the case and took Unos’s statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; On November 15, accompanied by SPO1 Bustamante and two other police officers, SPO1 Sinag went to the UST Hospital and took a look at David’s body, noting the wounds on his forehead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Subsequently, the officers went to the crime scene but found no witness there.<br><br>In his defense, accused Nazareno claimed that he left his house at around 9:30 in the evening on November 11, 1993 to buy milk.&nbsp; While on a street near his house, he noted a commotion taking place nearby.&nbsp; He then bumped into Saliendra.&nbsp; Nazareno proceeded home and went to bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; His wife Isabel supported his testimony, claiming that she asked her husband on that night to buy milk for their children.&nbsp; When Nazareno returned home, he informed her of the commotion outside and how someone bumped into him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Unos testified that she saw Saliendra chasing David as the latter hang on the rear of a running jeepney.&nbsp; She claimed that she did not see Nazareno around the place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On March 9, 2004, the RTC found Nazareno guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength and aggravated by treachery.&nbsp; The RTC sentenced Nazareno to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered him to pay P141,670.25 as actual damages, P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P50,000.00 as moral damages, without any subsidiary imprisonment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed with modification the decision of the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Finding no treachery, it convicted Nazareno of murder qualified by abuse of superior strength, hence, this appeal.<br><br><center><b>Issues Presented</b><br></center><br>The issues in this case are:<br><br>1. Whether or not Nazareno took part in a conspiracy to kill David;<br><br>2. Whether or not a qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength attended the killing of David.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></div><br><b>One</b>.&nbsp; As a rule, the factual findings of the trial court are, except for compelling or exceptional reasons, conclusive to the Court especially when fully supported by evidence and affirmed by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Here, no sound reason exists to alter the findings of the RTC and the CA with respect to the facts they deemed to have been proved and the credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Actions indicating close personal association and shared sentiment among the accused can prove its presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Proof that the perpetrators met beforehand and decided to commit the crime is not necessary as long as their acts manifest a common design and oneness of purpose.<br><br>Here, both the RTC and the CA found conspiracy in attendance.&nbsp; Magallanes and Francisco testified that accused Nazareno and Saliendra purposely waited for David and his companions out on the street as they came out of the wake.&nbsp; The witnesses testified that each of Nazareno and Saliendra took concerted steps aimed at killing or causing serious harm to David.&nbsp; Nazareno repeatedly struck David on the area of his neck with a stick; Saliendra hurled a fist-sized stone on his head.&nbsp; Even when David tried to flee, they still chased him and together with other barangay tanods, beat him to unconsciousness.&nbsp; Although Magallanes testified that Saliendra and Nazareno acted “quite differently” from each other before the attack,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> their actions before and during the incident reveal a common purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Saliendra appears to have delivered the fatal blow but Nazareno cannot escape liability because, in conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Magallanes and Francisco saw the commission of the offense from different angles but the core of their stories remains cohesive.&nbsp; The result of the autopsy of David’s body corroborates such stories.&nbsp; True their accounts have certain inconsistencies but these do not weaken their credibility since they concurred on material points.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Rather, those small inconsistencies strengthened their credibility as they evince spontaneity and candor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Completely uniform and identical statements manifest rehearsed testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Taken against these considerations, the Court cannot give credence to Nazareno’s defense of alibi.&nbsp; To be admissible, not only must he be at a different place during the commission of the crime, his presence at the crime scene must also be physically impossible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Here, Nazareno even admits that he encountered Saliendra, the accused who went into hiding, on the street and noticed the commotion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><b>Two</b>.&nbsp; The CA held that the killing of David should be characterized as one of murder qualified by abuse of superior strength.&nbsp; The Court finds no fault in this ruling.&nbsp; There is abuse of superior strength when the aggressors purposely use excessive force rendering the victim unable to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The notorious inequality of forces creates an unfair advantage for the aggressor.<br><br>Here, Nazareno and Saliendra evidently armed themselves beforehand, Nazareno with a stick and Saliendra with a heavy stone.&nbsp; David was unarmed.&nbsp; The two chased him even as he fled from them.&nbsp; And when they caught up with him, aided by some unnamed <i>barangay tanods</i>, Nazareno and Saliendra exploited their superior advantage and knocked the defenseless David unconscious.&nbsp; He evidently died from head fracture caused by one of the blows on his head.<br><br>On the matter of penalty, the Court affirms the imposition of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The Court retains the amount of P141,670.25 as actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; But, consistent with current jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court is awarding P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. 01308 dated December 17, 2010, that found Chito Nazareno guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder qualified by abuse of superior strength in Criminal Case 94-133117.<br><br>The Court also <b>AFFIRMS</b> the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>imposed on accused Nazareno but <b>MODIFIES</b> the award of damages to P141,670.25 as actual damages, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Peralta</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated Acting Member in lieu of Associate Justice Jose P.
