SP No. 91281.<br><br>The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:<br><br>Petitioner Lockheed Detective and Watchman Agency, Inc.

The Order dated 23 November 2003 is hereby reversed and set aside. The Labor Arbiter is directed to issue a Writ of Execution for the satisfaction of the judgment award in favor of Third-Party complainants.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>UP moved to reconsider the NLRC resolution.&nbsp; On December 28, 2004, the NLRC upheld its resolution but with modification that the satisfaction of the judgment award in favor of Lockheed will be only against the funds of UP which are not identified as public funds.<br><br>The NLRC order and resolution having become final, Lockheed filed a motion for the issuance of an alias writ of execution.&nbsp; The same was granted on May 23, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On July 25, 2005, a Notice of Garnishment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> was issued to Philippine National Bank (PNB) UP Diliman Branch for the satisfaction of the award of P12,142,522.69 (inclusive of execution fee).<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated August 9, 2005, PNB informed UP that it has received an order of release dated August 8, 2005 issued by the Labor Arbiter directing PNB UP Diliman Branch to release to the NLRC Cashier, through the assigned NLRC Sheriff Max L. Lago, the judgment award/amount of P12,142,522.69.&nbsp; PNB likewise reminded UP that the bank only has 10 working days from receipt of the order to deliver the garnished funds and unless it receives a notice from UP or the NLRC before the expiry of the 10-day period regarding the issuance of a court order or writ of injunction discharging or enjoining the implementation and execution of the Notice of Garnishment and Writ of Execution, the bank shall be constrained to cause the release of the garnished funds in favor of the NLRC.<br><br>On August 16, 2005, UP filed an Urgent Motion to Quash Garnishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; UP contended that the funds being subjected to garnishment at PNB are government/public funds.&nbsp; As certified by the University Accountant, the subject funds are covered by Savings Account No. 275-529999-8, under the name of UP System Trust Receipts, earmarked for Student Guaranty Deposit, Scholarship Fund, Student Fund, Publications, Research Grants, and Miscellaneous Trust Account.&nbsp; UP argued that as public funds, the subject PNB account cannot be disbursed except pursuant to an appropriation required by law.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter, however, dismissed the urgent motion for lack of merit on August 30, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On September 2, 2005, the amount of P12,062,398.71 was withdrawn by the sheriff from UP’s PNB account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 2005, UP filed a petition for certiorari before the CA based on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>The concept of “solidary liability” by an indirect employer notwithstanding, respondent NLRC gravely abused its discretion in a manner amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by misusing such concept to justify the garnishment by the executing Sheriff of public/government funds belonging to UP.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>Respondents NLRC and Arbiter LORA acted without jurisdiction or gravely abused their discretion in a manner amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when, by means of an Alias Writ of Execution against petitioner UP, they authorized respondent Sheriff to garnish UP’s public funds. Similarly, respondent LORA gravely abused her discretion when she resolved petitioner’s Motion to Quash Notice of Garnishment addressed to, and intended for, the NLRC, and when she unilaterally and arbitrarily disregarded an official Certification that the funds garnished are public/government funds, and thereby allowed respondent Sheriff to withdraw the same from PNB.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>Respondents gravely abused their discretion in a manner amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when they, despite prior knowledge, effected the execution that caused paralyzation and dislocation to petitioner’s governmental functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>On March 12, 2008, the CA rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dismissing UP’s petition for certiorari.&nbsp; Citing <i>Republic v. COCOFED</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which defines public funds as moneys belonging to the State or to any political subdivisions of the State, more specifically taxes, customs, duties and moneys raised by operation of law for the support of the government or the discharge of its obligations, the appellate court ruled that the funds sought to be garnished do not seem to fall within the stated definition.<br><br>On reconsideration, however, the CA issued the assailed Amended Decision.&nbsp; It held that without departing from its findings that the funds covered in the savings account sought to be garnished do not fall within the classification of public funds, it reconsiders the dismissal of the petition in light of the ruling in the case of <i>National Electrification Administration v. Morales</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which mandates that all money claims against the government must first be filed with the Commission on Audit (COA).<br><br>Lockheed moved to reconsider the amended decision but the same was denied in the assailed CA Resolution dated December 23, 2008.&nbsp; The CA cited <i>Manila International Airport Authority v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which held that UP ranks with MIAA, a government instrumentality exercising corporate powers but not organized as a stock or non-stock corporation. While said corporations are government instrumentalities, they are loosely called government corporate entities but not government-owned and controlled corporations in the strict sense.<br><br>Hence this petition by Lockheed raising the following arguments:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> RESPONDENT UP IS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY WITH A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT PERSONALITY FROM THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND HAS ITS OWN CHARTER GRANTING IT THE RIGHT TO SUE AND BE SUED. IT THEREFORE CANNOT AVAIL OF THE IMMUNITY FROM SUIT OF THE GOVERNMENT. NOT HAVING IMMUNITY FROM SUIT, RESPONDENT UP CAN BE HELD LIABLE AND EXECUTION CAN THUS ENSUE.<br><br></li><li>MOREOVER, IF THE COURT LENDS IT ASSENT TO THE INVOCATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF STATE IMMUNITY, THIS WILL RESULT [IN] GRAVE INJUSTICE.<br><br></li><li>FURTHERMORE, THE PROTESTATIONS OF THE RESPONDENT ARE TOO LATE IN THE DAY, AS THE EXECUTION PROCEEDINGS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TERMINATED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>Lockheed contends that UP has its own separate and distinct juridical entity from the national government and has its own charter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it can be sued and be held liable. Moreover, Executive Order No. 714 entitled “Fiscal Control and Management of the Funds of UP” recognizes that “as an institution of higher learning, UP has always granted full management and control of its affairs including its financial affairs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, it cannot shield itself from its private contractual liabilities by simply invoking the public character of its funds.&nbsp; Lockheed also cites several cases wherein it was ruled that funds of public corporations which can sue and be sued were not exempt from garnishment.<br><br>Lockheed likewise argues that the rulings in the <i>NEA</i> and <i>MIAA</i> cases are inapplicable.&nbsp; It contends that UP is not similarly situated with NEA because the jurisdiction of COA over the accounts of UP is only on a post-audit basis.&nbsp; As to the <i>MIAA</i> case, the liability of MIAA pertains to the real estate taxes imposed by the City of Paranaque while the obligation of UP in this case involves a private contractual obligation.&nbsp; Lockheed also argues that the declaration in <i>MIAA</i> specifically citing UP was mere obiter dictum.<br><br>Lockheed moreover submits that UP cannot invoke state immunity to justify and perpetrate an injustice.&nbsp; UP itself admitted its liability and thus it should not be allowed to renege on its contractual obligations.&nbsp; Lockheed contends that this might create a ruinous precedent that would likely affect the relationship between the public and private sectors.<br><br>Lastly, Lockheed contends that UP cannot anymore seek the quashal of the writ of execution and notice of garnishment as they are already <i>fait accompli</i>.<br><br>For its part, UP contends that it did not invoke the doctrine of state immunity from suit in the proceedings <i>a quo</i> and in fact, it did not object to being sued before the labor department.&nbsp; It maintains, however, that suability does not necessarily mean liability.&nbsp; UP argues that the CA correctly applied the <i>NEA </i>ruling when it held that all money claims must be filed with the COA.<br><br>As to alleged injustice that may result for invocation of state immunity from suit, UP reiterates that it consented to be sued and even participated in the proceedings below.&nbsp; Lockheed cannot now claim that invocation of state immunity, which UP did not invoke in the first place, can result in injustice.<br><br>On the <i>fait accompli </i>argument, UP argues that Lockheed cannot wash its hands from liability for the consummated garnishment and execution of UP’s trust fund in the amount of P12,062,398.71.&nbsp; UP cites that damage was done to UP and the beneficiaries of the fund when said funds, which were earmarked for specific educational purposes, were misapplied, for instance, to answer for the execution fee of P120,123.98 unilaterally stipulated by the sheriff.&nbsp; Lockheed, being the party which procured the illegal garnishment, should be held primarily liable.&nbsp; The mere fact that the CA set aside the writ of garnishment confirms the liability of Lockheed to reimburse and indemnify in accordance with law.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>We agree with UP that there was no point for Lockheed in discussing the doctrine of state immunity from suit as this was never an issue in this case.&nbsp; Clearly, UP consented to be sued when it participated in the proceedings below.&nbsp; What UP questions is the hasty garnishment of its funds in its PNB account.<br><br>This Court finds that the CA correctly applied the <i>NEA</i> case.&nbsp; Like NEA, UP is a juridical personality separate and distinct from the government and has the capacity to sue and be sued.&nbsp; Thus, also like NEA, it cannot evade execution, and its funds may be subject to garnishment or levy. However, before execution may be had, a claim for payment of the judgment award must first be filed with the COA.&nbsp; Under Commonwealth Act No. 327,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as amended by Section 26 of P.D. No. 1445,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> it is the COA which has primary jurisdiction to examine, audit and settle “all debts and claims of any sort” due from or owing the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries.&nbsp; With respect to money claims arising from the implementation of Republic Act No. 6758,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> their allowance or disallowance is for COA to decide, subject only to the remedy of appeal by petition for certiorari to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>We cannot subscribe to Lockheed’s argument that NEA is not similarly situated with UP because the COA’s jurisdiction over the latter is only on post-audit basis.&nbsp; A reading of the pertinent Commonwealth Act provision clearly shows that it does not make any distinction as to which of the government subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries whose debts should be filed before the COA.<br><br>As to the <i>fait accompli</i> argument of Lockheed, contrary to its claim that there is nothing that can be done since the funds of UP had already been garnished, since the garnishment was erroneously carried out and did not go through the proper procedure (the filing of a claim with the COA), UP is entitled to reimbursement of the garnished funds plus interest of 6% per annum, to be computed from the time of judicial demand to be reckoned from the time UP filed a petition for certiorari before the CA which occurred right after the withdrawal of the garnished funds from PNB.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on certiorari is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.&nbsp; Petitioner Lockheed Detective and Watchman Agency, Inc. is ordered to <b>REIMBURSE</b> respondent University of the Philippines the amount of P12,062,398.71 plus interest of 6% per annum, to be computed from September 12, 2005 up to the finality of this Decision, and 12% interest on the entire amount from date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, (Acting Chairperson), Peralta,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Bersamin, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Reyes,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">**</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated additional member per Raffle dated April 2, 2012.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> Designated additional member per Raffle dated April 16, 2012.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 47-50.
