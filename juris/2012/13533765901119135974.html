Nuqui added that the BSP’s action shall be governed by CB Circular No. 28, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On November 17, 1994, the PDB also asked BSP Deputy Governor Edgardo Zialcita that (i) a notation in the BSP’s books be made against the transfer, exchange, or payment of the bonds and the payment of interest thereon; and (ii) the presenter of the bonds upon maturity be required to submit proof as a holder in due course (of the first set of CB bills). The PDB relied on Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>(4) Assignments effected by fraud – Where the assignment of a registered bond is secured by fraudulent representations, the Central Bank can grant no relief if the assignment has been honored without notice of fraud.

It argued that the PDB has no cause of action against it since the PDB is no longer the owner of the CB bills. Contrary to the PDB’s “warehousing theory,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the BOC asserted that the (i) April 15 transaction and the (ii) April 19 transaction – covering both sets of CB bills - were valid contracts of sale, followed by a transfer of title (i) to the BOC (in the April 15 transaction) upon the PDB’s delivery of the 1<sup>st</sup> set of CB bills <i>in substitution</i> of the Treasury Bills the PDB originally intended to sell, and (ii) to Bancap (in the April 19 transaction) upon the PDB’s delivery of the 2<sup>nd</sup> set of CB bills to Bancap, likewise by way of substitution.<br><br>The BOC adds that Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28 cannot apply to the PDB’s case because (i) the PDB is not in possession of the CB bills and (ii) the BOC acquired these bills from the PDB, as to the 1<sup>st</sup> set of CB bills, and from Bancap, as to the 2<sup>nd</sup> set of CB bills, in good faith and for value. The BOC also asserted a compulsory counterclaim for damages and attorney’s fees.<br><br>On the other hand, the BSP countered that the PDB cannot invoke Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28 because this section applies only to an “owner” and a “person presenting the bond,” of which the PDB is neither. The PDB has not presented to the BSP any assignment of the subject CB bills, duly recorded in the BSP’s books, in its favor to clothe it with the status of an “owner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> According to the BSP –<br><br><blockquote>Section 10 d. (4) applies only to a <u>registered bond</u> which is <u>assigned</u>. And the issuance of CB Bills x x x are required to be recorded/registered in BSP’s books. In this regard, <u>Section 4 a. (1)</u> of CB Circular 28 provides that <u>registered bonds “may be transferred only by an assignment</u> thereon duly executed by the registered owner or his duly authorized representative x x x and <u>duly recorded on the books of the Central Bank</u>.”<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>The alleged assignment of subject CB Bills in PDB’s favor is not recorded/registered in BSP’s books</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Consequently, when Nuqui and the BSP refused the PDB’s request (to record its claim), they were merely performing their duties in accordance with CB Circular No. 28.<br><br>Alternatively, the BSP asked that an interpleader suit be allowed between and among the claimants to the subject CB bills on the position that while it is able and willing to pay the subject CB bills’ face value, it is duty bound to ensure that payment is made to the rightful owner. The BSP prayed that judgment be rendered:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Ordering the dismissal of the [PDB’s petition] for lack of merit;<br></li><li>Determining which between/among [PDB] and the other claimants is/are lawfully entitled to the ownership of the subject CB bills and the proceeds thereof;<br></li><li>x x x;<br></li><li>Ordering PDB to pay BSP and Nuqui such actual/compensatory and exemplary damages… as [the RTC] may deem warranted; and<br></li><li>Ordering PDB to pay Nuqui moral damages… and to pay the costs of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><b><i>Subsequent events</i></b><br><br>The PDB agreed with the BSP’s alternative response for an interpleader –<br><br><blockquote>4. PDB agrees that the various claimants should now interplead and substantiate their respective claims on the subject CB bills. However, the total face value of the subject CB bills should be deposited in escrow with a private bank to be disposed of only upon order [of the RTC].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Accordingly, on June 9, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and August 4, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the BOC and the PDB entered into two separate Escrow Agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The first agreement covered the first set of CB bills, while the second agreement covered the second set of CB bills.

The RTC gave its approval to the parties’ Joint Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Accordingly, the BSP released the maturity proceeds of the CB bills by crediting the Demand Deposit Account of the PDB and of the BOC with 50% each of the maturity proceeds of the amount in escrow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In view of the BOC’s acquisition of all the CB bills, All Asia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> moved to be dropped as a respondent (with the PDB’s conformity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>), which the RTC granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The RCBC subsequently followed suit. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In light of the developments, on May 4, 1998, the RTC required the parties to manifest their intention regarding the case and to inform the court of any amicable settlement; “otherwise, th[e] case shall be dismissed for lack of interest.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Complying with the RTC’s order, the BOC moved (i) that the case be set for pre-trial and (ii) for further proceeding to resolve the remaining issues between the BOC and the PDB, particularly on “who has a better right over the subject CB bills.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The <b><u>PDB joined the BOC in its motion</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b><u>On September 28, 2000, the RTC granted the BSP’s motion to interplead</u></b> and, accordingly, required the BOC to amend its Answer and for the conflicting claimants to comment thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In October 2000, the BOC filed its <i>Amended Consolidated Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim</i>, reiterating its earlier arguments asserting ownership over the subject CB bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In the alternative, the BOC added that even assuming that there was no effective transfer of the nine CB bills ultimately to the BOC, the PDB remains obligated to deliver to the BOC, as buyer in the April 15 transaction and ultimate successor-in-interest of the buyer (Bancap) in the April 19 transaction, either the original subjects of the sales or the value thereof, plus whatever income that may have been earned during the pendency of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>That BOC prayed:<br><br><blockquote>1.

The RTC cannot entertain the BOC’s counterclaim, regardless of its nature, because it is the BSP which has jurisdiction to determine who is entitled to receive the proceeds of the CB bills.<br><br>The BOC opposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the PDB’s Omnibus Motion. The PDB filed its Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In a January 10, 2002 Order, the RTC dismissed the PDB’s petition, the BOC’s counterclaim and the BSP’s counter-complaint/cross-claim for interpleader, holding that under CB Circular No. 28, it has no jurisdiction (i) over the BOC’s “counterclaims” and (ii) to resolve the issue of ownership of the CB bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> With the denial of their separate motions for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the BOC and the BSP separately filed the present petitions for review on <i>certiorari.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>THE BOC’S and THE BSP’S PETITIONS</u></b></center><br><br>The BOC argues that the present cases do not fall within the limited provision of Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28, which contemplates only of three situations: <i>first</i>, where the fraudulent assignment is not <u>coupled with</u> a notice to the BSP, it can grant no relief; <i>second</i>, where the fraudulent assignment is coupled with a notice of fraud to the BSP, it will make a notation against the assignment <u>and require the <i>owner</i> and the <i>holder</i> to substantiate their claims</u>; and <i>third</i>, where the case does not fall on either of the first two situations, the BSP will have to await action on the assignment pending settlement of the case, whether by agreement or by court order.<br><br>The PDB’s case cannot fall under the first two situations. With particular regard to the second situation, CB Circular No. 28 requires that the conflict must be between an “owner” and a “holder,” for the BSP to exercise its limited jurisdiction to resolve conflicting claims; and the word “owner” here refers to the <u>registered owner</u> giving notice of the fraud to the BSP. The PDB, however, is not the registered owner nor is it in possession (holder) of the CB bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Consequently, the PDB’s case can only falls under the third situation which leaves the RTC, as a court of general jurisdiction, with the authority to resolve the issue of ownership of a registered bond (the CB bills) not falling in either of the first two situations.<br><br>The BOC asserts that the policy consideration supportive of its interpretation of CB Circular No. 28 is to have a reliable system to protect the registered owner; should he file a notice with the BSP about a fraudulent assignment of certain CB bills, the BSP simply has to look at its books to determine who is the owner of the CB bills fraudulently assigned. Since it is only the registered owner who complied with the BSP’s requirement of recording an assignment in the BSP’s books, then “the protective mantle of administrative proceedings” should necessarily benefit him only, without extending the same benefit to those who chose to ignore the Circular’s requirement, like the PDB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the PDB’s case falls under the second situation – i.e., the BSP has jurisdiction to resolve the issue of ownership of the CB bills – the more recent CB Circular No. 769-80 (<i>Rules and Regulations Governing Central Bank Certificates of Indebtedness</i>) already superseded CB Circular No. 28, and, in particular, effectively amended Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28. The pertinent provisions of CB Circular No. 769-80 read:<br><br><blockquote>Assignment Affected by Fraud. – Any assignment for transfer of ownership of registered certificate obtained through fraudulent representation if honored by the Central Bank or any of its authorized service agencies shall not make the Central Bank or agency liable therefore unless it has previous formal notice of the fraud. The Central Bank, upon notice under oath that the assignment was secured through fraudulent means, shall immediately issue and circularize a “stop order” against the transfer, exchange, redemption of the Certificate including the payment of interest coupons. The Central Bank or service agency concerned shall continue to withhold action on the certificate until such time that the conflicting claims have been finally settled either by amicable settlement between the parties or by order of the Court.</blockquote><br>Unlike CB Circular No. 28, CB Circular No. 769-80 limited the BSP’s authority to the mere issuance and circularization of a “stop order” against the transfer, exchange and redemption upon sworn notice of a fraudulent assignment. Under this Circular, the BSP shall only continue to withhold action until the dispute is ended by an amicable settlement or by judicial determination. Given the more passive stance of the BSP – the very agency tasked to enforce the circulars involved - under CB Circular No. 769-80, the RTC’s dismissal of the BOC’s counterclaims is palpably erroneous.<br><br>Lastly, since Nuqui’s office (Government Securities Department) had already been abolished,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> it can no longer adjudicate the dispute under the second situation covered by CB Circular No. 28. The abolition of Nuqui’s office is not only consistent with the BSP’s Charter but, more importantly, with CB Circular No. 769-80, which removed the BSP’s adjudicative authority over fraudulent assignments.<br><br><center><b><u>THE PDB’S COMMENT</u></b></center><br><br>The PDB claims that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint/petition and not by the defenses set up in the answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In filing the petition with the RTC, the PDB merely seeks to compel the BSP to determine, pursuant to CB Circular No. 28, the party legally entitled to the proceeds of the subject CB bills, which, as the PDB alleged, have been transferred through fraudulent representations – an allegation which properly recognized the BSP’s jurisdiction to resolve conflicting claims of ownership over the CB bills.<br><br>The PDB adds that under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, courts should refrain from determining a controversy involving a question whose resolution demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion. In the present case, the BSP’s special knowledge and experience in resolving disputes on securities, whose assignment and trading are governed by the BSP’s rules, should be upheld.<br><br>The PDB counters that the BOC’s tri-fold interpretation of Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28 sanctions split jurisdiction which is not favored; but even this tri-fold interpretation which, in the second situation, limits the meaning of the “owner” to the registered owner is flawed. Section 10 (d) 4 aims to protect not just the registered owner but anyone who has been deprived of his bond by fraudulent representation in order to deter fraud in the secondary trading of government securities.<br><br>The PDB asserts that the existence of CB Circular No. 769-80 or the abolition of Nuqui’s office does not result in depriving the BSP of its jurisdiction:<i> first</i>, CB Circular No. 769-80 expressly provides that CB Circular No. 28 shall have suppletory application to CB Circular No. 769-80; and <i>second,</i> the BSP can always designate an office to resolve the PDB’s claim over the CB bills.<br><br>Lastly, the PDB argues that even assuming that the RTC has jurisdiction to resolve the issue of ownership of the CB bills, the RTC has not acquired jurisdiction over the BOC’s so-called “compulsory” counterclaims (which in truth is merely “permissive”) because of the BOC’s failure to pay the appropriate docket fees. These counterclaims should, therefore, be dismissed and expunged from the record.<br><br><center><b><u>THE COURT’S RULING</u></b></center><br><br><b>We grant the petitions.</b><br><br>At the outset, we note that the parties have not raised the validity of either CB Circular No. 28 or CB Circular No. 769-80 as an issue. What the parties largely contest is the applicable circular in case of an allegedly fraudulently assigned CB bill. The applicable circular, in turn, is determinative of the proper remedy available to the PDB and/or the BOC as claimants to the proceeds of the subject CB bills.<br><br>Indisputably, at the time the PDB supposedly invoked the jurisdiction of the BSP in 1994 (by requesting for the annotation of its claim over the subject CB bills in the BSP’s books), CB Circular No. 769-80 has long been in effect. Therefore, the parties’ respective interpretations of the provision of Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28 do not have any significance unless it is first established that that Circular governs the resolution of their conflicting claims of ownership. This conclusion is important, given the supposed repeal or modification of Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28 by the following provisions of CB Circular No. 769-80:<br><br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE XI<br>SUPPLEMENTAL RULES<br></center><br>Section 1. <u>Central Bank Circular No. 28</u> – The provisions of Central Bank Circular No. 28 shall have <b>suppletory application</b> to matters not specially covered by these Rules.<br><br><center>ARTICLE XII<br>EFFECTIVITY<br></center><br>Effectivity – The rules and regulations herein prescribed shall take effect upon approval by the Monetary Board, Central Bank of the Philippines, and <b>all circulars</b>, memoranda, or office orders <b>inconsistent herewith are revoked or modified accordingly</b>. (Emphases added)</blockquote><br>We agree with the PDB that in view of CB Circular No. 28’s suppletory application, an attempt to harmonize the apparently conflicting provisions is a prerequisite before one may possibly conclude that an amendment or a repeal exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Interestingly, however, even the PDB itself failed to submit an interpretation based on its own position of harmonization.<br><br>The repealing clause of CB Circular No. 769-80 obviously did not <i>expressly </i>repeal CB Circular No. 28; in fact, it even provided for the suppletory application of CB Circular No. 28 on “matters not specially covered by” CB Circular No. 769-80. While no express repeal exists, the intent of CB Circular No. 769-80 to operate as an implied repeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> or at least to amend earlier CB circulars, is supported by its text “revok[i]ng]” or “modif[y]ing” “all circulars” which are inconsistent with its terms.<br><br>At the outset, we stress that none of the parties disputes that the subject CB bills fall within the category of a certificate or evidence of indebtedness and that these were issued by the Central Bank, now the BSP. Thus, even without resorting to statutory construction aids, matters involving the subject CB bills should necessarily be governed by CB Circular No. 769-80. Even granting, however, that reliance on CB Circular No. 769-80 alone is not enough, we find that CB Circular No. 769-80 impliedly repeals CB Circular No. 28.<br><br>An implied repeal transpires when a substantial conflict exists between the new and the prior laws. In the absence of an express repeal, a subsequent law cannot be construed as repealing a prior law unless an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy exist in the terms of the new and the old laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Repeal by implication is not favored, unless manifestly intended by the legislature, or unless it is convincingly and unambiguously demonstrated, that the laws or orders are clearly repugnant and patently inconsistent with one another so that they cannot co-exist; the legislature is presumed to know the existing law and would express a repeal if one is intended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>There are two instances of implied repeal. One takes place when the provisions in the two acts on the same subject matter are irreconcilably contradictory, in which case, the later act, to the extent of the conflict, constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one. The other occurs when the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute; thus, it will operate to repeal the earlier law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>A general reading of the two circulars shows that the second instance of implied repeal is present in this case. CB Circular No. 28, entitled “Regulations Governing Open Market Operations, Stabilization of Securities Market, Issue, Servicing and Redemption of Public Debt,” is a regulation governing the servicing and redemption of public debt, including the issue, inscription, registration, transfer, payment and replacement of bonds and securities representing the public debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> On the other hand, CB Circular No. 769-80, entitled “Rules and Regulations Governing Central Bank Certificate of Indebtedness,” is the governing regulation on matters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (i) involving certificate of indebtedness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> issued by the Central Bank itself and (ii) which are similarly covered by CB Circular No. 28.<br><br>The CB Monetary Board issued CB Circular No. 28 to regulate the servicing and redemption of public debt, pursuant to Section 124 (now Section 119 of Republic Act [R.A.] No. 7653) of the old Central Bank law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> which provides that “the servicing and redemption of the public debt shall also be effected through the [Bangko Sentral].” However, even as R.A. No. 7653 continued to recognize this role by the BSP, the law required a phase-out of all fiscal agency functions by the BSP, including Section 119 of R.A. No. 7653.<br><br>In other words, even if CB Circular No. 28 applies broadly to both government-issued bonds and securities and Central Bank-issued evidence of indebtedness, given the present state of law, CB Circular No. 28 and CB Circular No. 769-80 now operate on the same subject – Central Bank-issued evidence of indebtedness. Under Section 1, Article XI of CB Circular No. 769-80, the continued relevance and application of CB Circular No. 28 would depend on the need to supplement any deficiency or silence in CB Circular No. 769-80 on a particular matter.<br><br>In the present case, both CB Circular No. 28 and CB Circular No. 769-80 provide the BSP with a course of action in case of an allegedly fraudulently assigned certificate of indebtedness. Under CB Circular No. 28, in case of fraudulent assignments, the BSP would have to “call upon the owner and the person presenting the bond to substantiate their respective claims” and, from there, determine who has a better right over the registered bond. On the other hand, under CB Circular No. 769-80, the BSP shall merely “issue and circularize a ‘stop order’ against the transfer, exchange, redemption of the [registered] certificate” <i>without any adjudicative function</i> (which is the precise root of the present controversy). As the two circulars stand, the patent irreconcilability of these two provisions does not require elaboration. Section 5, Article V of CB Circular No. 769-80 inescapably repealed Section 10 (d) 4 of CB Circular No. 28.<br><br><b><i>The issue of BSP’s jurisdiction,<br>lay hidden</i></b><br><br>On that note, the Court could have written <i>finis </i>to the present controversy by simply sustaining the BSP’s hands-off approach to the PDB’s problem under CB Circular No. 769-80. However, the jurisdictional provision of CB Circular No. 769-80 itself, in relation to CB Circular No. 28, on the matter of fraudulent assignment, has given rise to a question of jurisdiction - the core question of law involved in these petitions - which the Court cannot just treat<i> sub-silencio.</i><br><br>Broadly speaking, jurisdiction is the legal power or authority to hear and determine a cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In the exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial power, it refers to the authority of a court to hear and decide a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In the context of these petitions, we hark back to the basic principles governing the question of jurisdiction over the subject matter.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined only by the Constitution and by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> As a matter of substantive law, procedural rules alone can confer no jurisdiction to courts or administrative agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> In fact, an administrative agency, acting in its quasi-judicial capacity, is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction and, as such, could wield only such powers that are specifically granted to it by the enabling statutes.

The PDB, in particular, relied solely and heavily on CB Circular No. 28.<br><br>In light of the above principles pointing to jurisdiction as a matter of substantive law, the provisions of the law itself that gave CB Circular 769-80 its life and jurisdiction must be examined.<br><br><b><i>The Philippine Central Bank</i></b><br><br>On January 3, 1949, Congress created the Central Bank of the Philippines (Central Bank) as a corporate body with the primary objective of (i) maintaining the internal and external monetary stability in the Philippines; and (ii) preserving the international value and the convertibility of the peso.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> In line with these broad objectives, the Central Bank was empowered to issue rules and regulations “necessary for the effective discharge of the responsibilities and exercise of the powers assigned to the Monetary Board and to the Central Bank.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Specifically, the Central Bank is authorized to organize (other) departments for the efficient conduct of its business and whose powers and duties “shall be determined by the Monetary Board, within the authority granted to the Board and the Central Bank”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> under its original charter.<br><br>With the 1973 Constitution, the then Central Bank was constitutionally made as the country’s central monetary authority until such time that Congress<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> shall have established a central bank. The 1987 Constitution continued to recognize this function of the then Central Bank until Congress, pursuant to the Constitution, created a new central monetary authority which later came to be known as the <i>Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.</i><br><br>Under the New Central Bank Act (<i>R.A.

Under R.A. No. 7653, the BSP’s powers and functions include (i) supervision over the operation of banks; (ii) regulation of operations of finance companies and non-bank financial institutions performing quasi banking functions; (iii) sole power and authority to issue currency within the Philippine territory; (iv) engaging in foreign exchange transactions; (v) making rediscounts, discounts, loans and advances to banking and other financial institutions to influence the volume of credit consistent with the objective of achieving price stability; (vi) engaging in open market operations; and (vii) acting as banker and financial advisor of the government.<br><br>On the BSP’s power of supervision over the operation of banks, Section 4 of R.A.

[emphasis ours]</blockquote><br>While this provision empowers the BSP to oversee the operations and activities of banks to “ascertain that laws and regulations are complied with,” the existence of the BSP’s jurisdiction in the present dispute cannot rely on this provision. The fact remains that the BSP already made known to the PDB its unfavorable position on the latter’s claim of fraudulent assignment due to the latter’s own <i>failure to comply</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> with existing regulations:<br><br><blockquote>In this connection, Section 10 (b) 2 also requires that a “Detached assignment will be recognized or accepted only upon previous notice to the Central Bank x x x.” In fact, in a memo dated September 23, 1991 xxx then CB Governor [Jose L.] Cuisia advised all banks (including PDB) xxx as follows:<br><br>In view recurring incidents ostensibly disregarding certain provisions of CB circular No. 28 (as amended) covering assignments of registered bonds, <b><i>all banks and all concerned are enjoined to observe strictly the pertinent provisions</i></b> of said CB Circular as hereunder quoted:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><blockquote>Under Section 10.b.

What the PDB requested the BSP on that date was <b><i>not</i></b> the recording <i>of the assignment </i>of the CB bills in its favor <b><i>but</i></b> the annotation <i>of its claim</i> over the CB bills at the time when (i) it was no longer in possession of the CB bills, having been transferred from one entity to another and (ii) all it has are the detached assignments, which the PDB has not shown to be compliant with Section 10 (b) 2 above-quoted. Obviously, the PDB cannot insist that the BSP take cognizance of its plaint when the basis of the BSP’s refusal under existing regulation, which the PDB is bound to observe, is the PDB’s own failure to comply therewith.<br><br>True, the BSP exercises supervisory powers (and regulatory powers) over banks (and quasi banks). The issue presented before the Court, however, does not concern the BSP’s supervisory power over banks as this power is understood under the General Banking Law. In fact, there is nothing in the PDB’s petition (even including the letters it sent to the BSP) that would support the BSP’s jurisdiction outside of CB Circular No. 28, under its power of supervision, over conflicting claims to the proceeds of the CB bills.<br><br><b><i>BSP has quasi-judicial powers over<br>a class of cases which does not include the<br>adjudication of ownership of the CB bills in question</i></b><br><br>In <i>United Coconut Planters Bank v.

Ganzon, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> the Court considered the BSP as an administrative agency,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> exercising quasi-judicial functions through its Monetary Board. It held:<br><br><blockquote>A quasi-judicial agency or body is an organ of government other than a court and other than a legislature, which affects the rights of private parties through either adjudication or rule-making. The very definition of an administrative agency includes its being vested with quasi-judicial powers. The ever increasing variety of powers and functions given to administrative agencies recognizes the need for the active intervention of administrative agencies in matters calling for technical knowledge and speed in countless controversies which cannot possibly be handled by regular courts. A "quasi-judicial function" is a term which applies to the action, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers or bodies, who are required to investigate facts, or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them, as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the BSP Monetary Board is a quasi-judicial agency exercising quasi-judicial powers or functions. As aptly observed by the Court of Appeals, the BSP Monetary Board is an independent central monetary authority and a body corporate with fiscal and administrative autonomy, mandated to provide policy directions in the areas of money, banking and credit. It has power to issue subpoena, to sue for contempt those refusing to obey the subpoena without justifiable reason, to administer oaths and compel presentation of books, records and others, needed in its examination, to impose fines and other sanctions and to issue cease and desist order. Section 37 of Republic Act No. 7653, in particular, explicitly provides that the BSP Monetary Board shall exercise its discretion in determining whether administrative sanctions should be imposed on banks and quasi-banks, which necessarily implies that the BSP Monetary Board must conduct some form of investigation or hearing regarding the same. [citations omitted]</blockquote><br>The BSP is not simply a corporate entity but qualifies as an administrative agency created, pursuant to constitutional mandate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> to carry out a particular governmental function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> To be able to perform its role as central monetary authority, the Constitution granted it fiscal and administrative autonomy.

That the statute withholds this power from the BSP is only consistent with the fundamental reasons for the creation of a Philippine central bank, that is, to lay down stable monetary policy and exercise bank supervisory functions.

In the fifties, the Court taking cognizance of the move to vest jurisdiction in administrative commissions and boards the power to resolve specialized disputes xxx ruled that Congress in requiring the Industrial Court's intervention in the resolution of labor-management controversies xxx meant such jurisdiction to be exclusive, although it did not so expressly state in the law. The Court held that under the “sense-making and expeditious doctrine of primary jurisdiction ... the courts cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of <b>sound administrative discretion</b> requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the purposes of the regulatory statute administered.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>In <i>Industrial Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> the Court ruled that while an action for rescission of a contract between coal developers appears to be an action cognizable by regular courts, the trial court remains to be without jurisdiction to entertain the suit since the contract sought to be rescinded is “inextricably tied up with the right to develop coal-bearing lands and the determination of whether or not the reversion of the coal operating contract over the subject coal blocks to [the plaintiff] would be in line with the [country’s national program and objective on coal-development and] over-all coal-supply-demand balance.” It then applied the doctrine of primary jurisdiction –<br><br><blockquote>In recent years, it has been the jurisprudential trend to apply the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in many cases involving matters that demand the special competence of administrative agencies. It may occur that the Court has jurisdiction to take cognizance of a particular case, which means that the matter involved is also judicial in character.<b> However, if the case is such that its determination requires the expertise, specialized skills and knowledge of the proper administrative bodies because technical matters or intricate questions of facts are involved</b>, then relief must first be obtained in an administrative proceeding before a remedy will be supplied by the courts even though the matter is within the proper jurisdiction of a court. This is the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. It applies “where a claim is <i>originally cognizable in the courts</i>, and <b>comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body</b>[.]”<br><br>Clearly, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction finds application in this case since the question of what coal areas should be exploited and developed and which entity should be granted coal operating contracts over said areas involves a <b>technical determination</b> by the [Bureau of Energy Development] as the administrative agency in possession of the specialized expertise to act on the matter. The Trial Court does not have the competence to decide matters concerning activities relative to the exploration, exploitation, development and extraction of mineral resources like coal. These issues preclude an initial judicial determination.

Given the non-applicability of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the BSP’s own position, in light of Circular No. 769-80, deserves respect from the Court.<br><br>Ordinarily, cases involving the application of doctrine of primary jurisdiction are initiated by an action invoking the jurisdiction of a court or administrative agency to resolve the substantive legal conflict between the parties. In this sense, the present case is quite unique since the court’s jurisdiction was, <i>originally</i>, invoked<i> to compel</i> an administrative agency (the BSP) to resolve the legal conflict of ownership over the CB bills - instead of obtaining a judicial determination of the same dispute.<br><br><b><i>The remedy of interpleader</i></b><br><br>Based on the unique factual premise of the present case, the RTC acted correctly in initially assuming jurisdiction <i>over the PDB’s petition for mandamus, prohibition and injunction</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> While the RTC agreed (albeit erroneously) with the PDB’s view (that the BSP has jurisdiction), it, however, dismissed not only the BOC’s/the BSP’s counterclaims but <i>the PDB’s petition itself as</i> well, on the ground that it lacks jurisdiction.<br><br>This is plain error.<br><br>Not only the parties themselves, but more so the courts, are bound by the rule on non-waiver of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Even indulging the RTC, if it believes that jurisdiction over the BOC’s counterclaims and the BSP’s counterclaim/crossclaim for interpleader calls for the application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the allowance of the PDB’s petition even becomes imperative because courts may raise the issue of primary jurisdiction <i>sua sponte.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>Of the three possible options available to the RTC, the adoption of either of these two would lead the trial court into serious legal error: <i>first, <b>if</b></i> it granted the PDB’s petition, its decision would have to be set aside on appeal because the BSP has no jurisdiction as previously discussed; and <i>second <b>when</b></i> it dismissed the PDB’s petitions and the BOC’s counterclaims <i>on the ground that it lacks jurisdiction</i>, the trial court seriously erred because precisely, the resolution of the conflicting claims over the CB bills falls within its general jurisdiction.<br><br>Without emasculating its jurisdiction, the RTC could have properly dismissed the PDB’s petition <b><i>but </i></b>on the ground that <i>mandamus </i>does not lie against the BSP; but even this correct alternative is no longer plausible since the BSP, as a respondent below, already properly brought before the RTC the remaining conflicting claims over the subject CB bills by way of a counterclaim/crossclaim for interpleader. Section 1, Rule 62 of the Rules of Court provides when an interpleader is proper:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. When interpleader proper. – Whenever conflicting claims upon the same subject matter are or may be made against a person who claims no interest whatever in the subject matter, or an interest which in whole or in part is not disputed by the claimants, he may bring an action against the conflicting claimants to compel them to interplead and litigate their several claims among themselves.</blockquote><br>The remedy of an action of interpleader<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> is designed to protect a person against double vexation in respect of a single liability.7 It requires, as an indispensable requisite, that conflicting claims upon the same subject matter are or may be made against the stakeholder (the possessor of the subject matter) who claims no interest whatever in the subject matter or an interest which in whole or in part is not disputed by the claimants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Through this remedy, the stakeholder can join all competing claimants in a single proceeding to determine conflicting claims without exposing the stakeholder to the possibility of having to pay more than once on a single liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br><b><i>When the court orders that the claimants litigate among themselves, in reality a new action arises,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> where the claims of the interpleaders<br><br>themselves are brought to the fore, the stakeholder as plaintiff is relegated merely to the role of initiating the suit. In short, the remedy of interpleader, when proper, merely provides an avenue for the conflicting claims on the same subject matter to be threshed out in <i>an <b>action</b></i>. Section 2 of Rule 62 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. Order. – Upon the filing of the complaint, the court shall issue an order requiring the conflicting claimants to interplead with one another. If the interests of justice so require, the court may direct in such order that the subject matter be paid or delivered to the court.</blockquote><br>This is precisely what the RTC did by granting the BSP’s motion to interplead. The PDB itself “agree[d] that the various claimants should now interplead.” Thus, the PDB and the BOC subsequently entered into two separate escrow agreements, covering the CB bills, and submitted them to the RTC for approval.<br><br>In granting the BSP’s motion, the RTC acted on the correct premise that it has jurisdiction to resolve the parties’ conflicting claims over the CB bills - consistent with the rules and the parties’ conduct - and accordingly required the BOC to amend its answer and for the PDB to comment thereon. Suddenly, however, the PDB made an about-face and questioned the jurisdiction of the RTC. Swayed by the PDB’s argument, the RTC dismissed even the PDB’s petition - which means that it did not actually <i>compel </i>the BSP to resolve the BOC’s and the PDB’s claims.<br><br>Without the motion to interplead and the order granting it, the RTC could only dismiss the PDB’s petition since it is the RTC which has jurisdiction to resolve the parties’ conflicting claims – not the BSP. Given that the motion to interplead has been actually filed, the RTC could not have really granted the relief originally sought in the PDB’s petition since the RTC’s order granting the BSP’s motion to interplead - to which the PDB in fact acquiesced into - <i>effectively resulted in the dismissal of the PDB’s petition.</i> This is not altered by the fact that the PDB additionally prayed in its petition for damages, attorney’s fees and costs of suit “against the public respondents” because the grant of the order to interplead effectively sustained the propriety of the BSP’s resort to this procedural device.<br><br><b><i>Interpleader</i></b><br><br><b><i>1. as a special civil action</i></b><br><br>What is quite unique in this case is that the BSP did not initiate the interpleader suit through an original complaint but through its Answer. This circumstance becomes understandable if it is considered that insofar as the BSP is concerned, the PDB does not possess any right to have its claim recorded in the BSP’s books; consequently, the PDB cannot properly be considered even as a potential claimant to the proceeds of the CB bills upon maturity. Thus, the interpleader was only an alternative position, made only in the BSP’s Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br>The remedy of interpleader, as a special civil action, is primarily governed by the specific provisions in Rule 62 of the Rules of Court and secondarily by the provisions applicable to ordinary civil actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Indeed, Rule 62 does not expressly authorize the filing of a complaint-in-interpleader as part of, although separate and independent from, the answer.

Under Section 2, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court, governing <i>ordinary</i> civil actions, a party’s claim is asserted “in a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint, or complaint-in-intervention.” In an interpleader suit, however, a claim is not required to be contained in any of these pleadings but in the answer-(of the conflicting claimants)-in-interpleader.

The same order required the BOC to amend its answer and for the conflicting claimants to comment, presumably to conform to the nature of an answer-in-interpleader. Perhaps, by reason of the BOC’s denomination of its claim as a “compulsory-counterclaim” and the PDB’s failure to fully appreciate the RTC’s order granting the “BSP’s motion for interpleader” (with the PDB’s conformity), the PDB mistakenly treated the BOC’s claim as a “permissive counterclaim” which necessitates the payment of docket fees.<br><br>As the preceding discussions would show, however, the BOC’s “claim” - <i>i.e</i>., its assertion of ownership over the CB bills – is in reality just that, a “claim” <u>against the stakeholder</u> and not as a “counterclaim,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> whether compulsory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> or permissive. It is only the BOC’s alternative prayer (for the PDB to deliver to the BOC, as the buyer in the April 15 transaction and the ultimate successor-in-interest of the buyer in the April 19 transaction, either the original subjects of the sales or the value thereof plus whatever income that may have been earned <i>pendente lite</i>) and its prayer for damages that are obviously compulsory counterclaims against the PDB and, therefore, does not require payment of docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>The PDB takes a contrary position through its insistence that a compulsory counterclaim should be one where the presence of third parties, of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction, is not required. It reasons out that since the RCBC and All Asia (the intervening holders of the CB bills) have already been dropped from the case, then the BOC’s counterclaim must only be permissive in nature and the BOC should have paid the correct docket fees.<br><br>We see no reason to belabor this claim. Even if we gloss over the PDB’s <i>own</i> conformity to the dropping of these entities as parties, the BOC correctly argues that a remedy is provided under the Rules. Section 12, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 12. Bringing new parties. – When the presence of parties other than those to the original action is required for the granting of complete relief in the determination of a counterclaim or cross-claim, the court shall order them to be brought in as defendants, if jurisdiction over them can be obtained.</blockquote><br>Even then, the strict characterization of the BOC’s counterclaim is no longer material in disposing of the PDB’s argument based on non-payment of docket fees.<br><br>When an action is filed in court, the complaint must be accompanied by the payment of the requisite docket and filing fees by the party seeking affirmative relief from the court.

The seminal case of <i>Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v.

The court may also allow payment of said fee within a reasonable time but also in no case beyond its applicable prescriptive or reglementary period. [underscoring ours]</blockquote><br>This must be the rule considering that Section 7, Rule 62 of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 7. Docket and other lawful fees, costs and litigation expenses as liens. – The docket and other lawful fees paid by the party who filed a complaint under this Rule, as well as the costs and litigation expenses, shall constitute a lien or charge upon the subject matter of the action, unless the court shall order otherwise.</blockquote><br><i>only</i> pertain to the docket and lawful fees to be paid by the one who initiated the interpleader suit, and who, under the Rules, actually “claims no interest whatever in the subject matter.” By constituting a lien on the subject matter of the action, Section 7 in effect only aims to actually compensate the complainant-in-interpleader, who happens to be the stakeholder unfortunate enough to get caught in a legal crossfire between two or more conflicting claimants, for the faultless trouble it found itself into. Since the defendants-in-interpleader are actually the ones who make a claim - only that it was extraordinarily done through the procedural device of interpleader - then to them devolves the duty to pay the docket fees prescribed under Rule 141 of the Rules of Court, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br>The importance of paying the correct amount of docket fee cannot be overemphasized:<br><br><blockquote>The matter of payment of docket fees is not a mere triviality.

The device was developed on the theory that the stakeholder should not be forced to take the personal risk of evaluating the claims (44B Am Jur 2d Interpleader § 1). If the BSP indeed has jurisdiction over the parties’ conflicting claims, the remedy of interpleader would obviously be inappropriate since the exercise of a quasi-judicial discretion cannot generally, entail any personal risk to the official who exercises it. Having found that the BSP lacks jurisdiction to resolve the parties’ conflicting claims, payment to anyone of the conflicting claimants would necessarily result in exposing the BSP to “double vexation in respect of a single liability.”<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> <i>Alvarez v.
