CV No. 49978.<br><br>The Bishop of the Missionary District of the Philippine Islands of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, otherwise known as the Philippine Episcopal Church (PEC), is a religious corporation duly organized and registered under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, performing mission work in over 500 communities throughout the country.&nbsp; The PEC was previously comprised of five dioceses, namely: Episcopal Diocese of Northern Philippines (EDNP), Episcopal Diocese of Northern Luzon, Episcopal Diocese of North Central Philippines, Episcopal Diocese of Central Philippines, and Episcopal Diocese of Southern Philippines.&nbsp; PEC-EDNP, which has canonical jurisdiction over the provinces of Mountain Province, Ifugao, Isabela, Quirino, Aurora, and Quezon, exercises missionary, pastoral, and administrative oversight of St. Mary the Virgin Parish in the municipality of Sagada, Mountain Province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On February 18, 1992, PEC-EDNP filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bontoc, Mountain Province, Branch 36, a Complaint for Accion Reinvindicatoria and Accion Publiciana against Ambrosio Decaleng and Fabian Lopez (Lopez), docketed as Civil Case No. 797.<br><br>PEC-EDNP alleged that it is the owner of two parcels of land in the Municipality of Sagada, located in areas commonly known as Ken-geka and Ken-gedeng.<br><br>According to PEC-EDNP, the Ken-geka property is covered by Certificate of Title No. 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the Register of Deeds of Mountain Province, issued on February 18, 1915, in the name of The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States (U.S. Episcopal Church).&nbsp; According to Certificate of Title No. 1, the U.S. Episcopal Church acquired the Ken-geka property by virtue of a sales patent issued by the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands also on February 18, 1915, in accordance with Section 122 of Act No. 496,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; otherwise known as the Land Registration Act.&nbsp; The Ken-geka property has an area of 34 hectares, 24 ares, and 60 centares, with the following technical description:<br><br><blockquote>Beginning at point marked 1 on plan Pi-115, N. 68o 48’W.&nbsp; 339.1 m. from Pulpit, a Mon. 7 cm. marked B.

PEC-EDNP and its predecessors-in-interest have introduced valuable improvements on the Ken-gedeng property through the years.&nbsp; The Ken-gedeng property was surveyed on August 22, 1947 and said survey was approved by the Director of Lands on June 15, 1948.&nbsp; During the first quarter of 1987, Ambrosio Decaleng illegally and forcibly entered two portions of the Ken-gedeng property, one measuring 1,650 square meters (Portion 1) and the other 419.50 square meters (Portion 2).&nbsp; Ambrosio Decaleng, despite the vehement objections and conciliatory attitude of PEC-EDNP, cut several matured pine trees within the aforementioned portions of the Ken-gedeng property, removed the fence and two monuments found therein, and cultivated and planted the same with plants of economic value.&nbsp; Ambrosio Decaleng made matters worse by selling Portion 2 of the Ken-gedeng property to Fabian Lopez.&nbsp; Lopez went ahead and purchased Portion 2 despite the warning of PEC-EDNP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>PEC-EDNP contended that Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez refused to vacate the portions of Ken-geka and Ken-gedeng properties that they are occupying.&nbsp; Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez claimed to be the owners of said portions, but PEC-EDNP maintained that such claim is illegal and baseless in fact and in law.&nbsp; PEC-EDNP likewise challenged the sale of Portion 2 of Ken-gedeng by Ambrosio Decaleng to Lopez for being unlawful and void.<br><br>PEC-EDNP thus prayed of the RTC to render judgment:<br><br><blockquote>A) To declare the [PEC-EDNP] as the true and real owner of the aforesaid properties and for [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez] to perpetually desist from claiming ownership over the respective portion being occupied by them;<br><br>B) To order [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez] to refrain from entering the property of [PEC-EDNP] subject of this case;<br><br>C) To order [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez] to vacate the premises of the subject portions of the aforedescribed land being illegally occupied by them;<br><br>D) To order [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez] to pay the [PEC-EDNP] the amount of P20,000.00 as actual damages, P15,000.00 as attorney’s fee, plus P500.00 as appearance pay of counsel every time this case is called for hearing and P10,000.00 as necessary expenses of litigation;<br><br>E) To issue a temporary restraining order directing [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez]&nbsp; to desist from continuing to expand their aforesaid illegal occupation and to unlawfully enter the property subject of this case and thereafter to make it permanent; and<br><br>F) To sentence [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez] to pay the cost of the suit;<br><br>G) Finally [PEC-EDNP] prays for such other measures of reliefs and remedies just and equitable in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Before Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez could file their answer to the complaint of&nbsp; PEC-EDNP, the&nbsp; RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 20, 1992, suspending&nbsp; further&nbsp; proceedings in Civil Case No. 797 until the parties have conducted a relocation survey of the properties in question, as agreed upon in open court.&nbsp; The RTC issued another Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of even date requesting the Community&nbsp; Environment and Natural Resources Office-Department of Environment and Natural Resources (CENRO-DENR), Sabangan, Mountain Province, to provide said trial court with a Geodetic Engineer to help in the re-survey of the area subject of the case.<br><br>Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez filed their Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on April 27, 1992.&nbsp; They stated in their Answer that Certificate of Title No. 1 was inaccurate and depicted a parcel of land much bigger than that generally believed to be owned by PEC-EDNP; that the properties occupied by Ambrosio Decaleng were outside the properties of PEC-EDNP; that Ambrosio Decaleng received the property in Ken-geka, and his wife, Julia Wanay Decaleng, received the property in Ken-gedeng, from their parents as their inheritance on the occasion of their marriage in accordance with the local custom of ay-yeng or liw-liwa; that Ambrosio Decaleng and Julia Wanay Decaleng (spouses Decaleng) and their predecessors-in-interest had been in possession of the subject properties continuously, actually, notoriously, publicly, adversely, and in the concept of an owner, since time immemorial, or at least, certainly for more than 50 years; that the spouses Decaleng had been in peaceful and undisturbed possession of the subject properties until PEC-EDNP surreptitiously moved the existing perimeter fence and encroached upon 240 square meters of their properties; and that Lopez was a mere tenant of the spouses Decaleng who worked on Portion 2 of the Ken-gedeng property.&nbsp; Consequently, Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez sought the dismissal of the complaint of PEC-EDNP and the payment by PEC-EDNP in their favor of P50,000.00 as reimbursement of litigation expenses and attorney’s fees, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>The relocation survey ordered by the RTC was conducted on September 17, 1992.<br><br>On February 12, 1993, PEC-EDNP filed a Motion to Admit Amended Complaint alleging:<br><br><blockquote>1. That when defendant Ambrosio Decaleng filed his answer, he alleged that subject portions of the properties are owned by his wife, Julia “Wanay” Decaleng;<br><br>2. That after the verification survey was conducted on September 17, 1992, it came to the knowledge of [PEC-EDNP] that other parties are making adverse claim of ownership over subject properties; as in fact, some of them requested the surveyor hired by [Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez] to survey portions of the properties owned by [PEC-EDNP] which they respectively claim to be owned by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The RTC admitted the amended complaint of PEC-EDNP in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated February 16, 1993.&nbsp; As a result, Julia Wanay Decaleng, Florentina Madadsec (Madadsec), Dominga D. Maguen (Maguen), and Patrick Bawing (Bawing) were impleaded as additional defendants and summoned to answer the amended complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The spouses Decaleng and Lopez jointly filed their Answer to Amended Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on March 1, 1993, essentially reiterating the allegations in the earlier Answer filed by Ambrosio Decaleng and Lopez, but increasing their claim for reimbursement of litigation expenses to P85,000.00.&nbsp; Maguen filed her Answer to Summons/Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on March 2, 1993, in which she wrote that she was not interested to appear before the RTC for her deceased father, Kapis, from whom she inherited one of the lots that bound the PEC-EDNP property; and that PEC-EDNP should have pursued its complaint a long time ago when the concerned “boundary owners” were still alive.&nbsp; Madadsec and Bawing did not submit any answer but the RTC, in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated April 27, 1993, denied the Motion to Declare Defendants in Default<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; filed by PEC-EDNP and ruled that the Answer to Amended Complaint of spouses Decaleng and Lopez shall be deemed to also be the answer of Madadsec and Bawing.<br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> on January 20, 1995 finding that:<br><br><blockquote>The documentary and testimonial evidence as a whole, adduced by the [PEC-EDNP] on whose side the onus probandi lies, do not adequately and reliably support by greater weight of credibility, the [proponent’s] causes of action, vis-à-vis, the counter-vailing proof proffered by the defensive party (Article 434, New Civil Code; Rule 131, Sec. 1 and Rule 133, Sec. 1, Revised Rules on Evidence).<br><br>De consequente, the plaintiff Church is determined not the owner of those three (3) parcels of land situated at Sitio Ken-geka and Sitio Ken-gedeng, Sagada, Mt. Province identified as the bone of contention in this suit.&nbsp; And that said Church has no right of possession of the subject parcels better than that of the defendants who are the present de facto possessors (Art. 433 and Art. 541, NCC).&nbsp;&nbsp; Corollarily, the former can neither recover ownership, which said right it never had from the very beginning, of the lots in question from the latter; nor possessions thereof, by the same token, either as an element of, or independent of ownership (Art. 428, Par. 2, NCC; Tuazon v. Jaime, CA-GR 26538-R, Feb.16, 1963; Lopez v. Franco, 26-786-R, May 27, 1961).<br><br>Re that 1,635 square meters lot at Ken-geka (Exhs. “C-1” and “C-2”), the mere supposed xerox copy of a reputed OCT No. 1 purportedly including the portion within its borders, allegedly registered in the name of the plaintiff Church (Exh. “A”), does not reasonably confirm the fact of its absolute ownership of the said portion (Reyes vs Borbon, 50 Phil. 79).&nbsp; Neither does the purported xerox copy of a putative deed of donation (Exh. “B”), sans the original, substantially show that said plaintiff acquired dominion over that particular parcel in issue via gratuitous grant as a mode of acquiring ownership (Art. 712, Par. 2, NCC; Paras, Civil Code, Vol. II, 1981 Ed., (b) p. 92).&nbsp; By itself, the plaintiff’s survey plans of the premises coupled with its unpaid tax declarations (Exhs. “BB”, “CC”, “E”, “F” and “G”) is insufficient and inc[onc]lusive to prove ownership ad/or possession of the proponent of the subject area (Acuña vs City of Manila, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Phil. 225; Dadivas vs Bunayon, 54 Phil. 632).&nbsp; While it appears that the Church is the possessor for almost a century of the greater part of that tract of land embraced in its survey plan of P1-115 (Exh. “C”), it cannot be deemed to be in constructive possession of that portion now in question, considering that said plaintiff never materially occupied or exercised control over the same and that it has been in the adverse possession of the Decalengs for quite sometime (Art. 531, NCC; Rosales vs Director of Lands, 51 Phil 502).&nbsp; In effect, dominion over the portion have not passed to the plaintiff by operation of law by virtue of long and actual possession as a title or a mode of acquiring ownership (Art. 712, Par. 2, NCC; Nolan v. Jalandoni, 23 Phil. 299).<br><br>Anent those two (2) separate parcels at Ken-gedeng (Exhs. “D-2”, “D-3”, “D-4”, “D-5”), the survey plans and tax declarations in the name of the plaintiff and predecessors in interest (Exhs. “X”, “DD”, “G”, “H”, “I”) do not by themselves confer dominion of the proponent over the afore-mentioned parcels, albeit the same are included within the coverage of the documents.&nbsp; To be sure, the Church is the exclusive and continuous possessor, probably since 1902, of the south-eastern portion of the surveyed area where its building are erected and the surroundings thereof improved (Exhs. “X”, “X-1” to “X-6”).&nbsp; This fact in conjunction with its said survey plans and tax declarations may prove ownership of the plaintiff of the premises mentioned (Alamo vs Ignacio, L-16434, Feb. 28, 1962).&nbsp; It cannot however be presumed, much less adjudged that the Church has constructive possession of the subject two separate parcels absent any showing that it materially occupied, and exercised control over said parcels at any given time in the same manner as it developed the rest of the portions within the plans and tax declarations.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that the former lots have been all along in the adverse possession of the defendants.&nbsp; Hence, by law, the plaintiff Church did not acquire ownership and/or possession of those disputed lots at Ken-gedeng.<br><br>Penultimately, the counterclaim for damages interposed by the defensive party is denied for lack of merit and on the principle that no penalty should be attached on the right to litigate (Art. 2217, NCC; Ramos vs. Ramos, 61 SCRA 284)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The<i> fallo </i>of the RTC Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in accordance with the prayer of the defendants, viz:<br><br>I. Dismissing the instant suit;<br><br>II. Ordering the plaintiff to pay attorney’s fees and litigation expense in the reasonable sum of P120,000.00; and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The PEC-ENDP filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the aforementioned Decision on February 21, 1995 but the RTC denied said motion in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated May 11, 1995.<br><br>PEC-EDNP filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals which was docketed as CA-G.R.

This rule, however, admits of exceptions as recognized by jurisprudence, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>(1) [W]hen the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner’s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>The case at bar falls under one of the exceptions, as the factual conclusions of the RTC and the Court of Appeals are in conflict with each other.&nbsp;

The Ken-geka property was registered in the name of the U.S. Episcopal Church under Certificate of Title No. 1 issued on February 18, 1915.&nbsp; It was conveyed by the U.S. Episcopal Church to PEC through a Deed of Donation dated April 24, 1974.&nbsp;

approved plat of sales survey; and the approved survey plan and owner’s copies of Tax Declaration Nos. 6307, 14326, A-11179, 14325 and 6306.&nbsp; In contrast, the defendants mainly relied on the supposed non-existence of OCT No. 1 that rested solely on the certification of Atty. Dulay-Papa of the Registry of Deeds-Mountain Province.<br><br>We consider the testimonial and documentary evidence of the plaintiff sufficient, clear and competent in establishing its absolute ownership and actual possession of the disputed areas which were within its properties.&nbsp; The survey plans, prepared upon the request of the plaintiff, were approved by the Director of Lands, which, standing alone, might not be conclusive proofs of ownership, but were already proof that the plaintiff had taken steps to assert and protect its ownership and possession of the premises.&nbsp; Being public documents, such survey plans were entitled to great weight and credence as “evidence of the facts which gave rise to their execution.”&nbsp; Moreover, the plaintiff’s tax declarations, although not proof of ownership, were strong evidence of ownership for being coupled with possession for a period sufficient for prescription.&nbsp; In sum, the plaintiff’s documentary evidence was overwhelming.<br><br>The plaintiff’s testimonial evidence was equally formidable, because it was provided by witnesses who were very knowledgeable and reliable.&nbsp; Fr. Arthur Bosaing had resided in the property for almost 26 years, such that his testimony that the disputed parcels were inside the mission lot where a building and other improvements of the plaintiff were found might not be disputed.&nbsp; Retired Bishop Robert Lee O. Longid attested that he and his father had lived from 1928 to 1931 in a building called the Fox House, which was located near the portion being claimed by the Decalengs.&nbsp; Even defendant Julia Decaleng admitted on cross-examination that there was a building owned by the plaintiff in one of the disputed lots.&nbsp; She was referring to the plaintiff’s building known as Doctor’s Quarters which was then occupied by Fr. Bosaing.<br><br>It is apt to observe that actual possession of an owner did not need to be the actual and physical possession and occupation of every inch or portion of the property.&nbsp; That is an impossibility.&nbsp; Constructive possession is sufficient, for, according to <i>Ramos v. Director of Lands</i>: “The claimant has color of title; he acted in good faith; and he has had open, peaceable, and notorious possession of a portion of the property, sufficient to apprise the community and the world that the land was for his enjoyment.&nbsp; (See Arts. 446, 448, Civil Code.)&nbsp; Possession in the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to have his feet on every square meter of ground before it can be said that he is in possession. x x x”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>The spouses Decaleng attempt to raise doubts as to the title of PEC-EDNP over the Ken-geka property by insisting that (1) PEC-EDNP failed to present the original copies of Certificate of Title No. 1 and the Deed of Donation dated April 24, 1974 during the trial before the RTC; and (2) Certificate of Title No. 1 does not exist based on the Certification dated July 20, 1992 of Register of Deeds Angela Dailay-Papa (Dailay-Papa) of the Mountain Province.<br><br>It is worthy to point out that PEC-EDNP presented and marked the photocopies of Certificate of Title No. 1 and the Deed of Donation dated April 24, 1974 in the course of the testimony of Rev. Henry Hakcholna on June 10, 1993 before the RTC.&nbsp; Even though the defense counsel stated for the record the defense’s position that Certificate of Title No. 1 is non-existent, he did not make any objection to the presentation and marking of the photocopies of Certificate of Title No. 1 and the Deed of Donation dated April 24, 1974 by PEC-EDNP, and even admitted that said photocopies appear to be faithful reproductions of the “purported” original documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Relevant herein is the pronouncement of the Court in <i>Caraan v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> wherein it accepted in evidence a mere photocopy of the document:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners’ asseveration that TCT No. RT-71061 (214949) should not have been admitted into evidence because private respondents merely presented the photocopy thereof is also unmeritorious.&nbsp; Private respondents presented the original of TCT No. RT-71061 (214949) in open court during the hearing held on April 13, 1994. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Furthermore, no objection was raised by counsel for petitioners in their written opposition/comment to private respondents' offer of evidence regarding the fact that what was marked and submitted to the court was the photocopy.&nbsp; In <i>Blas vs. Angeles-Hutalla,</i> the Court held thus:<br><br><blockquote>The established doctrine is that when a party failed to interpose a timely objection to evidence at the time they were offered in evidence, such objection shall be considered as waived. In <i>Tison v. Court of Appeals</i>, the Supreme Court set out the applicable principle in the following terms:<br><br><blockquote>[F]or while the documentary evidence submitted by petitioners do not strictly conform to the rules on their admissibility, we are, however, of the considered opinion that the same may be admitted by reason of private respondent's failure to interpose any timely objection thereto at the time they were being offered in evidence. It is elementary that an objection shall be made at the time when an alleged inadmissible document is offered in evidence, otherwise, the objection shall be treated as waived, since the right to object is merely a privilege which the party may waive.<br><br>As explained in <i>Abrenica vs. Gonda</i>, et al., it has been repeatedly laid down as a rule of evidence that a protest or objection against the admission of any evidence must be made at the proper time, otherwise, it will be deemed to have been waived. The proper time is when from the question addressed to the witness, or from the answer thereto, or from the presentation of the proof, the inadmissibility of the evidence is, or may be inferred.<br><br>Thus, a failure to except to the evidence because it does not conform with the statute is a waiver of the provisions of the law. . . .</blockquote></blockquote><br>Hence, considering the fact that counsel for petitioners admitted that the photocopy of TCT No. RT-71061 (214949) is a faithful reproduction of the original thereof, stipulated with private respondents' counsel that what will be marked and submitted to the trial court as Exhibit A is the photocopy, and the lack of objection on such ground which is then deemed a waiver thereof, the admission into evidence of the photocopy of TCT No. RT-71061 was absolutely correct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>Also instructive on this point is <i>Quebral v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> where the Court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>Even if it were true that Exhibit K consisted of a mere photocopy and not the original of the petitioner’s letter, petitioner nevertheless failed to make timely objection thereto. As to when an objection to a document must be made, the Court ruled in Interpacific Transit, Inc. v. Aviles [186 SCRA 385 (June 6, 1990)]:<br><br><blockquote>Objection to the documentary evidence must be made at the time it is formally offered, not earlier. The identification of the document before it is marked as an exhibit does not constitute the formal offer of the document as evidence for the party presenting it. Objection to the identification and marking of the document is not equivalent to objection to the document when it is formally offered in evidence. What really matters is the objection to the document at the time it is formally offered as an exhibit.<br></blockquote><br>In the case at bench, no such timely objection was ever made. Consequently, the evidence not objected to became property of the case, and all the parties to the case are considered amenable to any favorable or unfavorable effects resulting from the evidence. x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote><br>In any case, PEC-EDNP subsequently submitted to the RTC its original copies of Certificate of Title No. 1 and Deed of Donation dated April 24, 1974, together with its Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC Decision dated January 20, 1995.<br><br>As for the spouses Decaleng’s contention that Certificate of Title No. 1 does not exist, the Court fully agrees with the Court of Appeals that the same constitutes a collateral attack of Certificate of Title No. 1.<br><br>It is a hornbook principle that “a certificate of title serves as evidence of an indefeasible title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears therein.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; In order to establish a system of registration by which recorded title becomes absolute, indefeasible, and imprescriptible, the legislature passed Act No. 496, which took effect on February 1, 1903.&nbsp; Act No. 496 placed all registered lands in the Philippines under the Torrens system.&nbsp; The Torrens system requires the government to issue a certificate of title stating that the person named in the title is the owner of the property described therein, subject to liens and encumbrances annotated on the title or reserved by law.&nbsp; The certificate of title is indefeasible and imprescriptible and all claims to the parcel of land are quieted upon issuance of the certificate.&nbsp; Presidential Decree No. 1529, known as the Property Registration Decree, enacted on June 11, 1978, amended and updated Act No. 496.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 48.<i> Certificate not subject to collateral attack</i>. – A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack.

Insular Government,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the United States Supreme Court granted an Igorot’s application for registration of a piece of land in Benguet based on the latter’s possession of the land from time immemorial, ratiocinating thus:<br><br><blockquote>It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have been public land.&nbsp; Certainly in a case like this, if there is doubt or ambiguity in the Spanish law, we ought to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; x x x.<br><br>If the applicant’s case is to be tried by the law of Spain, we do not discover such clear proof that it was bad by that law as to satisfy us that he does not own the land.&nbsp; To begin with, the older decrees and laws cited by the counsel for the plaintiff in error seem to indicate pretty clearly that the natives were recognized as owning some lands, irrespective of any royal grant.&nbsp; In other words, Spain did not assume to convert all the native inhabitants of the Philippines into trespassers or even into tenants at will.&nbsp; For instance, Book 4, title 12, Law 14 of the Recopilación de Leyes de las Indias, cited for a contrary conclusion in Valenton vs. Murciano, 3 Philippine, 537, while it commands viceroys and others, when it seems proper, to call for the exhibition of grants, directs them to confirm those who hold by good grants or justa prescripción.&nbsp; It is true that it begins by the characteristic assertion of feudal overlordship and the origin of all titles in the King or his predecessors.&nbsp; That was theory and discourse.&nbsp; The fact was that titles were admitted to exist that owed nothing to the powers of Spain beyond this recognition in their books.<br><br>Prescription is mentioned again in the royal cedula of October 15, 1754, cited in 3 Philippine, 546; “Where such possessors shall not be able to produce title deeds, it shall be sufficient if they shall show that ancient possession, as a valid title by prescription.”&nbsp; It may be that this means possession from before 1700; but at all events, the principle is admitted.&nbsp; As prescription, even against Crown lands, was recognized by the laws of Spain we see no sufficient reason for hesitating to admit that it was recognized in the Philippines in regard to lands over which Spain had only a paper sovereignty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>From the testimonies of the spouses Decaleng and their witnesses, the Court can glean actual possession of the properties in Ken-geka and Ken-gedeng by the spouses Decaleng and their predecessors-in-interest only as far back as the 1920s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; This hardly constitutes possession since time immemorial judging by the standard set by the Court in <i>Oh Cho v.
