That all accruals of interest as provided for in paragraph 2-c of the Deed of Sale With Mortgage will be deferred and the subsequent payments of installments will correspondingly [sic] extended to the date the occupants/squatters will vacate the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The succeeding paragraph 4 provided that in the event the informal settlers do not leave the property, PLU would reimburse ALS the following amounts:<br><br><blockquote>4. That in the event the occupants/squatters will refuse to vacate the premises despite the amicable payments being offered by the FIRST PARTY (PLU) and paid by the SECOND PARTY (ALS) for the account of the FIRST PARTY, the following amount [sic] will be refunded by the FIRST PARTY to the SECOND PARTY:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>All payments made, including the downpayment<br></li><li>All costs of temporary/permanent improvements introduced by the SECOND PARTY in the subject property<br></li><li>All damages suffered by the SECOND PARTY due to the refusal of the occupants/squatters to vacate the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br>On January 26, 1981, TCT No. 16721 was canceled and a new one, TCT No. 26048, issued in the name of ALS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the parties executed a Partial Release of Mortgage dated April 3, 1981<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> attesting to the payment by ALS of the first installment indicated in the underlying deed. The relevant portion of the Partial Release of Mortgage reads:<br><br><blockquote>1. Upon the execution of this document, the SECOND PARTY shall pay the net sum of THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P395,000.00) after deducting expenses, covered by UCPB Check No. 078993 dated April 2, 1981 to complete the full payment of the first 24% installment.<br><br>2.

The case was initially raffled to the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal, but eventually re-raffled to the Regional Trial Court, Branch 137 in Makati City (Makati RTC) thereat docketed as Civil Case No. 47438 entitled <i>PLU Realty Corporation v. ALS </i>(or ASL) Management and Development Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; In the complaint, PLU alleged having had entered into an oral agreement with ALS whereby the latter “[agreed to] take over the task of ejecting the squatters/occupants from the property covered by TCT No. 26048 issued in its name,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> adding that, through the efforts of ALS, the property was already 90% clear of informal settlers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Notably, PLU’s prayer for relief states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, plaintiff respectfully prays that judgment be rendered:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaring null and void the documents attached to, and made an integral part of this complaint as Annexes “D” and “G”;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentencing the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of Six Million Two Hundred Six Thousand Six hundred Ninety-Five Pesos &amp; 60/100 (P6,206,695.80), with interest thereon as provided in sub-paragraph (c), paragraph 2 of the Deed of Sale with Mortgage and paragraph 6 of the same Deed, plus interests at the legal rate from the date of filing of this complaint;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentencing the defendant to pay the plaintiff the actual damages and attorney’s fees it has suffered, as above alleged, in the total sum of Four Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P450,000.00);<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing that, in the event defendant refuses or fails to pay all the above-mentioned amounts after the decision of this Hon. Court has become final and executory, the corresponding order is issued for the sale, in the corresponding Foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property described in the Deed of Sale with Mortgage, to satisfy the judgment rendered by this Hon. Court, plus costs of suit.</blockquote>Plaintiff prays for such further reliefs as this Hon. Court may deem just and proper in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>On May 9, 1986, the Makati RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> ruling that the obligation of PLU to clear the property of informal settlers was superseded by an oral agreement between the parties whereby ALS assumed the responsibility of ejecting said informal settlers. The Makati RTC, however, declared that the removal of the informal settlers on the property is still a subsisting and valid condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In this regard, the trial court, citing a CA case entitled <i>Jacinto v. Chua Leng</i> (45 O.G. 2915), ruled:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, the fulfillment of the conditional obligation to pay the subsequent installments does not depend upon the sole will or exclusive will of the defendant-buyer. In the first place, although the defendant-buyer has shown an apparent lack of interest in compelling the squatters to vacate the premises, as it agreed to do, there is nothing either in the contract or in law that would bar the plaintiff-seller from taking the necessary action to eject the squatters and thus compel the defendant-buyer to pay the balance of the purchase price. In the second place, should the squatters vacate the premises, for reasons of convenience or otherwise, and despite defendant’s lack of diligence, the latter’s obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price would arise unavoidably and inevitably. x x x Moreover, considering that the squatters’ right of possession to the premises is involved in Civil Case No. 40078 of this Court, defendant’s obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price would necessarily be dependent upon a final judgment of the Court ordering the squatters to vacate the premises.</blockquote><br>The trial court further ruled that because informal settlers still occupied 28% of the property, the condition, as to their eviction, had not yet been complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> For this reason, the Makati RTC found the obligation of ALS to pay the balance of the purchase price has not yet fallen due and demandable; thus, it dismissed the case for being premature. The dispositive portion of the Makati RTC Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the instant action for foreclosure of mortgage, as the same is premature. Likewise the counterclaim is hereby ordered dismissed, for lack of sufficient merit. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Therefrom, both parties appealed to the CA which eventually affirmed the ruling of the trial court in a Decision dated August 30, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in CA-G.R. CV No. 12663 entitled <i>PLU Realty Corporation v. ALS (or ASL) Management and Development Corporation</i>. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED i<span style="font-style: italic;">n toto.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote><br>ALS appealed the case to this Court primarily questioning the finding of the Makati RTC that it had assumed the responsibility of ejecting the informal settlers on the property. On February 7, 1990, in G.R. No. 91656, entitled <i>ALS Management and Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals and PLU Realty,</i> the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> affirming the rulings of the CA and the Makati RTC. The resolution became final and executory on February 7, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Sometime thereafter, PLU again filed a Complaint dated November 12, 1990<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> against ALS for Judicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage under Rule 68, before the RTC, Branch 156 in Pasig City (Pasig RTC), docketed as Civil Case No. 60221 and entitled<i> P. L. Uy Realty Corporation v. ASL Management and Development Corporation and Antonio S. Litonjua.</i> In the complaint, PLU claimed that ALS had not yet completed the agreed 1st payment obligation despite numerous demands. The complaint’s prayer reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that after hearing judgment be rendered directing the defendants to pay within ninety (90) days from receipt of an order the following amount:<br><ol><li>The outstanding balance of the purchase price amounting to P6,206,695.80 plus 12% interest per annum from January, 1981 until full payment thereof has been made;<br></li><li>The sum equivalent to 10% of the total outstanding obligations as and for attorney’s fee;<br></li><li>The sum of P100,000.00 as and for moral damages; and,<br></li><li>The sum of P50,000.00 as and for exemplary damages, plus costs;<br></li></ol>and in case of default to order the sale of the properties to satisfy the aforestated obligations pursuant to the provisions of Rule 68 of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>Plaintiff also prays for such other just and equitable reliefs in the premises.</blockquote><br>In defense, ALS claims that the installment payments for the balance of the purchase price of the property are not yet due and demandable, as the removal of the informal settlers, a condition precedent for such payments to be demandable, is still to be completed. ALS further avers that respondent Antonio Litonjua (Litonjua) cannot be made personally liable under the Deed of Absolute Sale with Mortgage, not being a party thereto and as no ground exists for piercing the veil of corporate fiction to make Litonjua, a corporate officer of ALS, liable. By way of counterclaim, ALS alleged that because there were still informal settlers on the property, PLU should be directed to reimburse ALS the payments that it already made, the cost of improvements introduced by ALS on the property and for other damages.<br><br>During the course of the trial, the court conducted an ocular inspection and found 1 ½ hectares of the 5.4 hectare property still being occupied by informal settlers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In a Decision dated November 17, 1993, the Pasig RTC dismissed the case for being premature, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the present Complaint is hereby ordered DISMISSED for being premature.<br><br>On the counterclaim, the plaintiff is hereby ordered to reimburse the defendant-corporation the amount of P131,331.20 representing the real estate taxes paid by the latter with 12% interest thereon from the time of their actual payments to the Government until the same are fully reimbursed.<br><br>The other counterclaims are hereby ordered DISMISSED for want of sufficient merits.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Just like the Makati RTC in Civil Case No. 47438, the Pasig RTC found that the payment of the installments has not yet become due and demandable as the suspensive condition, the ejection of the informal settlers on the property, has not yet occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Further, even if ALS has taken up the obligation to eject the informal settlers, its inaction cannot be deemed as constructive fulfillment of the suspensive condition. The court reasoned that it is only when the debtor prevents the fulfillment of the condition that constructive fulfillment can be concluded, citing Article 1186 of the Civil Code. And inasmuch as PLU has failed to demand the removal of the informal settlers from the property, so the court noted citing Art. 1169 of the Civil Code, ALS cannot be deemed as in default vis-à-vis its obligation to remove the informal settlers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Furthermore, the trial court, citing Art. 1167 of the Civil Code, ruled that the foreclosure of the mortgage is not the proper remedy, and that PLU should have caused the ejectment of the informal settlers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Also, the court found no reason to render Litonjua personally liable for the transaction of ALS as there was no ground to pierce the veil of corporate fiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>From such Decision, PLU appealed to the CA which rendered the assailed Decision affirming that of the Pasig RTC. PLU moved for a reconsideration of the CA Decision but was denied in the assailed Resolution.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>The instant petition must be dismissed.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Defenses and objections not pleaded. </i>— Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived. However, when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, <b>or that the action is barred by a prior judgment</b> or by statute of limitations, <b>the court shall dismiss the claim</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Under this provision of law, the Court may<i> motu proprio </i>dismiss a case when any of the four (4) grounds referred to therein is present. These are: (a) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter; (b) <i>litis pendentia</i>; (c) <i>res judicata</i>; and (d) prescription of action. Thus, in <i>Heirs of Domingo Valientes v. Ramas,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Secondly, and more importantly, Section 1, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Defenses and objections not pleaded</i>. – Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived. However, when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, that there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause, or that the action is barred by a prior judgment or by statute of limitations, the court shall dismiss the claim.</blockquote>The second sentence of this provision does not only supply exceptions to the rule that defenses not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived, it also allows courts to dismiss cases motu proprio on any of the enumerated grounds – (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter; (2) litis pendentia; (3) res judicata; and (4) prescription – provided that the ground for dismissal is apparent from the pleadings or the evidence on record.</blockquote><br>Correlatively, Secs. 47(b) and (c) of Rule 39 provides for the two (2) concepts of <i>res judicata:</i> bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment, respectively. The provisions state:<br><br><blockquote>Section 47. <i>Effect of judgments or final orders. </i>— The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b)&nbsp; In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and<br><br>(c)&nbsp; In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto.</blockquote><br>The Court, in <i>Social Security Commission v. Rizal Poultry and Livestock Association, Inc.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> distinguished the two (2) concepts in this wise:<br><blockquote>Res judicata embraces two concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment as enunciated in Rule 39, Section 47(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure; and (2) conclusiveness of judgment in Rule 39, Section 47(c).<br><br>There is “bar by prior judgment” when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action.<br><br>But where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of res judicata known as “conclusiveness of judgment.” Stated differently, any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.<br><br>Thus, if a particular point or question is in issue in the second action, and the judgment will depend on the determination of that particular point or question, a former judgment between the same parties or their privies will be final and conclusive in the second if that same point or question was in issue and adjudicated in the first suit. Identity of cause of action is not required but merely identity of issue.</blockquote><br>In the same<i> Social Security Commission</i> case, the Court enumerated the elements of <i>res judicata, </i>to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The elements of res judicata are: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.<b> Should identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action be shown in the two cases, then res judicata in its aspect as a “bar by prior judgment” would apply</b>. If as between the two cases, only identity of parties can be shown, but not identical causes of action, then res judicata as “conclusiveness of judgment” applies. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>All the elements of <i>res judicata</i>, as a “bar by prior judgment,” are present in the instant case. The previous complaint for foreclosure of mortgage was dismissed by the trial court for being premature in Civil Case No. 47438. The dismissal action, when eventually elevated to this Court in G.R. No. 91656, was affirmed and the affirmatory resolution of the Court becoming final and executory on February 7, 1990. Further, the element of indentity of parties is considered existing even though Litonjua was only impleaded in Civil Case No. 60221 and not in Civil Case No. 47438. Absolute identity of parties is not required for res judicata to apply; substantial identity is sufficient. The Court articulated this principle was raised in <i>Cruz v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>The principle of res judicata may not be evaded by the mere expedient of including an additional party to the first and second action.&nbsp; Only substantial identity is necessary to warrant the application of res judicata. The addition or elimination of some parties does not alter the situation. There is substantial identity of parties when there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case albeit the latter was not impleaded in the first case.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x Such identity of interest is sufficient to make them privy-in-law, thereby satisfying the requisite of substantial identity of parties.</blockquote><br>Plainly, the two (2) cases involve the very same parties, the same property and the same cause of action arising from the violation of the terms of one and the same deed of absolute sale with mortgage. In fact, PLU prayed substantially the same relief in both complaints. There is no reason not to apply this principle to the instant controversy.<br><br>Clearly, the instant complaint must be dismissed.<br><br>On a final note, it would be relevant to note that Art. 1306 of the Civil Code guarantees the freedom of parties to stipulate the terms of their contract provided that they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy. Thus, when the provisions of a contract are valid, the parties are bound by such terms under the principle that a contract is the law between the parties.<br><br>Here, both parties knew for a fact that the property subject of their contract was occupied by informal settlers, whose eviction would entail court actions that in turn, would require some amount of time. They also knew that the length of time that would take to conclude such court actions was not within their power to determine. Despite such knowledge, both parties still agreed to the stipulation that the payment of the balance of the purchase price would be deferred until the informal settlers are ejected. There was never any allegation that PLU was coerced into signing the Deed of Sale with Mortgage or that its consent was in any way vitiated. PLU was free to accept or decline such contractual provision. Thus, PLU cannot now be allowed to renege on its agreement. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, in<i> Gregorio Araneta, Inc. v. Phil. Sugar Estate Development Co., Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> a case cast against a similar factual milieu, stated the following apt observation:<br><br><blockquote>In this connection, it is to be borne in mind that the contract shows that the parties were fully aware that the land described therein was occupied by squatters, because the fact is expressly mentioned therein (Rec. on Appeal, Petitioner’s Appendix B, pp. 12-13). As the parties must have known that they could not take the law into their own hands, but must resort to legal processes in evicting the squatters, they must have realized that the duration of the suits to be brought would not be under their control nor could the same be determined in advance.<b> The conclusion is thus forced that the parties must have intended to defer the performance of the obligations under the contract until the squatters were duly evicted, as contended by the petitioner Gregorio Araneta, Inc.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the instant petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
