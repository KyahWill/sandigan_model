Petitioner further alleged that the technical description has no legal basis per the records of the Lands Management Bureau and the Bureau of Lands. It added that Baello’s title described the property to be Lot 3-A of subdivision plan Psd 706, but an examination of Psd 706 shows that there is no Lot 3-A in plan Psd 706.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petitioner contends that in view of the foregoing reasons, Baello has no legal basis to claim the subject property, and Baello’s title, TCT No. 35788, is spurious and illegal and should be annulled.

It prayed that judgment be rendered dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action against Uniwide; declaring the contract of lease as valid and enforceable; and ordering petitioner to pay Uniwide moral and exemplary damages, among others.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent Baello filed a Motion to Dismiss9 on the grounds that the complaint stated no cause of action, and that the demand for annulment of title and/or conveyance, whether grounded upon the commission of fraud or upon a constructive trust, has prescribed, and is barred by laches.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated December 5, 1995, the trial court denied Baello’s&nbsp; motion to dismiss for lack of merit.&nbsp; Baello’s motion for reconsideration&nbsp; was likewise denied for lack of merit in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated February 27, 1996.<br><br>Subsequently, respondent Baello filed an Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> alleging that the subject property was bequeathed to her through a will by her adoptive mother, Jacoba Galauran.&nbsp; She alleged that during the lifetime of Jacoba Galauran, the subject property was originally surveyed on January 24-26, 1923<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and, thereafter, on December 29, 1924.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Baello alleged that after Jacoba Galauran died in 1952, her will was duly approved by the probate court, the Court of First Instance, Pasig, Rizal.&nbsp; Baello stated that she registered the subject property in her name, and TCT No. (35788) 12754 was issued in her favor on September 6, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1959, she had the subject property surveyed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> On July 15, 1988, she entered into a Contract of Lease<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> with respondent Uniwide, which erected in full public view the building it presently occupies.&nbsp; Baello stated that she has been religiously paying realty taxes for the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Baello alleged that during her open and public possession of the subject property spanning over 40 years, nobody came forward to contest her title thereto.&nbsp; It was only in September 1994, when Baello was absent from the Philippines that petitioner demanded rentals from Uniwide, asserting ownership over the land.<br><br>As an affirmative defense, respondent Baello contended that the Complaint should be dismissed as she enjoys a superior right over the subject property because the registration of her title predates the registration of petitioner’s title by at least 40 years.<br><br>The deposition of respondent Baello, which was taken on October 1, 1998 at the Philippine Consular Office in San Francisco, California, United States of America, affirmed the same facts stated in her Answer.<br><br>On October 2, 2000, the trial court rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in favor of petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court stated that the evidence for petitioner showed that it is the rightful owner of the subject lot covered by TCT No. 285312 of the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City.&nbsp; The lot was purchased by petitioner from Felisa D. Bonifacio, who became the owner&nbsp; thereof by virtue of her petition for segregation of the subject property from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 994 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal in LRC Case No. C-3288.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court found no reason to deviate from the ruling of Judge Geronimo Mangay in LRC Case No. C-3288, which was rendered after receiving all the evidence, including that of Engineer Elpidio de Lara, who testified under oath that his office, the Technical Services of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR),&nbsp; had not previously issued the technical description appearing on TCT No. 265777 (Felisa Bonifacio’s title), and he also&nbsp; certified to the records of the technical description of Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A of subdivision plan Psd 706 on July 9, 1990, which refers to the same technical description appearing on Felisa D. Bonifacio’s title.&nbsp; The trial court stated that it cannot question the Order in LRC Case No. C-3288 issued by a co-equal court&nbsp; in this respect, considering&nbsp; that Regional Trial Courts now have the authority to act not only on applications for original registration, but also over all petitions filed after original registration of title, with power to hear and determine all questions arising from such applications or petitions.<br><br>Moreover, the trial court stated that aside from the complete records of the land registration proceedings (LRC Case No. C-3288), petitioner presented witnesses to support its causes of action, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Norberto Vasquez, Deputy Register of Deeds of Caloocan City, testified that TCT No. 28531<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Exh. “A”) in the name of the plaintiff VSD Realty and Development Corporation originated from TCT No. 265777 (Exh. “B”) in the name of Felisa D. Bonifacio; that Felisa Bonifacio sold the property to VSD Realty and Development Corporation, and the same was registered under the name of the plaintiff; that Felisa Bonifacio came in possession of TCT No. 265777 by virtue of an Order (Exh. “C”) issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 125, Kalookan City, dated May 31, 1993; that the Registry of Deeds received the Order of the RTC Branch 125 and by virtue of said Order with finality, their office issued TCT No. 265777 in the name of Felisa D. Bonifacio; that their office only issue[s] titles if there is a court Order. He related the [derivative] documents that were filed before their office such as the Court Order dated October 8, 1992, in L.R.C. Case No. 3288; the Certificate of finality to said Order dated April 6, 1999 and the subdivision plan to Lot No. 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A.<br><br>Evelyn Celzo, a Geodetic Engineer, DENR, NCR, testified that she was the one who conducted the survey of the property of Felisa D. Bonifacio covered by TCT No. 265777; that she prepared a Verification Plan (Exh. “D”) duly approved by the DENR, NCR, Director; that before the survey was conducted, she notified the adjoining owners that a survey will be conducted on the property of&nbsp; Felisa Bonifacio; that she was a witness in that case filed by Felisa Bonifacio vs. Syjuco before RTC Br. 125, Kalookan City. She attested to the verification survey she conducted of the subject lot as directed by her office. She confirmed that the technical description approved and recorded in their office is Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A of Psd 706. The DENR, NCR keeps a record of all technical descriptions approved and authorized by it under the Torrens system.&nbsp; She pointed out that only one (1) technical description is allowed for one particular lot. The subject technical description was submitted as Exhibit “F” for the plaintiff.<br><br>On January 27, 1997, witness Evelyn Celzo was subjected for cross-examination.<br><br>Witness testified that a request for verification survey was made by Felisa D. Bonifacio addressed to the Chief, Survey Division of the DENR, NCR; that a survey order was given to their office by the Regional Technical Director, Lands Management Service on August 22, 1994; that they conducted the verification survey at the actual site of the property of Felisa D. Bonifacio; that they checked all the boundaries of the property where they conducted the verification survey; that they likewise conducted actual visual inspection on the monuments; that the whole area covered by TCT No. 265777 is occupied by Uniwide Sales, Inc.; that she went to the office of the Registry of Deeds and inquired as to the address of the owner of Uniwide Sales, Inc.,&nbsp; but she was told by the people there that they do not know; that when she conducted the survey, she tried to inform the owner of the adjoining buildings, but nobody answered; that only one became the subject of the verification survey and this is the lot covered by TCT No. 265777 in the name of Felisa Bonifacio.<br><br>Soccoro Andrade, in-charge of the records of Civil/LRC cases in Branch 125 of the Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City, appeared bringing with her the records. She identified the pages of L.R.C. Case No. 3288, submitted as Exhibit “G” in this case.<br><br>Atty. Kaulayao V. Faylona, Director and Corporate Secretary of VSD Realty and Development Corporation testified on the details that led to the purchase of subject property. He verified the records of L.R.C. Case No. C-3288, as well as the transcripts and exhibits submitted in the case. He checked with the Registry of Deeds and was satisfied that the title was clean.&nbsp; Uniwide Sales, Inc., through its counsel Fortun and Narvasa, stated that it was not the owner of the subject property. It was a mere lessee, but during their talks on possible amicable settlement, Uniwide had to reveal the identity and address of the owner. This matter was clearly stated in the letter of Fortun and Narvasa dated May 18, 1995.&nbsp; As suggested by defendant Uniwide, the instant case was filed on June 8, 1995, to include the alleged lessor of the land, Dolores Baello, care of ACCRA Law Office. He likewise testified on the damages suffered by VSD.&nbsp; Witness testified that plaintiff VSD Realty and Development Corporation filed the instant case against the defendants because plaintiff is the owner of the lot wherein Uniwide Sales is located x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>Further, the trial court found that the technical description in respondent Baello’s title is not the same as the technical description in petitioner’s title. A mere reading of the technical description in petitioner’s title and that in Baello’s title would show that they are not one and the same.<br><br>The trial court averred that the technical description of the subject lot in petitioner’s title is recorded with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It stated that Baello’s claim to the same technical description cannot by itself alone be given weight, and the evidence offered by Baello is not enough.<br><br>The trial court held that from the evidence adduced, petitioner is the registered owner of TCT No. 275312, formerly TCT No. 265777 when Felisa D. Bonifacio was the registered owner, while respondent Baello is the registered owner of a parcel of land covered by TCT No. (35788) 12754 and respondent Uniwide is a mere lessee of the land.&nbsp; Baello is the holder of a title over a lot entirely different and not in anyway related to petitioner’s title and its technical description. Petitioner proved its ownership and the identity of the subject property.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court’s decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing consideration, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the following:<br><br><blockquote>1. Declaring TCT No. 35788 (12754) to be null and void;<br><br>2. Defendant Baello and all persons/entity claiming title under her, including UNIWIDE, to convey and to return the property to plaintiff VSD on the basis of the latter's full, complete, valid and legal ownership;<br><br>3. Defendant Baello and UNIWIDE, jointly and severally, to pay a just and reasonable compensation per month of P1,200,000.00 with legal interest for the occupancy and use of plaintiff's land from September 12, 1994, until actually vacated by them;<br><br>4. Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay attorney's fees of P200,000.00.</blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Respondents filed their respective motion for reconsideration. In its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated January 12, 2001, the trial court denied respondents’ motions for reconsideration for lack of merit, and it also denied petitioner’s motion for immediate execution.<br><br>Respondents appealed the trial court’s decision to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On May 30, 2005, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in favor of respondents and dismissed petitioner’s complaint.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that the main issue to be resolved was whether or not there is a valid ground to annul respondent Baello's TCT No. 35788 to warrant the reconveyance of the subject property to petitioner.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in declaring respondent Baello's TCT No. 35788 as null and void.&nbsp; It stated that well settled is the rule that a Torrens title is generally a conclusive evidence of ownership of the land referred to therein, and a strong presumption exists that it was regularly issued and valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, respondent Baello's TCT No. 35788 enjoys the presumption of validity.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that based on existing jurisprudence, a certificate of title may be annulled or cancelled by the court under the following grounds: (1) when the title is void because (a) it was procured through fraud, (b) it was issued for a land already covered by a prior Torrens title, (c) it covers land reserved for military, naval or civil public purposes, and (d) it covers a land which has not been brought under the registration proceeding; (2) when the title is replaced by one issued under a cadastral proceeding; and (3) when the condition for its issuance has been violated by the registered owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals averred that while petitioner sought to annul respondent Baello's TCT No. 35788 on the ground that the same was spurious, it failed to prove that Baello’s title was indeed spurious. The appellate court also noted that the trial court’s decision never mentioned that Baello's title was spurious. It further stated that any doubt or uncertainty as to the technical description contained in a certificate of title is not a ground for annulment of title. It held that since there was no legal basis for the annulment of Baello's TCT No. 35788, the trial court erred in declaring the said title null and void.<br><br>The Court of Appeals denied the cross-claim for moral damages filed by respondent Uniwide against respondent Baello, since Uniwide failed to establish its claim of besmirched reputation so as to be entitled to moral damages; hence, there was no basis to award the same. The other claims were likewise denied for lack of merit.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Decision of the Court of Appeals&nbsp; reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 126, in Civil Case No. C-16933 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered DISMISSING the instant complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals for lack of merit in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated December 6, 2005.<br><br>Hence, petitioner filed this petition raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF DID NOT SHIFT TO RESPONDENTS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY PETITIONER.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS MISCONSTRUED PETITIONER’S ALLEGATION THAT THE “ISSUANCE OF TWO TITLES OVER THE SAME PIECE OF LAND HAS NOT BEEN PROVED.”<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN TREATING PETITIONER’S COMPLAINT AS ONE ONLY FOR ANNULMENT OF TITLE WHEN PETITIONER ALSO SOUGHT RECONVEYANCE OF THE LOT IN QUESTION.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT RESPONDENT BAELLO’S TITLE IS NOT SPURIOUS.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>RESPONDENT UNIWIDE IS NOT A LESSOR IN GOOD FAITH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>The pertinent issues raised by petitioner shall be discussed together with the main issues which are: (1) whether or not petitioner is entitled to recovery of possession of the subject property; and (2) whether or not the title of respondent Baello may be annulled.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the burden of proof did not shift to respondents Baello and Uniwide, as it more than adequately proved its title to the lot in question by testimonial and documentary evidence.<br><br>In civil cases, the specific rule as to the burden of proof is that the plaintiff has the burden of proving the material allegations of the complaint which are denied by the answer; and the defendant has the burden of proving the material allegations in his answer, which sets up new matter as a defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This rule does not involve a shifting of the burden of proof, but merely means that each party must establish his own case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner seeks the annulment of respondent Baello’s title and the recovery of possession of property being occupied by Uniwide on the ground that it has the correct title to the subject property, with the proper technical description, while respondent Baello’s title is spurious and the technical description in her title is in general terms and does not identify her land with certainty.<br><br>The Court holds that petitioner was able to establish through documentary and testimonial evidence that the technical description of its Torrens title covers the property that is being occupied by respondent Uniwide by virtue of a lease contract with respondent Baello.&nbsp; A comparison of the technical description of the land covered by the title of petitioner and the technical description of the land covered by the title of Baello shows that they are not the same.<br><br>TCT No. 285312 registered in the name of petitioner reads:<br><br><blockquote>IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that certain land situated in Caloocan City, Philippines, bounded and described as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A parcel of land (Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A of the subd. plan Psd-706, LRC x x x situated in Balintawak, Caloocan, Rizal.&nbsp; Bounded on the E., along line 1-2, by Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-D, on the SE., along line 2-3 by Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-B, both&nbsp; of the subd. plan and on the SW., NW., along line 3-4-1 by Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-6, Beginning at a point marked “1” on plan being N. 69 deg. 07’E., 1,306.21m. from BLLM No. 1, Caloocan thence; S. 01 deg. 46’W., 25.16 m. to point 2; S 65 deg. 116.78 m. to point 3; N. 23 deg. 12’W., 23.85 m. to point 4; N. 65 deg. 57’E. 127.39 m. to the point of beginning; containing an area of TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR SQUARE METERS AND EIGHTY SQ.

(Full technical description appears on Transfer Certificate of Title No. 10300/T-42).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>From the foregoing, the title of petitioner covers a parcel of land referred to as Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A of the subdivision plan Psd-706, while the title of respondent Baello covers a parcel of land referred to as Lot No. 3-A of the subdivision plan Psd-706. It should be pointed out that the verification survey of Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A based on its technical description showed that Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A is the lot being occupied by Uniwide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Baello claims that her Lot No. 3-A is the same as Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A. However, the claim cannot be given credence because of the disparity of the lot description, and the technical description of the land covered by Baello’s title shows that it is not the same as the technical description of the land covered by petitioner’s title.&nbsp; Moreover, the technical description of the land covered by Baello’s title, or the boundaries stated therein, are not the same as those indicated in the survey plans<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which she adduced in evidence.&nbsp; Since Baello’s title covers a different property, she cannot claim a superior right over the subject property on the ground that she registered her title ahead of petitioner.<br><br>As petitioner has proven that its title covers the property in dispute, it is entitled to recover the possession thereof, the basis of which shall be discussed subsequently. The recovery of possession of the subject property by petitioner is not dependent on first proving the allegation that Baello’s title is spurious and the annulment of Baello’s title, since Baello’s title does not cover the subject property and petitioner has proven its title over the subject property and the identity of the property.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in treating its complaint as one only for annulment. It asserts that it prayed not only for annulment of Baello’s title, but also for the reconveyance of Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-B of subdivision plan Psd 706, which was the subject of lease between lessee Uniwide and lessor Baello, and over which property Baello claims ownership. Petitioner contends that reconveyance is in order as it has complied with the requisites of reconveyance under Article 434 of the Civil Code, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 434.&nbsp; In an action to recover, the property must be identified, and the plaintiff must rely on the strength of his title and not on the weakness of the defendant’s claim.</blockquote><br>Petitioner’s contention is meritorious.<br><br>Article 434 of the Civil Code provides that to successfully maintain an action to recover the ownership of a real property, the person who claims a better right to it must prove two (2) things:&nbsp; <i>first</i>, the identity of the land claimed, and; <i>second</i>, his title thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In regard to the first requisite, in an <span style="font-style: italic;">accion reinvindicatoria</span>, the person who claims that he has a better right to the property must first fix the identity of the land he is claiming by describing the location, area and boundaries thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner proved the identity of the land it is claiming through the technical description contained in its title, TCT No. T-285312;&nbsp; the derivative title of Felisa D.

Evelyn G. Celzo of the DENR, NCR, the same certification was also established as stated in L.R.C. 3288, a technical description as approved and recorded in DENR, NCR. The technical description appearing in plaintiff’s title shows the precise measurement, boundaries and location of the plaintiff’s property. These measurements/metes and bounds confirm the averments made by the plaintiff that the title of defendant Baello does not even clearly show where the land is located.<br><br>Defendant BAELLO claimed that the technical description appearing on plaintiff’s title belonged to her.&nbsp; In support of her claim[,] she submitted Exhibits “2,” “3,” “3-B.”&nbsp; Exhibits “3” and “3-B” were Survey Plans alleged to have been as prepared the Technical Description for TCT No. (35186) 12754.&nbsp; Firstly, the technical description appearing on her title is not the technical description alleged to be Exhibit “4,” which is the plan of Psd 706, Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A.&nbsp; Secondly, Exhibit “4,” which she submitted separately from the title, was not established by any competent witness.

Although petitioner, in its Complaint, prayed for the payment of P1.5 million as compensation for the occupancy and use of the subject property, it did not present evidence to prove that it is entitled to such amount.
