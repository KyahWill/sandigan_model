				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The February 12, 2009 Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Financial Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator <i>(FMO-OCA)</i> reported that several clerks of court of the lower courts failed to submit their Monthly Financial Reports and recommended that an immediate financial audit be conducted on them by the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office <i>(FMD-CMO)</i>. As recommended, FMD-CMO conducted an on-the-spot audit, examination and reconciliation of the book of accounts of Vivencia K. Languido <i>(Languido)</i>, Clerk of Court, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Pres. Roxas-Antipas-Arakan, North Cotabato <i>(MCTC)</i>, covering the period from April 19, 1985 to September 30, 2009.<br><br>On March 14, 2002, FMB-CMO submitted its report that Languido incurred delay in the remittances of her collections and had a cash shortage in the total amount of Four Hundred Ninety One Thousand Nine Hundred Ten Pesos and 70/100 (P491,910.70). Of the said amount, Languido restituted Eighty Seven Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty Nine Pesos and 10/100 (P87,969.10) leaving a balance of Four Hundred Three Thousand Nine Hundred Forty One Pesos and 60/100 (P403,941.60).<br><br>Moreover, only one passbook under Savings Account No. 0741-1432-91 could be presented covering the period from 2003 to 2009 because Languido claimed to have lost the earlier passbook.<br><br>Furthermore, it was disclosed that Languido failed to issue a receipt and remit to its proper account the bet money confiscated during an arrest in violation of P.D. No. 1602 and forfeited in favor of the government. She explained that she did not know that the money should be deposited in the Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund.<br><br>It was also discovered that Languido had been collecting and disbursing the Sheriffs Trust Fund since 2004 but did not issue the corresponding official receipts or deposit the amounts collected. Neither did she maintain an official cash book .nor prepare/submit monthly reports to the Accounting Division, FMO-OCA. For these shortcomings, Languido explained that there were no instructions on how to handle the trust fund.<br><br>For her infractions, the OCA withheld her salaries and other benefits. Judge Jose T. Tabosares, MCTC Presiding Judge, relieved her as financial custodian of the court funds, and designated Juliet B. Degutierrez, as the temporary financial custodian.<br><br>In a Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 14, 2012, the matter was referred to the OCA for evaluation, report and recommendation.<br><br>The OCA, in its March 23, 2012 Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> adopted the recommendations of the audit team, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; This report be docketed as an administrative complaint against Ms. Vivencia K.

A Hold Departure Order be ISSUED to Ms. Vivencia K. Languido to prevent her from leaving the country.</blockquote><br>Clerks of court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice. They perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> As such, their conduct must be guided by strict propriety and decorum at all times, in order to merit and maintain the public's respect for and trust in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Time and again, the Court has been reminding court personnel tasked with collection of court funds, such as clerks of courts and cash clerks, to deposit immediately with authorized government depositories the various funds they have collected because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment of. the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, Languido undoubtedly had been remiss in the performance of her duties. As clerk of court, she is duty-bound to use reasonable skill and diligence in the performance of her officially designated duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Records show that Languido failed to do the following: submit financial reports, remit the funds/collections on time, record her cash transactions in the cash books, and did not issue official receipts on several transactions particularly with regard to the confiscated and forfeited bet money and the collection and disbursement of the Sheriffs Trust Fund.<br><br>Languido's excuse of lack of knowledge and orientation in administering fiduciary funds and collections, and the absence of instructions on how to handle the Sheriffs Trust Fund does not absolve her of liability. Safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to an orderly administration of justice, and no protestation of good faith can override the mandatory nature of the circulars designed to promote full accountability for government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Languido's delay in remitting court collections was in complete violation of SC Circular Nos. 13-92 and 5-93, which provide the guidelines for the proper administration of court funds. These circulars mandate that all fiduciary collections shall be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank. Her failure to observe these circulars, which resulted in losses, shortage, destruction or impairment of court funds and properties, makes her liable therefor.<br><br>In the case of <i>Re: Initial Report on the Financial Audit Conducted in the Municipal Trial Court of Pulilan, Bulacan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the Court found the respondent clerk of court remiss in the performance of his duties for his failure to remit his collections on JDF and COC General Fund, when he failed to record the daily transactions in the official cash books, to submit monthly reports of collections and deposits and withdrawals to the Accounting Division, CMO, and to follow the circulars issued by the Court in the handling of the fiduciary funds. The respondent was found guilty of dishonesty, gross misconduct and malversation of public funds, and was dismissed from the service.<br><br>In <i>Report On The Financial Audit Conducted On The Books Of Accounts Of OIC Melinda Deseo, MTC, General Trias, Cavite</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court said that the undue delay in the remittances of amounts collected by clerks of court, at the very least, constitutes misconduct. The respondent in this case was meted the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay.<br><br>In the case of <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Nini</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court stated that delay in the remittances of collection as mandated constituted neglect of duty. The clerk of court therein was found guilty of gross neglect of duty and was suspended for a period of six (6) months and fined in the amount of P5,000.00.<br><br>On several occasions and for like offense, the Court has imposed the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service even if committed for the first time. In a more recent case, however, the Court mitigated the penalties imposed on erring officers and employees for humanitarian reasons.14<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds Vivencia K.
