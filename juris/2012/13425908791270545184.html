The Sate shall, by law, undertake an agrarian reform program founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other farmworkers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof. To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental, or equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation. In determining retention limits, the State shall respect the rights of small landowners. The State shall further provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing.</blockquote><br>The Congress has later enacted Republic Act No. 6657 to implement the constitutional mandate. Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 has defined the parameters for the determination of the just compensation, viz:<br><br><blockquote>Section 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation. </i>– In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</blockquote><br>The Congress has thereby required that any determination of just compensation should consider the following factors, namely: (<i>a</i>) the cost of the acquisition of the land; (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties; (<i>c</i>) the nature, actual use and income of the land; (d) the sworn valuation by the owner; (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations; (f) the assessment made by government assessors; (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed to the property by the farmers and farmworkers and by the Government; and (<i>h</i>) the fact of the non-payment of any taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the land.<br><br>Pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of Republic Act No. 6657,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) promulgated DAR Administrative Order (AO) No. 6, Series of 1992, DAR AO No. 11, Series of 1994 (to amend AO No. 6), and DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998 (to amend AO No. 11) ostensibly to translate the factors provided under Section 17 in a basic formula.&nbsp; The formulae embodied in these AOs have been used in computing the just compensation upon taking into account all the factors stated in Section 17, <i>supra</i>. It is relevant to note that the Court has consistently regarded reliance on the formulae under these AOs to be mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Of relevance here is DAR AO No. 5, whose formula of just compensation follows:<br><br><blockquote>A.

It ascertained Nable’s just compensation by considering the affected landholding’s nature, location, value and the volume of the produce, and by applying the formula under DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998, viz:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>Nonetheless, the said report (commissioners’ report) impliedly belied the classification made by the defendants (DAR and LBP) by stating among others, that the land is <b>fully cultivated</b> contrary to the allegation that portion of which is an idle land. While this Court may affirm, modify or disregard the Commissioner’s Report, <b>the Court may consider the number of listed coconut trees and bananas actually counted by the Board during their field inspection.</b><br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>The Court is of the opinion that the <b>actual production data </b>not the government statistics is the most accurate data that should be used if only to reflect the true and fair equivalent value of the property taken by the defendant through expropriation. Considering the number of coconut trees to a high of 12,153 all bearing fruits, it would be contrary to farming experience involving coconuts to have an average production per month of 2,057.14 kilos without necessarily stating that the said land is <b>classified as prime coconut land.</b> Apportioning the number of coconut trees to the total land area would yield, more or less 95 trees per hectare well within the <b>classification of a prime coconut land</b>.<br><br>Even the settled rule of thumb method of conversion, 1000 kilos of nuts make 250 kilos copra resecada long before adopted by coconut farmers spells substantial difference.

The Court stated that the RTC “was at no liberty to disregard the formula which was devised to implement the said provision.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus, LBP submits that the RTC’s land valuation, as modified by the CA, should be disregarded because of the failure to consider the factors listed in Section 17 of RA 6657 and the formula prescribed under DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998, amending DAR AO No. 11, Series of 1994.<br><br>LBP’s submission is grossly misleading. As the Court has already noted, the CA and the RTC did not disregard but applied the formula adopted in DAR AO No. 5. Moreover, the reasons for setting aside the RTC’s determinations of just compensation in <i>Banal</i> and <i>Celada</i> did not obtain here. In<i> Banal,</i> the RTC as SAC did not conduct a hearing to determine the landowner’s compensation with notice to and upon participation of all the parties, but merely took judicial notice of the average production figures adduced in another pending land case and used the figures without the consent of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The RTC did not also appoint any commissioners to aid it in determining just compensation. In contrast, the RTC as SAC herein conducted actual hearings to receive the evidence of the parties; appointed a board of commissioners to inspect and to estimate the affected landholding’s value; and gave due regard to the various factors before arriving at its valuation. In <i>Celada</i>, the Court accepted the valuation by LBP and set aside the valuation determined by the RTC because the latter valuation had been based “solely on the observation that there was a patent disparity between the price given to the respondent and the other landowners.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Apparently, the RTC had used only a single factor in determining just compensation. Here, on the other hand, the RTC took into consideration not only the board of commissioners’ report on the affected landholding’s value, but also the several factors enumerated in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and the applicable DAR AOs as well as the value of the improvements.<br><br><b><center>II.<br><i>Farming Experience </i>and <i>Rule of Thumb Method of <br>Conversion</i> are relevant to the statutory factors<br>for determining just compensation</center></b><br>The RTC elucidated:<br><blockquote>The Court is of the opinion that the actual production data not the government statistics is the most accurate data that should be used if only to reflect the true and fair equivalent value of the property taken by the defendant through expropriation.

LBP objected to the affidavit for the first time only on appeal in the CA. Expectedly, the CA rejected its tardy objection, and further deemed LBP’s failure to timely object to “respondent’s introduction of (the) affidavit” as an implied admission of the affidavit itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the CA’s rejection of LBP’s objection to the affidavit.<br><br>Any objection to evidence must be timely raised in the course of the proceedings in which the evidence is first offered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This enables the adverse party to meet the objection to his evidence, as well as grants to the trial court the opportunity to pass upon and rule on the objection. The objection to evidence cannot be made for the first time on appeal, both&nbsp; because the party who has failed to timely object becomes estopped from raising the objection afterwards; and because to assail the judgment of the lower court upon a cause as to which the lower court had no opportunity to pass upon and rule is contrary to basic fairness and procedural orderliness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>IV.<br>Awarding of interest and commissioners’ fee,<br>and deletion of attorney’s fee are proper</b></center><br>The CA correctly prescribed 12% interest <i>per annum</i> on the unpaid balance of P31,034,819.00 reckoned from the taking of the land in 1993 until full payment of the balance. This accords with our consistent rulings on the matter of interest in the expropriation of private property for a public purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The following justification for that rate of interest rendered in <i>Republic v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> is now worthy of reiteration, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The constitutional limitation of “just compensation” is considered to be the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described to be the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition or the fair value of the property as between one who receives, and one who desires to sell, it fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government. Thus, <b>if property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interests on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court. In fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred.</b><br><br>The Bulacan trial court, in its 1979 decision, was correct in imposing interests on the zonal value of the property to be computed from the time petitioner instituted condemnation proceedings and “took” the property in September 1969. <b>This allowance of interest on the amount found to be the value of the property as of the time of the taking computed, being an effective forbearance, at 12% per annum should help eliminate the issue of the constant fluctuation and inflation of the value of the currency over time</b>. Article 1250 of the Civil Code, providing that, in case of extraordinary inflation or deflation, the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis for the payment when no agreement to the contrary is stipulated, has strict application only to contractual obligations. In other words, a contractual agreement is needed for the effects of extraordinary inflation to be taken into account to alter the value of the currency. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The charging of P25,000.00 as commissioners’ fees against LBP is likewise upheld. Section 16, Rule 141 of the <i>Rules of Court,</i> expressly recognizes such fees, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 16.<i> Fees of commissioners in eminent domain proceedings. </i>– The commissioners appointed to appraise land sought to be condemned for public uses in accordance with the rules shall each receive a compensation to be fixed by the court of not less than (P300.00) Pesos per day for the time actually and necessarily employed in the performance of their duties and in making their report to the court which fees shall be taxed as a part of costs of the proceedings.</blockquote><br>Applying the rule, the Court finds the amount of P25,000.00 as fair and commensurate to the work performed by the commissioners, which the CA summed up as follows:<br><br><blockquote>We observe that in the Commissioners’ Report, the three (3) appointed Commissioners actually inspected 127 hectares of the subject property. It took them five (5) days to complete the ocular inspection and individually counted 12,153 coconut trees, 28,024 bananas, 4,928 <i>Tundan</i>, 821 <i>Falcata</i>, 1,126 <i>Temani</i>, 298 Bamboos, Jackfruit, 90 Santol, 51 <i>Rombuon</i>, 260 <i>Ipil-Ipil</i>, 5,222 Abaca plant, 68 Star Apple, 1,670 <i>Antipolo,</i> 67 <i>Narra</i> trees, 23 Durian trees, 139 Mango trees, 83 Avocado trees, 23 <i>Lanzones </i>trees, 84 Cacao, 18<i> Marang</i>, and 13 trees of <i>Lawaan.</i><br><br>Hence, for the actual time spent and thoroughness of its Report, it is proper for the said commissioners to be compensated in the amount of P25,000.00, which is only P1,666.66 per day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We sustain the CA’s deletion of the RTC’s award of 10% attorney’s fees.&nbsp; Under Article 2208, Civil Code, an award of attorney’s fees requires factual, legal, and equitable justifications. Clearly, the reason for the award must be explained and set forth by the trial court in the body of its decision. The award that is mentioned only in the dispositive portion of the decision should be disallowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Considering that the reason for the award of attorney’s fees was not clearly explained and set forth in the body of the RTC’s decision, the Court has nothing to review and pass upon now.
