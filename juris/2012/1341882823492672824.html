No. 194303).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Both Petitions assail the Decision dated 20 May 2009<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and Resolution dated 8 September 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> issued by the Court of Appeals (CA). The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the August 31, 2005 <i>Decision </i>and October 21, 2005 <i>Resolution</i> of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC NCR CA No. 043301-05 are hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Respondent Cosmos Bottling Corporation is, in light of the foregoing discussions, hereby <b>ORDERED</b> to pay Petitioner his full retirement benefits.<br><br>There being no data from which this Court can properly assess Petitioner’s full retirement benefits, the case is, thus, remanded to the Labor Arbiter only for that purpose.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote><br>Wilson B. Fermin (Fermin) was a forklift operator at Cosmos Bottling Corporation (COSMOS), where he started his employment on 27 August 1976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 16 December 2002, he was accused of stealing the cellphone of his fellow employee, Luis Braga (Braga).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Fermin was then given a Show Cause Memorandum, requiring him to explain why the cellphone was found inside his locker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In compliance therewith, he submitted an affidavit the following day, explaining that he only hid the phone as a practical joke and had every intention of returning it to Braga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 21 December 2002, Braga executed a handwritten narration of events stating the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;" width="10%">(a)</td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">At around 6:00 a.m. on 16 December 2002, he was changing his clothes inside the locker room, with Fermin as the only other person present. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;">(b) </td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Braga went out of the locker room and inadvertently left his cellphone by the chair.

Parenthetically, the labor courts dismissed Braga’s affidavit of desistance as a mere afterthought because the same was executed only after [Fermin] had been terminated.<br><br>It must be pointed out, however, that in labor cases, in which technical rules of procedure are not to be strictly applied if the result would be detrimental to the workingman, an affidavit of desistance gains added importance in the absence of any evidence on record explicitly showing that the dismissed employee committed the act which caused the dismissal. While We cannot completely exculpate [Fermin] from his violation at this point, We cannot, however, turn a blind eye and disregard Braga’s recantation altogether. Braga’s recantation all the more bolsters Our conclusion that [Fermin’s] violation does not amount to or borders on “serious or willful” misconduct or willful disobedience to call for his dismissal.<br><br>Morever, [COSMOS] failed to prove any resultant material damage or prejudice on their part as a consequence of [Fermin’s] questioned act. To begin with, the cellular phone subject of the stealth belonged, not to [COSMOS], but to Braga. Secondly, the said phone was returned to Braga in due time. Under the circumstances, a penalty such as suspension without pay would have sufficed to teach [Fermin] a lesson and for him to realize his wrongdoing.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </center><br>On another note, [COSMOS], in upholding the legality of [Fermin’s] termination from service, considered the latter’s past infractions with [COSMOS], i.e. threatening, provoking, challenging, insulting and committing acts of disrespect to a superior officer/defiance to an instruction and a lawful order of a superior officer; and, sleeping while on duty and abandonment of duty or leaving assigned post with permission from immediate supervisor, as <i>aggravating circumstances</i> to his present violation [stealth (sic) of a co-employee’s property]. We <i>disagree with Public Respondent on this matter.</i><br><br>The correct rule is that previous infractions may be used as justification for an employee’s dismissal from work in connection with a subsequent <i>similar</i> offense, which is obviously <u>not</u> the case here. x x x. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphases in the original.)</blockquote><br>COSMOS and Fermin moved for reconsideration, but the CA likewise denied their motions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, both parties filed the present Petitions for Review.<br><br>COSMOS argues, among other things, that: (a) Fermin committed a clear act of bad faith and dishonesty in taking the cellphone of Braga and denying knowledge thereof; (b) the latter’s recantation was a mere afterthought; (c) the lack of material damage or prejudice on the part of COSMOS does not preclude it from imposing the penalty of termination; and (d) the previous infractions committed by Fermin strengthen the decision of COSMOS to dismiss him from service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Fermin contends that since the CA found that the penalty of dismissal was not proportionate to his offense, it should have ruled in favor of his entitlement to backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>It must be noted that in the case at bar, <b>all the lower tribunals were in agreement that Fermin’s act of taking Braga’s cellphone amounted to theft</b>. Factual findings made by administrative agencies, if established by substantial evidence as borne out by the records, are final and binding on this Court, whose jurisdiction is limited to reviewing questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The only disputed issue left for resolution is whether the imposition of the penalty of dismissal was appropriate. We rule in the affirmative.<br><br>Theft committed against a co-employee is considered as a case analogous to serious misconduct, for which the penalty of dismissal from service may be meted out to the erring employee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Article 282 of the Labor Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Article 282. Termination by Employer. - An employer may terminate an employment for any of the following causes:<br><br>(a) <b>Serious misconduct </b>or willful disobendience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or his representatives <b>in connection with his work</b>;<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</center><br>(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing.</blockquote><br>Misconduct involves “the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment.” For misconduct to be serious and therefore a valid ground for dismissal, it must be:<br><br><blockquote>1. of grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial or unimportant and<br><br>2. connected with the work of the employee.</blockquote><br>In this case, petitioner dismissed respondent based on the NBI's finding that the latter stole and used Yuseco’s credit cards. But <b>since the theft was not committed against petitioner itself but against one of its employees, respondent's misconduct was not work-related and therefore, she could not be dismissed for serious misconduct.</b><br><br>Nonetheless, Article 282(e) of the Labor Code talks of other analogous causes or those which are susceptible of comparison to another in general or in specific detail. For an employee to be validly dismissed for a cause analogous to those enumerated in Article 282, the cause must involve a voluntary and/or willful act or omission of the employee.<br><br>A cause analogous to serious misconduct is a voluntary and/or willful act or omission attesting to an employee’s moral depravity. <b>Theft committed by an employee against a person other than his employer, if proven by substantial evidence, is a cause analogous to serious misconduct</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>In this case, the LA has already made a factual finding, which was affirmed by both the NLRC and the CA, that Fermin had committed theft when he took Braga’s cellphone. Thus, this act is deemed analogous to serious misconduct, rendering Fermin’s dismissal from service just and valid.<br><br>Further, the CA was correct in ruling that previous infractions may be cited as justification for dismissing an employee only if they are related to the subsequent offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> However, it must be noted that such a discussion was unnecessary since the theft, taken in isolation from Fermin’s other violations, was in itself a valid cause for the termination of his employment.<br><br>Finally, it must be emphasized that the award of financial compensation or assistance to an employee validly dismissed from service has no basis in law. Therefore, considering that Fermin’s act of taking the cellphone of his co-employee is a case analogous to serious misconduct, this Court is constrained to reverse the CA’s ruling as regards the payment of his full retirement benefits. In the same breath, neither can this Court grant his prayer for backwages.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition in G.R. No. 194303 is <b>DENIED</b>, while that in G.R. No. 193676 is <b>GRANTED</b>.
