Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> applicable insofar as it has determined what formula should be used in computing the just compensation for property expropriated under Presidential Decree No. 27 under the factual milieu of this case,<i> viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Respondent correctly cited the case of <i>Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Philippines,</i> where the Court ruled that "in computing the just compensation for expropriation proceedings, it is the value of the land at the time of the taking [or October 21, 1972, the effectivity date of P.D. No. 27], not at the time of the rendition of judgment, which should be taken into consideration."&nbsp; Under P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228, the following formula is used to compute the land value for palay:<br><br><center>LV (land value) = 2.5 x AGP x GSP x (1.06)n&nbsp; </center><br>It should also be pointed out, however, that in the more recent case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Natividad</i>, the Court categorically ruled: "the seizure of the landholding did not take place on the date of effectivity of P.D. No. 27 but would take effect on the payment of just compensation."&nbsp; Under Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657, the following factors are considered in determining just compensation, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation. </i>- In determining just compensation, <b>the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors</b> shall be considered.&nbsp; The <b>social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farm-workers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land </b>shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.<br></blockquote><br>Consequently, the question that arises is which of these two rulings should be applied?<br><br><b>Under the circumstances of this case, the Court deems it more equitable to apply the ruling in the <i>Natividad case</i>.&nbsp; In said case, the Court applied the provisions of R.A. No. 6657 in computing just compensation for property expropriated under P.D. No. 27</b>, stating,<span style="font-style: italic;"> viz</span>:<br><br><blockquote>Land Bank's contention that the property was acquired for purposes of agrarian reform on October 21, 1972, the time of the effectivity of PD 27, ergo just compensation should be based on the value of the property as of that time and not at the time of possession in 1993, is likewise erroneous.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Office of the President, Malacañang, Manila v. Court of Appeals,</span> we ruled that the seizure of the landholding did not take place on the date of effectivity of PD 27 but would take effect on the payment of just compensation.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Under the factual circumstances of this case, the agrarian reform process is still incomplete as the just compensation to be paid private respondents has yet to be settled.&nbsp; Considering the passage of Republic Act No. 6657 (RA 6657) before the completion of this process, the just compensation should be determined and the process concluded under the said law. Indeed, RA 6657 is the applicable law, with PD 27 and EO 228 having only suppletory effect, conformably with our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Paris v. Alfeche.</span></span><br><br>x x x x<br><br>It would certainly be inequitable to determine just compensation based on the guideline provided by PD 27 and EO 228 considering the DAR's failure to determine the just compensation for a considerable length of time.&nbsp; That just compensation should be determined in accordance with RA 6657, and not PD 27 or EO 228, is especially imperative considering that just compensation should be the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator, the equivalent being real, substantial, full and ample.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphases supplied, citations omitted.)</blockquote></blockquote><br>The ruling in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> was likewise applied in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Angel T. Domingo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> when the landowner Domingo filed a Petition for the Determination and Payment of Just Compensation despite his receipt of LBP’s partial payment.&nbsp; This Court held that since the amount of just compensation to be paid Domingo had yet to be settled, then the agrarian reform process was still incomplete; thus, it should be completed under Republic Act No. 6657.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, when the agrarian reform process is still incomplete as the just compensation due the landowner has yet to be settled, such just compensation should be determined and the process concluded under Republic Act No. 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Elucidating on this pronouncement, this Court, in<i> Land Bank of the Philippines v. Puyat</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> held:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, respondents’ title to the property was cancelled and awarded to farmer-beneficiaries on March 20, 1990.&nbsp; In 1992, Land Bank approved the initial valuation for the just compensation that will be given to respondents.&nbsp; Both the taking of respondents’ property and the valuation occurred during the effectivity of RA 6657.&nbsp; <b>When the acquisition process under PD 27 remains incomplete and is overtaken by RA 6657, the process should be completed under RA 6657, with PD 27 and EO 228 having suppletory effect only</b>.&nbsp; This means that PD 27 applies only insofar as there are <i>gaps</i> in RA 6657; where RA 6657 is sufficient, PD 27 is superseded.&nbsp; <b>Among the matters where RA 6657 is sufficient is the determination of just compensation</b>.&nbsp; In Section 17 thereof, the legislature has provided for the factors that are determinative of just compensation.&nbsp; Petitioner cannot insist on applying PD 27 which would render Section 17 of RA 6657 inutile.

With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:<br><br>1.

When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the <i>discretion of the court </i> at the rate of 6% <i>per annum. </i> No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).&nbsp; The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br>3.
