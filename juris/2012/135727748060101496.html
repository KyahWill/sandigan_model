The Sps.

The<i> fallo</i> of the CA decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is GRANTED and the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Judgment is hereby rendered declaring as legal and valid, the right of ownership of petitioner-appellant [respondents herein] spouses Jose Usi and Amelita T. Usi over Lot Nos. 733-B, 733-C-1 and 733-C-10 covered by TCT Nos. 1585-R.P., 2092-R.P, and 2101-R.P., respectively.&nbsp; Consequently, respondents-appellees [herein petitioners] are hereby ordered to cease and desist from further committing acts of dispossession or from disturbing possession and ownership of petitioners-appellants of the said property as herein described and specified.&nbsp; Claims for damages, however, are hereby denied x x x.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote><br>The CA predicated its ruling on the interplay of the following premises and findings: (a) the validity of the two (2) duly notarized subdivision agreements, or the 1<sup>st</sup> SA and 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, which the LMB later approved; (b) the subdivisions of Lot 733 on the basis of the Galang Plan actually partook the nature of the partition of the shares of its co-owners; (c)&nbsp; what Mendoza conveyed through the April 29, 1986 deeds of absolute sale is only her ideal, abstract or <i>pro-indiviso</i> share of Lot 733 of which she had full ownership, the conveyance or sale subject to the eventual delineation and partition of her share; (d) Vda. de Viray has not shown that fraud surrounded the execution of the partition of Lot 733 through the subdivision agreements of August 20, 1990 and April 5, 1991; (e) the certificates of title of the Sps. Usi constitute indefeasible proof of their ownership of Lots 733-B, 733-C-1 and 733-C-10; (f) said certificate entitled the Sps. Usi to take possession thereof, the right to possess being merely an attribute of ownership; (g) Vda. de Viray can only go after the partitioned shares of Mendoza in Lot 733; and (h) the issue of possessory right has been mooted by the judgment of ownership in favor of the Sps.

As shall be discussed shortly, facts and circumstances obtain arguing against the claimed co-ownership over Lot 733.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the earlier sale of Lot 733-A and Lot 733-F (Fajardo Plan) on April 29, 1986 was valid and effective conveyances of said portions of Lot 733.&nbsp; The subsequent transfers to the Sps. Usi of substantially the same portions of Lot 733 accomplished through the subdivision agreements constitute in effect double sales of those portions. This aberration was brought to light by the results of the adverted survey conducted sometime in June 22, 1999 of Engr. Nicdao of the LMB.<br><br><i>Third</i>, even granting <i>arguendo</i> that the subject subdivision agreements were in fact but partitions of the <i>pro-indiviso</i> shares of co-owners, said agreements would still be infirm, for the Sps. Viray and Vda. de Viray (vice Jesus Viray) were excluded from the transaction. Like Vda. de Mallari, Sps. Viray and Jesus Viray had validly acquired and, hence, owned portions of Lot 733 and are themselves co-owners of Lot 733.<br><br>And <i>last</i>, over and above the foregoing considerations, the instant petition must be resolved in favor of petitioners, the underlying reinvindicatory and possessory actions in Civil Case No. 01-1118 (M) being barred by the application of the <i>res judicata</i>&nbsp; principle. What is more, the issue of superior possessory rights of petitioner Vda. de Viray over Lot 733-F (Fajardo Plan) has been laid to rest with finality in Civil Case No. 91 (13).&nbsp; Besides, Sps. Usi’s action to assail the final and executory July 29, 1998 MCTC Decision in Civil Case No. 91 (13) has been denied with finality in <b>G.R.

Usi failed to prove their case.&nbsp; However, in CA G.R. CV No. 90344, an appeal from said RTC decision, the CA, while acknowledging the existence of the April 29, 1986 deeds of absolute sale, nonetheless accorded validity to the August 20, 1990 and April 5, 1991 subdivision agreements.&nbsp; This is incorrect.&nbsp; The CA held that the two (2) subdivision agreements, as notarized, enjoy the presumption of regularity and effectuated the property transfers covered thereby, obviously glossing over the <i>mala fides</i> attendant the execution of the two subdivision agreements. It cannot be overemphasized enough that the two (2) deeds of absolute sale over portions of substantially the same parcel of land antedated the subdivision agreements in question and their execution acknowledged too before a notary public.<br><br>The appellate court found and so declared the subdivision agreements valid without so much as explaining, let alone substantiating, its determination.&nbsp; The CA never elucidated how the Sps. Usi became, in the first place co-owners, with Mendoza over Lot 733. On its face, TCT 141-RP covering Lot 733 was in the name of spouses Ellen and Moses Mendoza only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then too, the CA did not explain how under the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA the Sps. Usi, the Sps. Lacap, the Sps. Balingit and the Sps. Jordan became co-owners with Mendoza over Lot 733-C, when Mendoza, under the 1<sup>st</sup> SA, virtually represented herself as the sole owner of Lot 733-C.<br><br>A scrutiny of the records with a fine-tooth comb likewise fails to substantially show a partition of Lot 733 by its co-owners.&nbsp; While the 1st and 2nd SAs purport to be deeds of partition by and among co-owners of the lot/s covered thereby, partition as a fact is belied by the evidence extant on record.&nbsp; Consider:<br><br>It is undisputed that TCT 141 RP covering Lot 733 was originally in the name of Ellen P. Mendoza and husband, Moses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The joint decision of the RTC in Civil Case Nos. 88-0265 and 88-0283-M narrated how the couple came to own Lot 733, thus: “Lot 733 was acquired by Spouses Moses Mendoza and Ellen Mendoza and Spouses Pacifico Bustos and Maria Roman from Donato Lacap for P5,000.00 (Exh. “1”) in 1977.&nbsp; After two years, Spouses Pacifico Bustos and Maria Roman sold one-half pro-indiviso portion of Lot 733 to spouses Moses Mendoza and Ellen Mendoza for P6,000.00 (Exh. “2”) and the acquisition cost of the whole lot is only P8,500.00 and x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Mendoza and the Sps.

Venancio Viray to sell the subject lot for at least PhP 200 per square meter, and that after his (Moses’) death on April 5, 1986, Lot 733 was included in the proceedings for the settlement of his estate docketed as Sp. Proc. Case No. 86-0040-M of the RTC, Branch 55 in Macabebe, Pampanga,&nbsp; The events thus alleged by Mendoza and the Usis can be gleaned from the final and executory joint decision in Civil Case Nos. 88-0265-M and 88-0283-M which petitioner Vda. de Viray attached as Annex “5” in her Answer with Counterclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> to the Usis’ petition for <i>accion publicana/reivindicatoria</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Joint Decision amply shows, in gist, the allegations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of both the Sps. Usi and Mendoza in Civil Case Nos. 88-0265-M and 88-0283-M asserting said facts.&nbsp; And these assertions, made in their complaints, are judicial admissions under Sec. 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Rule 129 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Unlike Vda. de Mallari who, per Vda. de Viray’s own admission,&nbsp; purchased the 416-square meter portion of Lot 733 on February 14, 1984, thus constituting her (Vda. de Mallari) as co-owner of Mendoza to the extent of said area purchased,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <b>the Sps. Usi have not been shown to be co-owners with Mendoza</b>. There is simply nothing in the records to demonstrate how the Sps. Usi became co-owners of Lot 733 before or after the death of Moses Mendoza.&nbsp; Elsewise put, no evidence had been adduced to show how the alleged interest of the Sps. Usi, as co-owner, came about, except for the bare assertions in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> SAs that they co-owned Lot 733 and Lot 733-C (Galang Plan).<br><br>It is fairly clear that Lot 733, even from the fact alone of its being registered under the name of the late Moses Mendoza and Ellen Mendoza, formed part of the couple’s conjugal property at the time Moses’ demise on April 5, 1986.&nbsp; Equally clear, too, is that Vda. de Mallari became a co-owner of Lot 733 by virtue of the purchase of its 416-square meter portion on February 14, 1984, during the lifetime of Moses. Be that as it may and given that the Sps. Usi have not been shown to be co-owners of Mendoza and Vda. de Mallari&nbsp; prior to the sale by Mendoza on April 29, 1986 of Lots 733-A and 733-F (Fajardo Plan) to the Sps. Viray and Jesus Viray, respectively, then the execution of the 1st SA on August 20, 1990 could not have been a partition by co-owners of Lot 733.&nbsp; The same could be said of the 2nd SA of April 5, 1991 vis-à-vis Lot 733-C, for the records are similarly completely bereft of any evidence to show on how the purported participating co-owners, namely Sps. Usi, the Sps. Lacap, the Sps. Balingit and the Sps. Jordan became co-owners with Mendoza and her children, i.e., McDwight, Bismark, Beverly and Georgenia.<br><br><b>The April 29, 1986 Deeds of Absolute Sale<br>of Lot 733-A and Lot 733-F are Valid</b><br><br>It must be noted that the RTC, in its decision in Civil Case Nos. 88-0265-M and 88-0283-M, upheld the validity of the separate April 29, 1986 deeds of absolute sale of Lots 733-A and 733-F (Fajardo Plan). The combined area of Lot 733-A (366 sq. m.) and Lot 733-F (3,501) is less than one half of the total area coverage of Lot 733 (9,137). The sale of one-half portion of the conjugal property is valid as a sale.&nbsp; It cannot be gainsaid then that the deeds, executed as they were by the property owner, were sufficient to transfer title and ownership over the portions covered thereby. And the aforesaid RTC decision had become final and executory as far back as December 11, 1995 when the Court, in <b>G.R. No. 122287</b>, in effect, affirmed the RTC decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the MCTC’s decision in Civil Case No. 91 (13) for forcible entry, declaring Vda. de Viray, as successor-in-interest of&nbsp; Jesus Viray, as entitled to the physical possession, or possession <i>de facto</i>, of Lot 733-F (Fajardo Plan), and the RTC’s decision in Civil Case No. 99-0914M, disposing of the belated appeal of the MCTC decision in the forcible entry case, have become final and executory on February 12, 2003 under <b>G.R. No. 154538</b>.<br><br>In light of the convergence of the foregoing disposed-of cases, there can be no question as to the ownership of the Sps. Viray and Vda. de Viray (vice Jesus Viray) over the specified and delineated portions of Lot 733 which they purchased for value from Mendoza.&nbsp; And Mendoza, as vendor, was bound to transfer the ownership of and deliver, as well as warrant, the thing which is the object of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the April 29, 1986 deeds of absolute sale indeed included the technical description of that part of Lot 733 subject of the transactions, thus clearly identifying the portions (Lots 733-A and 733-F under the Fajardo Plan) sold by Mendoza to the Sps. Viray and Vda. de Viray (vice Jesus Viray).&nbsp; Hence, there can be no mistaking as to the identity of said lots.<br><br>The deeds in question were, to reiterate, not only valid but constitute prior conveyances of the disputed portions of Lot 733.&nbsp; Accordingly, the subsequent conveyances in 1990 and 1991 to the Sps. Usi through transfer contracts, styled as subdivision agreements, resulted, in effect, in a double sale situation involving substantially the same portions of Lot 733.<br><br>The survey report of LMB surveyor, Engr. Nicdao, would support a finding of double sale.&nbsp; His report, as earlier indicated, contained the following key findings: (1) Lot 733-A (Fajardo Plan) with an area of 336 square meters thus sold to the Sps. Viray is within Lot 733-B (Galang Plan), the part&nbsp; assigned to Sps. Usi under the division; and (2) Lot 733-F (Fajardo Plan) with an area of 3,501 square meters is almost identical to the combined area of Lots 733-C-8 to 733-C-12 awarded to Ellen Mendoza and her children, McDwight, Bismark, Beverly and Georgenia, and a portion (1,000 square meters) of Lot 733-C-10 (Galang Plan) adjudicated to Sps. Usi.<br><br>A double sale situation, which would call, if necessary, the application of Art. 1544 of the Civil Code, arises when, as jurisprudence teaches, the following requisites concur:<br><br><blockquote>(a) The two (or more) sales transactions must constitute valid sales;<br>(b) The two (or more) sales transactions must pertain to exactly the same subject matter;<br>(c)&nbsp; The two (or more) buyers at odds over the rightful ownership of the subject matter must each represent conflicting interests; and<br>(d) The two (or more) buyers at odds over the rightful ownership of the subject matter must each have bought from the very same seller. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>From the facts, there is no valid sale from Mendoza to respondents Usi.&nbsp; The parties did not execute a valid deed of sale conveying and transferring the lots in question to respondents.&nbsp; What they rely on are two subdivision agreements which do not explicitly chronicle the transfer of said lots to them.&nbsp; Under the 1<sup>st</sup> SA, all that can be read is the declaration that respondents, together with others, are the “sole and exclusive owners” of the lots subject of said agreement.&nbsp; Per the 2<sup>nd</sup> SA, it simply replicates the statement in the 1st SA that respondents are “sole and exclusive undivided co-owners” with the other parties.&nbsp; While respondents may claim that the SAs of 1990 and 1991 are convenient conveying vehicles Mendoza resorted to in disposing portions of Lot 733 under the Galang Plan, the Court finds that said SAs are not valid legal conveyances of the subject lots due to non-existent prestations pursuant to Article 1305 which prescribes “a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service.”&nbsp; The third element of cause of the obligation which is established under Art. 1318 of the Civil Code is likewise visibly absent from the two SAs.&nbsp; The transfer of title to respondents based on said SAs is flawed, irregular, null and void.&nbsp; Thus the two SAs are not “sales transactions” nor “valid sales” under Art. 1544 of the Civil Code and, hence, the first essential element under said legal provision was not satisfied.<br><br>Given the above perspective, the Sps. Viray and Vda. de Viray (vice Jesus Viray) have, as against the Sps. Usi, superior rights over Lot 733-A and Lot 733-F (Fajardo Plan) or portions thereof.<br><br><b><i>Res Judicata Applies<br></i></b><br>Notably, the Sps. Viray and Vda. de Viray, after peremptorily prevailing in their cases supportive of their claim of ownership and possession of Lots 733-A and 733-F (Fajardo Plan), cannot now be deprived of their rights by the expediency of the Sps. Usi maintaining, as here, an <i>accion publiciana</i> and/or <i>accion reivindicatoria</i>, two of the three kinds of actions to recover possession of real property. The third, <i>accion interdictal</i>, comprises two distinct causes of action, namely forcible entry and unlawful detainer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the issue in both cases being limited to the right to physical possession or possession<i> de facto,</i> independently of any claim of ownership that either party may set forth in his or her pleadings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> albeit the court has the competence to delve into and resolve the issue of ownership but only to address the issue of priority of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Both actions must be brought within one year from the date of actual entry on the land, in case of forcible entry, and from the date of last demand to vacate following the expiration of the right to possess, in case of unlawful detainer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>When the dispossession or unlawful deprivation has lasted more than one year, one may avail himself of <i>accion publiciana</i> to determine the better right of possession, or possession <i>de jure</i>, of realty independently of title.&nbsp; On the other hand, <i>accion reivindicatoria</i> is an action to recover ownership which necessarily includes recovery of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Now then, it is a hornbook rule that once a judgment becomes final and executory, it may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land, as what remains to be done is the purely ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Any attempt to reopen a close case would offend the principle of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br><i>Res judicata</i> embraces two concepts or principles, the first is designated as “bar by prior judgment” and the other, “conclusiveness of judgment.” <i>Tiongson v.

Viray over the disputed parcels of land cannot, by force of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine, be re-litigated thru actions to recover possession and vindicate ownership filed by the Sps. Usi. The Court, in <b>G.R. No. 122287</b> (<i>Ellen P. Mendoza and Jose and Amelita Usi v. Spouses Avelino Viray and Margarita Masangcay and Jesus Carlo Gerard Viray</i>), has in effect determined that the conveyances and necessarily the transfers of ownership made to the Sps. Viray and Vda. de Viray (vice Jose Viray) on April 29, 1986 were valid.&nbsp; This determination operates as a bar to the Usis reivindicatory action to assail the April 29, 1986 conveyances and precludes the relitigation between the same parties of the settled issue of ownership and possession arising from ownership.&nbsp; It may be that the spouses Usi did not directly seek the recovery of title or possession of the property in question in their action for annulment of the deed sale of sale. But it cannot be gainsaid that said action is closely intertwined with the issue of ownership, and affects the title, of the lot covered by the deed. The prevalent doctrine, to borrow from<i> Fortune Motors, (Phils.), Inc. v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> “is that an action for the annulment or rescission of a sale of real property does not operate to efface the fundamental and prime objective and nature of the case, which is to recover said real property.”<br><br>And lest it be overlooked, the Court, in <b>G.R. No. 154538 </b>(<i>Spouses Jose and Amelita Usi v. Ruperta Cano Vda. de Viray</i>), again in effect ruled with finality that petitioner Vda. de Viray has a better possessory right over&nbsp; Lot 733-F (Fajardo Plan).&nbsp; Thus, the Court’s decision in <b>G.R. No. 122287</b> juxtaposed with that in <b>G.R. No. 154538 </b>would suffice to bar the Sps.

Venancio Viray before whom the alleged Deed of Absolute Sale was executed and notarized is related to the defendants in the first degree and that prior to the death of Moses Mendoza, (previous owner of the lot in question), Atty. Viray was their family lawyer and was appointed by the deceased Moses Mendoza as an exclusive agent to sell the property described as Lot No. 733 Cad-305-D of which the land in question is a portion, for a price not less than P200.00 per square meter; that to give more proofs of deception and forgery committed by defendants and Notary Public Atty. Venancio Viray at the time when he was still the family lawyer, the Res. Cert. No. 113574 issued on April 28, 1986 at Masantol, Pampanga allegedly exhibited by plaintiff Ellen P.

Venancio Viray executed and entered into a temporary deed of sale respecting a portion of said lot in question on March 25, 1984, when Atty. Venancio Viray representing himself to the spouses Jose Usi and Amelita Usi to be with power and authority to sell said lot from said owner Moses Mendoza, accepted by way of down payment from said plaintiffs-spouses the sum of P30,000.00 at P500.00 per square meter of that said portion of the said parcel of land with an area of 308 square meters and from the time when the owner Moses Mendoza died on April 5, 1986 up to the present, the corresponding Deed of Sale in favor of the plaintiffs have [sic] not been executed by Atty.

Venancio Viray before whom the alleged deed of absolute sale was executed and notarized is the natural father of the alleged vendee and prior to the death of Moses G. Mendoza previous owner of the lot allegedly sold, Atty. Viray was their family lawyer and was appointed by the deceased Moses Mendoza as exclusive agent to sell Lot No. 733 for a price not less than P200.00 per square meter and the over price shall be his commission; that the alleged consideration of P25,000.00 is simulated and fictitious and without any consideration, for the vendee-defendant never paid plaintiff-vendor any amount; that the residence certificate allegedly exhibited by plaintiff before Notary Public Atty. Venancio Viray, who at the time it was allegedly executed was their family lawyer, is likewise a forgery and a fictitious residence certificate because her (plaintiff’s) true residence certificate for 1986 was taken by her in San Fernando, Pampanga which was duly executed and signed by her, not the residence certificate No. 11305754 issued on April 28, 1986 at Masantol, Pampanga which is not signed and incomplete; that the forgery and deception was perpetrated by Atty. Viray as a father and Notary Public who notarized the deed of sale by making it appear that his son-vendee is of legal age when in truth he is still a minor and, therefore, cannot yet give consent to a contract of sale which is a bilateral contract, therefore, there being no consent on both the vendee and the vendor, the deed of absolute sale allegedly executed by the plaintiff and defendant Jesus Carlo Gerard Nunga Viray is null and void from the beginning; that when the deed of absolute sale was allegedly executed on April 29, 1986, the estate of Moses G. Mendoza has not yet been settled and still pending settlement before this Court; that notwithstanding repeated demands, the defendants failed and refused and still fail and refuse to return the possession of the land subject of the complaint x x x.<br><br>The plaintiff prayed that the subject Deed of Absolute Sale dated April 29, 1986 be declared null and void and the defendants be ordered to vacate the land in question and declare possession thereof to the plaintiff, and to pay the plaintiff such unpaid rental for the use and occupation of the subject land in the amount of P1,500.00 per month, plus actual damage incurred by virtue of the excavation of the land in the amount of P10,000.00; P20,000.00 as moral damages; P5,000.00 as exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney’s fees.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> SEC. 4. <i> Judicial admissions. </i>— An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof.&nbsp; The admission may be contradicted only by showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Records, p. 166.&nbsp; The August 1, 1989 Joint Decision (Civil Case Nos. 88-0265-M and 88-0283-M), p. 9 reads:<br><br>x x x&nbsp; Subsequently, on February 14, 1984, spouses Moses Mendoza and Ellen Mendoza sold a portion (416 square meters) to Emerencia M.
