This property was mortgaged to the then Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (now Development Bank of the Philippines or DBP) on August 18, 1955,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and upon default in the payment of the loan obligation, was foreclosed and ownership was consolidated in DBP's name under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-1152.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Serafin Adolfo, Sr., however, repurchased the same and was issued TCT No. 6313<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on December 1, 1971, a year after his wife died in 1970.<br><br>Sometime in 1975, Serafin Adolfo, Sr. (Adolfo) allegedly mortgaged the subject property for the sum of P12,500.00 to Aniceto Bangis (Bangis) who immediately took possession of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The said transaction was, however, not reduced into writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>When Adolfo died, his heirs, namely, Luz Adolfo Bannister, Serafin Adolfo, Jr. and Eleuterio Adolfo (Heirs of Adolfo), executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition dated December 24, 1997 covering the subject property and TCT No. T-65152<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> was issued to them. On May 26, 1998, the said property was subdivided and separate titles were issued in names of the Heirs of Adolfo, as follows: TCT Nos.

They further prayed, in the alternative, to be allowed to redeem the subject lot under the Homestead Law and that Bangis be ordered to indemnify them: (a) P50,000.00 each as moral damages; (b) 20% of the value of the property as attorney's fees; and (c) P50,000.00 as litigation expenses as well as the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In his Answer with Counterclaim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Bangis claimed to have bought the subject property from Adolfo for which TCT No. T-10567<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> was issued. He also alleged to have been in open and adverse possession of the property since 1972 and that the cause of action of the Heirs of Adolfo has prescribed. On November 11, 2001, Bangis died and was substituted in this suit by his heirs, namely, Rodolfo B. Bangis, Ronie B. Bangis, Rogelio B. Bangis, Raquel B. Quillo, Romulo B. Bangis, Rosalina B.

Lastre (Heirs of Bangis).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>During the trial, one of the Heirs of Bangis, Rodolfo Bangis, presented a photocopy of an Extra-Judicial Settlement with Absolute Deed of Sale dated December 30, 1971<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for the purpose of proving the sale of the subject lot by Adolfo and his heirs in favor of his predecessors-in-interest, Aniceto Bangis and Segundino Cortel, for the sum of P13,000.00. He also presented a Promissory Note<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of even date purportedly executed by Bangis and Segundino Cortel undertaking to pay the balance of the purchase price in the amount of P1,050.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Both documents were notarized by Atty. Valentin Murillo who testified to the fact of their execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Rodolfo Bangis likewise testified that they have been paying the taxes due on the property and had even used the same as collateral for a loan with a bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On rebuttal, one of the Heirs of Adolfo, Luz Adolfo Bannister, denied the due execution and genuineness of the foregoing Extra-Judicial Settlement with Absolute Deed of Sale alleging forgery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On December 29, 2005, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in favor of the Heirs of Adolfo, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the preponderance of evidence being strongly in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, decision is hereby rendered:<br><br>1. Declaring the contract between the plaintiffs and defendants as a mere mortgage or antichresis and since the defendants have been in the possession of the property in 1975 up to the present time enjoying all its fruits or income, the mortgaged loan of P12,000.00 is deemed fully paid;<br><br>2. Ordering the defendants to deliver the possession of the property in question and all the improvements thereon to the plaintiffs peacefully;<br><br>3. Declaring TCT No. 10567 in the name of Aniceto Bangis as NULL AND VOID AB INITIO and directing the Office of the Register of Deeds to cause its cancellation from its record to avoid confusion regarding the ownership thereof; and<br><br>4. Declaring all the transfer certificates of title issued in favor of the plaintiffs namely, Luz Adolfo-Bannister, Serafin Adolfo, Jr. and Eleuterio Adolfo, as above-mentioned as the ones valid and issued in accordance with PD 1529.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>Aggrieved, the Heirs of Bangis appealed the foregoing disquisition to the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br><b><i><u>THE CA RULING</u></i></b><br><br>In its assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC finding that the contract between the parties was a mortgage, not a sale. It noted that while Bangis was given possession of the subject property, the certificate of title remained in the custody of Adolfo and was never cancelled. The CA also ordered the Heirs of Adolfo to pay the Heirs of Bangis the mortgage debt of P12,500.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> with twelve (12%) percent interest reckoned from 1975 until 1998 and to deliver to them the possession of the property upon full payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It, however, deleted the RTC order directing the Register of Deeds to cancel TCT No. T-10567 in the name of Bangis for being a collateral attack proscribed under PD 1529.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, the Heirs of Bangis filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> arguing that the CA erred in disregarding their testimonial and documentary evidence, particularly, the Extra-Judicial Settlement with Absolute Deed of Sale (Exh. 2) which purportedly established the sale in favor of their predecessor-in-interest, Aniceto Bangis. The said motion was, however, denied in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated December 2, 2009.<br><br><b><i><u>THE ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT</u></i></b><br><br>Hence, the instant petition for review on certiorari based on the lone assignment of error<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that the transaction between the parties was one of sale and not a mortgage or antichresis. In support, petitioner Heirs of Bangis maintain that the CA erred in not giving probative weight to the Extra-Judicial Settlement with Absolute Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which supposedly bolsters their claim that their father, Aniceto Bangis, bought the subject parcel of land from Adolfo. Hence, the corresponding title, TCT No. T-10567, issued as a consequence should be respected.<br><br>On their part, respondent Heirs of Adolfo averred that no reversible error was committed by the CA in upholding that no sale transpired between the parties' predecessors-in-interest. Moreover, petitioners' TCT No. T-10567 was not offered in evidence and worse, certified as of dubious origin per the Manifestation of the Registrar of Deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>THE COURT'S RULING</u></i></b><br><br>The petition must fail.<br><br>At the outset, it should be emphasized that a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court involves only questions of law and not of facts. A question of law exists when there is doubt as to what the law is on a given set of facts while a question of fact arises when there is doubt as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Heirs of Bangis, in insisting that both the RTC and the CA erroneously disregarded the evidence of sale they presented, are effectively asking the Court to re-evaluate factual issues which is proscribed under Rule 45. "Such questions as to whether certain items of evidence should be accorded probative value or weight, or rejected as feeble or spurious, or whether or not the proofs on one side or the other are clear and convincing and adequate to establish a proposition in issue, are without doubt questions of fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court perused the records and found substantial evidence supporting the factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, that the nature of the transaction between the parties' predecessors-in-interest was a mortgage and not a sale. Thus, the maxim that factual findings of the trial court when affirmed by the CA are final and conclusive on the Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> obtains in this case.<br><br><b><i><u>THERE WAS NEITHER AN<br>ANTICHRESIS NOR SALE</u></i></b><br><br>For the contract of antichresis to be valid, Article 2134 of the Civil Code requires that "the amount of the principal and of the interest shall be specified in writing; otherwise the contract of antichresis shall be void." In this case, the Heirs of Adolfo were indisputably unable to produce any document in support of their claim that the contract between Adolfo and Bangis was an antichresis, hence, the CA properly held that no such relationship existed between the parties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Heirs of Bangis presented an Extra-Judicial Settlement with Absolute Deed of Sale dated December 30, 1971<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> to justify their claimed ownership and possession of the subject land. However, notwithstanding that the subject of inquiry is the very contents of the said document, only its photocopy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> was presented at the trial without providing sufficient justification for the production of secondary evidence, in violation of the best evidence rule embodied under Section 3 in relation to Section 5 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3. Original document must be produced; exceptions. - When the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself, except in the following cases:<br><br><blockquote>(1) When the original has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, without bad faith on the part of the offeror;<br><br>(2) When the original is in the custody or under the control of the party against whom the evidence is offered, and the latter fails to produce it after reasonable notice;<br><br>(3) When the original consists of numerous accounts or other documents which cannot be examined in court without great loss of time and the fact sought to be established from them is only the general result of the whole; and<br><br>(4) When the original is a public record in the custody of a public officer or is recorded in a public office.</blockquote><br>SEC. 5. When original document is unavailable. - When the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on his part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by a recital of its content in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated.</blockquote><br>The bare testimony of one of the Heirs of Bangis, Rodolfo Bangis, that the subject document was only handed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> to him by his father, Aniceto, with the information that the original thereof "could not be found"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> was insufficient to justify its admissibility. Moreover, the identification made by Notary Public Atty. Valentin Murillo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that he notarized such document cannot be given credence as his conclusion was not verified against his own notarial records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Besides, the Heirs of Bangis could have secured a certified copy of the deed of sale from the Assessor's Office<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> that purportedly had its custody in compliance with Section 7, Rule 130<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In sum, the Heirs of Bangis failed to establish the existence and due execution of the subject deed on which their claim of ownership was founded. Consequently, the RTC and CA were correct in affording no probative value to the said document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>TCT NO. T-10567 IN THE NAME OF<br>ANICETO BANGIS CANNOT PREVAIL<br>OVER THE TITLES OF THE HEIRS OF<br>ADOLFO</u></i></b><br><br>Records reveal that TCT No. T-10567 purportedly secured as a consequence of the deed of sale executed by Adolfo and his heirs in favor of Bangis was not offered in evidence. A perusal of its copy, however, shows that it was a transfer from TCT No. T-10566,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which title the Heirs of Bangis unfortunately failed to account for, and bore no relation at all to either OCT No. P-489 (the original title of the Spouses Adolfo) or TCT No. T-6313 (issued to Adolfo when he repurchased the same property from DBP). The Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the Register of Deeds of Malaybalay City regarding the doubtful origin of TCT No. T-10567 and the regularity of the titles of the Heirs of Adolfo are insightful, thus:<br><br><blockquote>That the verification from the office of the original copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10567 in the name of Anecito Bangis is existing in the office. Machine copy of the said title is hereto attached as annex "A" but nothing in the title whether annotated or attached, any Deed of Conveyance or other Documents by which said title was issued or transferred in the name of Anecito Bangis.<br><br>That for the information and guidance of the court attached herewith is a machine copies [sic] Original Certificate of Title No. P-489 in the name of Serafin Adolfo, marked as annex "B" which supposedly the mother title of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10567 as to how this title was transferred in the name of Anecito Bangis. Nothing will show which will validly supports [sic] the said transfer, in other words the said title is dubious.<br><br>This Original Certificate of Title No. P-489 in the name of Serafin Adolfo was mortgage to the Development Bank of the Philippines and then it was consolidated and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1152 was issued in the name of Development Bank of the Philippines. From the Development Bank of the Philippines a Deed of Sale was executed by the Development Bank of the Philippines in favor of Serafin Adolfo and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6313 marked annex "B-1" was issued in the name of Serafin Adolfo.<br><br>An Extrajudicial Settlement was now [sic] by the Heirs of Serafin Adolfo and Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-65152 annex "B-2", T-66560 annex "B-3", T-66561 annex "B-4", T-66562 annex "B-5", T-66563 annex "B-6", T-66564 annex "B-7", and T-66565 annex "B-8" were issued to the Heirs.<br>The titles issued to the Heirs of Serafin Adolfo were legitimately issued by this office after all its [sic] requirements and supporting documents were submitted and proper annotations were reflected at the back of the title of Serafin Adolfo.<br><br>Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10567 as shown on the title was derived from Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10566 but [sic] title is not existing in this office.</blockquote><br>As held in the case of <i>Top Management Programs Corporation v. Luis Fajardo and the Register of Deeds of Las Piñas City</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> "if two certificates of title purport to include the same land, whether wholly or partly, the better approach is to trace the <i>original certificates</i> from which the certificates of titles were derived."<br><br>Having, thus, traced the roots of the parties' respective titles supported by the records of the Register of Deeds of Malaybalay City, the courts a quo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> were correct in upholding the title of the Heirs of Adolfo as against TCT No. T-10567 of Bangis, notwithstanding its earlier issuance on August 18, 1976<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> or long before the Heirs of Adolfo secured their own titles on May 26, 1998. To paraphrase the Court's ruling in <i>Mathay v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> where two (2) transfer certificates of title have been issued on different dates, the one who holds the earlier title may prevail only in the absence of any anomaly or irregularity in the process of its registration, which circumstance does not obtain in this case.<br><br><b><i><u>CANCELLATION OF<br>TCT NO. T-10567</u></i></b><br><br>The Court cannot sustain the CA's ruling<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that TCT No. T-10567 cannot be invalidated because it constitutes as a collateral attack which is contrary to the principle of indefeasibility of titles.<br><br>It must be noted that Bangis interposed a counterclaim in his Answer seeking to be declared as the true and lawful owner of the disputed property and that his TCT No. T-10567 be declared as superior over the titles of the Heirs of Adolfo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Since a counterclaim is essentially a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> then, a determination of the validity of TCT No. T-10567 vis-a-vis the titles of the Heirs of Adolfo can be considered as a direct, not collateral, attack on the subject titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In <i>Pasiño v. Monterroyo</i>, the Court has ruled, thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is already settled that a counterclaim is considered an original complaint and as such, the attack on the title in a case originally for recovery of possession cannot be considered as a collateral attack on the title. <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals </i>is similar to the case before us insofar as petitioner in that case filed an action for recovery of possession against respondent who, in turn, filed a counterclaim claiming ownership of the land. In that case, the Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>Nor is there any obstacle to the determination of the validity of TCT No. 10101. It is true that the indefeasibility of torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked. In the instant case, the original complaint is for recovery of possession filed by petitioner against private respondent, not an original action filed by the latter to question the validity of TCT No. 10101 on which petitioner bases its right. To rule on the issue of validity in a case for recovery of possession is tantamount to a collateral attack. However, it should not [b]e overlooked that private respondent filed a counterclaim against petitioner, claiming ownership over the land and seeking damages. Hence, we could rule on the question of the validity of TCT No. 10101 for the counterclaim can be considered a direct attack on the same. ‘A counterclaim is considered a complaint, only this time, it is the original defendant who becomes the plaintiff... It stands on the same footing and is to be tested by the same rules as if it were an independent action.’ x x x (Citations omitted) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Besides, the prohibition against collateral attack does not apply to spurious or non-existent titles, which are not accorded indefeasibility,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> as in this case.<br><br><b><i><u>THE PRESENT ACTION<br>HAS NOT PRESCRIBED</u></i></b><br><br>The claim of the Heirs of Bangis that since they have been in possession of the subject land since 1972 or for 28 years reckoned from the filing of the complaint in 2000 then, the present action has prescribed is untenable. It bears to note that while Bangis indeed took possession of the land upon its alleged mortgage, the certificate of title (TCT No. 6313) remained with Adolfo and upon his demise, transferred to his heirs, thereby negating any contemplated transfer of ownership. Settled is the rule that no title in derogation of that of the registered owner can be acquired by prescription or adverse possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Moreover, even if acquisitive prescription can be appreciated in this case, the Heirs of Bangis' possession being in bad faith is two years shy of the requisite 30-year uninterrupted adverse possession required under Article 1137 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Consequently, the Heirs of Bangis cannot validly claim the rights of a builder in good faith as provided for under Article 449 in relation to Article 448 of the Civil Code. Thus, the order for them to surrender the possession of the disputed land together with all its improvements was properly made.<br><br><b><i><u>LIABILITY FOR THE PAYMENT<br>OF INTEREST</u></i></b><br><br>Finally, it is undisputed that the Heirs of Bangis made no judicial or extrajudicial demand on the Heirs of Adolfo to pay the mortgage debt. Instead, it was the latter who signified their intent to pay their father's loan obligation, admittedly in the amount of P12,500.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> which was refused. The mortgage contract therefore continued to subsist despite the lapse of a considerable number of years from the time it was constituted in 1975 because the mortgage debt has not been satisfied.<br><br>Following the Court's ruling in the iconic case of <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.
