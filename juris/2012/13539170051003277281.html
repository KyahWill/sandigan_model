				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure assailing the November 23, 2005 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the October 4, 2006 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 70994 entitled “<i>Rosal Homeowners Association, Inc. v. John C. Arroyo, et al</i>.”<br><br><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br><br>Respondent Rosal Homeowners Association, Incorporated <i>(RHAI)</i> is a non-stock, non-profit organization duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines.&nbsp; Its membership is composed mainly of occupants of a parcel of land with an area of 19,897 square meters, situated in Brgy. Rosal, Taculing, Bacolod City, and formerly owned by Philippine Commercial International Bank <i>(PCIB)</i>.<br><br>Petitioners Jasmin Alipato, Primitivo Belandres, Nestor Leduna, Anita de los Reyes, and Gina Caballero (<i>petitioners</i>) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> were among the actual occupants of the subject land.&nbsp; They occupied the land by mere tolerance long before the said land was acquired by PCIB in 1989.&nbsp; To evade eviction from PCIB and in order to avail of the benefits of acquiring land under the Community Mortgage Program (<i>CMP</i>) of the National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (<i>NHMFC</i>), the said occupants formally organized themselves into an association, the RHAI.&nbsp; With the aid and representation of the Bacolod Housing Authority (<i>BHA</i>), RHAI was able to obtain a loan from the NHMFC and acquired the subject land from PCIB. As a consequence, the Registry of Deeds of Bacolod City issued a Transfer Certificate of Title (<i>TCT</i>) No. T- 202933,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> covering the 19,897 square-meter land, in the name of RHAI.&nbsp; By virtue of the land acquisition by RHAI, all the occupants of the land became automatic members of RHAI.&nbsp; To fully avail of the benefits of the CMP, the NHMFC required the RHAI members to sign the Lease Purchase Agreement (<i>LPA</i>) and to maintain their membership in good standing in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of RHAI.&nbsp; Petitioners, however, refused to sign the LPA as a precondition under the CMP.&nbsp; They likewise failed to attend the regular meetings and pay their membership dues as required by the RHAI By-Laws.&nbsp; As a result, RHAI through its Board of Directors, approved a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to enforce the eviction of petitioners and recover possession of the portions of land which they were occupying.&nbsp; Pursuant to the said resolution, RHAI, through written letters of demand,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> called for petitioners to vacate the premises and deliver possession thereof to RHAI.&nbsp; Petitioners, however, ignored the demand.&nbsp; This prompted RHAI to file an action for recovery of possession of the subject property before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 49, Bacolod City (<i>RTC</i>), which was docketed as Civil Case No. 98-10388.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In their Answer, petitioners denied RHAI’s claim that they were illegal occupants of the subject land.&nbsp; They argued that they could not be ejected from the said property because they were entitled to own the land that they had occupied for several years prior to RHAI’s acquisition of title therein. They also claimed that RHAI sought their ejectment to accommodate other persons who were not qualified beneficiaries of the CMP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC ruled in favor of RHAI.&nbsp; The RTC found petitioners as already non-members, having been expelled from the RHAI.&nbsp; Petitioners did not qualify as loan beneficiaries for their refusal to sign the LPA as required by the NHMFC.&nbsp; As such, they had no more right to remain in the land they are occupying.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the RTC decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Defendants are ordered to vacate the premises of the lot covered by TCT No. T-202933 situated at Taculing, Bacolod City and to remove their structures constructed thereon.<br></li><li> Defendants are ordered to pay the amount of ?500.00 monthly for the use of the lot occupied by their respective houses starting from date of this decision until they actually leave the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><br>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the CA, claiming that they were denied due process by the RTC when it rendered judgment in favor of RHAI. They added that the RTC erred in finding that they refused to join the association or were expelled therefrom for failure to comply with their obligations, specifically the payment of membership dues and attendance in meetings.<br><br>On November 23, 2005, the CA rendered its decision affirming the RTC decision. It ruled that petitioners were not denied of their right to procedural due process as they were given opportunity to present evidence, but failed to do so.&nbsp; According to the CA, “[w]here opportunity to be heard either through oral argument or pleadings is accorded, there can be no denial of procedural due process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Further, the CA sustained the RTC’s finding that petitioners refused to become members of RHAI or were considered expelled from the same because of their failure to comply with their duties and responsibilities.&nbsp; The decretal portion of the CA Decision states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us <b>DENYING</b> the appeal filed in this case and <b>AFFIRMING</b> the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 49, in Bacolod City in Civil Case No. 98-10388.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the said decision on the ground that their expulsion from RHAI was illegal for want of due process.&nbsp; The motion, however, was denied by the CA in its Resolution, dated October 4, 2006.<br><br>Hence, petitioners interpose the present petition before this Court anchored on the following<br><br><blockquote><b><center>GROUNDS</center><br>That the Honorable Court of Appeals committed errors when it overlooked the following formulations:<br><br>1. The petitioners were denied of their right to due process when they were expelled as members of respondent.<br><br>2. The petitioners were denied of their right to own a piece of land for their homes under the socialized housing program of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></b></blockquote><br>The issues to be resolved are: 1) whether due process was observed in this case; and 2) whether petitioners were denied of their right to own a piece of land for their homes under the socialized housing program of the government.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the CA committed a serious error in upholding the ruling of the RTC that they were expelled as members of RHAI because the records are bereft of any evidence indicating the initiation of expulsion proceedings against them.&nbsp; In addition, they claim that they were not informed by RHAI that they had been expelled as members of the association.&nbsp; Invoking the case of <i>Ynot v. Intermediate Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> petitioners insist that, consistent with the requirements of due process, they should have been given the opportunity to be heard.<br><br>Petitioners insist that they cannot be ejected by RHAI being the actual occupants of the portions of the subject land long before the same was acquired by the latter.&nbsp; They opine that RHAI, in filing the ejectment case against them, violated the very purpose for the creation and existence of the socialized housing program, that is, to allow actual beneficiaries, like them, to own the portions of the land they were actually occupying.<br><br>On the other hand, RHAI, in its Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> points out that the issues being raised involve questions of fact which were properly disposed of both by the RTC and the CA when they found that petitioners were deemed expelled from their membership of RHAI for non-compliance with its rules and regulations specifically their refusal to pay membership dues and reasonable fees. The evidence on record conclusively shows that petitioners were validly expelled from the association in accordance with its By-Laws and in compliance with the demands of due process.&nbsp; Their refusal to comply with the requirements of the CMP disqualified them from being member-beneficiaries of RHAI.&nbsp; Hence, they were not denied of their right to own the portions of land they occupy for their homes.<br><br>The petition must fail.<br><br>On the first issue raised by petitioners, the Court finds no merit in their repeated claim of denial of due process.<br><br>The record shows that petitioners were accorded a fair trial in the RTC.&nbsp; In fact, they were properly represented by a counsel who was able to confront and cross-examine the witnesses presented by RHAI.&nbsp; They had ample opportunity to substantiate their claim that they were not expelled as members and to present witnesses.&nbsp; Unfortunately, petitioners did not present their own evidence to bolster their defense.&nbsp; Thus, they cannot feign denial of due process where they had been afforded the opportunity to present their side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Petitioners, having chosen not to avail of the opportunity to present evidence to rebut the charges against them, cannot complain of denial of due process.&nbsp; As long as the parties are given the opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered, the demands of due process are sufficiently met.&nbsp; What is offensive to due process is the denial of this opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Relevant in this regard is the findings of the CA, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It is basic that, as long as a party is given the opportunity to defend his interest in due course, he would have no reason to complain, for it is this opportunity to be heard that makes upon the essence of due process.&nbsp; Where opportunity to be heard, either through oral argument or pleadings is accorded, there can be no denial of procedural due process.&nbsp; In the case at bench, the record reveals that, during the trial on the merits of Civil Case No. 98-10388, the defendants-appellants were accordingly represented by their counsel on record, Atty. Allan Zamora.&nbsp; The said counsel was able to cross-examine the witnesses for the plaintiff-appellee association.&nbsp; Although it appears that, on the May 23, 2000 hearing of Civil Case No. 98-10388, said counsel raised to the court a quo the issue of a possible conflict of interest on his part, considering that he was then the City Legal Officer of Bacolod, the fact remains that the court<i> a quo</i>, in its order dated March 31, 2002, gave said counsel an opportunity to file a manifestation within 10 days as to whether or not he would still continue to act as counsel for the defendants-appellants.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 10-day period stated in the order lapsed with the failure of Atty. Zamora to file his manifestation to withdraw as counsel for the defendants-appellants.&nbsp; When the court <i>a quo</i> heard again Civil Case No. 98-10388, the defendants-appellants’ counsel still did not appear.&nbsp; When the court <i>a quo</i> rendered its assailed decision on March 21, 2001, defendants-appellants did not even bother to seek for reconsideration thereof.&nbsp; It is rather unfortunate that defendants-appellants’ counsel neglected his duties to the latter.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the negligence of counsel binds the client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>At any rate, when the RTC rendered its decision adverse to petitioners, the latter were able to seek reconsideration and avail of their right to appeal to the CA.&nbsp; The CA then required the parties to file their respective pleadings before it rendered a decision denying petitioners’ appeal.&nbsp; They even moved for the reconsideration of the denial of their appeal.&nbsp; Having been able to appeal and move for a reconsideration of the assailed rulings, petitioners cannot claim a denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Likewise devoid of merit is petitioners’ claim that they were deprived of their right to due process when they were allegedly expelled from RHAI.<br><br>The essence of due process is the opportunity to be heard. What the law prohibits is not the absence of previous notice but the absolute absence thereof and the lack of opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The records of this case disclose that there was a board resolution issued for the expulsion of the erring or defaulting members of RHAI.&nbsp; The latter were duly informed that they were already expelled as members of the association through notices sent to them.&nbsp; These notices, however, were refused to be received by petitioners.&nbsp; Their expulsion was made pursuant to the By-Laws of RHAI as shown by the testimony of Mildred de la Peña (<i>dela Peña</i>), President, on cross-examination by the counsel for petitioners:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">ATTY ZAMORA:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Is there any provision in the by-laws which provides for expulsion of the members of the association?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, Attorney.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">And is there a procedure to be followed before a member xxx (is) expelled from the association?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, Attorney.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And could you please tell us those procedure to be followed before a member could be expelled from association?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">As per by-laws of the association <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">we are sending notices</span> for the members to come, to attend the meeting and inform them whether they have paid their obligation.

This is expressly sanctioned by the By-Laws of RHAI.&nbsp; The Court quotes with approval the ruling of the CA on the matter, viz:<br><br><blockquote>Like any other organization, plaintiff-appellee association has to set certain rules and regulations.&nbsp; The evidence adduced in the court <i>a quo</i> by the plaintiff-appellee association proved that the defendants-appellants failed to pay their membership fees and other reasonable fees.&nbsp; A perusal of the by-laws of the plaintiff-appellee association reveals that a member is only required to pay a membership fee of ?100.00 to be paid every fiscal year and a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of ?10.00.&nbsp; Although it likewise provides for contribution and special assessments which the defendants-appellants claimed to be unreasonable, yet, the defendants-appellants failed to prove by the amount of evidence required by law as to what extent the plaintiff-appellee association unreasonably assessed them.&nbsp; To us, there is no reason at all for&nbsp; the defendants-appellants to protest the fees or dues as assessed against them by the plaintiff-appellee association. Such unwholesome attitude of the defendant-appellants to pay the memberships fees and monthly dues to the plaintiff-association clearly indicates that they do not want to be a part of the membership of the association.&nbsp; Thus, the court a quo was correct in holding that defendants-appellants were deemed expelled from their membership of the plaintiff-appellee association because of their irrational failure to obey the rules and regulations of the latter.&nbsp; The defendants-appellants likewise refused to acknowledge and sign the Lease Purchase Agreement (LPA) as required by the NHMFC.&nbsp; Because of the defendants-appellants’ refusal to be members in good standing of the plaintiff-appellee corporation, they remained squatters of the subject land in the true sense of the word.&nbsp; As such, their possession is only by tolerance of the plaintiff-appellee association, and the latter can recover possession of the subject land as the lawful owner thereof.&nbsp; Squatting is unlawful and no amount of acquiescence converts it into a lawful act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>Apparently, petitioners’ refusal to sign and submit the LPA, the most important requirement of the NHMFC for the acquisition of the land, disqualified them as loan beneficiaries. As such, they acquire no better rights than mere occupants of the subject land.<br><br>In any case, the due process guarantee cannot be invoked when no vested right has been acquired. The period during which petitioners occupied the lots, no matter how long, did not vest them with any right to claim ownership since it is a fundamental principle of law that acts of possessory character executed by virtue of license or tolerance of the owner, no matter how long, do not start the running of the period of acquisitive prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the Court does not lose sight of the fact that petitioners were actual occupants of the subject land.&nbsp; True enough, the RHAI was purposely formed to enable the dwellers, including petitioners, to purchase the lots they were occupying, being the ultimate beneficiaries of the CMP of the NHMFC.&nbsp; Petitioners, however, must be reminded that they have to comply with certain requirements and obligations to qualify as beneficiaries and be entitled to the benefits under the program.&nbsp; Their unreasonable refusal to join RHAI and their negative response to comply with their obligations compelled RHAI to either expel them or declare them as non-members of the association.&nbsp; Petitioners cannot now claim that they were denied the right to own the portions of land they were occupying for their homes under the CMP.<br><br>It should be noted that petitioners were never prevented from becoming members of RHAI.&nbsp; In fact, they were strongly encouraged to join and comply with the requirements of the CMP, not only by the RHAI, but also by the BHA.&nbsp; The following testimony of De la Pena illustrate that the direct intervention of the BHA proved futile, thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">ATTY.
