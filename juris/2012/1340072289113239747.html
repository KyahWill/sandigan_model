				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is an appeal from the 24 March 2010 Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which affirmed the 5 October 2007 Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Branch 24, Cebu City, which had convicted appellant Ireneo Ganzan (Ganzan) of the crime of rape.<br><br>Ganzan was charged in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 30 March 2001, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>That on 26<sup>th</sup> day of February, 2001 at 1:30 in the morning at APOCEMCO, Barangay Tinaan, Municipality of Naga, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with [AAA],<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against her will and consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, appellant Ganzan entered a plea of “not guilty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial on the merits ensued, and the RTC found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in a Decision dated 5 October 2007, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the prosecution having successfully discharged the burden of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, this Court finds him guilty of rape punished under Article 266-A of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, as amended, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">Reclusion Perpetua</span>. He shall likewise suffer the accessory penalty inherent in the law.<br><br>Accused is further ordered to pay the victim a civil indemnity of <b>PhP50,000.00</b>, by reason of the crime and <b>PhP50,000.00</b>, as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Dissatisfied with the judgment, Ganzan appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> After a review of the records by the appellate court, the finding of guilt by the trial court was affirmed by the former in a Decision dated 24 March 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Ganzan then filed this instant appeal before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The main witness for the prosecution was the victim herself. She narrated that, sometime before midnight on 25 February 2011, she was on her way home from a disco with her friend, Eleonor Sarda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> As they approached a small basketball court, they were accosted by a man with a gun, later identified as appellant Ganzan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He was wearing a bonnet, but it did not cover his entire face, as it covered only his head and forehead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He pointed a gun at them, identified himself as a member of the New People’s Army from Bohol, and asked them the names of their parents and if they had identification cards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He told them, “Don’t be afraid of me because I’m not a bad guy. You just go there to the dark side.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Trembling, they obeyed his order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Upon reaching the dark side, Eleonor and AAA were ordered by Ganzan at gunpoint to remove their clothes. They complied until they were only in their undergarments. Ganzan trained a flashlight all over their bodies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thereafter, he sent Eleonor to the disco place to buy banana cue and cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After Eleonor left, Ganzan aimed his flashlight all over AAA’s body while he kept looking around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He then dragged her towards the vicinity of the Apo Cement Corporation (APOCEMCO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> When they reached a grassy area, he commanded her to lie down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> She refused, but Ganzan threatened her with the gun, forced her to lie down, and removed her panties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> AAA instantly covered her genitals with her hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> After repeatedly ordering her to remove her hands, to no avail, Ganzan struck her hands, and uncovered her genitals. Afterwards, he covered AAA’s face with her blouse and held both her hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>When AAA’s face was already covered, appellant Ganzan inserted his finger inside her vagina, causing her to cry, “Ma!” Afterwards, he inserted his penis into her vagina, causing her to shout loudly. He then ordered her to keep quiet and poked a knife at her neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Because of her constant resistance, the blouse covering her face came off during the assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Ganzan then inserted his finger into her vagina for about three times, and then inserted his penis again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> AAA could not do anything, because she was no longer feeling well due to the intense pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>When Ganzan was finished, he ordered AAA to get up and put on her clothes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> After she got dressed, he pointed the gun at her and said, “Don’t ever reveal these things because I will kill you and your family.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He then told her, “You can go home now but don’t tell anybody about this. Don’t turn around to face me.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Defiantly, AAA turned around to take a good look at her rapist. Ganzan then remarked, “I told you not to turn your back,” while still pointing the gun at her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>AAA kept on walking until she reached home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> She slept on the sofa and did not inform anyone in her family about what happened, because she was afraid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Marie Cris Canicon and Reynante Cabigas narrated in their Joint Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that, shortly after the incident, at around 1:45 a.m., they saw appellant Ganzan coming from the area where the rape incident happened, still fixing his short pants. He was walking hurriedly while repeatedly looking from side to side. When appellant saw Marie Cris and Reynante, he asked them what they were doing in the area. He asked to see their identification cards, and when they replied that they did not have any, he asked them where they lived. He kept on pointing his flashlight at Marie Cris, until Reynante covered her eyes and told Ganzan not to do that. Marie Cris then stared at appellant for almost one minute, causing him to get angry. Afterwards, he left and told them not to go to the place he pointed to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, instead of following appellant’s order to buy banana cue and cigarettes, Eleonor reported the incident to her cousin and to the <i>barangay tanods</i>. They went to the scene of the crime, but found nobody there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>AAA woke up to the sound of her elder brother and cousin knocking very hard and kicking at their door. Apparently having heard about the incident, her brother asked her what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> She told him that somebody forcibly raped her. Her brother asked her if she knew her assailant, and she replied that she would recognize the person if she would see him again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Her brother and cousin then went out looking for the man who raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the morning, AAA went to the Don Vicente Sotto Memorial Hospital of Cebu City for a medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The examining physician, Dr. Carlos Ray B. Sanchez, concluded that, consistent with a finding of possible sexual abuse, there were fresh lacerations in her hymen. He also confirmed the presence of sperm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The following day, during a police lineup, both AAA and Eleonor Sarda identified Ganzan as the man who had waylaid them and later raped AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Appellant Ganzan interposed the defense of denial and alibi. He stated that he did not have a firearm,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and that he was a mountaineer at APOCEMCO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> On 25 February 2001, he was on duty from 7:00 a.m. up to 3:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> At about 11:00 p.m., he rested and slept at the bunkhouse<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> together with Rolando Pelandas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> APOCEMCO Security Guard Michael Quirol confirmed that Ganzan proceeded to the bunkhouse a little past 10:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> while Rolando Pelandas stated that he saw appellant sleeping in one of the rooms of the bunkhouse at about the same time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> From the time Ganzan arrived at the APOCEMCO compound that night, he alleged that he never left the premises until he woke up the following morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>On 27 February 2001, Ganzan was surprised to find out that he was a suspect in a rape incident and was being invited to go to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> At the police station, he was then identified by AAA as the one responsible for the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b></center><br>We rule that the prosecution has fulfilled its burden of establishing appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The crime of rape is defined in the Revised Penal Code as amended by the Anti-Rape Law of 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed</i>. – Rape is committed –<br><ol><li> By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a. Through force, threat or intimidation; x x x.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Pursuant to this provision, the essential elements that the prosecution must prove are, first, that a man succeeded in having carnal knowledge of a woman; and, second, that the act was accomplished through force, threat or intimidation.<br><br>In this case, AAA positively testified to the presence of both elements. In her testimony, she recounted in detail her harrowing experience at the hands of Ganzan – how she and her friend, while on their way home from a disco, were intercepted by the appellant;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> how they were made to undress at gunpoint;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> how her friend was sent away so that the appellant would be left alone with her to fulfill his lewd designs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and how he actually succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her against her will while poking a knife against her neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>These accusations were further buttressed by the findings of Dr. Carlos Ray Sanchez, who concluded that there was a possibility of sexual abuse after he found fresh lacerations in her hymen and confirmed the presence of sperm in her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>For his part, appellant Ganzan vehemently denied the allegations of the prosecution and interposed alibi as a defense.<br><br>We have ruled that alibi is a weak defense and is viewed with disfavor by the courts, because it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove. Unless substantiated by clear and convincing proof, such defense is negative, self-serving, and undeserving of any weight in law. In order for alibi to prosper, appellant must prove that, first, he was somewhere else during the commission of the crime, and, second, that it was impossible for him to be anywhere within the vicinity of the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The defense fell short of meeting this burden.<br><br>Appellant Ganzan alleged that he was sleeping in the APOCEMCO bunkhouse when the crime of rape occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Michael Quirol confirmed that appellant had indeed proceeded to that place a little past 10:00 p.m.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> while Rolando Pelandas stated that he saw Ganzan sleeping in one of the rooms of the bunkhouse at about the same time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> However, the rape incident occurred at about 1:30 a.m. of the following day, at which time Ganzan’s presence was unaccounted for, aside from his bare and self-serving assertion.<br><br>Moreover, even if Ganzan was in the APOCEMCO compound at or near the time when the crime was committed, it was not impossible for him to be near the crime scene when the rape occurred. He himself testified that the crime scene could be reached from the bunkhouse by walking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>We quote with favor the ruling of the trial court in disposing of appellant’s defense of alibi:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. During the ocular inspection, the distance from the place of the incident and the bunkhouse was proven to be easily accessible (five minutes by horse riding, passing through the quarry within the Compound of the APOCEMCO and about 300 meters passing the footpath through the barbed wire fence in shortcut to the highway). Thus, while it could be true that accused Ireneo Ganzan was sleeping at the bunk house of the Apocemco between 11:00 in the evening of February 25, 2001 until the morning of the next day, it could not be ruled out that he could have been at the place of the incident sometime in between or at about midnight or 1:30 dawn, when people are in deep slumber, to commit the bestial act against the victim herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> x x x.</blockquote><br>Furthermore, we have ruled that alibi cannot prevail over positive identification that is categorical, consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In this case, AAA positively identified appellant Ganzan in open court as the perpetrator of the rape committed against her:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Now, when you saw that person pointed by you, that was the face of the person who raped you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That was the face of the person who inserted his penis to your vagina?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, if that person is here in the chamber, can you point him out?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, that one.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Court Interpreter: Witness points to the person seated inside the chamber who when asked answered his name to be Ireneo Ganzan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></blockquote><br>We have ruled that owing to the nature of the offense, rape is usually a crime bereft of witnesses, and, in many cases, the only evidence is the testimony of the offended party herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> As long as her testimony passes the test of credibility, she says all that is necessary to show that the offense has been committed, and the court may convict the accused on that basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues that the victim failed to clearly and positively identify her assailant, because she could not have seen his face as the place where the incident occurred was very dark.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The victim’s clear and categorical statements belie the submission of the defense. On cross-examination, AAA testified that the place where they were waylaid was not very dark, as there was a lamppost about 20 meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Moreover, she expressly stated that she saw the face of appellant two times: first, when he was sexually abusing her, as the blouse covering her face came off;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and, second, when she defiantly turned around to look at her assailant despite being ordered not to look back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>During the clarificatory examination conducted by the Municipal Trial Court of Naga, AAA firmly asserted that she saw the face of appellant as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Court:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">At the time when you were sexually violated, did you see the face of the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Court: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Are you sure?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x x x</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Court: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">And if the person who violated you sexually is present in the courtroom now, can you recognize him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Court: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Can you point him out?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.
