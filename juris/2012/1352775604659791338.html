				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This administrative matter stemmed from the financial audit report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated November 22, 2011, conducted by the Court Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator (<i>CMO-OCA</i>), on the books of accounts of Susana R. Fontanilla (<i>Fontanilla</i>), Clerk of Court, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, San Narciso-Buenavista, San Narciso, Quezon (<i>MCTC</i>).<br><br>On January 26, 2009, the OCA requested for authority from the Court to withhold Fontanilla’s salaries for her continuous failure to submit the required monthly reports of collections, deposits and withdrawals for the Judiciary Development Fund (<i>JDF</i>), Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund and Fiduciary Fund. The request was approved on January 27, 2009. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In her Letter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Fontanilla admitted that she used some of her collections for her personal needs because of financial difficulties. She explained that, as she was the bread winner of the family, she used the money for the family’s sustenance, education of her children and medical expenses of her husband and parent.<br><br>In&nbsp; another&nbsp; Letter, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; dated&nbsp; December&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 2010,&nbsp; Fontanilla informed the OCA that she had submitted the required monthly reports and deposited all the cash balances on hand and attached the validated deposit slips as proof thereof. In the same letter, Fontanilla requested the release of her withheld salaries.<br><br>Upon recommendation of the OCA, the Court, in its Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated July 19, 2011, ordered the release of the salaries of Fontanilla beginning April 2011 and authorized the Fiscal Monitoring Division, CMO-OCA, to conduct a financial audit on the books of accounts covering the period from October 1984 to September 8, 2011. Subsequently, Fontanilla was relieved as Clerk of Court and Ericson E. Musa (Musa), Court Stenographer I, was designated as Officer-in-Charge.<br><br>Based on the audit conducted, Fontanilla’s collections were all accounted for in the Court’s financial records. It was, however, revealed that there were unauthorized withdrawals amounting to P28,000.00, resulting in a cash shortage in the Fiduciary Fund. The amounts and dates of the withdrawals were: P4,000.00 on March 8, 2006, P12,000.00 on December 11, 2006, and another P12,000.00 on January 23, 2008. On October 20, 2011, Fontanilla restituted the said amounts.<br><br>The audit team noted that although no cash shortage was found in the other judiciary funds, Fontanilla delayed the remittances of collections which deprived the Court of the interests that would have accrued had the collections been deposited on time.<br><br>During the audit, it was also discovered that, as of August 31, 2011, the MCTC had Fiduciary Fund deposits with the Municipal Treasurer’s Office, San Narciso, Quezon, in the amount of P141,500.00, which should have been withdrawn and deposited in the Land Bank of the Philippines (<i>LBP</i>), Mulanay, Quezon Branch,&nbsp; the Court’s authorized depository bank.<br><br>The audit team likewise found out that the MCTC was not collecting the Process Server’s Fee and the Mediation Fee as required under Section 9 of the Amended Administrative Circular No. 35-2004. The audit team, thus, advised Musa to collect the process server’s fee and disburse the same in accordance with the aforementioned circular; and to collect the mediation fee, remit it to its corresponding account, and prepare the monthly reports relative thereto.<br><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated July 25, 2012, the OCA adopted the recommendation of the audit team, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">This report be DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter against Ms. Susana R.

Section 3, in relation to Section 5 of SC Circular No. 5-93, specifically designates the LBP as the authorized government depositary of the JDF. It reads:<br><br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>Duty of the Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge or accountable officers. – The Clerks of Court, Officers-in-Charge, or their accountable duly authorized representatives designated by them in writing, who must be accountable officers, shall receive the Judiciary Development Fund collections, issue the proper receipt therefore, maintain a separate cash book properly marked x x x deposit such collections in the manner herein prescribed and render the proper Monthly Report of Collections for said Fund.<br><br></li><li>x x x x<br><br></li><li>Systems and Procedures:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><ol start="3" type="a"><li>In the RTC, SDC, MeTC, MTCC, MTC, and SCC. – The daily collections for the Fund in these courts shall be deposited every day with the local or nearest LBP branch For the account of the Judiciary Development Fund, Supreme Court, Manila – Savings Account No. 159-01163; or if depositing daily is not possible, deposits of the Fund shall be every second and third Fridays and at the end of every month, provided, however, that whenever collections for the Fund reach P500.00, the same shall be deposited immediately even before the days before indicated.<br><br>Where there is no LBP branch at the station of the judge concerned, the collections shall be sent by postal money order payable to the Chief Accountant of the Supreme Court at the latest before 3:00 of that particular week.<br><br>x x x x<br><br></li><li>Rendition of Monthly Report. – Separate “Monthly Report of Collections” shall be regularly prepared for the Judiciary Development Fund, which shall be submitted to the Chief Accountant of the Supreme Court within ten (10) days after the end of every month, together with the duplicate of the official receipts issued during such month covered and validated copy of the Deposit Slips.</li></ol></li></ol><br>The aggregate total of the Deposit Slips for any particular month should always equal to, and tally with, the total collections for that month as reflected in the Monthly Report of Collections.<br><br>If no collection is made during any month, notice to that effect should be submitted to the Chief Accountant of the Supreme Court by way of a formal letter within ten (10) days after the end of every month.</blockquote><br>These directives in the circulars are mandatory, designed to promote full accountability for government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Clerks of Court, tasked with the collections of court funds, are duty bound to immediately deposit with the LBP or with the authorized government depositories their collections on various funds because they are not authorized to keep funds in their custody.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The unwarranted failure to fulfill this responsibility deserves administrative sanction and not even the full payment, as in this case, of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, Fontanilla did not only delay the remittance of her collections but also incurred shortages amounting to ?28,000.00. She admitted her fault, explaining that she used the money for her family’s sustenance, for the education of her children, and for the medical expenses of her spouse and mother.<br><br>Although the Court understands the plight of Fontanilla, it cannot condone her wrongdoing. As custodian of the court’s funds and revenues, she was entrusted with the primary responsibility of correctly and effectively implementing regulations regarding fiduciary funds. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> She was an accountable officer entrusted with the great responsibility of collecting money belonging to the funds of the court.&nbsp; She was, therefore, liable for any loss, shortage, destruction, or impairment of said funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>As held in Report on the Financial Audit Conducted on the Books of Accounts of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Mondragon-San Roque, Northern Samar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> shortages in the amounts to be remitted and the years of delay in the actual remittance constitute gross neglect of duty for which the clerk of court shall be administratively liable.<br><br>Delay in the remittance of collection is a serious breach of duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; It deprives the Court of the interest that may be earned if the amounts are promptly deposited in a bank;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and more importantly, it diminishes the faith of the people in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; This act constitutes dishonesty which carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service even if committed for the first time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In this case, however, Fontanilla, in a show of remorse, immediately returned the withdrawals and complied with the directives of the audit team.&nbsp; Considering that this is her first offense, the Court finds the penalty of P40,000.00 fine as sufficient.<br><br>Every public official should realize that “public office is a public trust. Those charged with the dispensation of justice, from the justices and judges to the lowliest clerks, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. Not only must their conduct, at all times, be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, it must be beyond suspicion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Again, the OCA is reminded to expand the coverage of the check payment system in all cities and capital towns in the provinces in order to minimize, if not to eliminate the irregularities in the collection of court funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> finding Susan R.
