Sevilla2) to the Office of the Chief Justice.<br><br>Acting on the report, the Court issued a Resolution on June 23, 2010,3 which we quote:<br><br><blockquote>The OCA’s financial audit team, from the Fiscal Monitoring Division of the Court Management Office, found that a huge amount of collections within the period of February 1995 to October 2007 was not deposited; these funds were successively handled by persons appointed as Clerk of Court II in the said court, namely: Victorio A. Dion, Alicia Q. Carrera, and Liza P. Castillo, and by retired Judge Aniceto L. Madronio, Sr. The Court previously required them to file compliance/explanation/comments. In this regard, the OCA reports that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>Mr. Dion’s explanations/comments to the audit findings, together with the audit team’s evaluation of his explanations and its recommendations, were taken up and discussed in a <i>separate report</i>.<br><br></li><li>Ms. Carrera made an over withdrawal of P3,000.00, representing a reduced cash bond deposit in Criminal Case No. 3982. She did not file any&nbsp; explanation/comment as she already left for the United States after [s]he resigned from her court position on May 15, 2002.<br><br></li><li>Judge Madronio made a withdrawal of cash bond in the amount of P2,000.00 in Criminal Case Nos. 4358-59, without a special power of attorney (SPA). Judge Madronio explained that the bondsman/payor, who should have issued the SPA, was already residing abroad Judge Madronio redeposited P2,000.00 to the Fiduciary Fund Account on September 23, 2008. <br><br></li><li>Ms. Castillo incurred a total shortage of P598,655.10, reduced to P597,155.10. The FMD withheld her salaries and allowances since August 2006. She expressed her willingness “to deposit all the amounts,” subject to a recomputation and the application of the withheld salaries to her accountabilities. However, she offered no explanation for the shortages. </li></ol></blockquote><br>Moreover, Ms. Castillo affixed her signature as Officer-in-Charge <i>(OIC)</i> in (1) the monthly reports of collections, deposits, and withdrawals covering the period of November 2001 to April 2002; and (2) the Supreme Court official receipts starting December 2001, although she was only verbally designated as OIC. She explained that she readily obeyed Judge Madronio’s orders since nobody was willing to take on the responsibilities of the OIC. She also made requests that her designation as OIC be formalized but the same were ignored by Judge Madronio.<br><br>Further, Ms. Castillo also failed to include the SPA or authorization letter, or to indicate in several acknowledgement receipts (during her tenure as an accountable officer) the date the refund was made, thus precluding anyone from determining if a collection, deposited to and withdrawn from the Fiduciary Fund Account, was promptly returned to the recipient. She explained that the inadvertent omissions were caused by a heavy workload.<br><br>Lastly, she failed to attend to the disbursement vouchers, with a list of estimated expenses pertaining to the service of court processes within the period of January 16, 2006 to March 19, 2007, presented to her by Mr. Diego C. Iglesias. Mr. Iglesias admitted to have received P1,500.00 of the P4,400.00 being claimed in 15 disbursement vouchers. Ms. Castillo explained that she could not attend to these because they were not yet signed by the Presiding Judge, but she gave cash advances anyway (contrary to the audit rules). She gave cash advances to Mr. Iglesias for travel expenses in serving court processes. Ms. Castillo claimed that she had refunded unused deposits to the plaintiffs/petitioners, and requested for time to produce the corresponding acknowledgment receipt for each refund.<br><br>The financial audit team also discovered an unremitted interest of P1,518.69, earned on the Fiduciary Fund Account deposits (with the Land Bank of the Philippines) for the period of July to September 2007. Mr. Romulo L. Visperas, Jr., the court’s incumbent OIC, stated that this amount was remitted to the Judiciary Development Fund Account on December 27, 2007.<br><br>In view of these findings and considering the Office of the Court Administrator recommendations, the Court resolves to:<br><br><ol><li><b><u>DIRECT</u></b> the present Report of the Office of the Court Administrator to be <b><u>DOCKETED</u></b> as a regular administrative complaint against Ms. Liza P.

Additionally, she expressed regrets for her failure to exercise the highest degree of diligence, efficiency, care and integrity in the custody of court collections. She averred that she persevered in her work although her salaries had been withheld. She pledged that she would not commit the same mistakes again and would be more careful in the performance of her duties. She pleaded that she be given the chance to continue serving in the Judiciary. In a different vein, she also alleged that there were several instances in the past when Judge Aniceto Madronio, Sr. would verbally order her to secure advances from court collections of cashbonds ordered released to the bondsmen.<br><br>Castillo also informed the Court that she had been asking the OCA’s Fiscal Management Office <i>(FMO)</i> for the computation of her withheld salaries, ADCOM and PERA and the money value of her leave credits6 to determine how much she still had to raise to cover her accountabilities, but the FMO had not finished the computation yet; thus, she could not then deposit the remaining balance of her shortages. For this reason, she asked (by letter dated September 3, 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>) for an extension of the period (which expired on September 5, 2010) given to her to settle her shortages until her withheld salaries, other benefits, leave credits and loan could be completely determined.<br><br>In a Resolution dated November 22, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court referred Castillo’s comment and letter to the OCA, and directed it to submit its recommendation on the case. On July 20, 2011, the OCA submitted a memorandum-report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> based substantially on the audit team’s report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and on the subsequent developments on the case. It decried Castillo’s “delaying tactics” in settling her accountabilities.

Her transgressions as Clerk of Court II of the MCTC, San Fabian- San Jacinto, Pangasinan have been graver and have resulted in larger shortages in court collections than those of Clerk of Court II Victorio A. Dion, her predecessor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Dion</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court dismissed Victorio Dion based on the same charges lodged against Castillo, but for a court collection shortage amounting to P30,000.00 only or 5% of Castillo’s accountability of P597,155.10. As the OCA noted, Dion tried to refute the evidence presented against him, but in the end, he admitted his misdeed; he later settled his accountability, but was nevertheless dismissed from the service by the Court.<br><br>Castillo deserves no less than the sanction meted on Dion. She readily admitted the large amounts of shortages she incurred in the court collections but failed to explain these shortages. Although she ultimately settled her accountabilities through her salaries, allowances and part of the monetary value of her leave credits, restitution of the deficit cannot erase the serious breach she committed in the handling of court funds, to the grave prejudice of the Court and the Judiciary as a whole.<br><br>Castillo miserably failed to carry out the responsibilities of her office. As we stressed in <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Dureza-Aldevera</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the clerk of court is primarily accountable for all funds collected for the Court, whether personally received by him or by a duly appointed cashier under his supervision and control. As the custodian of court funds, revenues, records, properties and premises, he is liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of these funds and properties, and may be dismissed from the service for violation of this duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> For her serious breach of duty as clerk of court, Castillo should be removed from office.<br><br>Under Section 58(a), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, the penalty of dismissal shall carry with it the accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the government service, unless otherwise provided in the decision. By jurisprudence, the Court has additionally imposed the forfeiture of all other benefits, except accrued leave credits, of an erring court employee who has failed to meet the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the discharge of his/her judicial office in the management of court funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>With these considerations and in view of the enormity of Castillo’s infidelity in the collection of court funds, we deem it appropriate to order the forfeiture of Castillo’s retirement benefits and all other benefits due her, except accrued leave credits. To clarify, she is entitled to be paid the salaries and allowances she has earned up to the time of her dismissal, save only for what may be needed to cover her confirmed deficiencies for her accounts with the Court.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, Clerk of Court II Liza P. Castillo is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED </span>from the service, effective from the date of finality of this decision, for gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct.
