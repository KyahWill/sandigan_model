The Field Investigation Report (Exh. “B”) state also that in the portion for acquisition, there is a hectare of Nipa and according to the Sanggunian Panlalawigan Provincial Ordinance No. 73-99, Sec. 10-Valuation of Perennial Trees, Plants and Other Improvements on Agricultural Land, the value of Nipa Improvement in a 5th class Municipality is P13,400.00 per hectare and summing all of the valuation on the above improvements, the Court hereby fixes the just compensation for the area of 35.9887 hectares subject for acquisition in the total value of P4,470,554.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC did not consider the petitioner’s P819,778.30 valuation because it was “unrealistically low,” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> based on a field investigation report made 11 years ago, compared to the report of the respondents’ representative on the current condition of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>With the denial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of its motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the petitioner elevated its case to the CA via a petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The CA Ruling<br></u></b></center><br>In its July 22, 2004 decision, the CA dismissed the petition for review for lack of merit, recognizing the jurisdiction and supposed expertise of the DARAB and the RTC, as a SAC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It found that the petitioner’s P819,778.30 valuation for 35.9887 hectares was unconscionably low<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and that the RTC’s P4,470,554.00 valuation substantially complied with the factors prescribed by Section 17 of RA 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>After the denial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of its motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the petitioner came to this Court.<br><br><center><b><u>The Petition</u></b><br></center><br>The petitioner argues that the RTC failed to use the formula provided by Section 17 of RA 6657 in fixing the land’s valuation at P4,470,554.00;

(2) the current value of the properties; (3) its nature, actual use, and income; (4) the sworn valuation by the owner; (5) the tax declarations; (6) the assessment made by government assessors; (7) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property; and (8) the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any.<br><br>Pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of RA 6657, the DAR translated these factors into the following basic formula in computing just compensation:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><blockquote>LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br>Where:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LV = Land Value<br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br>CS = Comparable Sales<br>MV = Market Value per Tax Declaration<br></div></blockquote><br>We have repeatedly stressed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> that these factors and formula are mandatory and <b>not mere guides</b> that the SAC may disregard. “While the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function vested in the RTC acting as a [SAC], the judge cannot abuse his discretion by not taking into full consideration the factors specifically identified by law and implementing rules. [SACs] are <b>not at liberty to disregard</b> the formula laid down [by the DAR], because unless an administrative order is declared invalid, courts have no option but to apply it. The [SAC] cannot ignore, without violating the agrarian law, the formula provided by the DAR for the determination of just compensation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In this case, we cannot accept the RTC’s P4,470,554.00 valuation for the respondents’ 35.9887-hectare agricultural land as it failed to comply with the mandated requirements of the law and applicable DAR regulation on the fixing of just compensation.<br><br>Instead of taking into account the condition of the subject land at the time of taking on December 5, 1997 when the title was transferred to the Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the RTC considered the respondents’ evidence on the condition of the subject land at the time of rendition of the judgment, as well the updated schedule of fair market value of real properties in the Province of Sorsogon (<i>Sanggunian Panlalawigan</i> Resolution No. 73-99). The RTC made use of no computation or formula to arrive at the P4,470,554.00 figure. In fact, it simply enumerated the respondents’ evidence and plucked out of thin air the amount of P4,470,554.00.<br><br>In the same vein, we cannot accept the petitioner’s P819,778.30 valuation since it was based on the condition of the subject land at the time of the field investigation in 1992, not at the time of the taking of the subject land in 1997. Besides, the petitioner offered no testimony to show how the P819,778.30 figure was arrived at; its witness merely stated that the P819,778.30 valuation was based on DAR AO No. 11, series of 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In the absence of sufficient evidence for the determination of just compensation, we are constrained to remand the present case to the SAC for the determination of just compensation, in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO No. 02-09 dated October 15, 2009, the latest DAR issuance on fixing just compensation.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is<b> GRANTED</b>.
