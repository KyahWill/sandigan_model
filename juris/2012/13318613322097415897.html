				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The public outrage over the death of Leonardo "Lenny" Villa - the victim in this case - on 10 February 1991 led to a very strong clamor to put an end to hazing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Due in large part to the brave efforts of his mother, petitioner Gerarda Villa, groups were organized, condemning his senseless and tragic death. This widespread condemnation prompted Congress to enact a special law, which became effective in 1995, that would criminalize hazing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The intent of the law was to discourage members from making hazing a requirement for joining their sorority, fraternity, organization, or association.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Moreover, the law was meant to counteract the exculpatory implications of "consent" and "initial innocent act" in the conduct of initiation rites by making the mere act of hazing punishable or <i>mala prohibita</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Sadly, the Lenny Villa tragedy did not discourage hazing activities in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Within a year of his death, six more cases of hazing-related deaths emerged - those of Frederick Cahiyang of the University of Visayas in Cebu; Raul Camaligan of San Beda College; Felipe Narne of Pamantasan ng Araullo in Cabanatuan City; Dennis Cenedoza of the Cavite Naval Training Center; Joselito Mangga of the Philippine Merchant Marine Institute; and Joselito Hernandez of the University of the Philippines in Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Although courts must not remain indifferent to public sentiments, in this case the general condemnation of a hazing-related death, they are still bound to observe a fundamental principle in our criminal justice system - "[N]o act constitutes a crime... unless it is made so by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege</i>. Even if an act is viewed by a large section of the populace as immoral or injurious, it cannot be considered a crime, absent any law prohibiting its commission. As interpreters of the law, judges are called upon to set aside emotion, to resist being swayed by strong public sentiments, and to rule strictly based on the elements of the offense and the facts allowed in evidence.<br><br>Before the Court are the consolidated cases docketed as G.R. No. 151258 (<i>Villareal v. People</i>), G.R. No. 154954 (<i>People v. Court of Appeals</i>), G.R. No. 155101 (<i>Dizon v. People</i>), and G.R. Nos. 178057 and 178080 (<i>Villa v. Escalona</i>).<br><br><center><b>Facts</b></center><br>The pertinent facts, as determined by the Court of Appeals (CA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> are as follows:<br><br>In February 1991, seven freshmen law students of the Ateneo de Manila University School of Law signified their intention to join the Aquila Legis Juris Fraternity (Aquila Fraternity). They were Caesar "Bogs" Asuncion, Samuel "Sam" Belleza, Bienvenido "Bien" Marquez III, Roberto Francis "Bert" Navera, Geronimo "Randy" Recinto, Felix Sy, Jr., and Leonardo "Lenny" Villa (neophytes).<br><br>On the night of 8 February 1991, the neophytes were met by some members of the Aquila Fraternity (Aquilans) at the lobby of the Ateneo Law School. They all proceeded to Rufo's Restaurant to have dinner. Afterwards, they went to the house of Michael Musngi, also an Aquilan, who briefed the neophytes on what to expect during the initiation rites. The latter were informed that there would be physical beatings, and that they could quit at any time. Their initiation rites were scheduled to last for three days. After their "briefing," they were brought to the Almeda Compound in Caloocan City for the commencement of their initiation.<br><br>Even before the neophytes got off the van, they had already received threats and insults from the Aquilans. As soon as the neophytes alighted from the van and walked towards the <i>pelota</i> court of the Almeda compound, some of the Aquilans delivered physical blows to them. The neophytes were then subjected to traditional forms of Aquilan "initiation rites." These rites included the "Indian Run," which required the neophytes to run a gauntlet of two parallel rows of Aquilans, each row delivering blows to the neophytes; the "Bicol Express," which obliged the neophytes to sit on the floor with their backs against the wall and their legs outstretched while the Aquilans walked, jumped, or ran over their legs; the "Rounds," in which the neophytes were held at the back of their pants by the "auxiliaries" (the Aquilans charged with the duty of lending assistance to neophytes during initiation rites), while the latter were being hit with fist blows on their arms or with knee blows on their thighs by two Aquilans; and the "Auxies' Privilege Round," in which the auxiliaries were given the opportunity to inflict physical pain on the neophytes. During this time, the neophytes were also indoctrinated with the fraternity principles. They survived their first day of initiation.<br><br>On the morning of their second day - 9 February 1991 - the neophytes were made to present comic plays and to play rough basketball. They were also required to memorize and recite the Aquila Fraternity's principles. Whenever they would give a wrong answer, they would be hit on their arms or legs. Late in the afternoon, the Aquilans revived the initiation rites proper and proceeded to torment them physically and psychologically. The neophytes were subjected to the same manner of hazing that they endured on the first day of initiation. After a few hours, the initiation for the day officially ended.<br><br>After a while, accused non-resident or alumni fraternity members<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Fidelito Dizon (Dizon) and Artemio Villareal (Villareal) demanded that the rites be reopened. The head of initiation rites, Nelson Victorino (Victorino), initially refused. Upon the insistence of Dizon and Villareal, however, he reopened the initiation rites. The fraternity members, including Dizon and Villareal, then subjected the neophytes to "paddling" and to additional rounds of physical pain. Lenny received several paddle blows, one of which was so strong it sent him sprawling to the ground. The neophytes heard him complaining of intense pain and difficulty in breathing. After their last session of physical beatings, Lenny could no longer walk. He had to be carried by the auxiliaries to the carport. Again, the initiation for the day was officially ended, and the neophytes started eating dinner. They then slept at the carport.<br><br>After an hour of sleep, the neophytes were suddenly roused by Lenny's shivering and incoherent mumblings. Initially, Villareal and Dizon dismissed these rumblings, as they thought he was just overacting. When they realized, though, that Lenny was really feeling cold, some of the Aquilans started helping him. They removed his clothes and helped him through a sleeping bag to keep him warm. When his condition worsened, the Aquilans rushed him to the hospital. Lenny was pronounced dead on arrival.<br><br>Consequently, a criminal case for homicide was filed against the following 35 Aquilans:<br><br><blockquote>In Criminal Case No. C-38340(91)<br><ol><li>Fidelito Dizon (Dizon)</li><li>Artemio Villareal (Villareal)</li><li>Efren de Leon (De Leon)</li><li>Vincent Tecson (Tecson)</li><li>Junel Anthony Ama (Ama)</li><li>Antonio Mariano Almeda (Almeda)</li><li>Renato Bantug, Jr. (Bantug)</li><li>Nelson Victorino (Victorino)</li><li>Eulogio Sabban (Sabban)</li><li>Joseph Lledo (Lledo)</li><li>Etienne Guerrero (Guerrero)</li><li>Michael Musngi (Musngi)</li><li>Jonas Karl Perez (Perez)</li><li>Paul Angelo Santos (Santos)</li><li>Ronan de Guzman (De Guzman)</li><li>Antonio General (General)</li><li>Jaime Maria Flores II (Flores)</li><li>Dalmacio Lim, Jr. (Lim)</li><li>Ernesto Jose Montecillo (Montecillo)</li><li>Santiago Ranada III (Ranada)</li><li>Zosimo Mendoza (Mendoza)</li><li>Vicente Verdadero (Verdadero)</li><li>Amante Purisima II (Purisima)</li><li>Jude Fernandez (J.

SP Nos. 89060 &amp; 90153<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> reversed the trial court's Orders and dismissed the criminal case against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano on the basis of violation of their right to speedy trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>From the aforementioned Decisions, the five (5) consolidated Petitions were individually brought before this Court.<br><br><b>G.R. No. 151258 - <i>Villareal v. People</i></b><br><br>The instant case refers to accused Villareal's Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45. The Petition raises two reversible errors allegedly committed by the CA in its Decision dated 10 January 2002 in CA-G.R. No. 15520 - first, denial of due process; and, second, conviction absent proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>While the Petition was pending before this Court, counsel for petitioner Villareal filed a Notice of Death of Party on 10 August 2011. According to the Notice, petitioner Villareal died on 13 March 2011. Counsel thus asserts that the subject matter of the Petition previously filed by petitioner does not survive the death of the accused.<br><br><b>G.R. No. 155101 - <i>Dizon v. People</i></b><br><br>Accused Dizon filed a Rule 45 Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, questioning the CA's Decision dated 10 January 2002 and Resolution dated 30 August 2002 in CA-G.R. No. 15520.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Petitioner sets forth two main issues - first, that he was denied due process when the CA sustained the trial court's forfeiture of his right to present evidence; and, second, that he was deprived of due process when the CA did not apply to him the same "<i>ratio decidendi</i> that served as basis of acquittal of the other accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>As regards the first issue, the trial court made a ruling, which forfeited Dizon's right to present evidence during trial. The trial court expected Dizon to present evidence on an earlier date since a co-accused, Antonio General, no longer presented separate evidence during trial. According to Dizon, his right should not have been considered as waived because he was justified in asking for a postponement. He argues that he did not ask for a resetting of any of the hearing dates and in fact insisted that he was ready to present evidence on the original pre-assigned schedule, and not on an earlier hearing date.<br><br>Regarding the second issue, petitioner contends that he should have likewise been acquitted, like the other accused, since his acts were also part of the traditional initiation rites and were not tainted by evil motives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He claims that the additional paddling session was part of the official activity of the fraternity. He also points out that one of the neophytes admitted that the chairperson of the initiation rites "decided that [Lenny] was fit enough to undergo the initiation so Mr. Villareal proceeded to do the paddling...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Further, petitioner echoes the argument of the Solicitor General that "the individual blows inflicted by Dizon and Villareal could not have resulted in Lenny's death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Solicitor General purportedly averred that, "on the contrary, Dr. Arizala testified that the injuries suffered by Lenny could not be considered fatal if taken individually, but if taken collectively, the result is the violent death of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner then counters the finding of the CA that he was motivated by ill will. He claims that Lenny's father could not have stolen the parking space of Dizon's father, since the latter did not have a car, and their fathers did not work in the same place or office. Revenge for the loss of the parking space was the alleged ill motive of Dizon. According to petitioner, his utterances regarding a stolen parking space were only part of the "psychological initiation." He then cites the testimony of Lenny's co-neophyte - witness Marquez - who admitted knowing "it was not true and that he was just making it up...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Further, petitioner argues that his alleged motivation of ill will was negated by his show of concern for Villa after the initiation rites. Dizon alludes to the testimony of one of the neophytes, who mentioned that the former had kicked the leg of the neophyte and told him to switch places with Lenny to prevent the latter's chills. When the chills did not stop, Dizon, together with Victorino, helped Lenny through a sleeping bag and made him sit on a chair. According to petitioner, his alleged ill motivation is contradicted by his manifestation of compassion and concern for the victim's well-being.<br><br><b>G.R. No. 154954 - <i>People v. Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>This Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 seeks the reversal of the CA's Decision dated 10 January 2002 and Resolution dated 30 August 2002 in CA-G.R. No. 15520, insofar as it acquitted 19 (Victorino <i>et al.</i>) and convicted 4 (Tecson <i>et al.</i>) of the accused Aquilans of the lesser crime of slight physical injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> According to the Solicitor General, the CA erred in holding that there could have been no conspiracy to commit hazing, as hazing or fraternity initiation had not yet been criminalized at the time Lenny died.<br><br>In the alternative, petitioner claims that the ruling of the trial court should have been upheld, inasmuch as it found that there was conspiracy to inflict physical injuries on Lenny. Since the injuries led to the victim's death, petitioner posits that the accused Aquilans are criminally liable for the resulting crime of homicide, pursuant to Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The said article provides: "Criminal liability shall be incurred... [b]y any person committing a felony (<i>delito</i>) although the wrongful act done be different from that which he intended."<br><br>Petitioner also argues that the rule on double jeopardy is inapplicable. According to the Solicitor General, the CA acted with grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, in setting aside the trial court's finding of conspiracy and in ruling that the criminal liability of <br> all the accused must be based on their individual participation in the commission of the crime.<br><br><b>G.R. Nos. 178057 and 178080 - <i>Villa v. Escalona</i></b><br><br>Petitioner Villa filed the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, praying for the reversal of the CA's Decision dated 25 October 2006 and Resolution dated 17 May 2007 in CA-G.R. S.P. Nos. 89060 and 90153.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The Petition involves the dismissal of the criminal charge filed against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano.<br><br>Due to "several pending incidents," the trial court ordered a separate trial for accused Escalona, Saruca, Adriano, Ramos, Ampil, Concepcion, De Vera, S. Fernandez, and Cabangon (Criminal Case No. C-38340) to commence after proceedings against the 26 other accused in Criminal Case No. C-38340(91) shall have terminated. On 8 November 1993, the trial court found the 26 accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt. As a result, the proceedings in Criminal Case No. C-38340 involving the nine other co-accused recommenced on 29 November 1993. For "various reasons," the initial trial of the case did not commence until 28 March 2005, or almost 12 years after the arraignment of the nine accused.<br><br>Petitioner Villa assails the CA's dismissal of the criminal case involving 4 of the 9 accused, namely, Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano. She argues that the accused failed to assert their right to speedy trial within a reasonable period of time. She also points out that the prosecution cannot be faulted for the delay, as the original records and the required evidence were not at its disposal, but were still in the appellate court.<br><br>We resolve herein the various issues that we group into five.<br><br><center><b>ISSUES</b><br></center><br><ol><li>Whether the forfeiture of petitioner Dizon's right to present evidence constitutes denial of due process;<br><br></li><li>Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it dismissed the case against Escalona, Ramos, Saruca, and Adriano for violation of the right of the accused to speedy trial;<br><br></li><li>Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, when it set aside the finding of conspiracy by the trial court and adjudicated the liability of each accused according to individual participation;<br><br></li><li>Whether accused Dizon is guilty of homicide; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion when it pronounced Tecson, Ama, Almeda, and Bantug guilty only of slight physical injuries.</li></ol><br><center><b>DISCUSSION</b><br></center><br><center><u><b>Resolution on Preliminary Matters</b></u></center><br><br><b>G.R. No. 151258 - <i>Villareal v. People</i></b><br><br>In a Notice dated 26 September 2011 and while the Petition was pending resolution, this Court took note of counsel for petitioner's Notice of Death of Party.<br><br>According to Article 89(1) of the Revised Penal Code, criminal liability for personal penalties is totally extinguished by the death of the convict. In contrast, criminal liability for pecuniary penalties is extinguished if the offender dies prior to final judgment. The term "personal penalties" refers to the service of personal or imprisonment penalties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> while the term "pecuniary penalties" (<i>las pecuniarias</i>) refers to fines and costs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> including civil liability predicated on the criminal offense complained of (<i>i.e.</i>, civil liability <i>ex delicto</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> However, civil liability based on a source of obligation other than the <i>delict</i> survives the death of the accused and is recoverable through a separate civil action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Thus, we hold that the death of petitioner Villareal extinguished his criminal liability for both personal and pecuniary penalties, including his civil liability directly arising from the <i>delict</i> complained of. Consequently, his Petition is hereby dismissed, and the criminal case against him deemed closed and terminated.<br><br><b>G.R. No. 155101 (<i>Dizon v. People</i>)</b><br><br>In an Order dated 28 July 1993, the trial court set the dates for the reception of evidence for accused-petitioner Dizon on the 8<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, and 22<sup>nd</sup> of September; and the 5<sup>th</sup> and 12 of October 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Order likewise stated that "it will not entertain any postponement and that all the accused who have not yet presented their respective evidence should be ready at all times down the line, with their evidence on all said dates. Failure on their part to present evidence when required shall therefore be construed as waiver to present evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>However, on 19 August 1993, counsel for another accused manifested in open court that his client - Antonio General - would no longer present separate evidence. Instead, the counsel would adopt the testimonial evidence of the other accused who had already testified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Because of this development and pursuant to the trial court's Order that the parties "should be ready at all times down the line," the trial court expected Dizon to present evidence on the next trial date - 25 August 1993 - instead of his originally assigned dates. The original dates were supposed to start two weeks later, or on 8 September 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Counsel for accused Dizon was not able to present evidence on the accelerated date. To address the situation, counsel filed a <i>Constancia </i>on 25 August 1993, alleging that he had to appear in a previously scheduled case, and that he would be ready to present evidence on the dates originally assigned to his clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The trial court denied the Manifestation on the same date and treated the <i>Constancia</i> as a motion for postponement, in violation of the three-day-notice rule under the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Consequently, the trial court ruled that the failure of Dizon to present evidence amounted to a waiver of that right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Accused-petitioner Dizon thus argues that he was deprived of due process of law when the trial court forfeited his right to present evidence. According to him, the postponement of the 25 August 1993 hearing should have been considered justified, since his original pre-assigned trial dates were not supposed to start until 8 September 1993, when he was scheduled to present evidence. He posits that he was ready to present evidence on the dates assigned to him. He also points out that he did not ask for a resetting of any of the said hearing dates; that he in fact insisted on being allowed to present evidence on the dates fixed by the trial court. Thus, he contends that the trial court erred in accelerating the schedule of presentation of evidence, thereby invalidating the finding of his guilt.<br><br>The right of the accused to present evidence is guaranteed by no less than the Constitution itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Article III, Section 14(2) thereof, provides that "<b>in all criminal prosecutions, the accused</b> ... <b>shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and counsel</b>..." This constitutional right includes the right to present evidence in one's defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as well as the right to be present and defend oneself in person at every stage of the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In <i>Crisostomo v.

The 21 June 1995 hearing was cancelled due to "lack of quorum in the regular membership" of the Sandiganbayan's Second Division and upon the agreement of the parties. The hearing was reset for the next day, 22 June 1995, but Crisostomo and his counsel failed to attend. The Sandiganbayan, on the very same day, issued an Order directing the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of Crisostomo and the confiscation of his surety bond. The Order further declared that he had waived his right to present evidence because of his nonappearance at "yesterday's and today's scheduled hearings." In ruling against the Order, we held thus:<br><br><blockquote>Under Section 2(c), Rule 114 and Section 1(c), Rule 115 of the Rules of Court, <b>Crisostomo's non-appearance during the 22 June 1995 trial was merely a waiver of his right to be present for trial on such date only and not for the succeeding trial dates</b>...<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></center><br>Moreover, Crisostomo's <b>absence</b> on the 22 June 1995 hearing <b>should not have been deemed as a waiver of his right to present evidence</b>. While constitutional rights may be waived, such <b>waiver must be clear and must be coupled with an actual intention to relinquish the right</b>. Crisostomo did not voluntarily waive in person or even through his counsel the right to present evidence. The Sandiganbayan imposed the waiver due to the agreement of the prosecution, Calingayan, and Calingayan's counsel.<br><br>In criminal cases where the imposable penalty may be death, as in the present case, the <b>court is called upon to see to it that the accused is personally made aware of the consequences of a waiver of the right to present evidence</b>. In fact, it is <b>not enough that the accused is simply warned of the consequences of another failure to attend the succeeding hearings</b>. The court must first explain to the accused personally in clear terms the exact nature and consequences of a waiver. Crisostomo was not even forewarned. The Sandiganbayan simply went ahead to deprive Crisostomo of his right to present evidence without even allowing Crisostomo to explain his absence on the 22 June 1995 hearing.<br><br>Clearly, the <b>waiver of the right to present evidence in a criminal case involving a grave penalty is not assumed and taken lightly</b>.

On the contrary, it should have considered the excuse of counsel justified, especially since counsel for another accused - General - had made a last-minute adoption of testimonial evidence that freed up the succeeding trial dates; and since Dizon was not scheduled to testify until two weeks later. At any rate, the trial court pre-assigned five hearing dates for the reception of evidence. If it really wanted to impose its Order strictly, the most it could have done was to forfeit one out of the five days set for Dizon's testimonial evidence. Stripping the accused of all his pre-assigned trial dates constitutes a patent denial of the constitutionally guaranteed right to due process.<br><br>Nevertheless, as in the case of an improvident guilty plea, an invalid waiver of the right to present evidence and be heard does not <i>per se</i> work to vacate a finding of guilt in the criminal case or to enforce an automatic remand of the case to the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In <i>People v.

Instead, what he is really contesting in his Petition is the application of the law to the facts by the trial court and the CA. Petitioner Dizon admits direct participation in the hazing of Lenny Villa by alleging in his Petition that "all actions of the petitioner were part of the traditional rites," and that "the alleged extension of the initiation rites was not outside the official activity of the fraternity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> He even argues that "Dizon did not request for the extension and he participated only after the activity was sanctioned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>For one reason or another, the case has been passed or turned over from one judge or justice to another - at the trial court, at the CA, and even at the Supreme Court.

However, <b>by reason of the death of the victim</b>, there can be <b>no precise means to determine the duration of the incapacity or the medical attendance required</b>. To do so, at this stage would be merely speculative. In a prosecution for this crime where the category of the offense and the severity of the penalty depend on the period of illness or incapacity for labor, the length of this period must likewise be proved beyond reasonable doubt in much the same manner as the same act charged [People v. Codilla, CA-G.R. No. 4079-R, June 26, 1950]. And <b>when proof of the said period is absent, the crime committed should be deemed only as slight physical injuries</b> [People v. De los Santos, CA, 59 O.G. 4393, citing People v. Penesa, 81 Phil. 398].

According to the CA, because of "the death of the victim, there can be no precise means to determine the duration of the incapacity or medical attendance required."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The reliance on <i>Penesa</i> was utterly misplaced. A review of that case would reveal that the accused therein was guilty merely of slight physical injuries, because the victim's injuries neither caused incapacity for labor nor required medical attendance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Furthermore, he did not die.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> His injuries were not even serious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Since <i>Penesa</i> involved a case in which the victim allegedly suffered physical injuries and not death, the ruling cited by the CA was patently inapplicable.<br><br>On the contrary, the CA's ultimate conclusion that Tecson, Ama, Almeda, and Bantug were liable merely for slight physical injuries grossly contradicts its own findings of fact. According to the court, the four accused "were found to have <b>inflicted more than the usual punishment</b> undertaken during such initiation rites on the person of Villa."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> It then adopted the NBI medico-legal officer's findings that the antecedent cause of Lenny Villa's death was the "multiple traumatic injuries" he suffered from the initiation rites.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Considering that the CA found that the "<b>physical punishment heaped on</b> <b>[Lenny Villa was] serious in nature</b>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> it was patently erroneous for the court to limit the criminal liability to slight physical injuries, which is a light felony.<br><br>Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code dictates that the perpetrator shall be liable for the consequences of an act, even if its result is different from that intended. Thus, once a person is found to have committed an initial felonious act, such as the unlawful infliction of physical injuries that results in the death of the victim, courts are required to automatically apply the legal framework governing the destruction of life. This rule is mandatory, and not subject to discretion.<br><br>The CA's application of the legal framework governing physical injuries - punished under Articles 262 to 266 for intentional felonies and Article 365 for culpable felonies - is therefore tantamount to a whimsical, capricious, and abusive exercise of judgment amounting to lack of jurisdiction. According to the Revised Penal Code, the mandatory and legally imposable penalty in case the victim dies should be based on the framework governing the destruction of the life of a person, punished under Articles 246 to 261 for intentional felonies and Article 365 for culpable felonies, and not under the aforementioned provisions. We emphasize that these two types of felonies are distinct from and legally inconsistent with each other, in that the accused cannot be held criminally liable for physical injuries when actual death occurs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>Attributing criminal liability solely to Villareal and Dizon - as if only their acts, in and of themselves, caused the death of Lenny Villa - is contrary to the CA's own findings. From proof that the death of the victim was the cumulative effect of the multiple injuries he suffered,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>&nbsp; the only logical conclusion is that criminal responsibility should redound to all those who have been proven to have directly participated in the infliction of physical injuries on Lenny. The accumulation of bruising on his body caused him to suffer cardiac arrest. Accordingly, we find that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in finding Tecson, Ama, Almeda, and Bantug criminally liable for slight physical injuries. As an allowable exception to the rule on double jeopardy, we therefore give due course to the Petition in G.R. No. 154954.<br><br><center><u><b>Resolution on Ultimate Findings</b></u><br></center><br>According to the trial court, although hazing was not (at the time) punishable as a crime, the intentional infliction of physical injuries on Villa was nonetheless a felonious act under Articles 263 to 266 of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, in ruling against the accused, the court <i>a quo</i> found that pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code, the accused fraternity members were guilty of homicide, as it was the direct, natural and logical consequence of the physical injuries they had intentionally inflicted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>The CA modified the trial court's finding of criminal liability. It ruled that there could have been no conspiracy since the neophytes, including Lenny Villa, had knowingly consented to the conduct of hazing during their initiation rites. The accused fraternity members, therefore, were liable only for the consequences of their individual acts. Accordingly, 19 of the accused - Victorino <i>et al.</i> - were acquitted; 4 of them - Tecson <i>et al.</i> - were found guilty of slight physical injuries; and the remaining 2 - Dizon and Villareal - were found guilty of homicide.<br><br>The issue at hand does not concern a typical criminal case wherein the perpetrator clearly commits a felony in order to take revenge upon, to gain advantage over, to harm maliciously, or to get even with, the victim. Rather, the case involves an <i>ex ante</i> situation in which a man - driven by his own desire to join a society of men - pledged to go through physically and psychologically strenuous admission rituals, just so he could enter the fraternity. Thus, in order to understand how our criminal laws apply to such situation absent the Anti-Hazing Law, we deem it necessary to make a brief exposition on the underlying concepts shaping intentional felonies, as well as on the nature of physical and psychological initiations widely known as hazing.<br><br><b>Intentional Felony and Conspiracy</b><br><br>Our Revised Penal Code belongs to the classical school of thought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> The classical theory posits that a human person is essentially a moral creature with an absolute free will to choose between good and evil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> It asserts that one should only be adjudged or held accountable for wrongful acts so long as free will appears unimpaired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> The basic postulate of the classical penal system is that humans are rational and calculating beings who guide their actions with reference to the principles of pleasure and pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> They refrain from criminal acts if threatened with punishment sufficient to cancel the hope of possible gain or advantage in committing the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Here, criminal liability is thus based on the free will and moral blame of the actor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup>&nbsp; The identity of <i>mens rea</i> - defined as a guilty mind, a guilty or wrongful purpose or criminal intent - is the predominant consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> Thus, it is not enough to do what the law prohibits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> In order for an intentional felony to exist, it is necessary that the act be committed by means of <i>dolo</i> or "malice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>The term "<i>dolo</i>" or "malice" is a complex idea involving the elements of <i>freedom</i>, <i>intelligence</i>, and <i>intent</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> The first element, <i>freedom</i>, refers to an act done with deliberation and with power to choose between two things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> The second element, <i>intelligence</i>, concerns the ability to determine the morality of human acts, as well as the capacity to distinguish between a licit and an illicit act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> The last element, <i>intent</i>, involves an aim or a determination to do a certain act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>The element of <i>intent</i> - on which this Court shall focus - is described as the state of mind accompanying an act, especially a forbidden act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> It refers to the purpose of the mind and the resolve with which a person proceeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> It does not refer to mere <i>will</i>, for the latter pertains to the act, while <i>intent</i> concerns the result of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> While motive is the "moving power" that impels one to action for a definite result, intent is the "purpose" of using a particular means to produce the result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> On the other hand, the term "felonious" means, <i>inter alia</i>, malicious, villainous, and/or proceeding from an evil heart or purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> With these elements taken together, the requirement of intent in intentional felony must refer to malicious intent, which is a vicious and malevolent state of mind accompanying a forbidden act.

The phrase "coming to an agreement" connotes the existence of a prefaced "intent" to cause injury to another, an element present only in intentional felonies.&nbsp; In culpable felonies or criminal negligence, the injury inflicted on another is unintentional, the wrong done being simply the result of an act performed without malice or criminal design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Here, a person performs an initial lawful deed;

Such inaccuracy cannot be tolerated, especially because it was the CA's primary basis for finding that Villarreal had the intent to kill Lenny Villa, thereby making Villareal guilty of the intentional felony of homicide. To repeat, according to Bienvenido Marquez's testimony, as reproduced above, it was Dizon who uttered both "accusations" against Villa and Marquez; Villareal had no participation whatsoever in the specific threats referred to by the CA. It was "<u>Boyet Dizon</u> [who] stepped on [Marquez's] thigh"; and who told witness Marquez, "<i>[I]to, yung pamilya nito ay pinapatay yung kapatid ko</i>." It was also Dizon who jumped on Villa's thighs while saying, "[T]his guy, his father stole the parking space of my father." With the testimony clarified, we find that the CA had no basis for concluding the existence of intent to kill based solely thereon. <b> </b><br><br>As to the existence of <i>animus interficendi</i> on the part of Dizon, we refer to the entire factual milieu and contextual premise of the incident to fully appreciate and understand the testimony of witness Marquez. At the outset, the neophytes were briefed that they would be subjected to psychological pressure in order to scare them. They knew that they would be mocked, ridiculed, and intimidated. They heard fraternity members shout, "<i>Patay ka</i>, Recinto," "<i>Yari ka</i>, Recinto," "Villa, <i>akin ka</i>," "Asuncion, <i>gulpi ka</i>," "<i>Putang ina mo</i>, Asuncion," "<i>Putang ina nyo, patay kayo sa amin</i>," or some other words to that effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> While beating the neophytes, Dizon accused Marquez of the death of the former's purported NPA brother, and then blamed Lenny Villa's father for stealing the parking space of Dizon's father. According to the Solicitor General, these statements, including those of the accused Dizon, were all part of the psychological initiation employed by the Aquila Fraternity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup><br><br>Thus, to our understanding, accused Dizon's way of inflicting psychological pressure was through hurling make-believe accusations at the initiates. He concocted the fictitious stories, so that he could "justify" giving the neophytes harder blows, all in the context of fraternity initiation and role playing. Even one of the neophytes admitted that the accusations were untrue and made-up.<br><br>The infliction of psychological pressure is not unusual in the conduct of hazing. In fact, during the Senate deliberations on the then proposed Anti-Hazing Law, former Senator Lina spoke as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Senator Lina. -- so as to capture the intent that we conveyed during the period of interpellations on why we included the phrase "or psychological pain and suffering."<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></center><br>So that if no direct physical harm is inflicted upon the neophyte or the recruit but the <b>recruit or neophyte is made to undergo certain acts</b> which I already described yesterday, like playing the Russian roulette extensively <b>to test the readiness and the willingness of the neophyte or recruit to continue his desire to be a member of the fraternity, sorority or similar organization</b> or playing and putting a noose on the neck of the neophyte or recruit, making the recruit or neophyte stand on the ledge of the fourth floor of the building facing outside, asking him to jump outside after making him turn around several times but the reality is that he will be made to jump towards the inside portion of the building - these are the <b>mental or psychological tests that are resorted to by these organizations, sororities or fraternities</b>. The doctors who appeared during the public hearing testified that such acts can result in some mental aberration, that they can even lead to psychosis, neurosis or insanity. This is what we want to prevent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, without proof beyond reasonable doubt, Dizon's behavior must not be automatically viewed as evidence of a genuine, evil motivation to kill Lenny Villa. Rather, it must be taken within the context of the fraternity's psychological initiation. This Court points out that it was not even established whether the fathers of Dizon and Villa really had any familiarity with each other as would lend credence to the veracity of Dizon's threats. The testimony of Lenny's co-neophyte, Marquez, only confirmed this view. According to Marquez, he "knew it was not true and that [Dizon] was just making it up...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> Even the trial court did not give weight to the utterances of Dizon as constituting intent to kill: "[T]he cumulative acts of all the accused were not directed toward killing Villa, but merely to inflict physical harm as part of the fraternity initiation rites x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> The Solicitor General shares the same view.<br><br>Verily, we cannot sustain the CA in finding the accused Dizon guilty of homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code on the basis of the existence of intent to kill. <i>Animus interficendi</i> cannot and should not be inferred unless there is proof beyond reasonable doubt of such intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> Instead, <b>we adopt and reinstate the finding of the trial court in part, insofar as it ruled that none of the fraternity members had the specific intent to kill Lenny Villa</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup><br><br><b>The existence of <i>animus iniuriandi</i> or malicious intent <br>to injure not proven beyond reasonable doubt </b><br><br>The Solicitor General argues, instead, that there was an intent to inflict physical injuries on Lenny Villa.

As an act that is <i>mala in se</i>, the existence of malicious intent is fundamental, since injury arises from the mental state of the wrongdoer - <i>iniuria ex affectu facientis consistat</i>. If there is no criminal intent, the accused cannot be found guilty of an intentional felony. Thus, in case of physical injuries under the Revised Penal Code, there must be a specific<i> animus iniuriandi</i> or malicious intention to do wrong against the physical integrity or well-being of a person, so as to incapacitate and deprive the victim of certain bodily functions. Without proof beyond reasonable doubt of the required <i>animus iniuriandi</i>, the overt act of inflicting physical injuries <i>per se</i> merely satisfies the elements of freedom and intelligence in an intentional felony. The commission of the act does not, in itself, make a man guilty unless his intentions are.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup><br><br>Thus, we have ruled in a number of instances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> that the mere infliction of physical injuries, absent malicious intent, does not make a person automatically liable for an intentional felony. In <i>Bagajo v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> the accused teacher, using a bamboo stick, whipped one of her students behind her legs and thighs as a form of discipline. The student suffered lesions and bruises from the corporal punishment. In reversing the trial court's finding of criminal liability for slight physical injuries, this Court stated thus: "Independently of any civil or administrative responsibility ... [w]e are persuaded that she did not do what she had done with criminal intent ... the means she actually used was moderate and that she was not motivated by ill-will, hatred or any malevolent intent." Considering the applicable laws, we then ruled that "as a matter of law, petitioner did not incur any criminal liability for her act of whipping her pupil." In <i>People v. Carmen</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> the accused members of the religious group known as the Missionaries of Our Lady of Fatima - under the guise of a "ritual or treatment" - plunged the head of the victim into a barrel of water, banged his head against a bench, pounded his chest with fists, and stabbed him on the side with a kitchen knife, in order to cure him of "nervous breakdown" by expelling through those means the bad spirits possessing him. The collective acts of the group caused the death of the victim. Since malicious intent was not proven, we reversed the trial court's finding of liability for murder under Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code and instead ruled that the accused should be held criminally liable for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide under Article 365 thereof.<br><br>Indeed, the threshold question is whether the accused's initial acts of inflicting physical pain on the neophytes were attended by <i>animus iniuriandi</i> amounting to a felonious act punishable under the Revised Penal Code, thereby making it subject to Article 4(1) thereof.

The night before the commencement of the rites, they were briefed on what to expect. They were told that there would be physical beatings, that the whole event would last for three days, and that they could quit anytime. On their first night, they were subjected to "traditional" initiation rites, including the "Indian Run," "Bicol Express," "Rounds," and the "Auxies' Privilege Round." The beatings were predominantly directed at the neophytes' arms and legs.<br><br>In the morning of their second day of initiation, they were made to present comic plays and to play rough basketball. They were also required to memorize and recite the Aquila Fraternity's principles. Late in the afternoon, they were once again subjected to "traditional" initiation rituals. When the rituals were officially reopened on the insistence of Dizon and Villareal, the neophytes were subjected to another "traditional" ritual - paddling by the fraternity.<br><br>During the whole initiation rites, auxiliaries were assigned to the neophytes. The auxiliaries protected the neophytes by functioning as human barriers and shielding them from those who were designated to inflict physical and psychological pain on the initiates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> It was their regular duty to stop foul or excessive physical blows; to help the neophytes to "pump" their legs in order that their blood would circulate; to facilitate a rest interval after every physical activity or "round"; to serve food and water; to tell jokes; to coach the initiates; and to give them whatever they needed.<br><br>These rituals were performed with Lenny's consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> A few days before the "rites," he asked both his parents for permission to join the Aquila Fraternity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> His father knew that Lenny would go through an initiation process and would be gone for three days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> The CA found as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It is worth pointing out that the <b>neophytes willingly and voluntarily consented to undergo physical initiation and hazing</b>. As can be gleaned from the narration of facts, they voluntarily agreed to join the initiation rites to become members of the Aquila Legis Fraternity. Prior to the initiation, they were <b>given briefings on what to expect</b>. It is of common knowledge that before admission in a fraternity, the neophytes will undergo a rite of passage. Thus, they were <b>made aware that traditional methods such as mocking, psychological tests and physical punishment would take place</b>. They <b>knew that the initiation would involve beatings and other forms of hazing</b>. They were also <b>told of their right and opportunity to quit at any time they wanted to</b>. In fact, prosecution witness Navera testified that accused Tecson told him that "after a week, you can already play basketball." Prosecution witness <b>Marquez for his part, admitted that he knew that the initiates would be hit "in the arms and legs," that a wooden paddle would be used to hit them and that he expected bruises on his arms and legs</b>.... Indeed, <b>there can be no fraternity initiation without consenting neophytes</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Even after going through Aquila's grueling traditional rituals during the first day, Lenny continued his participation and finished the second day of initiation.<br><br>Based on the foregoing contextual background, and absent further proof showing clear malicious intent, we are constrained to rule that the specific <i>animus iniuriandi</i> was not present in this case. Even if the specific acts of punching, kicking, paddling, and other modes of inflicting physical pain were done voluntarily, freely, and with intelligence, thereby satisfying the elements of <i>freedom</i> and <i>intelligence</i> in the felony of physical injuries, the fundamental ingredient of criminal <i>intent</i> was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the contrary, all that was proven was that the acts were done pursuant to tradition. Although the additional "rounds" on the second night were held upon the insistence of Villareal and Dizon, the initiations were officially reopened with the consent of the head of the initiation rites; and the accused fraternity members still participated in the rituals, including the paddling, which were performed pursuant to tradition. Other than the paddle, no other "weapon" was used to inflict injuries on Lenny. The targeted body parts were predominantly the legs and the arms. The designation of roles, including the role of auxiliaries, which were assigned for the specific purpose of lending assistance to and taking care of the neophytes during the initiation rites, further belied the presence of malicious intent. All those who wished to join the fraternity went through the same process of "traditional" initiation; there is no proof that Lenny Villa was specifically targeted or given a different treatment. We stress that Congress itself recognized that hazing is uniquely different from common crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> The totality of the circumstances must therefore be taken into consideration.<br><br>The underlying context and motive in which the infliction of physical injuries was rooted may also be determined by Lenny's continued participation in the initiation and consent to the method used even after the first day. The following discussion of the framers of the 1995 Anti-Hazing Law is enlightening:<br><br><blockquote>SENATOR GUINGONA. Most of these acts, if not all, are already punished under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Senator Lina. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. If hazing is done at present and it results in death, the charge would be murder or homicide.<br><br>Senator Lina. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. If it does not result in death, it may be frustrated homicide or serious physical injuries.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. Or, if the person who commits sexual abuse does so it can be penalized under rape or acts of lasciviousness.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is correct, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. So, what is the rationale for making a new offense under this definition of the crime of hazing?<br><br>SENATOR LINA. To discourage persons or group of persons either composing a sorority, fraternity or any association from making this requirement of initiation that has already resulted in these specific acts or results, Mr. President.<br><br>That is the main rationale. We want to send a strong signal across the land that no group or association can require the act of physical initiation before a person can become a member without being held criminally liable.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. Yes, but what would be the rationale for that imposition? Because the distinguished Sponsor has said that he is not punishing a mere organization, he is not seeking the punishment of an initiation into a club or organization, he is seeking the punishment of certain acts that resulted in death, et cetera as a result of hazing which are already covered crimes.<br><br>The penalty is increased in one, because we would like to discourage hazing, abusive hazing, but it may be a legitimate defense for invoking two or more charges or offenses, because these very same acts are already punishable under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>That is my difficulty, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. x x x<br><br>Another point, Mr. President, is this, and this is a very telling difference: <b>When a person or group of persons resort to hazing as a requirement for gaining entry into an organization, the intent to commit a wrong is not visible or is not present</b>, Mr. President. Whereas, in these specific crimes, Mr. President, let us say there is death or there is homicide, mutilation,<b> if one files a case, then the intention to commit a wrong has to be proven. But if the crime of hazing is the basis, what is important is the result from the act of hazing.</b><br><br>To me,<b> that is the basic difference </b>and that is what will prevent or deter the sororities or fraternities; that they should really shun this activity called "hazing."<b> Because, initially, these fraternities or sororities do not even consider having a neophyte killed or maimed or that acts of lasciviousness are even committed initially</b>, Mr. President.<br><br>So, what we want to discourage is the so-called <b>initial innocent act.</b> That is why there is need to institute this kind of hazing. Ganiyan po ang nangyari. Ang fraternity o ang sorority ay magre-recruit. <b>Wala talaga silang intensiyong makamatay. </b>Hindi ko na babanggitin at buhay pa iyong kaso. Pero dito sa anim o pito na namatay nitong nakaraang taon, walang intensiyong patayin talaga iyong neophyte. So, kung maghihintay pa tayo, na saka lamang natin isasakdal ng murder kung namatay na, ay after the fact ho iyon.&nbsp; Pero, kung sasabihin natin sa mga kabataan na: "Huwag ninyong gagawin iyong hazing. Iyan ay kasalanan at kung mamatay diyan, mataas ang penalty sa inyo."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. I join the lofty motives, Mr. President, of the distinguished Sponsor. But <b>I am again disturbed </b>by his statement<b> that the prosecution does not have to prove the intent </b>that resulted<b> in the death, </b>that resulted<b> in the serious physical injuries, </b>that resulted<b> in the acts of lasciviousness or deranged mind. </b>We do not have to prove the willful intent of the accused in proving or establishing the crime of hazing.<b> This seems, to me, a novel situation where we create the special crime without having to go into the intent, which is one of the basic elements of any crime. </b><br><br><b>If there is no intent, there is no crime. If the intent were merely to initiate, then there is no offense. And even the distinguished Sponsor admits that the organization, the intent to initiate, the intent to have a new society or a new club is, per se, not punishable at all. What are punishable are the acts that lead to the result. But if these results are not going to be proven by intent, but just because there was hazing, I am afraid that it will disturb the basic concepts of the Revised Penal Code, Mr. President. </b><br><br>SENATOR LINA. Mr. President, the <b>act of hazing, precisely, is being criminalized because in the context of what is happening in the sororities and fraternities, when they conduct hazing, no one will admit that their intention is to maim or to kill. </b>So, we are already criminalizing the fact of inflicting physical pain. Mr. President, it is a criminal act and we want it stopped, deterred, discouraged.<b> </b><br><br>If that occurs, under this law, there is no necessity to prove that the masters intended to kill or the masters intended to maim. What is important is the result of the act of hazing. Otherwise,<b> the masters or those who inflict the physical pain can easily escape responsibility and say, "We did not have the intention to kill. This is part of our initiation rites. This is normal. We do not have any intention to kill or maim."</b><br><br><b>This is the lusot</b>, Mr. President. <b>They might as well have been charged therefore with the ordinary crime of homicide, mutilation, et cetera, where the prosecution will have a difficulty proving the elements if they are separate offenses.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. Mr. President, assuming there was a group that initiated and a person died. The charge is murder.

Mr. President, if the person is present during hazing x x x<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. The persons are present. First, would the prosecution have to prove conspiracy? Second, would the prosecution have to prove intent to kill or not?<br><br>SENATOR LINA. No more. As to the second question, Mr. President, if that occurs, there is no need to prove intent to kill.<br><br>SENATOR GUINGONA. But the charge is murder.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. That is why I said that it should not be murder. It should be hazing, Mr. President. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>During a discussion between Senator Biazon and Senator Lina on the issue of whether to include sodomy as a punishable act under the Anti-Hazing Law, Senator Lina further clarified thus:<br><blockquote>SENATOR BIAZON. Mr. President, this Representation has no objection to 
the inclusion of sodomy as one of the conditions resulting from hazing 
as necessary to be punished. However, the act of sodomy can be committed
 by two persons with or without consent.<br><br>To make it clearer, what
 is being punished here is the commission of sodomy forced into another 
individual by another individual. I move, Mr. President, that sodomy be 
modified by the phrase "without consent" for purposes of this section.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. I am afraid, Mr. President, that if we qualify sodomy with the 
concept that it is only going to aggravate the crime of hazing if it is 
done without consent will change a lot of concepts here. <b>Because the 
results from hazing aggravate the offense with or without consent. In 
fact, when a person joins a fraternity, sorority, or any association for
 that matter, it can be with or without the consent of the intended 
victim. The fact that a person joins a sorority or fraternity with his 
consent does not negate the crime of hazing.</b><br><br>This is a 
proposed law intended to protect the citizens from the malpractices that
 attend initiation which may have been announced with or without 
physical infliction of pain or injury, Mr. President. <b>Regardless of 
whether there is announcement that there will be physical hazing or 
whether there is none, and therefore, the neophyte is duped into joining
 a fraternity is of no moment. What is important is that there is an 
infliction of physical pain.</b><br><br>The <b>bottom line of this law</b> is that a citizen even has to be protected from himself if he joins a fraternity, so that at a certain point in time, <b>the State, the individual, or the parents of the victim can run after the perpetrators of the crime</b>, <b>regardless of whether or not there was consent on the part of the victim.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>SENATOR LINA. Mr. President, I understand the position taken by the 
distinguished Gentleman from Cavite and Metro Manila. It is correct that
 society sometimes adopts new mores, traditions, and practices.<br><br>In
 this bill, we are not going to encroach into the private proclivities 
of some individuals when they do their acts in private as we do not take
 a peek into the private rooms of couples. They can do their thing if 
they want to make love in ways that are not considered acceptable by the
 mainstream of society. That is not something that the State should 
prohibit.<br><br>But sodomy in this case is connected with hazing, Mr. 
President. Such that the act may even be entered into with consent. It 
is not only sodomy. <b>The infliction of pain may be done with the consent of the neophyte<i>.
 If the law is passed, that does not make the act of hazing not 
punishable because the neophyte accepted the infliction of pain upon 
himself. </i></b><br><br><b>If the victim suffers from serious physical 
injuries, but the initiator said, "Well, he allowed it upon himself. He 
consented to it." So, if we allow that reasoning that sodomy was done 
with the consent of the victim, then we would not have passed any law at
 all. There will be no significance if we pass this bill, because it 
will always be a defense that the victim allowed the infliction of pain 
or suffering. </b>He accepted it as part of the initiation rites.<br><br>But precisely, Mr. President<b> that is one thing that we would want to prohibit. <i>That
 the defense of consent will not apply because the very act of 
inflicting physical pain or psychological suffering is, by itself, a 
punishable act.</i> </b>The result of the act of hazing, like death or physical injuries merely aggravates the act with higher penalties. But<b> the defense of consent is not going to nullify the criminal nature of the act.</b><br><br><b>So, if we accept</b> the amendment that sodomy can only aggravate the offense <b>if it is committed without consent of the victim, then the whole foundation of this proposed law will collapse.<br><br></b>SENATOR BIAZON. Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>SENATOR LINA. Thank you very much.<br><br>The President. Is there any objection to the committee amendment? (Silence.) The Chair hears none; the same is approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup><br><br>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Realizing the implication of removing the state's burden to prove intent, Senator Lina, the principal author of the Senate Bill, said:<br><br><blockquote>I am very happy that the distinguished Minority Leader brought out the idea of intent or whether there it is mala in se or mala prohibita. There can be a radical amendment if that is the point that he wants to go to.<br><br><b>If we agree on the concept, then, maybe, we can just make this a special law on hazing.

I will not foreclose that suggestion, Mr. President.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, having in mind the potential conflict between the proposed law and the core principle of <i>mala in se</i> adhered to under the Revised Penal Code, Congress did not simply enact an amendment thereto. Instead, it created a special law on hazing, founded upon the principle of <i>mala prohibita</i>. This dilemma faced by Congress is further proof of how the nature of hazing - unique as against typical crimes - cast a cloud of doubt on whether society considered the act as an inherently wrong conduct or <i>mala in se</i> at the time. It is safe to presume that Lenny's parents would not have consented<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup> to his participation in Aquila Fraternity's initiation rites if the practice of hazing were considered by them as <i>mala in se</i>.<br><br>Furthermore, in <i>Vedaña v. Valencia</i> (1998), we noted through Associate Justice (now retired Chief Justice) Hilario Davide that "in our nation's very recent history, the people have spoken, through Congress, to deem <b>conduct</b> <b>constitutive of</b> ... <b>hazing</b>, [an] <b>act[] previously considered harmless by custom</b>, as criminal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup> Although it may be regarded as a simple <i>obiter dictum</i>, the statement nonetheless shows recognition that hazing - or the conduct of initiation rites through physical and/or psychological suffering - has not been traditionally criminalized. Prior to the 1995 Anti-Hazing Law, there was to some extent a lacuna in the law; hazing was not clearly considered an intentional felony. And when there is doubt on the interpretation of criminal laws, all must be resolved in favor of the accused. <i>In dubio pro reo</i>.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, and as a matter of law, the Court is constrained to rule against the trial court's finding of malicious intent to inflict physical injuries on Lenny Villa, there being no proof beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of malicious intent to inflict physical injuries or <i>animus iniuriandi</i> as required in <i>mala in se</i> cases, considering the contextual background of his death, the unique nature of hazing, and absent a law prohibiting hazing.<br><br><b>The accused fraternity members guilty of <br>reckless imprudence resulting in homicide </b><br><br>The absence of malicious intent does not automatically mean, however, that the accused fraternity members are ultimately devoid of criminal liability. The Revised Penal Code also punishes felonies that are committed by means of fault (<i>culpa</i>). According to Article 3 thereof, there is fault when the wrongful act results from imprudence, negligence, lack of foresight, or lack of skill.<br><br><i>Reckless imprudence </i>or<i> negligence</i> consists of a voluntary act done without malice, from which an immediate personal harm, injury or material damage results by reason of an inexcusable lack of precaution or advertence on the part of the person committing it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup> In this case, the danger is visible and consciously appreciated by the actor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> In contrast, <i>simple imprudence or negligence</i> comprises an act done without grave fault, from which an injury or material damage ensues by reason of a mere lack of foresight or skill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> Here, the threatened harm is not immediate, and the danger is not openly visible. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup><br><br>The test<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> for determining whether or not a person is negligent in doing an act is as follows: Would a prudent man in the position of the person to whom negligence is attributed foresee harm to the person injured as a reasonable consequence of the course about to be pursued? If so, the law imposes on the doer the duty to take precaution against the mischievous results of the act. Failure to do so constitutes negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup><br><br>As we held in <i>Gaid v. People</i>, for a person to avoid being charged with recklessness, the degree of precaution and diligence required varies with the degree of the danger involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> If, on account of a certain line of conduct, the danger of causing harm to another person is great, the individual who chooses to follow that particular course of conduct is bound to be very careful, in order to prevent or avoid damage or injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> In contrast, if the danger is minor, not much care is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> It is thus possible that there are countless degrees of precaution or diligence that may be required of an individual, "from a transitory glance of care to the most vigilant effort."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> The duty of the person to employ more or less degree of care will depend upon the circumstances of each particular case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup><br><br>There was patent recklessness in the hazing of Lenny Villa.<br><br>According to the NBI medico-legal officer, Lenny died of cardiac failure secondary to multiple traumatic injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> The officer explained that cardiac failure refers to the failure of the heart to work as a pump and as part of the circulatory system due to the lack of blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> In the present case, the victim's heart could no longer work as a pumping organ, because it was deprived of its requisite blood and oxygen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> The deprivation was due to the "channeling" of the blood supply from the entire circulatory system - including the heart, arteries, veins, venules, and capillaries - to the thigh, leg, and arm areas of Lenny, thus causing the formation of multiple hematomas or blood clots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> The multiple hematomas were wide, thick, and deep,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> indicating that these could have resulted mainly from injuries sustained by the victim from fist blows, knee blows, paddles, or the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> Repeated blows to those areas caused the blood to gradually ooze out of the capillaries until the circulating blood became so markedly diminished as to produce death. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup> The officer also found that the brain, liver, kidney, pancreas, intestines, and all other organs seen in the abdominals, as well as the thoracic organ in the lungs, were pale due to the lack of blood, which was redirected to the thighs and forearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup> It was concluded that there was nothing in the heart that would indicate that the victim suffered from a previous cardiac arrest or disease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup><br><br>The multiple hematomas or bruises found in Lenny Villa's arms and thighs, resulting from repeated blows to those areas, caused the loss of blood from his vital organs and led to his eventual death. These hematomas must be taken in the light of the hazing activities performed on him by the Aquila Fraternity. According to the testimonies of the co-neophytes of Lenny, they were punched, kicked, elbowed, kneed, stamped on; and hit with different objects on their arms, legs, and thighs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> They were also "paddled" at the back of their thighs or legs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> and slapped on their faces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> They were made to play rough basketball.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> Witness Marquez testified on Lenny, saying: "<i>[T]inamaan daw sya sa </i>spine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> The NBI medico-legal officer explained that the death of the victim was the cumulative effect of the multiple injuries suffered by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> The relevant portion of the testimony is as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Atty. Tadiar</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Doctor, there was, rather, it was your testimony on various cross examinations of defense counsels that the injuries that you have enumerated on the body of the deceased Lenny Villa previously marked as Exhibit "G-1" to "G-14" individually by themselves would not cause the death of the victim. The question I am going to propound to you is what is the cumulative effect of all of these injuries marked from Exhibit "G-1" to "G-14"?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Witness</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">All together nothing in concert to cause to the demise of the victim. So, it is not fair for us to isolate such injuries here because we are talking of the whole body. At the same manner that as a car would not run minus one (1) wheel. No, the more humane in human approach is to interpret all those injuries in whole and not in part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote><br>There is also evidence to show that some of the accused fraternity members were drinking during the initiation rites.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the collective acts of the fraternity members were tantamount to recklessness, which made the resulting death of Lenny a culpable felony. It must be remembered that organizations owe to their initiates a duty of care not to cause them injury in the process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> With the foregoing facts, we rule that the accused are guilty of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. Since the NBI medico-legal officer found that the victim's death was the cumulative effect of the injuries suffered, criminal responsibility redounds to all those who directly participated in and contributed to the infliction of physical injuries.<br><br>It appears from the aforementioned facts that the incident may have been prevented, or at least mitigated, had the alumni of Aquila Fraternity - accused Dizon and Villareal - restrained themselves from insisting on reopening the initiation rites. Although this point did not matter in the end, as records would show that the other fraternity members participated in the reopened initiation rites - having in mind the concept of "seniority" in fraternities - the implication of the presence of alumni should be seen as a point of review in future legislation. We further note that some of the fraternity members were intoxicated during Lenny's initiation rites. In this light, the Court submits to Congress, for legislative consideration, the amendment of the Anti-Hazing Law to include the fact of intoxication and the presence of non-resident or alumni fraternity members during hazing as aggravating circumstances that would increase the applicable penalties.<br><br>It is truly astonishing how men would wittingly - or unwittingly -impose the misery of hazing and employ appalling rituals in the name of brotherhood. There must be a better way to establish "kinship." A neophyte admitted that he joined the fraternity to have more friends and to avail himself of the benefits it offered, such as tips during bar examinations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> Another initiate did not give up, because he feared being looked down upon as a quitter, and because he felt he did not have a choice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> Thus, for Lenny Villa and the other neophytes, joining the Aquila Fraternity entailed a leap in the dark. By giving consent under the circumstances, they left their fates in the hands of the fraternity members. Unfortunately, the hands to which lives were entrusted were barbaric as they were reckless.<br><br>Our finding of criminal liability for the felony of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide shall cover only accused Tecson, Ama, Almeda, Bantug, and Dizon. Had the Anti-Hazing Law been in effect then, these five accused fraternity members would have all been convicted of the crime of hazing punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> (life imprisonment).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> Since there was no law prohibiting the act of hazing when Lenny died, we are constrained to rule according to existing laws at the time of his death. The CA found that the prosecution failed to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, Victorino <i>et al.</i>'s individual participation in the infliction of physical injuries upon Lenny Villa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> As to accused Villareal, his criminal liability was totally extinguished by the fact of his death, pursuant to Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Furthermore, our ruling herein shall be interpreted without prejudice to the applicability of the Anti-Hazing Law to subsequent cases. Furthermore, the modification of criminal liability from <b>slight physical injuries</b> to <b>reckless imprudence resulting in homicide</b> shall apply only with respect to accused Almeda, Ama, Bantug, and Tecson.<br><br><b>The accused liable to pay damages </b><br><br>The CA awarded damages in favor of the heirs of Lenny Villa in the amounts of P50,000 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> and P1,000,000 as moral damages, to be jointly and severally paid by accused Dizon and Villareal. It also awarded the amount of P30,000 as indemnity to be jointly and severally paid by accused Almeda, Ama, Bantug, and Tecson.<br><br>Civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> is automatically awarded for the sole fact of death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup> we sustain the CA's award of indemnity in the amount of P50,000.<br><br>The heirs of the victim are entitled to actual or compensatory damages, including expenses incurred in connection with the death of the victim, so long as the claim is supported by tangible documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup> Though we are prepared to award actual damages, the Court is prevented from granting them, since the records are bereft of any evidence to show that actual expenses were incurred or proven during trial. Furthermore, in the appeal, the Solicitor General does not interpose any claim for actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup><br><br>The heirs of the deceased may recover moral damages for the grief suffered on account of the victim's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[278]</sup> This penalty is pursuant to Article 2206(3) of the Civil Code, which provides that the "spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants and the ascendants of the deceased may demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of the deceased."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup> Thus, we hereby we affirm the CA's award of moral damages in the amount of ?1,000,000.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Judgment in G.R.
