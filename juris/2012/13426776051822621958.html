				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In resolving this controversy, the Court took into consideration that all the parties involved share common goals in pursuit of certain primordial State policies and principles that are enshrined in the Constitution and pertinent laws, such as the protection of the environment, the empowerment of the local government units, the promotion of tourism, and the encouragement of the participation of the private sector. The Court seeks to reconcile the respective roles, duties and responsibilities of the petitioner and respondents in achieving these shared goals within the context of our Constitution, laws and regulations.<br><br><b><i>Nature of the Case</i></b><br><br>This is an original petition for the issuance of an Environmental Protection Order in the nature of a continuing mandamus under A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC, otherwise known as the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases, promulgated on April 29, 2010.<br><br><b><i>The Parties</i></b><br><br>Petitioner Boracay Foundation, Inc. (petitioner) is a duly registered, non-stock domestic corporation. Its primary purpose is “to foster a united, concerted and environment-conscious development of Boracay Island, thereby preserving and maintaining its culture, natural beauty and ecological balance, marking the island as the crown jewel of Philippine tourism, a prime tourist destination in Asia and the whole world.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It counts among its members at least sixty (60) owners and representatives of resorts, hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions; at least five community organizations; and several environmentally-conscious residents and advocates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondent Province of Aklan (respondent Province) is a political subdivision of the government created pursuant to Republic Act No. 1414, represented by Honorable Carlito S. Marquez, the Provincial Governor (Governor Marquez).<br><br>Respondent Philippine Reclamation Authority (respondent PRA), formerly called the Public Estates Authority (PEA), is a government entity created by Presidential Decree No. 1084,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which states that one of the purposes for which respondent PRA was created was to reclaim land, including foreshore and submerged areas. PEA eventually became the lead agency primarily responsible for all reclamation projects in the country under Executive Order No. 525, series of 1979. In June 2006, the President of the Philippines issued Executive Order No. 543, delegating the power “to approve reclamation projects to PRA through its governing Board, subject to compliance with existing laws and rules and further subject to the condition that reclamation contracts to be executed with any person or entity (must) go through public bidding.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Respondent Department of Environment and Natural Resources – Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB), Regional Office VI (respondent DENR-EMB RVI), is the government agency in the Western Visayas Region authorized to issue environmental compliance certificates regarding projects that require the environment’s protection and management in the region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><b>Summary of Antecedent Facts</b><br><br>Boracay Island (Boracay), a tropical paradise located in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines and one of the country’s most popular tourist destinations, was declared a tourist zone and marine reserve in 1973 under Presidential Proclamation No. 1801.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The island comprises the barangays of Manoc-manoc, Balabag, and Yapak, all within the municipality of Malay, in the province of Aklan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioner describes Boracay as follows:<br><br>Boracay is well-known for its distinctive powdery white-sand beaches which are the product of the unique ecosystem dynamics of the area. The island itself is known to come from the uplifted remnants of an ancient reef platform. Its beaches, the sandy land strip between the water and the area currently occupied by numerous establishments, is the primary draw for domestic and international tourists for its color, texture and other unique characteristics. Needless to state, it is the premier domestic and international tourist destination in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>More than a decade ago, respondent Province built the Caticlan Jetty Port and Passenger Terminal at Barangay Caticlan to be the main gateway to Boracay. It also built the corresponding Cagban Jetty Port and Passenger Terminal to be the receiving end for tourists in Boracay. Respondent Province operates both ports “to provide structural facilities suited for locals, tourists and guests and to provide safety and security measures.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In 2005, Boracay 2010 Summit was held and participated in by representatives from national government agencies, local government units (LGUs), and the private sector. Petitioner was one of the organizers and participants thereto. The Summit aimed “to re-establish a common vision of all stakeholders to ensure the conservation, restoration, and preservation of Boracay Island” and “to develop an action plan that [would allow] all sectors to work in concert among and with each other for the long term benefit and sustainability of the island and the community.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The Summit yielded a Terminal Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> stating that the participants had shared their dream of having world-class land, water and air infrastructure, as well as given their observations that government support was lacking, infrastructure was poor, and, more importantly, the influx of tourists to Boracay was increasing. The Report showed that there was a need to expand the port facilities at Caticlan due to congestion in the holding area of the existing port, caused by inadequate facilities, thus tourists suffered long queues while waiting for the boat ride going to the island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Respondent Province claimed that tourist arrivals to Boracay reached approximately 649,559 in 2009 and 779,666 in 2010, and this was expected to reach a record of 1 million tourist arrivals in the years to come. Thus, respondent Province conceptualized the expansion of the port facilities at Barangay Caticlan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The<i> Sangguniang Barangay of Caticlan,</i> Malay Municipality, issued <b>Resolution No. 13, s. 2008</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on April 25, 2008 stating that it had learned that respondent Province had filed an application with the DENR for a foreshore lease of areas along the shorelines of Barangay Caticlan, and manifesting its strong opposition to said application, as the proposed foreshore lease practically covered almost all the coastlines of said barangay, thereby technically diminishing its territorial jurisdiction, once granted, and depriving its constituents of their statutory right of preference in the development and utilization of the natural resources within its jurisdiction. The resolution further stated that respondent Province did not conduct any consultations with the <i>Sangguniang Barangay</i> of Caticlan regarding the proposed foreshore lease, which failure the Sanggunian considered as an act of bad faith on the part of respondent Province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On November 20, 2008, the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of respondent Province approved <b>Resolution No. 2008-369</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> formally authorizing Governor Marquez to enter into negotiations towards the possibility of effecting self-liquidating and income-producing development and livelihood projects to be financed through bonds, debentures, securities, collaterals, notes or other obligations as provided under Section 299 of the Local Government Code, with the following priority projects: (a) renovation/rehabilitation of the Caticlan/Cagban Passenger Terminal Buildings and Jetty Ports; and (b) reclamation of a portion of Caticlan foreshore for commercial purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This step was taken as respondent Province’s existing jetty port and passenger terminal was funded through bond flotation, which was successfully redeemed and paid ahead of the target date.

The financial component of the said study was Two Hundred Sixty Million Pesos (P260,000,000.00). Its suggested financing scheme was bond flotation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of the Municipality of Malay expressed its strong opposition to the intended foreshore lease application, through <b>Resolution No. 044</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> approved on July 22, 2009, manifesting therein that respondent Province’s foreshore lease application was for business enterprise purposes for its benefit, at the expense of the local government of Malay, which by statutory provisions was the rightful entity “to develop, utilize and reap benefits from the natural resources found within its jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In August 2009, a Preliminary Geohazard Assessment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> for the enhancement/expansion of the existing Caticlan Jetty Port and Passenger Terminal through beach zone restoration and Protective Marina Developments in Caticlan, Malay, Aklan was completed.<br><br>Thereafter, Governor Marquez submitted an <b>Environmental Performance Report and Monitoring Program (EPRMP)</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to DENR-EMB RVI, which he had attached to his letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated September 19, 2009, as an initial step for securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC).

The study likewise indicated the vulnerability of the coastal zone within the proposed project site and the nearby coastal area due to the effects of sea level rise and climate change which will greatly affect the social, economic, and environmental situation of Caticlan and nearby Malay coastal communities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In his letter dated October 22, 2009 addressed to respondent PRA, Governor Marquez wrote:<br><br><blockquote>With our substantial compliance with the requirements under Administrative Order No. 2007-2 relative to our request to PRA for approval of the reclamation of the [proposed Beach Zone Restoration and Protection Marine Development in Barangays Caticlan and Manoc-Manoc] and as a result of our discussion during the [meeting with the respondent PRA on October 12, 2009], may we respectfully submit a <b>revised Reclamation Project Description embodying certain revisions/changes in the <u>size and location</u> of the areas to be reclaimed</b>. x x x.<br><br>On another note, we are pleased to inform your Office that the bond flotation we have secured with the Local Government Unit Guarantee Corporation (LGUGC) has been finally approved last October 14, 2009.

Said Evaluation Report indicates that the implementation of the other phases of the project including site 2, which consists of the other portions of the 40-hectare area that includes a portion in Boracay, is still within the 10-year period and will depend largely on the availability of funds of respondent Province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>So, even if respondent PRA approved an area that would total up to 40 hectares, it was divided into phases in order to determine the period of its implementation.

The entire approved area of 40 hectares could be implemented within a period of 10 years but this would depend solely on the availability of funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>As far as respondent Province understands it, additional reclamations not covered by the ECC, which only approved 2.64 hectares, should undergo another EIA.

On the issue that the reclamation project is within an ECA requiring the performance of a full or programmatic EIA, respondent Province reiterates that the idea of expanding the area to 40 hectares is only a future plan. It only secured an ECC for 2.64 hectares, based on the limits of its funding and authority. From the beginning, its intention was to rehabilitate and expand the existing jetty port terminal to accommodate an increasing projected traffic. The subject project is specifically classified under DENR DAO 2003-30 on its Project Grouping Matrix for Determination of EIA Report Type considered as Minor Reclamation Projects falling under Group II – Non ECP in an ECA. Whether 2.64 or 40 hectares in area, the subject project falls within this classification.<br><br>Consequently, respondent Province claims that petitioner erred in considering the ongoing reclamation project at Caticlan, Malay, Aklan, as co-located within an ECA.<br><br>Respondent Province, likewise argues that the 2.64-hectare project is not a component of the approved 40-hectare area as it is originally planned for the expansion site of the existing Caticlan jetty port. At present, it has no definite conceptual construction plan of the said portion in Boracay and it has no financial allocation to initiate any project on the said Boracay portion.<br><br>Furthermore, respondent Province contends that the present project is located in Caticlan while the alleged component that falls within an ECA is in Boracay. Considering its geographical location, the two sites cannot be considered as a contiguous area for the reason that it is separated by a body of water – a strait that traverses between the mainland Panay wherein Caticlan is located and Boracay. Hence, it is erroneous to consider the two sites as a co-located project within an ECA. Being a “stand alone project” and an expansion of the existing jetty port, respondent DENR-EMB RVI had required respondent Province to perform an EPRMP to secure an ECC as sanctioned by Item No. 8(b), page 7 of DENR DAO 2003-30.<br><br>Respondent Province contends that even if, granting for the sake of argument, it had erroneously categorized its project as Non-ECP in an ECA, this was not a final determination. Respondent DENR-EMB RVI, which was the administrator of the EIS system, had the final decision on this matter. Under DENR DAO 2003-30, an application for ECC, even for a Category B2 project where an EPRMP is conducted, shall be subjected to a review process. Respondent DENR-EMB RVI had the authority to deny said application. Its Regional Director could either issue an ECC for the project or deny the application. He may also require a more comprehensive EIA study. The Regional Director issued the ECC based on the EPRMP submitted by respondent Province and after the same went through the EIA review process.<br><br>Thus, respondent Province concludes that petitioner’s allegation of this being a “co-located project” is premature if not baseless as the bigger reclamation project is still on the conceptualization stage.

Furthermore, such endorsement is not necessary for projects falling under Category B2 unless required by the DENR-EMB RVI, under Section 5.3 of DENR DAO 2003-30.<br><br>Moreover, <b>DENR Memorandum Circular No. 08-2007</b> no longer requires the issuance of permits and certifications as a pre-requisite for the issuance of an ECC.

The vehement and staunch objections of both the <i>Sangguniang Barangay</i> of Caticlan and the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Malay, according to respondent Province, were not rooted on its perceived impact upon the people and the community in terms of environmental or ecological balance, but due to an alleged conflict with their “principal position to develop, utilize and reap benefits from the natural resources found within its jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Respondent Province argues that these concerns are not within the purview of the Local Government Code.

It is allegedly not within the provisions to give the full authority to the LGU concerned to unilaterally approve or disapprove the project in the guise of requiring the proponent of securing its favorable endorsement. In this case, petitioner is calling a halt to the project without providing an alternative resolution to harmonize its position and that of respondent Province.<br><br>Respondent Province claims that the EPRMP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> would reveal that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he area fronting the project site is practically composed of sand.

Respondent Province claims that its failure to comply with said condition indicated its waiver to pursue the succeeding phases of the reclamation project and that the subject matter of this case had thus been limited to 2.64 hectares. Respondent PRA, for its part, declared through its General Manager that the “Aklan Beach Zone Restoration and Protection Marine Development Project will now be confined to the reclamation and development of the 2.64 hectares, more or less.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>The Court notes such manifestation of respondent Province. Assuming, however, that the area involved in the subject reclamation project has been limited to 2.64 hectares, this case has not become moot and academic, as alleged by respondents, because the Court still has to check whether respondents had complied with all applicable environmental laws, rules, and regulations pertaining to the actual reclamation project.<br><br>We recognize at this point that the DENR is the government agency vested with delegated powers to review and evaluate all EIA reports, and to grant or deny ECCs to project proponents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> It is the DENR that has the duty to implement the EIS system. It appears, however, that respondent DENR-EMB RVI’s evaluation of this reclamation project was problematic, based on the valid questions raised by petitioner.<br><br>Being the administrator of the EIS System, respondent DENR-EMB RVI’s submissions bear great weight in this case. However, the following are the issues that put in question the wisdom of respondent DENR-EMB RVI in issuing the ECC:<br><br><ol><li>Its approval of respondent Province’s classification of the project as a mere expansion of the existing jetty port in Caticlan, instead of classifying it as a <b>new project</b>;<br><br></li><li>Its classification of the reclamation project as a single instead of a <b>co-located</b> project;<br><br></li><li>The lack of <i>prior</i> public consultations and approval of local government agencies; and<br><br></li><li>The lack of comprehensive studies regarding the impact of the reclamation project to the environment.<br></li></ol><br>The above issues as raised put in question the sufficiency of the evaluation of the project by respondent DENR-EMB RVI.<br><br><b>Nature of the project</b><br><br>The first question must be answered by respondent DENR-EMB RVI as the agency with the expertise and authority to state whether this is a new project, subject to the more rigorous environmental impact study requested by petitioner, or it is a mere expansion of the existing jetty port facility.<br><br>The second issue refers to the classification of the project by respondent Province, approved by respondent DENR-EMB RVI, as single instead of co-located. Under the Revised Procedural Manual, the “<b>Summary List of Additional Non-Environmentally-Critical Project (NECP) Types in ECAs Classified under Group II” (Table I-2)</b> lists “buildings, storage facilities and other structures” as a separate item from “transport terminal facilities.” This creates the question of whether this project should be considered as consisting of more than one type of activity, and should more properly be classified as “co-located,” under the following definition from the same Manual, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><p align="JUSTIFY">f) </p></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Group IV (Co-located Projects in either ECA or NECA): A co-located project is a group of single projects, under one or more proponents/locators, which are located in a contiguous area and managed by one administrator, who is also the ECC applicant. </b>The co-located project may be an economic zone or industrial park, or a mix of projects within a catchment, watershed or river basin, or any other geographical, political or economic unit of area. Since the location or threshold of specific projects within the contiguous area will yet be derived from the EIA process based on the carrying capacity of the project environment, the nature of the project is called “programmatic.” (Emphasis added.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Respondent DENR-EMB RVI should conduct a thorough and detailed evaluation of the project to address the question of whether this could be deemed as a group of single projects (transport terminal facility, building, <i>etc</i>.) in a contiguous area managed by respondent Province, or as a single project.<br><br>The third item in the above enumeration will be discussed as a separate issue.<br><br>The answer to the fourth question depends on the final classification of the project under items 1 and 3 above because the type of EIA study required under the Revised Procedural Manual depends on such classification.<br><br>The very definition of an EIA points to what was most likely neglected by respondent Province as project proponent, and what was in turn overlooked by respondent DENR-EMB RVI, for it is defined as follows:<br><br><blockquote>An [EIA] is a ‘process that involves <b>predicting</b> and evaluating the likely impacts of a project (including cumulative impacts) on the environment during construction, commissioning, operation and abandonment. It also includes designing appropriate <b>preventive</b>, mitigating and enhancement measures addressing these consequences to protect the environment and the community’s welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>Thus, the EIA process must have been able to <b>predict</b> the likely impact of the reclamation project to the environment and to <b>prevent</b> any harm that may otherwise be caused.<br><br>The project now before us involves reclamation of land that is <b>more than five times the size of the original</b> reclaimed land. Furthermore, the area prior to construction merely contained a jetty port, whereas the proposed expansion, as described in the EPRMP submitted by respondent Province to respondent DENR-EMB RVI involves so much more, and we quote:<br><br><blockquote>The expansion project will be constructed at the north side of the existing jetty port and terminal that will have a total area of 2.64 hectares, more or less, after reclamation. The Phase 1 of the project construction costing around P260 million includes the following:<br><br><b></b><ol><li><b>Reclamation&nbsp; - 3,000 sq m (expansion of jetty port)<br><br></b></li><li><b>Reclamation&nbsp; - 13,500 sq m (buildable area)<br><br></b></li><li><b>Terminal annex building - 250 sq m<br><br></b></li><li><b>2-storey commercial building – 2,500 sq m (1,750 sq m of leasable space)<br><br></b></li><li><b>Health and wellness center<br><br></b></li><li><b>Access road&nbsp;&nbsp; - 12 m (wide)<br><br></b></li><li><b>Parking, perimeter fences, lighting and water treatment sewerage system<br><br></b></li><li><b>Rehabilitation of existing jetty port and terminal</b></li></ol>x x x x<br><br>The succeeding phases of the project will consist of [further] reclamation, completion of the commercial center building, bay walk commercial strip, staff building, ferry terminal, a cable car system and wharf marina. This will entail an additional estimated cost of P785 million bringing the total investment requirement to about P1.0 billion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> (Emphases added.)<br></blockquote><br>As may be gleaned from the breakdown of the 2.64 hectares as described by respondent Province above, a significant portion of the reclaimed area would be devoted to the construction of a commercial building, and the area to be utilized for the expansion of the jetty port consists of a mere 3,000 square meters (sq. m). To be true to its definition, the EIA report submitted by respondent Province should at the very least predict the impact that the construction of the new buildings on the reclaimed land would have on the surrounding environment. These new constructions and their environmental effects were not covered by the old studies that respondent Province previously submitted for the construction of the original jetty port in 1999, and which it re-submitted in its application for ECC in this alleged expansion, instead of conducting updated and more comprehensive studies.<br><br>Any impact on the Boracay side cannot be totally ignored, as Caticlan and Boracay are separated only by a narrow strait. This becomes more imperative because of the significant contributions of Boracay’s white-sand beach to the country’s tourism trade, which requires respondent Province to <b>proceed with utmost caution</b> in implementing projects within its vicinity.<br><br>We had occasion to emphasize the duty of local government units to ensure the quality of the environment under Presidential Decree No. 1586 in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. The City of Davao,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> wherein we held:<br><br><blockquote>Section 15 of Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, defines a local government unit as a body politic and corporate endowed with powers to be exercised by it in conformity with law. As such, it performs dual functions, governmental and proprietary. Governmental functions are those that concern the health, safety and the advancement of the public good or welfare as affecting the public generally. Proprietary functions are those that seek to obtain special corporate benefits or earn pecuniary profit and intended for private advantage and benefit. When exercising governmental powers and performing governmental duties, an LGU is an agency of the national government. When engaged in corporate activities, it acts as an agent of the community in the administration of local affairs.<br><br><b>Found in Section 16 of the Local Government Code is the duty of the LGUs to promote the people’s right to a balanced ecology</b>. Pursuant to this, an LGU, like the City of Davao, can not claim exemption from the coverage of PD 1586. As a body politic endowed with governmental functions, an LGU has the duty to ensure the quality of the environment, which is the very same objective of PD 1586.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 4 of PD 1586 clearly states that “no person, partnership or corporation shall undertake or operate any such declared environmentally critical project or area without first securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate issued by the President or his duly authorized representative.” The Civil Code defines a person as either natural or juridical. <b>The state and its political subdivisions, i.e., the local government units are juridical persons. Undoubtedly therefore, local government units are not excluded from the coverage of PD 1586.</b><br><br>Lastly, very clear in Section 1 of PD 1586 that said law intends to implement the policy of the state to achieve a balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection, which are the twin goals of sustainable development. The above-quoted first paragraph of the Whereas clause stresses that <b>this can only be possible if we adopt a comprehensive and integrated environmental protection program where all the sectors of the community are involved, i.e., the government and the private sectors. The local government units, as part of the machinery of the government, cannot therefore be deemed as outside the scope of the EIS system</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>The Court chooses to remand these matters to respondent DENR-EMB RVI for it to make a proper study, and if it should find necessary, to require respondent Province to address these environmental issues raised by petitioner and submit the correct EIA report as required by the project’s specifications. The Court requires respondent DENR-EMB RVI to complete its study and submit a report within a non-extendible period of three months. Respondent DENR-EMB RVI should establish to the Court in said report why the ECC it issued for the subject project should not be canceled.<br><br><b>Lack of prior public consultation</b><br><br>The Local Government Code establishes the duties of <b>national </b>government agencies in the maintenance of ecological balance, and requires them to secure <i>prior public consultation and approval </i>of <b>local</b> government units for the projects described therein.<br><br>In the case before us, the national agency involved is respondent PRA. Even if the project proponent is the local government of Aklan, it is respondent PRA which authorized the reclamation, being the exclusive agency of the government to undertake reclamation nationwide. Hence, it was necessary for respondent Province to go through respondent PRA and to execute a MOA, wherein respondent PRA’s authority to reclaim was delegated to respondent Province. Respondent DENR-EMB RVI, regional office of the DENR, is also a national government institution which is tasked with the issuance of the ECC that is a prerequisite to projects covered by environmental laws such as the one at bar.<br><br>This project can be classified as a national project that affects the environmental and ecological balance of local communities, and is covered by the requirements found in the Local Government Code provisions that are quoted below:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>Section 26.

Paño</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> we held that Section 27 of the Local Government Code applies only to “national programs and/or projects which are to be implemented in a particular local community”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> and that it should be read in conjunction with Section 26. We held further in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>Thus, the projects and programs mentioned in Section 27 should be interpreted to mean projects and programs whose effects are among those enumerated in Section 26 and 27, to wit, those that: (1) <b>may cause pollution</b>; (2) may bring about climatic change; (3) may cause the depletion of non-renewable resources; (4) may result in loss of crop land, range-land, or forest cover; (5) may eradicate certain animal or plant species from the face of the planet; and (6) other projects or programs that may call for the eviction of a particular group of people residing in the locality where these will be implemented.

Accordingly, the information dissemination conducted months after the ECC had already been issued was insufficient to comply with this requirement under the Local Government Code. Had they been conducted properly, the prior public consultation should have considered the ecological or environmental concerns of the stakeholders and studied measures alternative to the project, to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impact or damage. In fact, respondent Province once tried to obtain the favorable endorsement of the Sangguniang Bayan of Malay, but this was denied by the latter.<br><br>Moreover, DENR DAO 2003-30 provides:<br><br><blockquote>5.3 <i>Public Hearing / Consultation Requirements</i><br><br>For projects under Category A-1, the conduct of public hearing as part of the EIS review is mandatory unless otherwise determined by EMB.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In essence, the above-quoted rule shows that in cases requiring public consultations, the same should be initiated early so that concerns of stakeholders could be taken into consideration in the EIA study. In this case, respondent Province had already filed its ECC application before it met with the local government units of Malay and Caticlan.<br><br>The claim of respondent DENR-EMB RVI is that no permits and/or clearances from National Government Agencies (NGAs) and LGUs are required pursuant to the DENR Memorandum Circular No. 2007-08. However, we still find that the LGC requirements of consultation and approval apply in this case. This is because a Memorandum Circular cannot prevail over the Local Government Code, which is a statute and which enjoys greater weight under our hierarchy of laws.<br><br>Subsequent to the information campaign of respondent Province, the Municipality of Malay and the <i>Liga ng mga Barangay</i>-Malay Chapter still opposed the project. Thus, when respondent Province commenced the implementation project, it violated Section 27 of the LGC, which clearly enunciates that “[no] project or program shall be implemented by government authorities unless the consultations mentioned in Sections 2(c) and 26 hereof are complied with, and prior approval of the sanggunian concerned is obtained.”<br><br>The lack of <b><i>prior </i></b>public consultation and approval is not corrected by the subsequent endorsement of the reclamation project by the <i>Sangguniang Barangay</i> of Caticlan on <b>February 13, 2012</b>, and the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of the Municipality of Malay on <b>February 28, 2012</b>, which were both undoubtedly achieved at the urging and insistence of respondent Province. As we have established above, the respective resolutions issued by the LGUs concerned did not render this petition moot and academic.<br><br>It is clear that both petitioner and respondent Province are interested in the promotion of tourism in Boracay and the protection of the environment, lest they kill the proverbial hen that lays the golden egg. At the beginning of this decision, we mentioned that there are common goals of national significance that are very apparent from both the petitioner’s and the respondents’ respective pleadings and memoranda.<br><br>The parties are evidently in accord in seeking to uphold the mandate found in Article II, Declaration of Principles and State Policies, of the 1987 Constitution, which we quote below:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 16.

The State recognizes the indispensable role of the private sector, encourages private enterprise, and provides incentives to needed investments.</blockquote><br>The protection of the environment in accordance with the aforesaid constitutional mandate is the aim, among others, of Presidential Decree No. 1586, “Establishing an Environmental Impact Statement System, Including Other Environmental Management Related Measures and For Other Purposes,” which declared in its first Section that it is “the policy of the State to attain and maintain a rational and orderly balance between socio-economic growth and environmental protection.”<br><br>The parties undoubtedly too agree as to the importance of promoting tourism, pursuant to Section 2 of Republic Act No. 9593, or “The Tourism Act of 2009,” which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. –<b> The State declares tourism as an indispensable element of the national economy and an industry of national interest and importance,</b> which must be harnessed as an engine of socioeconomic growth and cultural affirmation to generate investment, foreign exchange and employment, and to continue to mold an enhanced sense of national pride for all Filipinos.

The Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Declaration of Policy.</i> - (a) <b>It is hereby declared the policy of the State that the territorial and political subdivisions of the State shall enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals</b>.
