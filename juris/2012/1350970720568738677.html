SP No. 109265.<br><br>The facts leading to the filing of this petition are undisputed. Subject of the present controversy is a parcel of land with an approximate area of 4.4 hectares and located at Bignay, Valenzuela City. The property is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. V-73892, registered in the names of George and Marilyn Lim (Spouses Lim).<br><br>On September 8, 2004, Maria Consolacion Rivera-Pascual (Consolacion) filed before the Office of the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD) for Region IV-A a petition to be recognized as a tenant of a property located at Bignay, Valenzuela City against Danilo Deato (Deato). At that time, the property, which has an approximate area of 4.4 hectares, was covered by TCT No. 24759 under Deato’s name. During the pendency of the petition, Deato sold the property to Spouses Lim. The sale was registered on December 21, 2004 leading to the issuance of TCT No. V- 73892 in favor of Spouses Lim. Considering this development, Consolacion filed a motion on March 3, 2005 to implead Spouses Lim as respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The petition, which was docketed as DARAB Case No. R-0400-0012- 04, was granted by Regional Adjudicator Conchita C.

Records show that both the petitioner-appellee and her counsel received a copy of the Decision dated 18 February 2009 on 27 February 2009 and that Legal Officer Nancy Geocada[,] the alleged new counsel of the herein petitioner[-]appellee[,] filed the Motion for Reconsideration only on 13 April 2009, clearly the Motion for Reconsideration was filed beyond the fifteen (15) days (sic) reglementary period thus the herein Decision has already become final and executory. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br><br>On June 25, 2009, Consolacion filed a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On July 1, 2009, the CA resolved to require Consolacion’s counsel to submit within five (5) days from notice his Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) Certificate of Compliance or Exemption and an amended Verification and Certification Against Non-Forum-Shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Apparently, Consolacion’s counsel failed to indicate in the petition his MCLE Certificate of Compliance or Exemption Number as required under Bar Matter No. 1922. Also, the jurat of Consolacion’s verification and certification against non-forum-shopping failed to indicate any competent evidence of Consolacion’s identity apart from her community tax certificate.<br><br>Considering the failure of Consolacion and her counsel to comply, the CA issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> on October 15, 2009 dismissing the petition.<br><br><blockquote>On July 7, 2009, the counsel for the petitioner received the abovementioned Resolution. However, the counsel for the petitioner failed to comply with the said Resolution which was due on July 19, 2009.<br><br>For failure of the counsel for the petitioner to comply with the Resolution dated July 1, 2009, despite receipt of the notice thereof, the petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Consolacion moved for reconsideration but this was denied by the CA in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated March 11, 2010.<br><br>Consolacion is, before this Court, claiming that the CA’s summary dismissal of her petition on technical grounds is unwarranted. Consolacion invoked substantial justice against the CA’s strict application of the rule requiring her counsel to note his MCLE Compliance or Exemption Certificate Number and the rule rendering the jurat of her verification and certification on non-forum-shopping defective in the absence of the details of any one of her current identification document issued by an official agency bearing her photograph and signature. That there was merit in her petition and that she complied, albeit belatedly as her counsel’s MCLE Compliance Certificate Number was indicated and a verification and certificate on non-forum-shopping with a proper jurat was attached to her motion for reconsideration, should have sufficed for the CA to reverse the dismissal of her petition and decide the same on its merits. Consolacion alleged that procedural rules or technicalities are designed to facilitate the attainment of justice and their rigid application should be avoided if this would frustrate rather than promote substantial justice. <br><br>The Court finds no merit in the petition. The Court sees no reversible error committed by the CA in dismissing Consolacion’s petition before it on the ground of petitioner’s unexplained failure to comply with basic procedural requirements attendant to the filing of a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Notably, Consolacion and her counsel remained obstinate despite the opportunity afforded to them by the CA to rectify their lapses. While there was compliance, this took place, however, after the CA had ordered the dismissal of Consolacion’s petition and without reasonable cause proffered to justify its belatedness. Consolacion and her counsel claimed inadvertence and negligence but they did not explain the circumstances thereof. Absent valid and compelling reasons, the requested leniency and liberality in the observance of procedural rules appears to be an afterthought, hence, cannot be granted. The CA saw no compelling need meriting the relaxation of the rules. Neither does this Court see any.<br><br>The Court is aware of the exceptional cases where technicalities were liberally construed. However, in these cases, outright dismissal is rendered unjust by the presence of a satisfactory and persuasive explanation. The parties therein who prayed for liberal interpretation were able to hurdle that heavy burden of proving that they deserve an exceptional treatment. It was never the Court’s intent “to forge a bastion for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>This Court will not condone a cavalier attitude towards procedural rules. It is the duty of every member of the bar to comply with these rules. They are not at liberty to seek exceptions should they fail to observe these rules and rationalize their omission by harking on liberal construction.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Pates v.
