They further claimed that the resulting consolidated Lot 4 is not actually a consolidation of several lots but only contains Lot 1131, which belongs to Oliveros.&nbsp; Thus, they asked for the nullification as well of Ramitex' title to consolidated Lot 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> insofar as it unlawfully included Lot 1131.<br><br>Given the prejudicial nature of the nullity case on the reconstitution case, the latter was held in abeyance until the resolution of the former.<br><br>Ramitex answered that its title over Lot 1131 is valid and claimed continuous possession and ownership of the subject property.

It gave due credence to the certification of the LRA that Bulacan RD never possessed, hence could never have issued, Judicial Form No. 109-D with Serial No. 124604.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>It observed that the certification from the Bulacan RD only proved that its records and documents were destroyed in the fire of March 1987.&nbsp; It did not, in the least, prove that TCT No. T-17186 existed prior to the fire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Further, Oliveros failed to explain why the parent title of TCT No. T-17186 refers to a lot in the Lolomboy Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; He did not present the deed of sale allegedly executed in his favor by his vendors Domingo de Leon and Modesta Molina; nor could he produce the correct title, from which his TCT No. T-17186 was derived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the trial court found overwhelming evidence supporting SMC's claim as to the validity of its title to the subject property.&nbsp; The title from which SMC's predecessor-in-interest Ramitex derived its own title, TCT No. (T-63790) 29334, was in the name of Ramitex' vendors Soriano and Lozada, and was still in existence in the Bulacan RD.&nbsp; Moreover, Entry No. 39069 can be found on the dorsal portion thereof, which corroborates Ramitex' claim that it bought Lot 1131 from the said vendors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The trial court ruled in favor of SMC, thus:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1).&nbsp; Declaring TCT No. T-17186 of Oliveros as not genuine and dismissing the above-entitled case for lack of merit; and<br><br>2).&nbsp; Ordering the plaintiffs, jointly and severally, to pay defendant SMC the amount of P700,000.00 as attorney's fees, plus the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Petitioners appealed to the CA.&nbsp; They asked for the reversal of the finding that Oliveros' title over Lot 1131 is spurious and non-existent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners averred that TCT No. T-17186 was issued earlier than Ramitex' title, contains the technical description for Lot 1131 and is signed by Soledad B. De Jesus, the registrar of the Bulacan RD.&nbsp; Thus, TCT No. T-17186 enjoys the presumption of regularity accorded to every public instrument and thus, cannot be collaterally attacked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners relied heavily on the alleged conclusiveness of Oliveros' title based on its earlier issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The appellate court affirmed the trial court's Decision.<br><br>After reviewing the factual findings of the trial court, the CA agreed that there is no evidence that Oliveros' title came from official sources.&nbsp; On the other hand, SMC adequately established the existence and validity of its title (TCT No. T-18460), as well as those of its predecessors' titles - those of Ramitex (TCT No. T-137261) and Soriano and Lozada (TCT No. 29334).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; Given that these titles exist in official sources, they are indefeasible unless and until credible evidence is presented to obtain their annulment on grounds of fraud. In this instance, the CA found that Oliveros failed to present such evidence and thus, sustained the validity of SMC's title.<br><br>The CA however found the trial court's award of P700,000.00 as attorney's fees excessive, and thus reduced the same to P100,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> which was denied for lack of merit in the appellate court's July 7, 2006 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners' Arguments</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Petitioners insist that the mere existence of Oliveros' earlier title negates the conclusiveness of Ramitex' title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; Oliveros' TCT No. T-17186, as the older title, should enjoy presumptive conclusiveness of ownership and indefeasibility of title.&nbsp; Corollarily, Ramitex's title being a later title should have the presumption of invalidity. Thus, SMC has the burden of overcoming this presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; Oliveros argues that SMC failed to prove the validity of its title, which should be cancelled accordingly.<br><br>Petitioners then assail the CA Decision for allowing a collateral attack on Oliveros' title.&nbsp; Since the complaint filed below was for the declaration of nullity of <i>Ramitex's title</i>, not Oliveros' title, what occurred below when the trial and appellate courts nullified Oliveros' title was a collateral attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Petitioners pray that Oliveros' title over Lot 1131 be declared valid; while that of SMC be declared null and void.<br><br><b><i>Respondents' Arguments</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Respondent SMC argues that the principle of indefeasibility of titles applies only to an existing valid title to the litigated property. In the instant case, SMC showed that Oliveros' title, while claiming priority, is actually spurious; thus, between SMC and Oliveros, it is only SMC which has a valid title and in whose favor the doctrine of indefeasibility of title applies.<br><br>SMC further stresses that Oliveros cannot assert a right by virtue of a title, the existence of which Oliveros cannot establish. By the best evidence rule, the contents of a title can only be proved by presenting the original document. Secondary evidence, such as the ones presented by Oliveros (photocopy of TCT No. T-17186, tax declaration, and unapproved land surveys), are inadmissible until the offeror has laid the predicate for the presentation of secondary evidence. In the instant case, Oliveros failed to lay the predicate for the presentation of secondary evidence.&nbsp; The certifications he presented from the various RDs attest only that their offices do not have a record of TCT No. T-17186.&nbsp; They did not certify that TCT No. T-17186 existed in their records but was destroyed or transferred to another office.<br><br>Moreover, Oliveros admits that his owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-17186 is in the possession of his vendee, DNG Realty. Since it is not lost or destroyed, Oliveros is not justified in not presenting it in court. Oliveros' explanation that DNG Realty will not lend him the title is unacceptable because there is legal recourse for such recalcitrance, which is to compel DNG Realty to present the duplicate copy in the instant case through a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>.<br><br>Lastly, SMC argues against the validity of Oliveros' title by reiterating the evidence they presented during trial.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b></center><br>Petitioners present the following issues for this Court's resolution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><ol><li>Whether the CA erred in applying the doctrines of indefeasibility and conclusiveness of title in favor of respondent SMC;<br><br></li><li>Whether the decisions of the CA and the trial court allowed a collateral attack on Oliveros' certificate of title.</li></ol><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>Petitioners contend that the CA erred in holding that it was their burden to prove the invalidity of SMC's title and that they failed to discharge such burden.&nbsp; They maintain that <i>the mere existence of a prior title in Oliveros' name</i> suffices to create the presumption that SMC's title, being the later title, is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> With that presumption, it was incumbent upon SMC to prove the validity of its alleged title.<br><br>Petitioners are oversimplifying the rule.&nbsp; The principle that the earlier title prevails over a subsequent one applies when there are two apparently valid titles over a single property. The existence of the earlier valid title renders the subsequent title void because a single property cannot be registered twice.&nbsp; As stated in <i>Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage Systems v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> which petitioners themselves cite, "a certificate is not conclusive evidence of title <b>if it is shown</b> that the same land had <b>already been registered</b> and an earlier certificate for the same <b>is in existence</b>."&nbsp; Clearly, a mere allegation of an earlier title will not suffice.<br><br>It is elementary that parties have the burden of proving their respective allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>&nbsp; Since petitioners allege that they have a title which was issued earlier than SMC's title, it was their burden to prove the alleged <i>existence</i> and <i>priority</i> of their title. The trial and appellate courts' shared conclusion that petitioners' TCT No. T-17186 <i>does not exist</i> in the official records is a finding of fact that is binding on this Court.&nbsp; Petitioners have not offered a reason or pointed to evidence that would justify overturning this finding.&nbsp; Neither did they assert that this factual finding is unsubstantiated by the records.&nbsp; Without a title, petitioners cannot assert priority or presumptive conclusiveness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In contrast to petitioners, SMC adequately proved its title to Lot 1131. SMC proved that its and its predecessors' titles to Lot 1131 all exist in the official records, and petitioners failed to present any convincing evidence to cast doubt on such titles.&nbsp; Thus, the CA correctly ruled that SMC's title enjoys presumptive conclusiveness and indefeasibility under the Torrens system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' argument that the ruling of the trial and appellate courts allowed a collateral attack on his title is clearly unmeritorious and easily disposed of.<br><br>In the first place, the prohibition against collateral attack does not apply to spurious or non-existent titles, since such titles do not enjoy indefeasibility. "Well-settled is the rule that the indefeasibility of a title does not attach to titles secured by fraud and misrepresentation.&nbsp; In view of these circumstances, it was as if no title was ever issued in this case to the petitioner and therefore this is hardly the occasion to talk of collateral attack against a title."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the attack on Oliveros' title was not a collateral attack.&nbsp; "An action or proceeding is deemed an attack on a title when the object of the action is to nullify the title, and thus challenge the judgment pursuant to which the title was decreed.&nbsp; The attack is direct when the object of the action is to annul or set aside such judgment, or to enjoin its enforcement.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is indirect or collateral when, in an action or proceeding to obtain a different relief, an attack on the judgment is nevertheless made as an incident thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Here, SMC/Ramitex assailed the validity of Oliveros' title as part of its counterclaim in an action to declare SMC/Ramitex's title a nullity. A counterclaim is essentially a complaint filed by the defendant against the plaintiff and stands on the same footing as an independent action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, Ramitex's counterclaim can be considered a direct attack on Oliveros' title.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The April 21, 2006 Decision and the July 7, 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
