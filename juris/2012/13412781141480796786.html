Verily, reinstatement cannot be and could not have been an option for petitioner Hotel.<br><br>For the purpose of proving financial losses, petitioner presented the financial statements of Waterfront Promotion, Ltd. which petitioner describes as the company which promotes, markets and finances the Club.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>A review of the corporate structure of the Club as contained in the financial statements submitted by petitioner reveals that it is actually a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waterfront Promotion, Ltd.&nbsp; Their corporate relationship is described as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Waterfront Promotion Ltd (“WPL”) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Club Waterfront International Limited (“CWIL”), were incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 6, 1995 and June 11, 1996, respectively.&nbsp; WPL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waterfront Philippines, Incorporated (“WPI”), a company registered with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).<br><br>WPL and CWIL invite and organize groups of foreign casino players to play in Philippine casinos pursuant to certain agreements entered into with the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (“PAGCOR”) under the latter’s Foreign Highroller Marketing Program (“the Program”).<br><br>To support the Program, WPL and CWIL entered into several agreements with certain parties also known as junket operators to market and promote the Philippine casinos to foreign casino players.&nbsp; In consideration for marketing and promoting the Philippine casinos, these operators receive certain incentives such as free hotel accommodations, free airfares, and rolling commissions from WPL and CWIL.<br><br>The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that WPL and CWIL will continue in existence.&nbsp; The validity of this assumption is dependent upon WPL and CWIL to meet their financing requirements on a continuing basis and the success of their future operations.&nbsp; Management continues to look for other business opportunities and intends to run WPL and CWIL as going concerns.<br><br>At present, both WPL and CWIL have temporarily stopped their operations.&nbsp; The Management decided to temporarily cease the operations of WPL and CWIL on June 2003 and November 2001 respectively, due to unfavorable economic conditions.&nbsp; However, the Management of Waterfront Philippines, Incorporated (WPI), the Ultimate Parent Company, has given an undertaking to provide necessary support in order for the Company to continue as a going concern.<br><br>WPL’s principal office is located in George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, British West Indies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>In turn, Waterfront Promotion, Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waterfront Philippines.&nbsp; Petitioner Hotel, as shown in the official records, is also another subsidiary of Waterfront Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Strictly speaking, the Club is not related to petitioner except to say that they are two different subsidiaries of one parent corporation, i.e., Waterfront Philippines.&nbsp; Petitioner, then, could have right at the beginning avoided the conflict with respondents by setting itself apart from them.&nbsp; Petitioner could have invoked the separateness from the Hotel of the Club which employed respondents. Petitioner did not do so.&nbsp; Instead, and at the outset, it formally presented itself as the respondents’ employer when, through its Director of Human Resources, it informed respondents about the temporary suspension of the business of the Club and forthwith served the notices of suspension of business on DOLE.<br><br>We find the consolidated financial statements that were prepared in the name of Waterfront Promotion refer to the casino operations of the Club.&nbsp; A consolidated financial statement is usually prepared for a parent company and its subsidiaries, the purpose of which is to provide an overview of the financial condition of the group of companies as a single entity.&nbsp; The Club, being a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waterfront Promotion, Ltd. operates under the management, supervision and control of Waterfront Promotion, Ltd.&nbsp; The relationship between these two companies is so intertwined that the Club is practically considered a department or division of Waterfront Promotion, Ltd.<br><br>A review of the consolidated financial statement shows that for the fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the parent company and the consolidated companies reflect the same amounts of losses: United States (U.S.) $2,791,104.00 for 2002 and U.S. $765,222.00 for 2003.&nbsp; This proves petitioner’s assertion that the losses there reflected refer to the losses of the Club.<br><br>The consolidated financial statement and the corporate relationships it indicates, cannot, however, be relied upon by petitioner to avoid this particular labor dispute because, as already stated, petitioner itself has been claiming from the very beginning that the Club is only a division/department of the hotel.<br><br>Verily, retrenchment and not closure was effected to warrant the valid dismissal of respondents.&nbsp; Petitioner has not totally ceased its operations.&nbsp; It merely closed down a department.<br><br>Retrenchment is the termination of employment initiated by the employer through no fault of and without prejudice to the employees. It is resorted to during periods of business recession, industrial depression, or seasonal fluctuations or during lulls occasioned by lack of orders, shortage of materials, conversion of the plant for a new production program or the introduction of new methods or more efficient machinery or of automation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; It is an act of the employer of dismissing employees because of losses in the operation of a business, lack of work, and considerable reduction on the volume of his business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In case of retrenchment, proof of financial losses becomes the determining factor in proving its legitimacy.&nbsp; In establishing a unilateral claim of actual or potential losses, financial statements audited by independent external auditors constitute the normal method of proof of profit and loss performance of a company.&nbsp; The condition of business losses justifying retrenchment is normally shown by audited financial documents like yearly balance sheets and profit and loss statements as well as annual income tax returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Retrenchment is subject to faithful compliance with the substantative and procedural requirements laid down by law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; For a valid retrenchment, the following elements must be present:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">That retrenchment is reasonably necessary and likely to prevent business losses which, if already incurred, are not merely <em>de minimis,</em> but substantial, serious, actual and real, or if only expected, are reasonably imminent as perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer served written notice both to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer pays the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least ½ month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer exercises its prerogative to retrench employees in good faith for the advancement of its interest and not to defeat or circumvent the employees’ right to security of tenure; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(5)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">That the employer used fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining who would be dismissed and who would be retained among the employees, such as status, efficiency, seniority, physical fitness, age, and financial hardship for certain workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>All these elements were successfully proven by petitioner.&nbsp; First, the huge losses suffered by the Club for the past two years had forced petitioner to close it down to avert further losses which would eventually affect the operations of&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; Second, all 45 employees working under the Club were served with notice of termination. The corresponding notice was likewise served to the DOLE one month prior to retrenchment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Third, the employees were offered separation pay, most of whom have accepted and opted not to join in this complaint.&nbsp; Fourth, cessation of or withdrawal from business operations was <i>bona fide</i> in character and not impelled by a motive to defeat or circumvent the tenurial rights of employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; As a matter of fact, as of this writing, the Club has not resumed operations.&nbsp; Neither is there a showing that petitioner carried out the closure of the business in bad faith.&nbsp; No labor dispute existed between management and the employees when the latter were terminated.<br><br>Finally, we affirm the NLRC’s award and computation of separation pay in favor of respondents.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The 5 July 2006 Decision and 15 August 2006 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA- G.R.
