They insist that they never agreed to give petitioners one-half of their respective properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; Neither did they agree to reimburse petitioner Ching all the expenses incurred in obtaining the loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner Ching, in fact, admitted in court that he agreed to shoulder all the expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; Also, petitioners are not entitled to exemplary damages because when respondents revoked the SPA, they did not act in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>There is no question that the SPA executed by respondents in favor of petitioners is a contract of agency coupled with interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; This is because their bilateral contract depends upon the agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, it “cannot be revoked at the sole will of the principal.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The only issue therefore is the extent of the liability of respondents and the damages to be awarded to petitioners.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner Ching is entitled to actual <br>damages in the amount of P500,000.00 <br>without any condition.</i></b><br><br>In exchange for his possession of the titles, petitioner Ching advanced the amount of P500,000.00 to respondents.&nbsp; Considering that the loan application with PVB did not push through, respondents are liable to return the said amount to petitioner Ching.<br><br>In ordering the award of P500,000.00, the CA decreed:<br><br><blockquote>2.&nbsp; The amount of P500,000.00 paid by the [petitioner] Ching to the [respondents] should be deducted from the amount to be loaned;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>Obviously, the language employed by the CA made the judgment conditional.&nbsp; The return of the amount of P500,000.00 should not depend on the happening of a future event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; Whether or not a loan is obtained by petitioners, respondents are liable to pay the amount of P500,000.00 as actual damages.&nbsp; Thus, the dispositive portion of the CA Decision should be modified by ordering respondents to pay actual damages in the amount of P500,000.00, without any condition.<br><br>Petitioners are not entitled to one-half of the subject properties.<br><br>As to petitioners’ claim to one-half of the subject properties, we agree with the CA that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x it is far from human experience that a person will give half of his property to another person whom he barely knows.&nbsp; It is clear from the records of the case that the [respondents] do not know [petitioner] Ching.&nbsp; It was [petitioner] Bautista who introduced him to [respondent] Bantolo.&nbsp; The [respondents] agreed to give an SPA to Ching, because they were informed that the latter could help them secure a loan with their pieces of property as collateral.&nbsp; No one in his right mind would definitely agree to give half of his property to another.&nbsp; It is certain that they agreed that they would share in the proceeds of the loan but not in the property.&nbsp; <b>Hence, [petitioners] are not entitled to one-half of the property.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In fact, other than petitioner Ching’s self-serving testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> no evidence was presented to show that respondents agreed to give one-half of the properties to petitioners.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners are not entitled to reimbursement <br>of all the expenses incurred in obtaining a loan.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner Ching testified in court that he agreed to shoulder all the expenses, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">Atty.
