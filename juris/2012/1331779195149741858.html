On March 15, 2000, Zagala died, leaving the respondents to answer the charges in the criminal cases.<br><br>After the pre-trial conference, a joint trial of the criminal cases ensued. The prosecution's chief evidence was based on the lone testimony of Commission of Audit (<i>COA</i>) Auditor Iluminada Cortez and the documentary evidence used in the audit examination of the subject funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The gist of COA Auditor Cortez' direct testimony was summarized by the Sandiganbaya, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><u>In Criminal Case No. 20345 -</u><br><br>[s]he was appointed on March 31, 1986 by then COA Chairman Teofisto Guingona, Jr. to head a team of COA auditors. Upon examination of the documents, she declared that an amount of P100 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) from the Office of Budget and Management was released for the KSS Project of the Ministry of Human Settlements (MHS) by virtue of an Advice of Allotment for Calendar Year 1984. Also, an amount of P42.4 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was separately disbursed for the Kabisig Program of the Ministry of Human Settlements. With regard to the amount of P100 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) received by the MHS, P60 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) [was] disbursed through cash advances. Of the P60 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) in cash advances, accused Zagala received P40 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) in four (4) disbursements while accused Dulay received the remaining P20 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) in two disbursements.<br><br>With respect to accused Rafael Zagala, the cash advances consist of four (4) disbursement vouchers in the amount of P5 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>), P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>), P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) and P15 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>). All of these vouchers are in the name of accused Zagala as claimant and accused Benitez as approving officer and are accompanied by their corresponding Treasury Warrants that were countersigned by accused Benitez and approved by accused Dulay.<br><br>In contrast, x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; a disbursement voucher in the amount of P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was drawn in favor of accused Gilbert Dulay and approved by accused Benitez. Pursuant to this, a Treasury Warrant was issued to the order of accused Dulay, countersigned by accused Benitez and approved by accused Zagala. Another voucher was drawn in favor of accused Dulay in the amount of P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) and approved by accused Benitez. Again, a Treasury Warrant was issued to the order of accused Dulay in the amount of P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>), which was countersigned by accused Benitez and approved by accused Zagala.<br><br>x&nbsp; x x&nbsp; [A]ccused Marcos sent a letter to then President Ferdinand E. Marcos requesting that the fund intended for the KSS Project in the amount of P100 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) be deemed as "Confidential Fund".<br><br>x&nbsp; x x&nbsp; [T]he liquidation of accused Zagala's account, which was contained in a Journal Voucher dated November 27, 1984, was without any supporting documents. Upon this discovery, witness requested and secured a certification from the Manager of the National Government Audit Office to the effect that the COA did not receive any document coming from the MHS. However, this liquidation voucher which contained figures in the total amount of P50 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>), comprised the entire cash advances of accused Zagala in the amount of P40 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) and the P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) cash advance made by accused Dulay. Since the amount of P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was already contained in Zagala's Journal Voucher, the witness and her team of auditors tried to locate the remaining P10 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) and found out that accused Dulay had liquidated the same amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (footnotes omitted)</blockquote><br>According to COA Auditor Cortez, Zagala's cash advances were supported by a liquidation report and supporting documents submitted to the resident auditor even before the P100 Million Kilusang Sariling Sikap (<i>KSS</i>) fund was made confidential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The witness also testified that the COA resident auditor found no irregularity in this liquidation report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>COA Auditor Cortez stated that since the P100 Million KSS fund was classified as confidential, the liquidation report should have been submitted to the COA Chairman who should have then issued a <i>credit memo</i>. No <i>credit memo</i> was ever found during the audit examination of the MHS accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; COA Auditor Cortez admitted that she did not verify whether the supporting documents of Zagala's cash advances were sent to the COA Chairman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Respondent Marcos was prosecuted because of her participation as Minister of the MHS, in requesting that the P100 Million KSS fund be declared confidential. Respondent Benitez was prosecuted because he was the approving officer in these disputed transactions.<br><br><blockquote><u>In Criminal Case No. 20346 </u>-<br><br>Regarding the Kabisig Program of the MHS, the COA team of auditors examined the vouchers of the MHS, which upon inspection revealed that there were at least three (3) memoranda of agreements entered into between the MHS and University of Life (UL).&nbsp; With reference to the first Memorandum of Agreement dated July 2, 1985, an amount of P21.6 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was transferred by the MHS to the UL to pay for the operations of the Community Mobilization Program and the Kabisig Program of the MHS. Accused Benitez as the Deputy Minister of the MHS and accused Dulay as Vice President of the UL were the signatories of this agreement. Although there is no disbursement voucher in the records, it is admitted that a Treasury Warrant was drawn in the sum of P21.6 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>). The second Memorandum of Agreement dated July 10, 1985 provided for a fund transfer in the amount of P3.8 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) for the Human Resources Development Plan of the MHS. Accordingly, a Disbursement Voucher certified by accused Dulay and approved by accused Benitez was drawn in the sum of P3.8 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>). The third Memorandum of Agreement in the sum of P17 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was granted for the acquisition of motor vehicles and other equipment to support the Kabisig Program of the MHS. For that reason, a Disbursement Voucher pertaining thereto accompanied by a Treasury Warrant was drafted.<br><br>Similarly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the witness declared that although they did not examine any of the records of the UL, the abovementioned sums were not received by the UL based on the affidavit of</span> the UL Comptroller named Pablo Cueto. In the same way, an affidavit was executed by the UL Chief Accountant named Ernesto Jiao attesting that there is no financial transaction on record covering the purchase of motor vehicles. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Again, witness Cortez admitted that they did not examine the books of the UL on this matter but only inquired about it from Mr. Jiao</span>. The affidavit of Mr. Jiao with respect to the nonexistence of the purchases of motor vehicles was further corroborated by the affidavit of one Romeo Sison, who was the Administrative Assistant of the Property Section of the UL.<br><br>The respective treasury warrants representing the various sums of P21.6 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>), P17 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) and P3.8 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) were subsequently deposited with the United Coconut Planters' Bank (UCPB), Shaw Blvd. Branch, Mandaluyong, under various accounts. Soon after, several checks were drawn out of these funds as evidenced by the Photostat copies recovered by the COA auditors. In the course of the testimony of the witness, she revealed that her team of auditors classified said several checks into different groups in accordance with the account numbers of the said deposits.<br><br>x x&nbsp; x&nbsp; [T]he amount of P3.8 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>), the same was intended for the Human Resource Development Plan of the UL. x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x [T]he aforesaid amount is not a cash advance but rather paid as an expense account, which is charged directly as if services have already been rendered. Hence, UL is not mandated to render liquidation for the disbursement of P3.8 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>).<br><br>The sums of P21.6 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) and P17 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) were deposited under x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; the name of the UL Special Account. Out of these deposits, the following first sequence of withdrawals of checks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; payable either to its order or to cash&nbsp; x&nbsp; x x&nbsp; reached a total sum of P5,690,750.93 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>).<br><br>The second list of checks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> [which] consists of numerous [Manager's] Checks x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x reached the amount of P18,416,062.15.<br><br>A third set of checks allegedly consists of nine (9) ordinary checks and two (2) manager's checks in the sum of P1,971,568.00 and P4,566,712.18[,] respectively.&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br><br>Moreover, [a] witness confirmed that as regards the amount of P17 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) intended for the acquisition of motor vehicles, P10.4 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was spent for the purchase of some five hundred (500) units of motorcycles while P2.1 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was used to procure eight (8) brand new cars. The balance of P4.5 Million Pesos (<i>sic</i>) was later refunded to the MHS. As regards the five hundred (500) units of motorcycle, the Presidential Task Force furnished the witness documents attesting to the transfers of some two hundred seventy-one (271) units of motorcycles from the UL to the MHS by virtue of Deed of Assignments allegedly executed on February 17, 1986. However, of the two hundred seventy-one (271) units of motorcycle, only one hundred ninety (190) units were covered with complete documents. With respect to the eight (8) brand new cars, the team of auditors did not see any registration papers. (footnotes omitted; underscorings ours)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>COA Auditor Cortez admitted that the audit team did not conduct a physical inventory of these motor vehicles; it based its report on the information given by the Presidential Task Force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; She emphasized that the audit team found it highly irregular that the motor vehicles were registered in the name of University of Life (<i>UL</i>) and not in the name of MHS; and for this reason, she believed that no proper liquidation was made of these vehicles by MHS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After COA Auditor Cortez' testimony, the prosecution submitted its formal offer of evidence and rested its case.<br><br>Subsequently, <b>separate motions to dismiss the criminal cases, by way of demurrers to evidence</b>, were filed by Zagala and the respondents on November 15, 1997, January 5, 1998 and January 28, 1998; on January 27, 1998, <b>the prosecution filed a Manifestation stating that it was not opposing the demurrers to evidence</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>The Sandiganbayan's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>The Sandiganbayan granted the demurrers to evidence<i> </i>and acquitted the respondents in its assailed decision dated March 22, 2002.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of this decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Wherefore, the Demurrers to Evidence are hereby granted.

It claims that the prosecutor failed to protect the State's interest in the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan. To support its position, petitioner cites the case of <i>Merciales v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> where the Court nullified the dismissal of the criminal cases due to the serious nonfeasance committed by the public prosecutor.<br><br>The petitioner argues that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction that resulted in a miscarriage of justice prejudicial to the State's interest when it took the demurrers to evidence<i> </i>at face value instead of requiring the presentation of additional evidence, taking into consideration the huge amounts of public funds involved and the special prosecutor's failure to oppose the demurrers to evidence.<br><br><center><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br><b>We do not find the petition meritorious</b>.<br><br>We are called to overturn a judgment of acquittal in favor of the respondents brought about by the dismissal, for insufficiency of evidence, of the malversation charged in the two criminal cases.&nbsp; As a rule, once the court grants the demurrer, the grant amounts to an acquittal; any further prosecution of the accused would violate the constitutional proscription on double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Notably, the proscription against double jeopardy only envisages appeals based on errors of judgment, but not errors of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Jurisprudence recognizes two grounds where double jeopardy will not attach, these are: (i) on the ground of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and/or (ii) where there is a denial of a party's due process rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>A judgment of acquittal sought to be reviewed on the basis of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction or on the ground of denial of due process implies an invalid or otherwise <b>void judgment</b>.

In upholding the prosecution's right to present additional evidence under the circumstances, <i>Valencia</i> took into account the fact that the former special prosecutor rested his case solely on the basis of a Joint Stipulation of Facts that was not even signed by the accused.<br><br>These two cases, to our mind, not only show the existing factual considerations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> that led to the conclusion that the public prosecutor willfully and deliberately failed to perform his mandated duty to represent the State's interest, but stress as well that there must be sufficient facts on record supporting this conclusion. In the absence of these supporting facts, no conclusion similar to the <i>Merciales </i>and <i>Valencia</i><i> </i>outcomes can be reached.<br><br>The requirement for supporting factual premises finds complement in the general rule founded on public policy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> that the negligence or mistake of a counsel binds the client. While this rule admits of exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (as when the gross negligence of a counsel resulted in depriving the client of due process), the application of the exception likewise depends on a showing of facts on record demonstrating a clear violation of the client's due process rights.<br><br><b><i>II. </i></b><b><i>The factual premises cited in the petition and the issue of due process </i></b><br><br>In the present case, we find that the State was not denied due process in the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan. There was no indication that the special prosecutor deliberately and willfully failed to present available evidence or that other evidence could be secured. For purposes of clarity, we shall address the instances cited in the petition as alleged proof of the denial of the State's due process rights, and our reasons in finding them inadequate.<br><br><b><i>First.</i></b><b> </b>The petitioner bewails the alleged lack of efforts by the special prosecutor to ascertain the last known addresses and whereabouts, and to compel the attendance of Pablo C. Cueto, Ernesto M. Jiao and Romeo F. Sison, UL officers who executed affidavits in connection with the alleged anomalous fund transfers from MHS to UL.<br><br>The special prosecutor likewise allegedly did not present the records of the UL to show that the sums under the Memoranda of Agreement were not received by UL (based on the affidavit of UL Comptroller Cueto) and that no financial transactions really took place for the purchase of the motor vehicles (based on the affidavit of UL Chief Accountant Jiao, as corroborated by the affidavit of UL Administrative Assistant Sison).<br><br>We note that, other than making a claim that these instances demonstrate the serious nonfeasance by the special prosecutor, the petitioner failed to offer any explanation showing how these instances deprived the State of due process. An examination of the records shows that the affidavits of Cueto,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Jiao and Sison surfaced early on to prove the alleged anomalous fund transfers from MHS to UL. The records further show that during the hearing of December 5, 1995 - when the special prosecutor was asked by the presiding judge what she intended to do with these affidavits - the special prosecutor replied that she <i>planned to present Jiao and Cueto</i> who were the chief accountant and the designated comptroller, respectively, of UL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; The same records, however, show that, indeed, an attempt had been made to bring these prospective witnesses to court; as early as April 20, 1994, subpoenas had been issued to these three individuals and these were all returned unserved because the subjects had RESIGNED from the service sometime in 1992, and their present whereabouts were unknown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><sup></sup><br><br>We consider at this point that these individuals executed their respective affidavits on the alleged anomalous transactions between MHS and UL sometime in 1986; from that period on, and until the actual criminal prosecution started in 1994, a considerable time had elapsed bringing undesirable changes - one of which was the disappearance of these prospective witnesses.<br><br>Significantly, no evidence exists or has been submitted showing that the special prosecutor willfully and deliberately opted not to present these individuals. The petitioner also failed to show that the whereabouts of these individuals could have been located by the exercise of reasonable diligence in order to prove that the special prosecutor had been remiss in performing her duties.&nbsp; We can in fact deduce from the allegations in the petition that even at present, the petitioner has not and cannot ascertain the whereabouts of these prospective witnesses.<br><br>Further, the records show that the affidavits of these individuals (who denied the transfer of the funds in the amounts of P21.6 Million, P3.8 Million and P17 Million from MHS to UL) were <i>refuted by contrary evidence of the prosecution </i>itself.&nbsp; The records indicate that the special prosecutor presented treasury warrants and disbursement vouchers issued in the name of UL, bearing the respective amounts for transactions between MHS and UL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The special prosecutor admitted that the audit team failed to examine the records of UL to support the prosecution's allegation of an anomalous fund transfer. COA Auditor Cortez admitted, too, that the amounts (P21.6 Million and P3.8 Million) were transferred<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> to UL<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and that a portion of the amount of P17 Million, <i>i.e.</i>, P12.5 Million, was used to purchase 500 motorcycles and eight cars, while the remaining amount of P4.5 Million was refunded by UL to MHS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Under these facts, and in the absence of indicators too that other persons could have testified, we cannot give weight to the petitioner's allegation that no efforts were exerted by the special prosecutor. On the contrary, we find under the circumstances that the special prosecutor exerted reasonable efforts to present these individuals in court, but failed to do so for reasons beyond her control. One of these reasons appears to be the simple lack of concrete evidence of irregularities in the respondents' handling of the MHS funds.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b><b>. </b>The petitioner alleged that the special prosecutor failed to present the resident auditor to testify on the physical inventory of the vehicles, or to produce documents showing that an inspection was conducted on the vehicles.<br><br>The prosecution's theory, as the records would show, was to prove that there had been misappropriation of funds since the motor vehicles were registered in UL's name instead of the MHS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In this regard, the special prosecutor presented COA Auditor Cortez who testified that the audit team did not assail the existence of the motor vehicles and she also did not dispute that the amount of P12.5 Million (out of P17 Million) was used to purchase 500 motorcycles and eight cars. The witness stated that the audit team was more concerned with the documentation of the disbursements made rather than the physical liquidation (inventory) of the funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; The witness further explained that it was the Presidential Task Force which had the duty to keep track of the existence of the motor vehicles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> She reiterated that the audit team was only questioning the registration of the vehicles; it never doubted that the vehicles were purchased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>More importantly, COA Auditor Cortez stated that at the time the team made the audit examination in April 1986, 500 registration papers supported the purchase of these motorcycles;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> none of the audit team at that time found this documentation inadequate or anomalous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The witness also stated that the Presidential Task Force gave the audit team a folder showing that P10.4 Million was used to purchase the motorcycles and P2.1 Million was used to purchase the cars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Checks were presented indicating the dates when the purchase of some of the motor vehicles was made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; COA Auditor Cortez also testified that 270 of these motorcycles had already been transferred by UL in the name of MHS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; She stated that all the documents are in order except for the registration of the motor vehicles in the name of UL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Given these admissions regarding the existence of the motor vehicles, the presentation of the resident auditor who would simply testify on the physical inventory of the motor vehicles, or that an inspection had been conducted thereon, was unnecessary.&nbsp; Her presentation in court would not materially reinforce the prosecution's case; thus, the omission to present her did not deprive the State of due process.&nbsp; To repeat, the prosecution's theory of misappropriation was not based on the fact that the funds were not used to purchase motor vehicles, in which case, the testimony of the resident auditor would have had material implications. Rather, the prosecution's theory, as established by the records, shows that the imputed misappropriation stemmed from the registration of the motor vehicles in UL's name - an administrative lapse in light of the relationship of UL to MHS simply as an implementing agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><b><i>Third.</i></b> Despite the Sandiganbayan's warning on June 7, 1996 that the various checks covering the cash advances for P40 Million were "photostatic" copies, the special prosecutor still failed to present the certified copies from the legal custodian of these commercial documents.<br><br>The petitioner faults the special prosecutor for failing to present the original copies of the checks drawn out of the P21.6 Million and P17 Million combination account from the United Coconut Planters Bank (<i>UCPB</i>), as well as the P3.8 Million expense account with the same bank. The presentation would have allegedly proven the misappropriation of these amounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Records show that instead of presenting the original copies of these checks, the special prosecutor tried to establish, through the testimony of COA Auditor Cortez, that these checks were photocopied from the original checks in the possession of UCPB, which were obtained through the assistance of the UL management.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, while the originals of these checks were not presented, COA Auditor Cortez testified that the photostatic copies were furnished by the UCPB which had custody of the original checks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Further, the witness also testified that at the time she made the examination of these documents, the entries thereon were legible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> She also presented a summary schedule of the <i>various micro film prints </i>of the UCPB checks that she examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><i> </i><br><br>At any rate, we observe that the defense never objected<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; to the submission of the photostatic copies of the UCPB checks as evidence, thus making the production of the originals dispensable. This was our view in <i>Estrada v. Hon.

COA Auditor Cortez directly testified on the audit team's findings and examination, which took three hearings to complete; the cross-examination of COA Auditor Cortez took two hearings to complete; and subsequently, the Sandiganbayan ordered that a clarificatory hearing be held with respect to COA Auditor Cortez' testimony.&nbsp; In addition to her testimony, the special prosecutor did present, too, other pieces of documentary evidence (from which the final audit report was based) before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to consider the special prosecutor's omission as significant in the petitioner's allegation of serious nonfeasance or misfeasance.<br><br><b><i>Fifth. </i></b>The petitioner presents the special prosecutor's failure to oppose the demurrer to evidence as its last point and as basis for the applicability of the <i>Merciales</i> ruling.<br><br>The failure to oppose <i>per se</i> cannot be a ground for grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; The real issue, to our mind, is whether the special prosecutor had basis to act as she did. As the point-by-point presentation above shows, the dismissal of the criminal cases cannot be attributed to any grossly negligent handling by the special prosecutor. To begin with, the prosecution's case suffered from lack of witnesses because, among others, of the time that elapsed between the act charged and the start of the actual prosecution in 1994; and from lack of sufficient preparatory investigation conducted, resulting in insufficiency of its evidence as a whole. In sum, in the absence of circumstances approximating the facts of <i>Merciales </i>and <i>Valencia</i>, which circumstances the petitioner failed to show, no basis exists to conclude that the special prosecutor grossly erred in failing to oppose the demurrer to evidence.<br><br>Neither are we persuaded by the petitioner's position that the special prosecutor's Manifestation of non-opposition to the demurrer needed to be submitted to, and approved by, her superiors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; The petitioner's argument assumes that the special prosecutor lacked the necessary authority from her superiors when she filed her non-opposition to the demurrers to evidence.&nbsp; This starting assumption, in our view, is incorrect.&nbsp; The correct premise and presumption, since the special prosecutor is a State delegate, is that she had all incidental and necessary powers to prosecute the case in the State's behalf so that her actions as a State delegate bound the State.&nbsp; We do not believe that the State can have an unbridled discretion to disown the acts of its delegates at will unless it can clearly establish that its agent had been grossly negligent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> or was guilty of collusion with the accused or other interested party,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> resulting in the State's deprivation of its due process rights as client-principal.<br><br>Gross negligence exists where there is want, or absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care. It involves a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As the above discussions show, the State failed to clearly establish the gross negligence on the part of the special prosecutor (or to show or even allege that there was collusion in the principal case between the special prosecutor and the respondents) that resulted in depriving the petitioner of its due process rights; and, consequently prevent the application of the rule on double jeopardy. <b>If at all, what the records emphasized, as previously discussed, is the<i> weakness </i>of the prosecution's evidence as a whole rather than the gross negligence of the special prosecutor</b>. In these lights, we must reject the petitioner's position.<br><br><b><i>III. </i></b><b><i>Grave abuse of discretion </i></b><br><br>Under the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the Sandiganbayan is under no obligation to require the parties to present additional evidence when a demurrer to evidence is filed.&nbsp; In a criminal proceeding, the burden lies with the prosecution to prove that the accused committed the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt, as the constitutional presumption of innocence ordinarily stands in favor of the accused. Whether the Sandiganbayan will intervene in the course of the prosecution of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction, competence and discretion, provided that its actions do not result in the impairment of the substantial rights of the accused, or of the right of the State and of the offended party to due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>A discussion of the violation of the State's right to due process in the present case, however, is intimately linked with the gross negligence or the fraudulent action of the State's agent. The absence of this circumstance in the present case cannot but have a negative impact on how the petitioner would want the Court to view the Sandiganbayan's actuation and exercise of discretion.<br><br>The court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, <i>may</i> require or allow the prosecution to present additional evidence (at its own initiative or upon a motion) after a <i>demurrer to evidence </i>is filed. This exercise, however, must be for good reasons and in the paramount interest of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>&nbsp; As mentioned, the court may require the presentation of further evidence if its action on the demurrer to evidence would patently result in the denial of due process; it may also allow the presentation of additional evidence if it is newly discovered, if it was omitted through inadvertence or mistake, or if it is intended to correct the evidence previously offered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In this case, we cannot attribute grave abuse of discretion to the Sandiganbayan when it exercised restraint and did not require the presentation of additional evidence, given the clear weakness of the case at that point.&nbsp; We note that under the obtaining circumstances, the petitioner failed to show <i>what and how additional available</i> evidence could have helped and the paramount interest of justice sought to be achieved.&nbsp; It does not appear that pieces of evidence had been omitted through inadvertence or mistake, or that these pieces of evidence are intended to correct evidence previously offered. More importantly, it does not appear that<i> these contemplated additional pieces of evidence (which the special prosecutor allegedly should have presented) were ever present and available.</i> For instance, at no point in the records did the petitioner unequivocally state that it could present the three UL officers, <i>Cueto, Jiao </i>and<i> Sison</i>.&nbsp; The petitioner also failed to demonstrate its possession of or access to these documents (such as the <i>final audit report</i>) to support the prosecution's charges - the proof that the State had been deprived of due process due to the special prosecutor's alleged inaction.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>IIIa. Grave abuse of discretion and the demurrers to evidence</i></b><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 20345 that charged conspiracy for abstracting P57.59 Million out of the P100 Million KSS fund, the prosecution's evidence showed that P60 Million of this fund was disbursed by respondent Benitez, as approving officer, in the nature of cash advances to Zagala (who received a total amount of P40 Million) and Dulay (who received P20 Million).<br><br>To prove the misappropriation, the prosecution tried to establish that there was an irregularity in the procedure of liquidating these amounts on the basis of COA Auditor Cortez' testimony that the liquidation should have been made before the COA Chairman (not to the resident auditor of the MHS) because these funds were confidential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Quite evident from the prosecution's position is that it did not dispute whether a liquidation had been made of the whole amount of P60 Million; rather, what it disputed was the identity of the person before whom the liquidation should have been made. Before the directive of former President Marcos was made which declared the KSS funds (of which the P60 Million formed part) to be confidential, the liquidation of this amount must be made before the resident auditor of the MHS.&nbsp; With the issuance of the directive, liquidation should have been made to the COA Chairman who should have then issued a credit memo to prove proper liquidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>To justify conviction for malversation of public funds, the prosecution has to prove that the accused received public funds or property that they could not account for, or was not in their possession and which they could not give a reasonable excuse for the disappearance of such public funds or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The prosecution failed in this task as the subject funds were liquidated and were not shown to have been converted for personal use by the respondents.<br><br>The records reveal that the amounts of P50 Million and P10 Million were liquidated by Zagala and Dulay, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> On Zagala's part, the liquidation of P50 Million (P10 Million of which was the cash advance given to Dulay) was made to resident auditor Flerida V.
