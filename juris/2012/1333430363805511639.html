Ano?</i>”&nbsp; His brother went down and Rommel Hina was moaning.&nbsp; The tricycle came from his left side.&nbsp; When Adallom fired his gun, Danilo turned his head and tried to run but he was hit at the back.&nbsp; He himself, when he saw the gunfire just closed his eyes and leaned against the wall and turned his head to the right and moved his leg downward just waiting for what would happen next.&nbsp; When his brother and Rommel fell, the firing stopped and when he turned his head, he noticed that Adallom upon seeing him alive, again fired successive shots and then he heard, “<i>tak-tak.</i>”&nbsp; The gun must have jammed then he heard another burst of gunfire, “<i>rat-tat-tat.</i>”&nbsp; He sought cover beside a vehicle and ran.&nbsp; He showed some pictures and pointed to the place he testified on (see Exhibit A).&nbsp; There were bullet marks shown in the pictures (Exhibit B).&nbsp; He ran to an alley and then he went back to Senatorial Road where the incident happened and saw people milling around.&nbsp; His brother was already dead while Rommel Hina was rushed to the hospital.&nbsp; Noel Adallom, a long time resident of their place is the cousin of the husband of his sister while Johnwayne Lindawan is the son of his brother-in-law.&nbsp; During the wake of his brother, he saw Johnwayne with a new haircut.&nbsp; Adallom also had a new haircut.&nbsp; They used to have long hair prior to the incident.&nbsp; Both of them were sporting army cut.&nbsp; He tried to watch Adallom’s movements.&nbsp; He saw him fixing the gate of his house and when he could not take it anymore he told Jeanette, the wife of his brother Danilo Villareal, that what Adallom was doing was very insulting.&nbsp; He did not give any statement to the police because there was still the wake and he wanted to consult Jeanette who was very confused.&nbsp; He knows that it is hard to fight an Ifugao.&nbsp; After the funeral, he told his siblings about the incident.&nbsp; They decided to have Adallom arrested.&nbsp; His Ate Jeanette went to Station 6 but the police were not cooperative and he was losing heart.&nbsp; On November 19, 2001, he saw Adallom alight in front of his house.&nbsp; He asked his siblings to go to the barangay hall while he waited for Adallom because he might leave.&nbsp; When the barangay people came, they picked him up and informed him about the complaint against him.&nbsp; Adallom was detained at the barangay hall and taken at Station 6.&nbsp; Babelito executed a <i>sinumpaang salaysay</i> marked Exhibit C.<br><br>On cross examination, among others, he said that Adallom’s house is just near the eskinita.&nbsp; The following day when he saw Adallom sporting a new haircut, he tried to keep track of his movements.&nbsp; He did that for several days.&nbsp; He was shown a sketch marked as Exhibit D for the prosecution and said, the house of his sister was along Senatorial Road at the corner of an alley in Avocado Street.&nbsp; After Adallom alighted from the tricycle, he positioned himself before he fired the shots.&nbsp; When Babelito returned to the scene of the incident, he instructed some people to bring Rommel Hina to the hospital.&nbsp; He saw Agustin Adallom and Anderson Tuguinay that night.&nbsp; He saw Adallom’s wife by the gate of their house.&nbsp; He did not see Noel Adallom after the incident.&nbsp; The police investigators came to the scene and he went with them to the Criminal Investigation Unit.&nbsp; The investigator was Lawa-Lawa.&nbsp; When he was about to give a statement at the Criminal Investigation Unit, Nathaniel Hina, the father of Rommel appeared and he was telling a different story.&nbsp; Nathaniel was a usual drinking companion of Noel Adallom.&nbsp; Immediately prior to the incident, Rommel’s father was coming down from the tricycle with some companions, the <i>barkada</i> of Noel Adallom, he passed by the eskinita and took a look at them.&nbsp; That was before the tricycle with Adallom as passenger passed by.&nbsp; At the police precinct Rommel’s father was saying that it was another Ifugao, a certain Hubert who was responsible for the shooting.&nbsp; Because of this incident with the father of Rommel, he did not give a statement.&nbsp; He reiterated that he saw his brother hit as he was slowly moving his head and then he closed his eyes.&nbsp; After the first burst of gunfire it stopped for a while.&nbsp; When the gunman saw him, he raised his gun again and pointed it at him then he heard, <i>“pak.”</i>&nbsp; It did not fire then he heard successive shots.&nbsp; He saw Adallom with the carbine only that night but he knew that his family has a carbine.&nbsp; He was shown a photograph marked Exhibit 2 depicting the wall of his sister Nanette’s store marked as Exhibits A and B.&nbsp; There were no chairs in front of the store even when they were drinking.&nbsp; He was there first before Danilo and Rommel arrived.&nbsp; There were also two women who came thirty (30) minutes prior to the incident Danilo and Rommel had been drinking in front of his house.&nbsp; When they arrived, they gave him a bottle of beer to drink.&nbsp; And then, Danilo asked Rommel to buy cigarettes at Anderson’s store.&nbsp; The father of Rommel arrived and stared at them, just as Rommel arrived.&nbsp; He knows that Nathaniel gave a statement at the police station.&nbsp; Although in his affidavit he also mentioned Johnwayne Lindawan, the police have not arrested him.&nbsp; Lindawan also alighted from the back of the tricycle driver and he stood by the side of the road.&nbsp; He could not identify the tricycle driver.<br><br><b>Diorito Coronas, Jr.</b>, a billiard player by profession, usually played at the billiard hall near the house of Noel Adallom in Sarep Street on the right side going up the road.&nbsp; On October 28, 2001, about midnight, he was at the videoke bar, his usual hang out in Sitio 6 going towards Talanay.&nbsp; While there, he heard gunfire so he immediately went near a parked vehicle in front of the videoke bar.&nbsp; When he tried to investigate, he saw three persons fall to the ground (<i>Bumulagta noong pinagbabaril</i>).&nbsp; Two of them were already down and the third one stood up and ran even as the gunman continued firing.&nbsp; He identified the man who ran away as Babelito Villareal (Samboy).&nbsp; It was Noel Adallom whom he saw carrying the firearm which he described as a little less than 2 feet, shooting the three men.&nbsp; He saw Adallom’s companion and a third one who was manning the tricycle.&nbsp; The place of the incident was well lighted but from where he was standing, the light came only from the videoke bar.&nbsp; Then he noticed a yellow tricycle without any plate number moving toward his direction while the two other guys went to the opposite direction going upward.&nbsp; When he saw that they left, he immediately approached the two men lying down.&nbsp; He identified one of them as Rommel who was still moaning.&nbsp; He became apprehensive that someone might see him and his family might be involved.&nbsp; He ran toward his house.&nbsp; He identified three sets of pictures marked Exhibits A and B.&nbsp; He pointed to the place where the three guys who were shot at were positioned.<br><br>On cross examination, Coronas identified the owner of the videoke bar as Anderson Tuguinay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>Janita, when she took the witness stand, detailed the expenses incurred for the funeral and burial of her husband, Danilo.<br><br>Dr. Joselito reported that as a result of his autopsy examination of Danilo’s body, he had determined that Danilo died from hemorrhagic shock due to multiple gunshot wounds.&nbsp; There were six gunshot wounds in Danilo’s trunk and lower extremities.&nbsp; All points of entry were at Danilo’s back.&nbsp; There were five exit wounds at the front portion of Danilo’s body while one slug was recovered in Danilo’s liver.&nbsp; Dr. Joselito submitted the recovered slug for ballistic examination.&nbsp; Dr. Joselito further elaborated on his findings during his cross-examination:<br><br><blockquote>On cross examination, among others, he stated that the autopsy was conducted on October 28, 2001 at around 11:30 a.m.&nbsp; The abrasion on the victim’s right acromial region was caused by friction of the skin on a rough hard surface.&nbsp; Gunshot wound no. 1 was directed anteriorwards, upwards and lateralwards meaning it came from the back, traveled upwards from the center towards the sides.&nbsp; Its point of entry was 10 cm. from the posterior midline while the point of exit was 20 cm. from the posterior midline.&nbsp; The point of entry of gunshot wound No. 2 (depicted as POE No. 1 in Exhibit J) is 4 cm. from the posterior midline and exited 6 cm. from the anterior midline.&nbsp; The bullet traversed from the rear to the front going to the right side of the cadaver.&nbsp; The third gunshot wound’s point of entry is at the right infrascapular region end exited also on the right side of the chest but more towards the outer portion.&nbsp; The fourth gunshot wound’s point of entry is on the left side, back to front, lateralwards meaning from center or near the center towards the most outer part of the left side of the body.&nbsp; The entrance and exit wound were on the same level.&nbsp; It is superficial wound meaning it did not enter the peritonial cavity.&nbsp; The fifth gunshot wound was directed anteriorwards, downwards and medialwards.&nbsp; Anteriorward means from the back, it is noted downwards towards the foot while medialwards is towards the center.&nbsp; The sixth and final gunshot wound was sustained at the right buttocks directed anteriorwards, upwards and lateralwards, meaning from the back upwards going to the head and lateralwards, meaning from the center to the outer side of the cadaver.&nbsp; Since the entrance wounds were at the back of the cadaver, assuming the victim was not moving, the assailant or muzzle of the gun was at the back of the victim.&nbsp; Except for the fourth gunshot wound which entered and exited at the same level and the fifth gunshot wound which was downwards, all the other gunshot wounds were directed upwards.&nbsp; If the victim was in a sitting position at the time he sustained the wounds with an upward trajectory, he would probably be in a ducking position, hence the upward trajectory.&nbsp; If the victim was stationary at the time he was shot, it is possible the assailant was moving but the most probable explanation for the differences in the level of the points of entry in relation to the points of exit of the wounds is that the victim moved as a result of the force of the bullet that entered his body.&nbsp; The slug that he extracted from the cadaver of the victim was from a .30 caliber firearm based on the report of the ballistician.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><br>The defense presented the testimonies of accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> himself;

She knows that he is a soldier stationed in Camp Capinpin and that he comes home only once a month for a day, either Saturday or Sunday.&nbsp; She is also sure that witness Sgt. Anderson Tuguinay was not able to talk to her that morning because after the incident, she was alone in the middle of the road crying.<br><br>On cross-examination, among others, she stated that the incident happened right in front of her house.&nbsp; She was at home with her sisters and they were sleeping when she heard successive gunfire.&nbsp; She peeped out of the window and she saw two persons lying face down, Danilo and [Rommel].&nbsp; She was able to recognize her brother because he was facing the window.&nbsp; She went out of the house minutes after the last gunshot.&nbsp; She called for her siblings.&nbsp; Except for the neighbor of her Ate [Janita], none of their neighbors came out because they were afraid.&nbsp; Her brother Babelito was also there and he told her that he was almost hit.&nbsp; Danilo was already brought to the hospital before the police arrived in unmarked vehicles.&nbsp; Although Sgt.

The positive identification of the witnesses is more than enough to prove the accused-appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Accused-appellant argues that the delay in charging him raises serious doubts on Babelito’s testimony.&nbsp; Well settled is the rule that “Delay in making criminal accusations will not necessarily impair the credibility of a witness if such delay is satisfactorily explained.”&nbsp; It has been established that the delay in filing a criminal complaint is attributed to his confusion and desire to consult his sister-in-law who is the wife of deceased Danilo.&nbsp; He also testified that he did not file a complaint immediately, because he did not want to disturb the wake of his brother.&nbsp; Such explanation is acceptable.&nbsp; True enough, he filed a complaint with the barangay officials and asked for their assistance in bringing accused-appellant to Station 6 after the funeral of his brother.<br><br>Accused-appellant tried to attack the reliability of Babelito’s testimony by insisting that the story told by Babelito does not jive with the story told by the physical evidence consisting of the wounds sustained by the body of Danilo.&nbsp; We are not convinced.&nbsp; Accused-appellant is capitalizing on the fact that the location and nature of the gunshot wounds sustained by deceased Danilo is anteriorwards, lateralwards and going to the right.&nbsp; Simply stated, the direction of the wounds are slightly going upwards to the right, which according to the accused-appellant is impossible to be sustained by the deceased, because (as told by Babelito) he is standing up when he shot deceased Danilo, who is seated on the street.&nbsp; Such argument lacks merit.&nbsp; As explained by Dr. Rodrigo in his testimony, the body of Danilo could have moved and slumped forward when he was being hit by bullets in rapid succession and the position of his body has changed.&nbsp; When the bullets hit the body of the deceased, the body was already on the ground face down and the natural trajectory of bullets is upward, toward the head of the deceased.&nbsp; It is established that accused-appellant Noel was shooting while he was standing and the deceased was already on the ground.&nbsp; So when you try to examine the body and let it stand up, it would naturally create an impression that the bullets’ direction is upward.&nbsp; The explanation is so simple, the body received the bullets while it is slumped, with face forward on the ground, and accused-appellant Noel was shooting while he was standing up.&nbsp; Such explanation is corroborated by Babelito’s account that Danilo tried to turn his shoulders to face his left side, before he fell furthermore, such testimony is also corroborated by the testimony of Nanette which claimed that Danilo fell at the spot marked as Exhibit 2-C as told by Babelito.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied and citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>In contrast, accused-appellant proffered the defenses of denial and alibi, which are the weakest of defenses in criminal cases.&nbsp; The well-established rule is that denial and alibi are self-serving negative evidence; they cannot prevail over the spontaneous, positive, and credible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who pointed to and identified the accused-appellant as the malefactor.&nbsp; “Indeed, alibi is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Although accused-appellant presented other witnesses to supposedly corroborate his alibi, we could not ascribe much probative weight to said witnesses’ testimonies.&nbsp; None of said witnesses actually saw the shooting, most only heard the gunshots and arrived at the scene after the shooting took place and, thus, had no personal knowledge of the said incident.&nbsp; Except for Aida, no other witness for the defense was physically with accused-appellant at the exact time of the shooting.&nbsp; And even Aida’s testimony is unreliable given the observation of the RTC that it is in conflict with that of accused-appellant.&nbsp; Accused-appellant claimed that he first went to the billiard hall owned by Ilustre where he played with a certain <b>Zaldy</b> and then he transferred to Retota’s billiard hall where he was playing with <b>Danilo and Dominador Baldaba</b> when he heard the gunshots.&nbsp; Yet, Aida attested that she was watching accused-appellant playing billiards with a certain <b>Zaldy</b> when she heard the gunshots.<br><br>In sum, the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of accused-appellant for the murder of Danilo in Criminal Case No. Q-01-105875 and attempted murder of Babelito in Criminal Case No. Q-01-105877.<br><br>The penalty prescribed by law for the crime of murder is <i>reclusion perpetua to death.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; With the repeal of the death penalty law, the only penalty prescribed by law for the crime of murder is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; The Indeterminate Sentence Law does not apply, inter alia, to persons convicted of offenses punished with death penalty or life imprisonment, including <i>reclusion perpetua.</i>&nbsp; Hence, accused-appellant has been properly sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for the murder of Danilo in Criminal Case No. Q-01-105875.<br><br>However, we find it necessary to modify the award of damages to Danilo’s heirs in Criminal Case No. Q-01-105875.&nbsp; Consistent with prevailing case law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> accused-appellant must pay Danilo’s heirs the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, in addition to the sum of P57,084.80 as actual damages.<br><br>For the crime of attempted murder, the penalty shall be <i>prision mayor,</i> since Article 51 of the Revised Penal Code states that a penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by law for the consummated felony shall be imposed upon the principals in an attempt to commit a felony.&nbsp; Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum of the sentence shall be that which could be properly imposed in view of the attending circumstances, and the minimum shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Absent any mitigating or aggravating circumstance in this case, the maximum of the sentence should be within the range of <i>prision mayor</i> in its medium term, which has a duration of eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years; and that the minimum should be within the range of <i>prision correccional</i>, which has a duration of six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years.&nbsp; Hence, we sentence accused-appellant to suffer imprisonment from six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor,</i> as maximum, for the attempted murder of Babelito in Criminal Case No. Q-01-105877.<br><br>We further order accused-appellant to pay Babelito the amounts of P25,000.00 as civil indemnity, P10,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. Q-01-105877.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal of accused-appellant Noel T.
