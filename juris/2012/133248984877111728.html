				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 14, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 82052.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> filed by therein petitioner Dr. Macapado A. Muslim (Muslim) and declared the Motion for Intervention of the Board of Regents of the Mindanao State University (MSU) as a stray pleading proscribed by Rule 19, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The instant controversy arose from the following factual background:<br><br>Herein respondent Abedin Limpao Osop (Osop) is the former Chancellor of the Mindanao State University-General Santos City (MSU-GSC) campus.&nbsp; Osop retired in 1987 under the Early Retirement Law, but several years after his retirement, he was appointed by Moner M. Bajunaid, then MSU-GSC Chancellor, as a substitute for another professor of the Electrical Engineering Department, College of Engineering, of MSU-GSC, who was on study leave.&nbsp; Osop’s appointment took effect on July 1, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In 1997, Muslim, the succeeding Chancellor of MSU-GSC, renewed Osop’s appointment as Assistant Professor IV, effective January 1, 1997 until December 31, 1997.&nbsp; His appointment was duly noted by the MSU Board of Regents during its 166th Meeting held at DECS Conference Room, U.L. Complex, Meralco Avenue, Pasig City, on February 19, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Muslim allowed Osop to continue teaching at MSU-GSC even after December 31, 1997.&nbsp; On April 17, 1998, Muslim issued Special Order No. 144-98C designating Osop as Chairperson of the Electrical Engineering Department, College of Engineering, of MSU-GSC, with a term of office from April 18, 1998 to April 17, 1999, unless revoked or amended by competent authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>However, on July 15, 1998, Muslim caused to be served upon the College of Engineering and other offices of MSU-GSC a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated July 14, 1998 addressed to Osop that reads in full:<br><br><blockquote>Dear Prof. Osop:<br><br>In view of the return to the campus of Prof. Danilo Dadula for whom you have been serving as substitute since July 1, 1994, and considering the expiration of your temporary appointment last December 31, 1997, I regret to inform you that your services with the university will have to end.&nbsp; And since I am not renewing your appointment, you are hereby advised to cease from reporting to duty effective immediately.&nbsp; Moreover, you should clear yourself from monetary and other official accountabilities with the university.<br><br>On behalf of MSU-GSC, we thank you for your services.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 360px;">Very truly yours,<br><br>(signed)<br>MACAPADO A. MUSLIM, Ph. D.<br>Chancellor<br></div></blockquote><br>Muslim also issued Memorandum Order No. 010-98C<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated July 14, 1998, addressed to Virgilio Ramos (Ramos), Dean of the College of Engineering of MSU-GSC, concerning the expiration and non-renewal of Osop’s appointment and directing Ramos to already distribute Osop’s teaching load to the remaining faculty members of the College.&nbsp; In the same Memorandum Order, Muslim asked Ramos to explain the latter’s failure to include Osop in the list of substitute faculty members which he submitted to the Office of the Chancellor before the start of the 1st semester of 1998.<br><br>In compliance with Memorandum Order No. 010-98C, Ramos explained in his letter dated July 16, 1998 that there was no request for the appointment of a substitute for Prof. Danilo Dadula (Dadula) when the latter went on a study leave.&nbsp; He explained:<br><br><blockquote>Basing on our records, there was no request for substitute of Engr. Danilo P. Dadula when he went on study leave in June 1994.<br><br>On 17 June 1994, Engr. Noel S. Gunay, then the Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department, recommended the hiring of Prof. Abedin Limpao Osop in view of the study leave of Julito G. Fuerzas, PEE. Chancellor Moner M. Bajunaid, in his letter dated 30 June 1994, informed Dean Carlos B. Cuanan of the approval of the higher management to hire Prof. Abedin Limpao Osop as substitute of Engr. Julito G. Fuerzas effective 1 July 1994.&nbsp; After more than a semester, Engr. Fuerzas stopped schooling but did not return to this campus.&nbsp; Since then, Prof. Abedin Limpao Osop went on teaching with the College of Engineering and his appointment was renewable yearly as those on probationary status.<br><br>Per DBM Plantilla of Personnel, page 336 of 444 pages, Prof. Abedin Limpao Osop has an item. For this, I presumed Prof. A.L. Osop was not a contractual or substitute faculty of the college.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Regarding the distribution of Prof. A. L. Osop’s teaching load to appropriate faculty members at this time poses some problems.&nbsp; He is handling major courses in electrical engineering and the electrical engineers have excessive overload.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It has been noted and experienced that real excessive overload is more on the number of preparations than on overload teaching units.&nbsp; For the interest of our students and with much concern on the efficient delivery of instruction, the faculty of the Electrical Engineering Department could not absorb the load of Prof. A. L. Osop.&nbsp; Since his load are major EE courses, the same could not be handled by any of the faculty in the other departments.<br><br>In view thereof, may we request for the reconsideration of your decision to terminate the services of Prof. Abedin Limpao Osop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>Muslim responded by issuing handwritten Memorandum Order No. 012-98C<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated July 17, 1998, in which he reiterated his earlier order to Ramos to already distribute Osop’s teaching load.<br><br>On July 21, 1998, Osop filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City, Branch 22, a Complaint for Injunction with Prayer for Writ of Preliminary Injunction/Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), Damages and Attorney’s Fees against Muslim and Ramos.&nbsp; The Complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 6381.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Osop filed two days later, on July 23, 1998, an Urgent Motion for Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order.&nbsp; At the hearing held the very next day, on July 24, 1998, the RTC issued an Order in which it noted the absence of Muslim, and to give chance for the possibility of an amicable settlement, it reset the hearing for the issuance of a TRO to July 27, 1998.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in the same Order, the RTC already directed Osop to submit a bond of P20,000.00 to answer for damages that Muslim and Ramos might suffer if it turns out that Osop was not entitled to an injunction/TRO.&nbsp; Osop filed his injunction/TRO bond on July 27, 1998.<br><br>At the hearing of Osop’s application for the issuance of a TRO on July 27, 1998, the RTC issued an Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> whereby, in consideration of the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies, it suggested that Osop first write Muslim to seek reconsideration of Muslim’s letter and Memorandum Order No. 010-98C both dated July 14, 1998. Osop accordingly wrote Muslim such a letter dated July 27, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Muslim endorsed Osop’s letter dated July 27, 1998 to Emily Marohombsar (Marohombsar), then MSU President.&nbsp; In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated August 7, 1998, Marohombsar wrote:<br><br><blockquote>Based on the meticulous study made, the management is not legally nor morally under obligation to retain Prof. Osop in the service or liable for the non-renewal of his appointment the nature of which was temporary and contingent on the return of Prof. Danilo Dadula.&nbsp; With the return of Prof. Dadula, the renewal of the appointment of Prof. Osop would have been an unjustifiable superfluity.<br><br>This Office, concurring with the opinion of Director Imam, upholds your position on the case of Prof. Osop.</blockquote><br>Marohombsar’s aforequoted decision was based on the Brief from the MSU Human Resources Development Office dated August 6, 1998, signed by Director Lomala O. Imam, stating that “[t]he issue is not one of termination or dismissal but an expiration of an appointment which is not permanent in nature” and that “[t]he renewal or non-renewal of a temporary or probationary appointment is a management prerogative.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 6, 1998, Muslim and Ramos filed before the RTC a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. 6381 citing the following grounds: (1) lack of cause of action due to non-exhaustion of administrative remedies and non-inclusion of indispensable parties; (2) appointment in a temporary character; (3) presumption of regularity; and (4) forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The RTC issued an Omnibus Order on September 10, 1998, dismissing Civil Case No. 6381, for the following reasons:<br><br><blockquote>The complaint is essentially one for illegal dismissal filed by [herein respondent] Abedin Limpao Osop, a faculty member of the Mindanao State University (MSU), against defendant Macapagal A. Muslim, Chancellor of the MSU, and Virgilio Ramos, Dean of the College of Engineering of the same university.&nbsp; A party aggrieved by a decision, ruling, order or action of an agency of the government involving termination of services may appeal to the Civil Service Commission.&nbsp; Regional Trial Courts have no jurisdiction to entertain cases involving dismissal of officers and employees covered by the Civil Service Law.&nbsp; (Mateo v. C.A., 247 SCRA 284).&nbsp; The Civil Service Commission is the sole arbiter of all controversies pertaining to the Civil Service. (Dario v. Mison, 176 SCRA 84).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, the RTC decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant complaint is hereby DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Accordingly, [Osop’s] application for preliminary injunction, being merely ancillary to the principal action is also hereby dismissed without prejudice.&nbsp; The injunction bond is cancelled <i>ipso facto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC denied Osop’s Motion for Reconsideration in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated September 25, 1998, prompting him to file with the Court of Appeals a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and <i>Mandamus</i>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 49966, in which he argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that:<br><br><blockquote>2) The issue of removal from office of [Osop], who is faculty member of a state university, is beyond the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>4) In Civil Case No. 6381 [Osop] is suing [Muslim and Ramos] also for damages, a subject matter that is beyond the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>In the meantime, concerned students of MSU-GSC filed before the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Regional Office No. 11 a Complaint for the illegal termination of Osop by Muslim.&nbsp; CSC Regional Office No. 11 issued an Order dated November 27, 1998 finding that Osop’s termination was in order given that his appointment as a substitute was good only until the return of the person being substituted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Eventually, on June 7, 1999, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in CA-G.R. SP No. 49966, granting Osop’s Petition for Certiorari, based on the following ratiocination:<br><br><blockquote>Anent the order of the Civil Service Commission Regional Office dated November 27, 1998 holding the termination of [Osop] as legal, we agree with [Osop] that this finding should not be legally binding upon him because he is not a party to the complaint apparently initiated by alleged concerned students of MSU-GSC.<br><br>Secondly, [Osop’s] side of the issue was never heard because only Muslim was allowed to adduce evidence hence a denial of due process on the part of [Osop].<br><br>Coming now to the issue of whether or not [Osop’s] complaint was correctly dismissed by the trial court for having failed to exhaust administrative remedies and that consequently this case falls with the Civil Service Commission, we answer in the negative.<br><br>[Osop] cites Sections 4, 5 and 6(e)(h) of the MSU charter R.A. 1387 as amended by R.A. Nos. 1893, 3791, 3868, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4.&nbsp; The government of said University is vested in a board of regents to be known as the Board of Regents of the Mindanao State University. (R.A. 1893)<br><br>Sec. 5. The Mindanao State University shall have the general powers set out in Section thirteen of Act Numbered Fourteen hundred and fifty-nine and the administration of said university and the exercise of its corporate powers are hereby vested exclusively in the Board of Regents and in the President of the University, insofar as authorized by said Board.<br><br>Sec. 6.&nbsp; The Board of Regents shall have the following powers of administration and the exercise of the powers of the corporation.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) To appoint, on the recommendation of the President of the University, professors, instructors, lecturers, and other employees of the University; to fix their compensation, hours of service, and such other duties and conditions as it may deem proper; to grant to them in its discretion leave of absence under such regulations as it may promulgate, any provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, and to remove them for cause after an investigation and hearing shall have been had; and to extend with their consent the tenure of faculty members of the University beyond the age of sixty-five, any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, on recommendation of the President of the University, whenever in his opinion their services are specially needed; Provided, however, that no extension of service shall be made beyond the age of seventy.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(h) To prescribe rules for its own government, and to enact for the government of the University such general ordinances and regulations, not contrary to law, as are consistent with the purposes of the University as defined in Section 2 of this Act.</blockquote><br>Moreover, Article 152 of the Code of MSU provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 152. Terms and Conditions of Appointment. – The precise terms and conditions of every appointment shall be stated in writing.&nbsp; In case of a non-renewal of a probationary appointment the person so concerned shall be so informed in writing at least sixty days before the termination date.</blockquote><br>Proceeding from all the foregoing, it appears clearly that the authority to remove is vested in the Board of Regents and only after an investigation and hearing.<br><br>Due process was clearly not observed in the removal of [Osop].&nbsp; First of all, only the Board of Regents have the power of removal which must be for cause and after an investigation and hearing shall have been had.&nbsp; Secondly, even a mere probationary appointment requires that in case of non-renewal the person so concerned shall be informed in writing at least sixty (60) days before termination date.&nbsp; These basic requisites were not at all observed in the termination of [Osop].<br><br>Therefore, we agree with [Osop] that his non-referral of the matter of his removal to the Board of Regents before he resorted to court action is accepted as an exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<br><br>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies admits of several exception[s], to wit:<br><br>1. When there is a violation of due process.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>On another point, the two grounds relied upon by Muslim for terminating [Osop] to wit: (1) that Prof. Danilo Dadula for whom [Osop] has been serving as substitute since July 1, 1997 had already returned to MSU, and: (2) [Osop’s] temporary appointment expired on December 31, 1997, clearly appears to be without basis.<br><br>[Osop] contends and respondent Muslim does not deny that the notation “vice Danilo Dadula on study grant” contained in [Osop’s] appointment is erroneous because [Osop] was recruited as a substitute for Engineer Julito Fuerzas.<br><br>Assuming that [Osop] merely substituted for Dadula, [Muslim] does not deny that Danilo Dadula returned to MSU General Santos from his study grant in June 1996 and has taught in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the College of Engineering since then up to April 1998.&nbsp; During the said period, [Osop] was also teaching in the said University and before the letter of July 15, 1998 advising [Osop] of his termination, he was teaching at the same time as Dadula for which he was never asked to leave contrary to Muslim’s claim that [Osop] merely acted as a substitute of Dadula.&nbsp; Meanwhile Dadula has filed a leave of absence and has not reported for duty for the first semester of SY 1998-1999.&nbsp; To repeat, from June 1996 up to April 1998, Dadula and [Osop] taught together in the College of Engineering of MSU.&nbsp; Hence, if [Osop] was merely a substitute for Dadula, he should have been required to leave as early as June 1996, upon Dadula’s return.<br><br>Further, contradicting Muslim’s claim that [Osop] is a mere substitute of Dadula on April 17, 1998, Muslim issued Special Order 144-98C designating [Osop] as Chairperson of the Electrical Engineering Department of the College of Engineering with a term of office from April 18, 1998 up to April 17, 1999.&nbsp; Clearly, therefore, when [Osop] continued teaching up to July 15, 1998 and even his appointment as Chairperson of the Electrical Engineering Department until April 17, 1999 by Muslim himself, his appointment has ceased to be probationary in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>In the end, the Court of Appeals decreed:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition for certiorari is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Omnibus Order of the RTC of General Santos City, Branch 22 dated September 10, 1998 is hereby SET ASIDE.&nbsp; The RTC is directed to hear and try Civil Case No. 6381 with utmost dispatch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>The Motion for Reconsideration of Muslim and Ramos was denied by the Court of Appeal in its Resolution dated November 11, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Muslim then appealed the foregoing judgment of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

No. 127930, December 15, 2000, which lays down the rules in construing judgments.&nbsp; It was held that the sufficiency and efficacy of a judgment must be tested by its substance rather than its form.&nbsp;&nbsp; In construing a judgment, its legal effects including such effects that necessarily follows because of legal implications, rather than the language used, govern. Also, its meaning, operations, and consequences must be ascertained like any other written instrument.&nbsp; If the record shows that the judgment could not have been rendered without deciding the particular matter, it will be considered as having settled that matter as to all future actions between the parties, and if a judgment necessarily presupposes certain premises, they are as conclusive as the judgment itself.&nbsp; Reasons for the rule are that a judgment is an adjudication on all the matters which are essential to support it, and that every proposition assumed or decided by the court leading up to the final conclusions and upon which such conclusion is based is as effectually passed upon as the ultimate question which is solved.&nbsp; Thus a judgment rest on the intent of the court as gathered from every part thereof, including the situation to which it applies and attendant circumstances.<br><br>[Muslim, <i>et al</i>.] lost sight of the fact that the court gave due course to [Osop’s] Motion for Summary Judgment only after finding that the issue raised by them in their answer was patently unsubstantial as to constitute a genuine issue.&nbsp; Inasmuch as [Muslim, <i>et al</i>.] failed to show a plausible ground of defense something fairly arguable and of substantial character, they cannot therefore further insist that they have a genuine issue to warrant this Court to hear and try the above-entitled case.<br><br>Hence, in the present recourse, [Muslim, <i>et al.’s</i>] Motion for Reconsideration is hereby denied due course for bereft of any merit.</blockquote><br>In the same Order, the RTC granted Osop’s Motion for Execution Pending Appeal, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Anent [Osop’s] Motion for Execution Pending Appeal, it alleged that [Osop] has been unemployed for almost five (5) years and if [Muslim, <i>et al.</i>’s] appeal on the resolution of this Court, it will be just for the purpose of delaying the termination of the case and to cause further misery to [Osop].<br><br>Section 2, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, lays down the rule for execution pending appeal, categorized as discretionary execution.&nbsp; It is evident from the said provision that a primary consideration for allowing execution pending appeal would be the existence of good reasons.&nbsp; In turn, “good reasons” has been held to consist of compelling circumstances justifying the immediate execution lest judgment becomes illusory.&nbsp; Such reason must constitute superior circumstances demanding urgency which will outweigh the injury or damages should the losing party secure a reversal of the resolution issued by this Court.<br><br>After weighing the reasons presented, the Court deemed it wise to give due course to [Osop’s] Motion for Execution Pending Appeal.&nbsp; The effective and efficient administration of justice requires that the prevailing party should not be deprived of the fruits of the verdict rendered in his favor.&nbsp; The system of judicial review should not be misused and abused to evade the decision/order from attaining finality.<br><br>With the foregoing reasons, [Osop’s] Motion for Execution Pending Appeal is hereby given due course, but insofar as to the giving of teaching loads to [Osop] only inasmuch as no amount of damages could be ascertained at this moment.<br><br>Let therefore a Writ of Execution Pending Appeal be issued in this case directing [Muslim and Ramos] or their successors and defendant Mindanao State University to give teaching loads to [Osop] with a bond fix at Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>Muslim, <i>et al.</i>, filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the Order dated August 21, 2003, which Osop again opposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On October 1, 2003, Osop filed a Motion for Partial Execution (Based on a Final Executory Judgment) praying that a writ of execution be issued ordering Muslim, <i>et al.</i> to give him teaching loads.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Two days after, on October 3, 2003, Muslim, <i>et al</i>. filed a Second Motion for Reconsideration and Supplement to the Opposition (also Reply to Motion for Partial Execution).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated October 9, 2003 the RTC denied Muslim, et al.’s Second Motion for Reconsideration and Supplement to the Opposition (also Reply to Motion for Partial Execution) for being a <i>pro forma</i> motion.<br><br>Subsequently, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> dated November 10, 2003 granting Osop’s Motion for Partial Execution and ordering the issuance of a writ for the partial execution of the Order dated March 20, 2003, particularly, for its directive that Muslim, <i>et al.</i> give Osop teaching load.<br><br>RTC Clerk of Court Fulgar issued the Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the next day, November 11, 2003.&nbsp;

SP No. 49966, the appellate court, despite the fact that the issue brought therein was whether or not public respondent gravely abused his discretion in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction, nevertheless ruled that the appointment of [Osop] ceased to be probationary in character.&nbsp; Respondent judge merely took judicial notice of the appellate court’s findings that [Osop] had indeed ceased to be a probationary employee.&nbsp; To Our assessment, what respondent judge may have had on his mind was that even if he decided otherwise, the case would still be appealed to the Court of Appeals which, as adverted to, already made a finding that [Osop] was a permanent employee.&nbsp; Moreover, the appellate court’s decision was also binding between the parties; it was deemed to be the “law of the case,” hence, it was only proper for public respondent to conform to this Court’s decision.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>A trial court which has jurisdiction over the person and subject matter of the case, can grant a motion for summary judgment, and such is within its power or authority in law to perform.&nbsp; Its propriety rests on its sound exercise of discretion and judgment.&nbsp; In the event that it errs in finding that there is no genuine issue to thus call for the rendition of a summary judgment, the resulting decision may not be set aside either directly or indirectly by petition for certiorari, but may only be corrected on appeal or other direct review.&nbsp; The court a quo categorically stated that its March 20, 2003 [Order] had become final and executory as quoted hereunder:<br><br><blockquote>“A review of the records of the case will show that the [Muslim, et al.] received the Order dated <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> March 2003, granting the summary judgment, on March 25, 2003.&nbsp; On that date, the fifteen (15) days prescriptive period within which to file an appeal began to run.&nbsp; Instead of preparing an appeal, [Muslim, et al.] filed their Motion for Reconsideration on April 1, 2003.&nbsp; The filing of the said Motion interrupted the reglementary period to appeal.&nbsp; By that time, however, eight (8) days had already lapsed; thus, from their receipt of the Order dated August 21, 2003, denying their Motion for Reconsideration, on September 2, 2003, they had only seven (7) days left or until September 9, 2003 within which to file a notice of appeal. However, on said date, [Muslim, et al.] filed another Motion for Reconsideration praying that the order for execution pending appeal be recalled.&nbsp; On October 9, 2003, an Order had been issued denying [Muslim, et al.’s] Motion for Reconsideration, copy of which was received by [Muslim, et al.] on that same day.<br><br>Again, carefully going over the records, the Court finds that the Orders issued were already final and executory.&nbsp; [Muslim, et al.] received the Order granting the summary judgment of [Osop] dated March 20, 2003.&nbsp; Hence, they had until September 9, 2003 within which to file its appeal.&nbsp; [Muslim, et al.] filed a Motion for Reconsideration and the Court on its Order dated August 21, 2003 denied the same.&nbsp; [Muslim, et al.] received a copy of the denial of its Motion for Reconsideration, which was considered pro-forma, was likewise denied on October 9, 2003, [Muslim, et al.] received copy of the order of denial on that very same day.&nbsp; Such second motion for reconsideration filed by [Muslim, et al.], being a pro-forma, does (sic) not toll the running of the period to perfect an appeal or any remedy provided by law.&nbsp; Thus, it can be concluded that the subject orders issued by this Court are now final and executory.&nbsp; Now, once a judgment attains finality it becomes the ministerial duty of the trial court to order its execution.”</blockquote><br>Indeed, it bears stressing that the right to appeal is not a natural right or a part of due process.&nbsp; It is a procedural remedy of statutory origin and, as such, may be exercised only in the manner and within the time frame provided by the provisions of law authorizing its exercise.&nbsp; Failure of a party to perfect an appeal within the period fixed by law renders the decision sought to be appealed final and executory.&nbsp; After a decision is declared final and executory, vested rights are acquired by the winning party who has the right to enjoy the finality of the case.<br><br>To determine whether a judgment or order is final or interlocutory, the test is:&nbsp; Does it leave something to be done in the trial court with respect to the merits of the case?&nbsp; If it does, it is interlocutory, if it does not, it is final.&nbsp; A final judgment is one that disposes of a case in a manner that leaves nothing more to be done by the court in respect thereto.&nbsp; A summary judgment is one which is final as it already adjudicated the issues and determined the rights of the parties.&nbsp; It is only interlocutory when the court denies a motion for summary judgment or renders a partial summary judgment as there would still be issues left to be determined by the court.&nbsp; In the instant case, the March 20, 2003 Order was unequivocal, other than setting a hearing to determine the amount of damages, but had, on the other hand, already disposed of the case.&nbsp; As such, the issuance of the November 10, 2003 Order granting the motion for partial execution was proper as the summary judgment already became final and executory as adverted to.<br><br>In a petition for certiorari, even if, in the greater interest of substantial justice, certiorari may be availed of, it must be shown that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, that is, that the trial court exercised its powers in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostilities, so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion or virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.”&nbsp; We find that such abuse is not extant in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>Muslim filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the foregoing judgment on May 9, 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; and a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration on June 23, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>On July 11, 2006, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution stating that it received on June 8, 2006 a copy of the instant Petition (G.R.
