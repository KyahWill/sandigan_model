Accordingly, [respondent] <b>KERRY LAO ONG</b> is hereby admitted as citizen of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Republic’s Appeal</i></b><br><br>On January 31, 2003, the Republic, through the Solicitor General,&nbsp; appealed<br><br>to the CA.&nbsp; The Republic faulted the trial court for granting Ong’s petition despite his failure to prove that he possesses a known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation as required under Section 2, fourth paragraph of the Revised Naturalization Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The Republic posited that, contrary to the trial court’s finding, respondent Ong did not prove his allegation that he is a businessman/business manager earning an average income of P150,000.00 since 1989.&nbsp; His income tax returns belie the value of his income.&nbsp; Moreover, he failed to present evidence on the nature of his profession or trade, which is the source of his income.&nbsp; Considering that he has four minor children (all attending exclusive private schools), he has declared no other property and/or bank deposits, and he has not declared owning a family home, his alleged income cannot be considered lucrative. Under the circumstances, the Republic maintained that respondent Ong is not qualified as he does not possess a definite and existing business or trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Respondent Ong conceded that the Supreme Court has adopted a higher standard of income for applicants for naturalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; He likewise conceded that the legal definition of lucrative income is the existence of an appreciable margin of his income over his expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; It is his position that his income, together with that of his wife, created an appreciable margin over their expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the steady increase in his income, as evidenced in his tax returns, proved that he is gainfully employed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The appellate court dismissed the Republic’s appeal.&nbsp; It explained:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, the [respondent] chose to present [pieces of evidence] which relates [sic] to his lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation.&nbsp; Judging from the present standard of living and the personal circumstances of the [respondent] using the present time as the index for the income stated by the [respondent], it may appear that the [respondent] has no lucrative employment.&nbsp; However, We must be mindful that the petition for naturalization was filed in 1996, which is already ten years ago.&nbsp; It is of judicial notice that the value of the peso has taken a considerable plunge in value since that time up to the present.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if We consider the income earned at that time, the ages of the children of the [respondent], the employment of his wife, We can say that there is an appreciable margin of his income over his expenses as to be able to provide for an adequate support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>The appellate court denied the Republic’s motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> in its Resolution dated November 7, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><center><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue</span><br></center><br><blockquote>Whether respondent Ong has proved that he has some known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation in accordance with Section 2, fourth paragraph of the Revised Naturalization Law.</blockquote><br><b><i>Petitioner’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioner assigns as error the appellate court’s ruling that “there is an appreciable margin of (respondent’s) income over his expenses as to be able to provide for an adequate support.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; The Republic contends that the CA’s conclusion is not supported by the evidence on record and by the prevailing law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The only pieces of evidence presented by Ong to prove that he qualifies under Section 2, fourth paragraph of the Revised Naturalization Law, are his tax returns for the years 1994 to 1997, which show that Ong earns from P60,000.00 to P128,000.00 annually.&nbsp; This declared income is far from the legal requirement of lucrative income.&nbsp; It is not sufficient to provide for the needs of a family of six, with four children of school age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Moreover, none of these tax returns describes the source of Ong’s income, much less can they describe the lawful nature thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; The Republic also noted that Ong did not even attempt to describe what business he is engaged in.&nbsp; Thus, the trial and appellate courts’ shared conclusion that Ong is a businessman is grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The Republic thus prays for the reversal of the appellate court’s Decision and the denial of Ong’s petition for naturalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><b><i>Respondent’s Arguments</i></b><br><br>Respondent asks for the denial of the petition as it seeks a review of factual findings, which review is improper in a Rule 45 petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp; He further submits that his tax returns support the conclusion that he is engaged in lucrative trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The courts must always be mindful that naturalization proceedings are imbued with the highest public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp; Naturalization laws should be rigidly enforced and strictly construed in favor of the government and against the applicant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; burden&nbsp; of&nbsp; proof&nbsp;&nbsp; rests&nbsp;&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant&nbsp; to&nbsp; show&nbsp; full&nbsp;&nbsp; and<br><br>complete compliance with the requirements of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the controversy revolves around respondent Ong’s compliance with the qualification found in Section 2, fourth paragraph of the Revised Naturalization Law, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2.&nbsp; <i>Qualifications.</i>&nbsp; – Subject to section four of this Act, any person having the following qualifications may become a citizen of the Philippines by naturalization:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Fourth.&nbsp; He must own real estate in the Philippines worth not less than five thousand pesos, Philippine currency, or <b><i>must have some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation</i></b>;<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br>Based on jurisprudence, the qualification of <i>“some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation” </i>means “not only that the person having the employment gets enough for his ordinary necessities in life.&nbsp; It must be shown that the employment gives one an income such that <i>there is an appreciable margin of his income over his expenses</i> as to be able to provide for an adequate support in the event of unemployment, sickness, or disability to work and thus avoid one’s becoming the object of charity or a public charge.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>&nbsp; His income should permit “him and the members of his family <i>to live with reasonable comfort,</i> in accordance with the prevailing standard of living, and consistently with the demands of human dignity, at this stage of our civilization.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; it has been held that in determining&nbsp; the existence of&nbsp; a&nbsp; lucrative<br><br>income, the courts should consider only the applicant’s income; his or her spouse’s income should not be included in the assessment.&nbsp; The spouse’s additional income is immaterial “for under the law the petitioner should be the one to possess ‘some known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation’ to qualify him to become a Filipino citizen.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>&nbsp; Lastly, the Court has consistently held that the applicant’s qualifications must be determined as of the time of the filing of his petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Going over the decisions of the courts below, the Court finds that the foregoing guidelines have not been observed.&nbsp; To recall, respondent Ong and his witnesses testified that Ong is a businessman but none of them identified Ong’s business or described its nature.&nbsp; The Court finds it suspect that Ong did not even testify as to the nature of his business, whereas his witness Carvajal did with respect to his own (leasing of office space).&nbsp; A comparison of their respective testimonies is reproduced below:<br><br><blockquote><i>Carvajal’s testimony</i><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Q:&nbsp; You said earlier that you are a businessman?<br>A:&nbsp; Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; How long have you been a businessman?<br>A:&nbsp; Since 1980.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; And what is the business you are engaged in?<br>A:&nbsp; I am into leasing of office spaces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></div><br><i>Kerry Lao Ong’s testimony</i><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Q: What is your present occupation, Mr. Ong?<br>A:&nbsp; Businessman.<br><br>Q:&nbsp; Since when have you engaged in that occupation?<br>A:&nbsp; After graduation from college.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></div></blockquote><br>The dearth of documentary evidence compounds the inadequacy of the testimonial evidence.&nbsp; The applicant provided no documentary evidence, like business permits, registration, official receipts, or other business records to demonstrate his proprietorship or participation in a business.&nbsp; Instead, Ong relied on his general assertions to prove his possession of “some <i>known</i> lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation.”&nbsp; Bare, general assertions cannot discharge the burden of proof that is required of an applicant for naturalization.<br><br>The paucity of evidence is unmistakable upon a reading of the trial court’s decision.&nbsp; The trial court held that respondent Ong “is a businessman engaged in lawful trade and business since 1989”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> but did not cite the evidence, which supports such finding.&nbsp; After poring over the records, the Court finds that the reason for the lack of citation is the absence of evidence to support such conclusion.&nbsp; The trial court’s conclusion that Ong has been a businessman since 1989 is only an assertion found in Ong’s petition for naturalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>&nbsp; But, on the witness stand, Ong did <i>not</i> affirm this assertion.&nbsp; Instead, he testified that he had been a businessman since he graduated from college, which was in 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Further, the trial court, citing Exhibits U, V, W, and X (which are Ong’s tax returns), mistakenly found that Ong “derives an average annual income of more than One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; This conclusion is not supported by the evidence.&nbsp; The cited tax returns show that Ong’s gross annual income for the years 1994 to 1997 were P60,000.00, P118,000.00, P118,000.00, and P128,000.00, respectively.&nbsp; The average annual income from these tax returns is P106,000.00 only, not P150,000.00 as the trial court held.&nbsp; It appears that the trial court again derived its conclusion from an assertion in Ong’s petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> but not from the evidence.<br><br>As for the CA, it no longer ruled on the question whether Ong has a <i>known</i> business or trade.&nbsp; Instead, it ruled on the issue whether Ong’s income, as evidenced by his tax returns, can be considered lucrative in 1996.&nbsp; In determining this issue, the CA considered the ages of Ong’s children, the income that he earned in 1996, and the fact that Ong’s wife was also employed at that time.&nbsp; It then concluded that there is an appreciable margin of Ong’s income over his expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>The Court finds the appellate court’s decision erroneous.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, it should not have included the spouse’s income in its assessment of Ong’s lucrative income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><i> Second</i>, it failed to consider the following circumstances which have a bearing on Ong’s expenses vis-à-vis his income: (a) that Ong does not own real property; (b) that his proven average gross annual income around the time of his application, which was only P106,000.00, had to provide for the education of his four minor children; and (c) that Ong’s children were all studying in exclusive private schools in Cebu City.<i> Third,</i> the CA did not explain how it arrived at the conclusion that Ong’s income had an appreciable margin over his known expenses.<br><br>Ong’s gross income might have been sufficient to meet his family’s basic needs, but there is simply no sufficient proof that it was enough to create an appreciable margin of income over expenses.&nbsp; Without an appreciable margin of his income over his family’s expenses, his income cannot be expected to provide him and his family “with adequate support in the event of unemployment, sickness, or disability to work.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Clearly, therefore, respondent Ong failed to prove that he possesses the qualification of a known lucrative trade provided in Section 2, fourth paragraph, of the Revised Naturalization Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>The Court finds no merit in respondent’s submission that a Rule 45 petition precludes a review of the factual findings of the courts below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>&nbsp; In the first place, the trial court and appellate court’s decisions contain conclusions that are <i>bereft of evidentiary support or factual basis,</i> which is a known exception<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> to the general rule that only questions of law may be entertained in a Rule 45 petition.<br><br>Moreover, a review of the decisions involving petitions for naturalization shows that the Court is not precluded from reviewing the factual existence of the applicant’s qualifications.&nbsp; In fact, jurisprudence holds that the entire records of the naturalization case are open for consideration in an appeal to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, “[a] naturalization proceeding is so infused with public interest that it has been differently categorized and given special treatment. x x x&nbsp; [U]nlike in ordinary judicial contest, the granting of a petition for naturalization does not preclude the reopening of that case and giving the government another opportunity to present new evidence.&nbsp; A decision or order granting citizenship will not even constitute <i>res judicata</i> to any matter or reason supporting a subsequent judgment cancelling the certification of naturalization already granted, on the ground that it had been illegally or fraudulently procured.&nbsp; For the same reason, issues even if not raised in the lower court may be entertained on appeal. As the matters brought to the attention of this Court x x x involve facts contained in the disputed decision of the lower court and admitted by the parties in their pleadings, the present proceeding may be considered adequate for the purpose of determining the correctness or incorrectness of said decision, in the light of the law and extant jurisprudence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, there is even no need to present new evidence.&nbsp; A careful review of the extant records suffices to hold that respondent Ong has not proven his possession of a “known lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation” to qualify for naturalization.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition of the Republic of the Philippines is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated May 13, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
