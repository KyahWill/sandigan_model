Tubigan, Biñan, Laguna.&nbsp; The plastic sachet product of the buy-bust was marked TR-B, which means Teofilo Royena and the letter “B” means “Bust.”&nbsp; While the plastic sachet recovered from Gomer was marked TR-R, which means Teofilo Royena and the letter “R” means “Recovered”.&nbsp; PO1 Ignacio identified the accused Gomer Climaco in open court.&nbsp; He likewise identified his sworn statement.&nbsp; During the cross-examination, PO1 Ignacio admitted that he learned of the warrant of arrest on 7 September 2004 only.&nbsp; It was SPO4 Valverde who instructed PO Ignacio to conduct surveillance operation against Gomer, who was engaged in rampant selling of shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Aside from the testimony of PO1 Alaindelon Ignacio (Ignacio),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the following documentary exhibits were offered for the prosecution:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Exhibit “A” – Letter dated 7 September 2004; (2) Exhibit “B” – Chemistry Report No. D-1102-04; (3) Exhibit “C” – One-half white envelope; (4) Exhibit “C-1” – Plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings “GSC-1”; (5) Exhibit “C-2” – Plastic sachet with white crystalline susbtance with markings “GSC-2”; and (6) Exhibit “D” – Pinanumpaang Salaysay of&nbsp; PO1 Ignacio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Defense’s Version</u></b><br></center><br>Appellant Climaco, on the other hand, presented three witnesses and denied the prosecution’s allegations of sale and possession of <i>shabu</i>.&nbsp; The defense’s version of the events, as narrated in the RTC Decision, is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The defense presented three (3) witnesses in the persons of the accused himself, Gomer S. Climaco, who testified on 13 May 2008, Michael M. Basihan, who gave his testimony on 7 October 2008, and Cristina Gamboa Climaco, who gave her testimony on 25 November 2008.<br><br>Gomer S. Climaco testified that prior to 7 September 2004, he did not know SPO2 Wilfredo Samson and PO1 Alaindelon Ignacio.&nbsp; On&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 September 2004, Gomer, together with his wife and five (5) children, were inside their house.&nbsp; When Gomer was feeding the chicken in front of his yard, four (4) unidentified armed men suddenly arrived and frisked him.&nbsp; When nothing was found in his possession, the men handcuffed and brought him to the police station.&nbsp; At the police station, the men filed a case against him. Gomer denied having sold and delivered shabu to a police poseur-buyer and that he was in possesion of shabu.&nbsp; During the cross-examination, Gomer said that while he was being frisked by the men, Gomer asked the men what was his violation.&nbsp; The men replied that somebody bought shabu from him.&nbsp; Gomer told the men that he did nothing wrong, but the men continued to handcuff him.&nbsp; Gomer was not aware that he was included in the list of top 20 illegal drug pushers.&nbsp; Gomer did not know of any ill motive on the part of the police officer why he would be charged with so grave an offense.&nbsp; He did not file any case against the police officer who arrested him.<br><br>Michael M. Basihan testified that Gomer Climaco was his neighbor in Bagong Silang.&nbsp; On 7 September 2004, Michael went to Gomer’s manukan to gather guava fruits.&nbsp; When he arrived there, Gomer was tending to his cocks.&nbsp; While he was gathering guava fruits, Michael saw four (4) unidentified armed men suddenly barge into the premises and arrest Gomer.&nbsp; After he was handcuffed, Gomer was made to board a vehicle where he was brought to Jaka Subdivision.&nbsp; Michael could not remember whether it was morning or evening when Gomer was arrested by unidentified armed men because the incident happened a long time ago.<br><br>Cristina Gamboa Climaco testified that she is the wife of Gomer Climaco.&nbsp; She did not know SPO2 Wilfredo Samson and PO1 Alaindelon Ignacio.&nbsp; On 7 September 2004, she was inside their house taking care of her child.&nbsp; At around 3:00 in the afternoon of the same day, Gomer arrived in their house, who just came from Barangay Cuyab.&nbsp; After taking a bath, Gomer went outside of their house.&nbsp; While in front of their house, Gomer called the person taking care of his chickens.&nbsp; Gomer and that person went to the back of the house.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Cristina went inside the house.&nbsp; Although she was inside of the house, Cristina could see Gomer and the person through the window.&nbsp; At around 4:00 in the afternoon, Cristina saw four (4) unidentified armed men approach and ask something from Gomer.&nbsp; After a few minutes, Gomer left the back of the house, while the men were left standing there.&nbsp; Cristina went out the house and saw her husband go toward the direction of St. Reymond.&nbsp; At around 6:00 in the evening, Cirstina went down from their house to ask Michael if he saw Gomer.&nbsp; Michael told Cristina that he saw Gomer loaded into a van by several men.&nbsp; During the cross-examination, Cristina said that she did not know of any reason why SPO2 Samson and PO1 Ignacio would arrest her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Decision of the Regional Trial Court</u></b><br></center><br>The RTC declared Climaco guilty of the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 4912-SPL, the Court finds the accused, Gomer S.

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof, excluding possibility of error, which produces absolute certainty.&nbsp; Only moral certainly is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<br><br><center><b>“Chain of Custody” Over the Confiscated Items</b><br></center><br>The elements necessary in every prosecution for the illegal sale of <i>shabu</i> are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, it is essential that the transaction or sale be proved to have actually taken place coupled with the presentation in court of evidence of <i>corpus delicti</i> which means the “actual commission by someone of the particular crime charged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; The <i>corpus delicti </i>in cases involving dangerous drugs is the presentation of the dangerous drug itself.<br><br>On the other hand, to successfully prosecute a case of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the following elements must be established: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In both cases of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the chain of custody over the dangerous drug must be shown to establish the <i>corpus delicti</i>.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Alcuizar,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>The dangerous drug itself, the <i>shabu</i> in this case, constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti </i>of the offense and in sustaining a conviction under Republic Act No. 9165, the identity and integrity of the<i> corpus delicti</i> must definitely be shown to have been preserved. This requirement necessarily arises from the illegal drug’s unique characteristic that renders it indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise. Thus, to remove any doubt or uncertainty on the identity and integrity of the seized drug, evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug presented in court is the same illegal drug actually recovered from the accused-appellant; otherwise, the prosecution for possession under Republic Act No. 9165 fails.</blockquote><br>Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which implements the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, defines “chain of custody” as follows:<br><br><blockquote>“Chain of Custody” means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction.&nbsp; Such record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Malillin v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court explained the importance of the chain of custody:<br><br><blockquote>Prosecutions for illegal possession of prohibited drugs necessitates that the elemental act of possession of a prohibited substance be established with moral certainty, together with the fact that the same is not authorized by law.&nbsp; The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction.&nbsp; Essential therefore in these cases is that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the mere fact of unauthorized possession will not suffice to create in a reasonable mind the moral certainty required to sustain a finding of guilt.&nbsp; More than just the fact of possession, the fact that the substance illegally possessed in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt.&nbsp; The chain of custody requirement performs this function in that it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.<br><br>As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.&nbsp; It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness’ possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain.&nbsp; These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<br><br>While testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard because it is almost always impossible to obtain, an unbroken chain of custody becomes indispensable and essential when the item of real evidence is not distinctive and is not readily identifiable, or when its condition at the time of testing or trial is critical, or when a witness has failed to observe its uniqueness.&nbsp; The same standard likewise obtains in case the evidence is susceptible to alteration, tampering, contamination and even substitution and exchange.&nbsp; In other words, the exhibit’s level of susceptibility to fungibility, alteration or tampering – without regard to whether the same is advertent or otherwise not – dictates the level of strictness in the application of the chain of custody rule.<br><br>Indeed, the likelihood of tampering, loss or mistake with respect to an exhibit is greatest when the exhibit is small and is one that has physical characteristics fungible in nature and similar in form to substances familiar to people in their daily lives.&nbsp; <i>Graham v. State</i> positively acknowledged this danger.&nbsp; In that case where a substance was later analyzed as heroin – was handled by two police officers prior to examination who however did not testify in court on the condition and whereabouts of the exhibit at the time it was in their possession – was excluded from the prosecution evidence, the court pointing out that the white powder seized could have been indeed heroin or it could have been sugar or baking powder.&nbsp; It ruled that unless the state can show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into the posession of the police officers until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition, testimony of the state as to the laboratory’s findings is inadmissible.<br><br>A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature.&nbsp; The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood or at least the possibility, that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases – by accident or otherwise – in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing.&nbsp; Hence, in authenticating the same, a standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with.</blockquote><br>In this case, PO1 Ignacio, in his testimony, claimed that the substances seized from Climaco during the buy-bust operation were marked as “TR-R” and “TR-B”:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">When SPO4 Almeida handed over the items to SPO4 Teofilo Royena, what if any did SPO4 Royena do with the items?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">He placed markings on it, maam.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Where were you when he placed the markings?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I was present, maam.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Do you know what markings was made?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">He placed his initials TR which means Teofilo Royena and the letter B which means bust, maam.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">I’m showing to you a plastic sachet with the markings TR-B, please go over this and tell if this is the same item which you confiscated from the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, maam.&nbsp; This is the same.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">PROS.

(Allegedly found from the posession of Glomer Climaco)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>In addition, in the Index of Exhibits submitted by the Officer-in-Charge of the RTC, Exhibit “C-1” was described as a “plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings ‘GSC-1’” while Exhibit “C-2” was described as a “plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings ‘GSC-2,’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> contrary to the testimony of PO1 Ignacio and the declaration of Prosecutor Casano that the specimens submitted to the court carried the markings “TR-B” and “TR-R.”<br><br>Likewise, in the handwritten Minutes dated 5 January 2005, Exhibit “C-1” was identified as a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with marking “GSC-1,” and Exhibit “C-2” was identified as a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with marking “GSC-2.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Clearly, what was submitted to the trial court were plastic sachets bearing the markings “GSC-1” and “GSC-2,” instead of the plastic sachets bearing the markings “TR-R” and “TR-B” that contained the substances recovered from Climaco.&nbsp; This fact is evident from the RTC Decision, recognizing Exhibits “C-1” and “C-2” to bear the markings “GSC-1” and “GSC-2,” while acknowledging the testimony of PO1 Ignacio that the plastic sachets containing the substances recovered from Climaco bore the markings “TR-R” and “TR-B”:<br><br><blockquote>The prosecution presented two (2) witnesses in the persons of x x x <b>Forensic Chemist Donna Villa Huelgas</b>, whose testimony was dispensed with on 5 January 2005 upon defense’s admission of the existence of the following: 1) Written Request for Laboratory Examination as Exhibit “A”; 2) The Chemistry Report No. D-1102-04 as Exhibit “B”; 3) 1 ½ white envelope as Exhibit “C”; <b>4) the existence of two (2) plastic sachets with markings “GSC-1” as Exhibit “C-1”; and 5) another one with markings “GSC-2” as Exhibit “C-2”.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>The plastic sachet product of the buy-bust was marked TR-B, which means Teofilo Royena and the letter “B” means “Bust.”&nbsp; While the plastic sachet recovered from Gomer was marked TR-R, which means Teofilo Royena and the letter “R” means “Recovered”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The prosecution did not explain why the markings of the plastic sachets containing the alleged drugs, which were submitted to be “TR-B” and “TR-R,” became “GSC-1” and “GSC-2” in the Chemistry Report, Index of Exhibits and Minutes of the Hearing.&nbsp; In their decisions, the RTC and CA were silent on the change of the markings.&nbsp; In fact, since the markings are different, the presumption is that the substance in the plastic sachets marked as “TR-B” and “TR-R” is different from the substance in the plastic sachets marked as “GSC-1” and “GSC-2.”&nbsp; There is no moral certainty that the substance taken from appellant is the same dangerous drug submitted to the laboratory and the trial court.<br><br>As held in <i>Malillin v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to establish guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in cases involving dangerous drugs, it is important that the substance illegally possessed in the first place be the same substance offered in court as exhibit.&nbsp; This chain of custody requirement ensures that unnecessary doubts are removed concerning the identity of the evidence.&nbsp; When the identity of the dangerous drug recovered from the accused is not the same dangerous drug presented to the forensic chemist for review and examination, nor the same dangerous drug presented to the court, the identity of the dangerous drug is not preserved due to the broken chain of custody.&nbsp; With this, an element in the criminal cases for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the <i>corpus delicti</i>,&nbsp; is not proven, and the accused must then be acquitted based on reasonable doubt.&nbsp; For this reason, Climaco must be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt due to the broken chain of custody over the dangerous drug allegedly recovered from him.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> we <b>SET ASIDE</b> the 29 March 2011 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
