				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the Decisiot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 9 October 2007 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. R6300. In the said decision, the Court of Appeals Affirmed <i>in toto</i> the 14 February 2005 ruling<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 15, of Naic, Cavite in LRC Case No. NC-2002-1292. The dispositive portion or the Court or Appeals' decision accordingly reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b>. The assailed decision dated February 14, 2005 of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 15) in Naic, Cavite, in LRC Case No. NC2002- 1292 is<b> AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i></b>. No costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>The aforementioned ruling of the RTC granted the respondents’ Application for Original Registration of a parcel of land under Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><br>The antecedents are as follows:<br><br><center><i><u>Prelude</u></i></center><br>In October 1997, the respondents purchased three (3) parcels of unregistered land situated in <i>Barangay</i> Carasuchi, Indang, Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The 3 parcels of land were previously owned by one Generosa Asuncion (Generosa), one <i>Teresita Sernal</i> (Teresita) and by the <i>spouses Jimmy and Imelda Antona</i>, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Sometime after the said purchase, the respondents caused the survey and consolidation of the parcels of land. Hence, <i>per</i> the consolidation/subdivision plan <i>Ccs-04-003949-D</i>, the 3 parcels were consolidated into a single lot—“<b>Lot 3</b>”—with a determined total area of nine thousand five hundred seventy-seven (9,577) square meters. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><center><i><u>The Application for Land Registration</u></i></center><br>On 12 March 2002, the respondents filed with the RTC an Application<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> for Original Registration of <b>Lot 3</b>. Their application was docketed as LRC Case No. NC-2002-1292.<br><br>On the same day, the RTC issued an <i>Order</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> setting the application for initial hearing and directing the satisfaction of jurisdictional requirements pursuant to Section 23 of Presidential Decree No. 1529. The same <i>Order</i>, however, also required the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to submit a <i>report </i>on the status of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Lot 3</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 13 March 2002, the DENR Calabarzon Office submitted its <i>Report</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to the RTC. The <i>Report</i> relates that the area covered by Lot 3 <i>“falls within the Alienable and Disposable Land, Project No. 13 of Indang, Cavite per LC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>3013 certified on March 15, 1982.”</i> Later, the respondents submitted a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> from the DENR- Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) attesting that, indeed, <b>Lot 3</b> was classified as an <i>“Alienable or Disposable Land”</i> as of 15 March 1982.<br><br>After fulfillment of the jurisdictional requirements, the government, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed the <i>lone</i> opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to the respondents’ application on 13 May 2003.<br><br><center style="font-style: italic;"><u>The Claim, Evidence and Opposition&nbsp; </u></center><br>The respondents allege that their predecessors-in-interest <i>i.e.</i>, the previous owners of the parcels of land making up <b>Lot 3</b>, have been in “<i>continuous, uninterrupted, open, public [and] adverse</i>” possession of the said parcels <i>“since time immemorial</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It is by virtue of such lengthy possession, tacked with their own, that respondents now hinge their claim of title over <b>Lot 3.</b><br><br>During trial on the merits, the respondents presented, among others, the testimonies of Generosa<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and the representatives of their two (2) other predecessors-in-interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The said witnesses testified that they have been in possession of their respective parcels of land for over thirty (30) years <i>prior</i> to the purchase thereof by the respondents in 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The witnesses also confirmed that neither they nor the interest they represent, have any objection to the registration of <b>Lot 3</b> in favor of the respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In addition, Generosa affirmed in open court a <i>Joint Affidavit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> she executed with Teresita.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In it, Generosa revealed that the portions of <b>Lot 3</b> previously pertaining to her and Teresita were once owned by her father, Mr. Valentin Sernal (Valentin) and that the latter had “<i>continuously, openly and peacefully occupied and tilled as</i> absolute owner” such lands even “<span style="font-style: italic;">before the outbreak of World War 2</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>To substantiate the above testimonies, the respondents also presented various <i>Tax Declarations</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> covering certain areas of <b>Lot 3</b>—the earliest of which dates back to 1948 and covers the portions of the subject lot previously belonging to Generosa and Teresita.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the government insists that <b>Lot 3</b> still forms part of the public domain and, hence, not subject to private acquisition and registration. The government, however, presented no further evidence to controvert the claim of the respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><i><u>The Decision of the RTC and the Court of Appeals</u></i><br></center><br>On 14 February 2005, the RTC rendered a ruling granting the respondents’ Application for Original Registration of <b>Lot 3</b>. The RTC thus decreed:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, this Court confirming its previous Order of general default, decrees and adjudges Lot 3 (Lot 1755) Ccs-04-003949-D of Indang, Cadastre, with a total area of <b>NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN </b>(9,577) square meters and its technical description as above-described and situated in Brgy. [Carasuchi], Indang, Cavite, pursuant to the provisions of Act 496 as amended by P.D. No. 1529, it is hereby decreed and adjudged to be confirmed and registered in the name of herein applicants <b>MICHAEL C. SANTOS, VANESSA C. SANTOS, MICHELLE C. SANTOS, and DELFIN C. SANTOS</b>, all residing at No. 60 Rockville Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City.<br><br>Once this decision has become final, let the corresponding decree of registration be issued by the Administrator, Land Registration Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>The government promptly appealed the ruling of the RTC to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As already mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC’s decision on appeal.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the RTC ruling granting original registration of <b>Lot 3</b> in favor of the respondents.<br><br>The government would have Us answer in the affirmative. It argues that the respondents have failed to offer evidence sufficient to establish its title over Lot 3 and, therefore, were unable to rebut the <i>Regalian</i> presumption in favor of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The government urges this Court to consider the DENR Calabarzon Office <i>Report</i> as well as the DENR-CENRO <i>Certification</i>, both of which clearly state that <b>Lot 3</b> only became “<i>Alienable or Disposable Land</i>” on 15 March 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The government posits that since <b>Lot 3</b> was only classified as alienable and disposable on 15 March 1982, the period of prescription against the State should also commence to run only from such date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, the respondents’ 12 March 2002 application—filed nearly twenty (20) years after the said classification—is still premature, as it does not meet the statutory period required in order for extraordinary prescription to set in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center><br><b>We grant the petition.</b><br><br><u><i>Jura Regalia and the Property Registration Decree</i></u><br><br>We start our analysis by applying the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">Jura Regalia </span>or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Regalian Doctrine</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>Jura Regalia</i> simply means that the State is the original proprietor of all lands and, as such, is the general source of all private titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, pursuant to this principle, all claims of private title to land, <i>save those acquired from native title,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> must be traced from some grant, whether express or implied, from the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Absent a clear showing that land had been let into private ownership through the State’s <i>imprimatur</i>, such land is presumed to belong to the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Being an unregistered land, Lot 3 is therefore presumed as land belonging to the State. It is basic that those who seek the entry of such land into the Torrens system of registration must first establish that it has acquired valid title thereto as against the State, in accordance with law.<br><br>In this connection, original registration of title to land is allowed by Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, or otherwise known as the <i>Property Registration Decree</i>. The said section provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 14</b>. Who may apply. The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><br><blockquote>(1) <b>Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.</b><br><br>(2) <b>Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provisions of existing laws. </b><br><br>(3) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands or abandoned river beds by right of accession or accretion under the existing laws.<br><br>(4) Those who have acquired ownership of land in any other manner provided for by law. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Basing from the allegations of the respondents in their application for land registration and subsequent pleadings, it appears that they seek the registration of <b>Lot 3</b> under either the <b>first</b> or the <b>second</b> paragraph of the quoted section.<br><br>However, after perusing the records of this case, as well as the laws and jurisprudence relevant thereto, We find that <i>neither</i> justifies registration in favor of the respondents.<br><br><i><u>Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529</u></i><br><br>Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 refers to the original registration of “<span style="font-style: italic;">imperfect</span>” titles to public land acquired under Section 11(4) in relation to Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141, or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Public Land Act</span>, as amended.38 Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 and Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141 specify identical requirements for the judicial confirmation of <span style="font-style: italic;">“imperfect”</span> titles, to wit:39<br><br>1. That the subject land forms part of the alienable and disposable lands of the public domain;. <br><br>2. That the applicants, by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest, have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the subject land under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership, and; <br><br>3. That such possession and occupation must be <b>since June 12, 1945 or earlier. </b><br><br>In this case, the respondents were not able to satisfy the <b>third</b> requisite, <i>i.e</i>., that the respondents failed to establish that they or their predecessors-in-interest, have been in possession and occupation of <b>Lot 3</b> “<i>since June 12, 1945 or earlier.</i>” An examination of the evidence on record reveals so:<br><br><i>First</i>. The testimonies of respondents’ predecessors-in-interest and/or their representatives were patently deficient on this point. None of them testified about possession and occupation of the subject parcels of land dating back to 12 June 1945 or earlier. Rather, the said witnesses merely related that they have been in possession of their lands <i>“for over thirty years”</i> prior to the purchase thereof by respondents in 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Neither can the affirmation of Generosa of the <i>Joint Affidavit</i> be considered as sufficient to prove compliance with the third requisite. The said Joint <i>Affidavit</i> merely contains a <b>general</b> claim that Valentin had “<i>continuously, openly and peacefully occupied and tilled as absolute owner</i>” the parcels of Generosa and Teresita even “<i>before the outbreak of World War 2</i>” — which lacks specificity and is unsupported by any other evidence. In <b><i>Republic v. East Silverlane Realty Development Corporation</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> this Court dismissed a similar unsubstantiated claim of possession as a “<i>mere conclusion of law</i>” that is “<i>unavailing and cannot suffice</i>:”<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, Vicente Oco did not testify as to what specific acts of dominion or ownership were performed by the respondent’s predecessors-in-interest and if indeed they did. He merely made a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> general claim</span> that they came into possession before World War II, which is a <b>mere conclusion of law and not factual proof of possession, and therefore unavailing and cannot suffice.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <b>Evidence of this nature should have been received with suspicion, if not dismissed as tenuous and unreliable.</b></blockquote><br><i>Second.</i> The supporting tax declarations presented by the respondents also fall short of proving possession since 12 June 1945 or earlier. The earliest declaration submitted by the respondents i.e., <b>Tax Declaration No. 9412</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> was issued only in 1948 and merely covers the portion of <b>Lot 3</b> previously pertaining to Generosa and Teresita. Much worse, <b>Tax Declaration No. 9412</b> shows no declared improvements on such portion of <b>Lot 3</b> as of 1948—posing an apparent contradiction to the claims of Generosa and Teresita in their <i>Joint Affidavit.</i><br><br>Indeed, the evidence presented by the respondents does not qualify as the “<i>well-nigh incontrovertible</i>” kind that is required to prove title thru possession and occupation of public land since 12 June 1945 or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Clearly, respondents are not entitled to registration under Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><br><i><u>Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529</u></i><br><br>The respondents, however, make an alternative plea for registration, this time, under Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529. Notwithstanding their inability to comply with Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529, the respondents claim that they were at least able to establish possession and occupation of <b>Lot 3</b> for a sufficient number of years so as to acquire title over the same <i>via</i> prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As earlier intimated, the government counters the respondents’ alternative plea by arguing that the statutory period required in order for extraordinary prescription to set in was not met in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The government cites the DENR Calabarzon Office <i>Report</i> as well as the DENR-CENRO Certification, both of which state that <b>Lot 3</b> only became “<i>Alienable or Disposable Land</i>” on 15 March 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It posits that the period of prescription against the State should also commence to run only from such date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Hence, the government concludes, the respondents’ 12 March 2002 application is still premature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We find the contention of the government inaccurate but nevertheless deny registration of <b>Lot 3</b> under Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><br>Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 sanctions the original registration of lands acquired by prescription “<i>under the provisions of existing law</i>.” In the seminal case of <b><i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic</i></b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> this Court clarified that the “<i>existing law</i>” mentioned in the subject provision refers to no other than Republic Act No. 386, or the <i>Civil Code of the Philippines.</i><br><br><b><i>Malabanan</i></b> acknowledged that only lands of the public domain that are <i>“patrimonial in character”</i> are <i>“susceptible to acquisitive presecription”</i> and, hence, eligible for registration under Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Applying the pertinent provisions of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <b><i>Malabanan </i></b>further elucidated that in order for public land to be considered as patrimonial “<i>there must be an <u>express declaration</u> by the State that the public dominion property is no longer intended for public service or the development of the national wealth or that the property has been converted into patrimonial.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Until then, the period of acquisitive prescription against the State will not commence to run.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The requirement of an “<i>express declaration</i>” contemplated by <b><i>Malabanan</i></b> is <b>separate and distinct</b> from the mere classification of public land as alienable and disposable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> On this point, <b><i>Malabanan</i></b> was reiterated by the recent case of <b><i>Republic v. Rizalvo,</i></b> <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Jr</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <br><br>In this case, the respondents were not able to present any “<span style="font-style: italic;">express declaration”</span> from the State, attesting to the patrimonial character of <b>Lot 3</b>. To put it bluntly, the respondents were not able to prove that acquisitive prescription has begun to run against the State, much less that they have acquired title to <b>Lot 3</b> by virtue thereof. As jurisprudence tells us, a mere certification or report classifying the subject land as alienable and disposable is not sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> We are, therefore, left with the unfortunate but necessary verdict that the respondents are not entitled to the registration under Section 14(2) or Presidential Decree No. 1529.<br><br><b>There being no compliance with either the first or second paragraph of Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, the <i>Regalian</i> presumption stands and must be enforced in this case</b>. We accordingly overturn the decisions or the RTC and the Court of Appeals ror not being supported by the evidence at hand.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

After all, by connotative definition, alienable and disposable lands may be the object of the commerce of man; Article 1113 provides that all things within the commerce of man are susceptible to prescription; and the same provision further provides that patrimonial property of the State may be acquired by prescription.<br><br><b>Nonetheless, Article 422 of the Civil Code states that “[p]roperty of public dominion, when no longer intended for public use or for public service, shall form part of the patrimonial property of the State.” It is this provision that controls how public dominion property may be converted into patrimonial property susceptible to acquisition by prescription.</b> After all, Article 420 (2) makes clear that those property “which belong to the State, without being for public use, and are intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth” are public dominion property. <b>For as long as the property belongs to the State, although already classified as alienable or disposable, it remains property of the public dominion if when it is “intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth.</b>” Id. at 202-203.

Without such express declaration, the property, <u>even if classified as alienable or disposable</u>, remains property of the public dominion, pursuant to Article 420(2), and thus incapable of acquisition by prescription. It is only when such alienable and disposable lands are expressly declared by the State to be no longer intended for public service or for the development of the national wealth that the period of acquisitive prescription can begin to run. Such declaration shall be in the form of a law duly enacted by Congress or a Presidential Proclamation in cases where the President is duly authorized by law</b>. Id. at 203.
