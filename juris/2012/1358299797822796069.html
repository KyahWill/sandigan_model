				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed pursuant to Rule 65 of the <i>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure,</i> petitioner Republic of the Philippines (the Republic) primarily assails the 17 January 2008 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> issued by public respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, Fourth Division, in Civil Case No. 0022,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the plaintiff Republic’s motion for execution is GRANTED [IN PART].&nbsp; The Court hereby ORDERS:<br><br>(a) PHILTRUST BANK to deliver to plaintiff Republic of the Philippines the proceeds from the sale of the 198,052.5 Bulletin shares sold by defendant HMHMI to Bulletin Publishing Corporation that is now under Philtrust Bank Time Deposit Certificate No. 136301, in the amount of P19,390,156.68, plus interest earned;<br><br>(b) Defendant Estate of Hans Menzi, through its executor Manuel G.

No. 79126, to execute the necessary documents in order to effect the transfer of the ownership over these shares to the Bulletin Publishing Corporation in accordance with the agreement it entered into with the latter on June 9, 1998.<br><br>Defendants Estate of Hans Menzi and HMHMI’s motion is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Court hereby ORDERS PHILTRUST BANK:<br><br>To pay the Estate of Hans Menzi, through its Executor, Manuel G. Montecillo and Hans Menzi Holdings and Management, Inc., the amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN PESOS and 76/100 interests thereon from said date of February 28, 2002, until the whole amount is paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Facts</i></b><br></center><br>On 22 April 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (<i>PCGG</i>) issued a Writ of Sequestration over the shares of former President Ferdinand Marcos, Emilio Yap (Yap) and Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. (Cojuangco) in the Bulletin Publishing Corporation (<i>Bulletin</i>), together with those of their nominees or agents, among them, Ceasar Zalamea (Zalamea) and Jose Campos (Campos).&nbsp; On 12 February 1987, the PCGG also issued a Writ of Sequestration and Freeze Order over the shares of the U.S. Automotive Co., Inc. (<i>US Automotive</i>) and its officers in Liwayway Publishing, Inc. (<i>Liwayway</i>) as well as the shares of stock, assets, properties, records and documents of Hans Menzi Holdings and Management, Inc. (HMHMI), the corporation organized by Menzi, Campos, Cojuangco, Zalamea and Rolando Gapud, to serve as holding company for their shares of stock in Liwayway, Menzi and Company, Inc., Menzi Agricultural, Inc., Menzi Development Corporation and M and M Consolidated, Inc.&nbsp; The Writs of Sequestration issued against the Liwayway and Bulletin shares as well as the PCGG’s then declared intent to vote the sequestered shares in Bulletin were challenged by Liwayway, US Automotive and Bulletin in the petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> docketed before this Court as G.R. Nos. 77422 and 79126.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Following Campos’ lead in waiving his rights over 46,620 Bulletin shares in favor of the Republic, Zalamea also waived his rights over 121,178 Bulletin shares in favor of the Republic on 15 October 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp; PCGG then sold the shares of Zalamea and Campos in favor of Bulletin, which thereafter appears to have offered a cash deposit in the sum of P8,174,470.32 for Cojuangco’s remaining 46,626 Bulletin shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Together with the interests thereon, the amount was proposed to either: (a) standby as full payment of Cojuangco’s shares upon a final judgment declaring the Republic the owner of said shares; or, (b) be returned to Bulletin upon a final judgment declaring Cojuangco as true owner thereof.&nbsp; In the 15 April 1988 Decision in G.R. Nos. 77422 and 79126, this Court directed, among others, the PCGG to accept the cash deposit offered by Bulletin for Cojuangco’s shares, subject to the foregoing alternative conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 29 July 1987, in the meantime, the Republic instituted a complaint for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution and damages against President Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Yap, Cojuangco, Zalamea and Atty. Manuel Montecillo (Montecillo).&nbsp; Docketed as Civil Case No. 0022 before the Sandiganbayan, the complaint essentially alleged that Yap acted as the Marcos Spouses’ dummy, nominee or agent in the appropriation and concealment of shares of stock of domestic corporations like Bulletin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cojuangco and Zalamea were likewise alleged to have acted as the Marcos Spouses’ dummies, nominees or agents in illegally acquiring Bulletin shares to prevent their disclosure and recovery.&nbsp; In the amended complaint the Republic filed on 10 March 1988, Cojuangco was&nbsp; joined as an actor instead of a mere collaborator of Zalamea who was later dropped as defendant from the case in view of his assignment of his 121,178 Bulletin shares in favor of the Republic as aforesaid.&nbsp; The Republic went on to amend its complaint for a second time on 17 October 1990, to implead as defendant respondent Estate of Hans Menzi (the Estate), through its Executor, Montecillo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 2 April 1992 the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> lifting the writ of sequestration issued by the PCGG.&nbsp; This was questioned by the Republic through a petition for <i>certiorari </i>docketed before this Court as G.R. No. 107377.&nbsp; In a Resolution dated 16 July 1996, the Court reversed and set aside the assailed resolution and referred the case back to the Sandiganbayan “for resolution of the preliminary question of whether there is <i>prima facie</i> factual basis for PCGG’s sequestration order.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; It was pursuant to the foregoing resolution that the Sandiganbayan went on to conduct hearings on the matter and, later, to issue the Resolution dated 13 April 1998, discounting the factual bases for PCGG’s sequestration order and granting the Estate’s motion to lift the writ of sequestration over the shares of stock, assets, properties, records and documents of HMHMI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Dissatisfied with the Resolution and the Sandiganbayan’s 26 August 1998 denial of its motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Republic filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> docketed before this Court as G.R. No. 135789.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On 31 January 2002, the Court rendered a decision in G.R. No. 135789, dismissing the Republic’s petition on the ground that the Sandiganbayan had the authority to resolve all incidents relative to cases involving ill-gotten wealth and that the court’s appellate jurisdiction over the graft court’s decisions or final orders is limited to questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; On 4 March 2002, Philtrust Bank (Philtrust) filed a motion to intervene in G.R. No. 135789, alleging that the writ of sequestration, which was the subject matter of the case, covered the following time deposits maintained with it by HMHMI, to wit:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">Time Deposit Certificate</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Date of Certificate</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">Original Deposit</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">136301</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">3/03/86</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P19,390,156.68</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">162828</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">4/18/88</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">24,102,443.85</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">162829</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">4/18/88</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">5,826,683.26</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>In addition to its being allowed to intervene in the case, Philtrust prayed for the consignation of the proceeds and interests of the foregoing TDCs as well as its release from its obligation pertaining thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Alongside the Republic’s motion for reconsideration of the 31 January 2002 Decision in G.R. No. 135789, Philtrust’s motions were, however, denied for lack of merit in the 20 November 2002 Resolution the Court issued in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The motions subsequently filed by the Republic as well as the Estate and HMHMI for the deposit of the Philtrust-tendered sums with, respectively, a government bank or their own account were noted without action in the Court’s Resolution dated 22 January 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, the following issues were identified for resolution at the pre-trial conducted in Civil Case No. 0022, to wit: (a) whether or not Menzi’s sale of his 154,470 Bulletin shares in favor of US Automotive was valid and legal; and, (b) whether or not the Bulletin shares registered in the names of Yap, Cojuangco, Zalamea, Menzi, his Estate or HMHMI were ill-gotten.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; After a protracted litigation, the Sandiganbayan rendered a Decision dated 14 March 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the decretal portion of which states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><ol><li> Declaring that the following Bulletin shares are the ill-gotten wealth of the defendant Marcos spouses:<br><br><ol type="A"><li>The 46,626 Bulletin shares [part of the 214 block] in the name of defendant Eduardo M.

Nos. 152578, 154487 and 154518.&nbsp; In the 23 November 2005 Decision rendered in said consolidated cases, however, the Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan’s 14 March 2002 Decision, upon the following findings and conclusions: (a) as the proven owner thereof, the Estate validly sold the 154 block of Bulletin shares to US Automotive, with the indorsement and delivery of the stock certificate covering the same; and, (b) the evidence on record shows that the 198 block of Bulletin shares as well as the 46,626 shares registered in the name of Cojuangco which formed&nbsp; part of the 214 block of Bulletin shares were ill-gotten.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequent to the 24 January 2006 denial of its motion for partial reconsideration of the foregoing decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Estate, alongside HMHMI, filed a Joint Manifestation dated 28 February 2006.&nbsp; The Joint Manifestation called the Court’s attention to the fact, among others, that the motion for the release of the proceeds of the TDCs they filed in G.R. No. 135789 was merely noted without action, on the ground that the matter would be better ventilated and addressed in the consolidated cases.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the issues pertaining to the TDCs were not addressed in the Court’s 23 November 2005 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; the Estate and HMHMI sought the grant of the following reliefs:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that:<br><br>1.

It is further prayed that such other reliefs be granted as to this Honorable Court may seem just and equitable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>The Joint Manifestation filed by the Estate and HMHMI was not, however, acted upon by this Court which went on to issue an Entry of Judgment certifying the finality of the 23 November 2005 Decision in G.R. Nos. 152578, 154487 and 154518.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; On 29 November 2006, the Republic filed its motion for the execution of the Sandiganbayan’s 14 March 2002 Decision and prayed for Philtrust’s delivery of the sums covered by the decision as well as the PCGG’s 12 February 1987 Freeze Order which included the sums covered by TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Claiming that only the proceeds of TDC No. 136301 were declared forfeited in favor of the Republic in the decision sought to be executed, the Estate and HMHMI also filed their motion for execution dated 5 December 2006, praying that Philtrust be ordered to render an accounting of TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829 and, thereafter, to deliver in their favor the principal thereof, together with the stipulated and legal interests they have, in the meantime, earned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On 16 January 2007, the Republic filed its Comment on the motion for execution filed by the Estate and HMHMI, arguing that said movants’ claim of entitlement to the proceeds of TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829 was bereft of any basis.&nbsp; Calling attention to the 28 February 2006 Joint Manifestation that the Estate and HMHMI filed in G.R. No. 135789, the Republic maintained that said TDCs could not have covered the proceeds of the sale of 154,472 Bulletin shares to US Automotive since the same had been already received by the Estate and, per the testimony elicited from Montecillo, were deposited with the Equitable Bank and used to pay estate taxes due the Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; On 25 January 2007, the Estate and HMHMI also filed their Manifestation with Comment, asserting that only the proceeds of TDC No. 136301 were declared ill-gotten in the decision sought to be executed; hence, it necessarily followed that all the other sequestered HMHMI assets – including the proceeds of TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829 – were not ill-gotten.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On 26 January 2007, Yap filed his comment on the motions for execution filed by the Republic as well as the Estate and HMHMI.&nbsp; Maintaining that the Republic had yet to effect the transfer of ownership of the 46,626 shares in favor of Bulletin pursuant to the 14 March 2002 Decision in Civil Case No. 0022, Yap also averred that the Estate had not yet surrendered for cancellation the original Bulletin certificates of stock in its possession which formed part of the 214 block of Bulletin shares subject of this Court’s 15 April 1988 Decision in G.R. Nos. 77422 and 79126.&nbsp; Likewise claiming that TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829 were not covered by the decision sought to be executed, Yap insisted that the Estate had already received the proceeds of TDC No. 130052 covering the sale of the 154 block of Bulletin shares to US Automotive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; In support of this assertion, Yap submitted copies of TDC No. 130052 in the sum of P24,969,200.09, Montecillo’s offer of surrender of said TDC in exchange for full payment of said principal and the interests thereon, as well as the manager checks and vouchers purportedly evidencing Philtrust’s payment thereof in April 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In its 21 February 2007 Reply to Yap’s Comment on its Motion for Execution, on the other hand, the Estate disavowed receiving payment of the proceeds of TDC No. 130052 on the ground that, at the time of the supposed payment in April 1989, the assets of HMHMI which consisted of TDC Nos. 136301, 162828 and 162829 had already been frozen.&nbsp; Contending that its continued possession of the original of TDC No. 130052 was ineluctable proof of the non-payment of the proceeds thereof, the Estate argued that Philtrust’s attempt to consign the proceeds of TDC Nos. 136301, 162828 and 162829 with this Court in G.R. No. 135789 was an admission that its liability therefor remained valid, subsisting and enforceable.&nbsp; While conceding that the delivery of the proceeds of TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829 was not covered in the decision sought to be executed, the Estate asserted that the Sandiganbayan’s 18 April 1995 Resolution invalidating the PCGG’s Freeze Order of HMHMI’s assets was affirmed by this Court in the 31 January 2002 Decision in G.R.

Nos. 152578, 154487 and 154518 affirmed the validity of the sale of said 154,472 Bulletin shares to US Automotive in the following wise:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. Atty. Montecillo’s authority to negotiate the transfer and execute the necessary documents for the sale of the 154 block is found in the General Power of Attorney executed by Menzi on May 23, 1984 which specifically authorizes Atty. Montecillo “[T]o sell, assign, transfer, convey and set over upon such consideration and under such terms and conditions as he may deem proper, any and all stocks or shares of stock, now standing or which may thereafter stand in my name on the books of any and all company or corporation, and for that purpose to make, sign and execute all necessary instruments, contracts, documents or acts of assignment or transfer.”<br><br>Atty. Montecillo’s authority to accept payment of the purchase price for the 154 block sold to US Automotive after Menzi’s death springs from the latter’s Last will and Testament and the Order of the probate court confirming the sale and authorizing Atty. Montecillo to accept payment therefor.&nbsp; Hence, before and after Menzi’s death, Atty. Montecillo was vested with ample authority to effect the sale of the 154 block to US Automotive.<br><br>That the 154 block was not included in the inventory is plausibly explained by the fact that at the time the inventory of the assets of Menzi’s estate was taken, the sale of the 154 block had already been consummated.&nbsp; Besides, the non-inclusion of the proceeds of the sale in the inventory does not affect the validity of the legality of the sale itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>Despite the validity of the sale, however, the Republic correctly argues that the funds deposited under TDC Nos. 162828 and 162829 could not have been sourced from the 1984 sale of 154,472 Bulletin shares to US Automotive, considering that the evidence on record indicates that the proceeds thereof had not been deposited with Philtrust and had already been expended for the estate taxes due from the Estate.&nbsp; No less than its Executor, Montecillo, made the following admissions during the trial of the case on the merits:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">ATTY.
