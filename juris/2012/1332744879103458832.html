Petitioners were informed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> beforehand of the scheduled relocation survey on May 29, 1994 but they opted not to attend.&nbsp; In fact, as testified by respondent Barangan and Engr. Jonco, the relocation survey had to be postponed several times because petitioners refused to participate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; By refusing to attend and participate in the relocation survey, they are now estopped from questioning the results of the relocation survey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Records also show that during the trial, the RTC ordered the DENR to conduct a resurvey of the subject property; but petitioners moved that the same be abandoned claiming that the resurvey would only delay the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; To us, the persistent refusal of petitioners to participate in the relocation survey does not speak well of their claim that they are not occupying respondent Barangan’s property.&nbsp; In fact, their unjustified refusal only shows either of two things: (1) that they know for a fact that the result would be detrimental to their case; or (2) that they have doubts that the result would be in their favor.<br><br>Neither is there any discrepancy between the title number stated in the Land Purchase Agreement and the Deed of Absolute Sale.&nbsp; As correctly found by the CA, TCT No. 171453, the title stated in the Deed of Absolute Sale, is a transfer from TCT No. 165456, the title stated in the Land Purchase Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, both TCTs pertain to the same property.<br><br><b><i>Respondent Barangan is entitled to<br>actual and moral damages as well as <br>attorney’s fees</i></b><br><br>Since respondent Barangan was deprived of possession of the subject property, he is entitled to reasonable compensation in the amount of P3,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> per month from November 17, 1994, the date of judicial demand, up to the time petitioners vacate the subject property.&nbsp; The legal interest of which shall be at the rate of 6% per annum from November 17, 1994 and at the rate of 12% per annum from the time the judgment of this Court becomes final and executory until the obligation is fully satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The award of temperate damages in the amount of P50,000.00, representing the expenses for the relocation survey, however, must be deleted as these expenses were not alleged in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>For the mental anguish, sleepless nights, and serious anxiety suffered by respondent Barangan, he is entitled to moral damages under Article 2217<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> of the Civil Code but in the reduced amount of P50,000.00, which is the amount prayed for in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Although not alleged in the complaint, we sustain the CA’s award of P50,000.00 as attorney’s fees because it is sanctioned by law, specifically, paragraphs 2 and 11 of Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><b><i>Laches and prescription do not apply</i></b><br><br>Finally, as to the issue of laches and prescription, we agree with the CA that these do not apply in the instant case.
