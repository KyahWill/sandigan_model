SP No. 85017, and its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated December 2, 2005, denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The&nbsp; Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the Decision dated February 2, 2004 of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), which affirmed the decision dated&nbsp; October 12, 1998 of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) of San Fernando, Pampanga, dismissing respondents' complaint for the annulment of&nbsp; the emancipation patent issued in favor of respondents’ tenant, petitioner Crispino Pangilinan, which emancipation patent covered a portion of the land sought to be retained by respondents.<br><br>The facts, as stated by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:<br><br>Respondent spouses Jocelyn N. Balatbat and Vicente A. Balatbat were found by the PARAD to have landholdings totaling 25.2548 hectares, which consisted of 9.8683 hectares of riceland and 15.3864 hectares of sugarland.&nbsp; The 9.8683 hectares of riceland was covered by land reform.<br><br>Out of the 25.2548 hectares of land owned by respondents, 18.2479 hectares or 182,479 square meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> thereof was under Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 6009. Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino D. Guevarra found that in&nbsp; OCT No. 6009,&nbsp; 8.6402 hectares or 86,402 square meters was riceland covered by Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27 and Executive Order (E.O.) No. 228, while&nbsp; 96,077 square meters was sugarland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; The&nbsp; 96,077 square meters of&nbsp; sugarland was subdivided by respondents as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Title No. 181462 --&nbsp; 64,540 square meters<br>Title No. 181464 --&nbsp; 8,904 square meters<br>Title No. 181469 --&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 22,633</span> square meters<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 96,077 square meters</blockquote><br>Title Nos. 181464 and 181469, representing Lots 21-0 and 21-1, were utilized by respondents in a subdivision/condominium project particularly called Carolina Village II, located at San Juan, Sta.

No. 27,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> as amended by Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 474, this case involves only 2.9941 hectares or 29,941 square meters thereof, covered under TCT No. 181466-R,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; and identified as Lot 21-F of the subdivision plan Psd-03-005059, being a portion of Lot 21 Sta. Ana Cadastre, situated in the Barrio of San Juan, Municipality of Sta. Ana, Province of Pampanga. The said Lot 21-F, with an area of 29,941 square meters, was transferred to petitioner as evidenced by TCT No. 25866,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; which was registered in the Register of Deeds for the Province of Pampanga on May 30, 1997,&nbsp; pursuant to Emancipation Patent No. 00728063 issued by the DAR on April 18, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, respondents sought to cancel the said emancipation patent on the ground that they applied to retain the land covered by it.<br><br>Respondents first filed an Application for Retention<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of their landholdings under P.D. No. 27 on December 24, 1975.&nbsp; However, it was not acted upon.<br><br>In May 1996, respondents received a letter from Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino Guevarra informing respondents of a conference for the determination of the value of their landholdings and the final survey of the land preparatory to the issuance of emancipation patents.<br><br>Respondents alleged that on September 16, 1996, they received a Notice of Coverage on OCT No. 6009 under R.A. No. 6657, and on October 28, 1996, they received a final notification to landowner, which notices were all issued by Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino Guevarra.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated September 28, 1996, respondents, by counsel, reiterated their application for retention to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Regional Director, Region III, San Fernando Pampanga, thru the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office, San Fernando, Pampanga.<br><br>The DAR Regional Director referred respondents' application for retention to the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer in San Fernando, Pampanga, which application was later endorsed to Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino Guevarra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>After investigation and verification of the landholdings of respondents, Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino Guevarra, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; dated March 21, 1997, recommended to the DAR Provincial Office, San Fernando, Pampanga that respondents' re-application for retention be denied.<br><br>On May 30, 1997, the Register of Deeds for the Province of Pampanga issued TCT No. 25866 to petitioner, pursuant to Emancipation Patent No. 00728063<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> covering&nbsp; Lot 21-F of the subdivision plan Psd-03-005059, situated in the Barrio of San Juan, Municipality of Sta. Ana, Province of Pampanga, with an area of 29,941 square meters, which is a portion of the land sought to be retained by respondents. This prompted respondents to file on February 4, 1998 with the DAR Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board, Region III, San Fernando, Pampanga a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for annulment of emancipation patent, ejectment and damages against petitioner Crispino Pangilinan, Municipal Land Officer Victorino D. Guevarra, and the DAR Secretary, represented by the Regional Director, Region III.<br><br>In their Complaint, respondents alleged that although Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino Guevarra knew that the land cultivated by petitioner is one of those included in their application for retention, Guevarra, acting in bad faith and without notice to them and in disregard of their rights and in collusion with petitioner, recommended for the coverage of their land under Operation Land Transfer. Thereafter, Emancipation Patent No. 00728063 and TCT No. 25866 were unlawfully issued and registered with the Register of Deeds of Pampanga on May 30, 1997.<br><br>Respondents prayed for the annulment of TCT No. 25866 bearing Emancipation Patent No. 00728063, the ejectment of petitioner from the landholding in question, and for payment of moral damages, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.<br><br>On October 12, 1998, the PARAD rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in favor of petitioner, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered against the plaintiffs by dismissing the case for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>The PARAD stated that 9.8683 hectares of the 25.2548 hectares of the landholding of respondents was subjected to Operation Land Transfer. He acknowledged that respondents applied for retention in 1975 under P.D. No. 27.<br><br>However, respondents were already barred in their bid for the retention area when they filed their subsequent application for retention on November 6, 1996, since the last day for the landowner to apply for his right of retention under Administrative Order No. 1 of February 27, 1985 was on August 29, 1985.<br><br>Moreover, the PARAD explained that the area of retention policy under P.D. No. 27 is that a landowner can retain in naked ownership an area of not more that seven (7) hectares of rice/corn lands if the said landowner does not own an aggregate area of more than seven (7) hectares of land used for residential, commercial, industrial and other urban purposes from which the landowner derives adequate income to support himself and his family. Otherwise, such landowner is compelled to give up his rice/corn land to his tenant-tiller, and payment to him shall be undertaken by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) if not directly paid by such tenant-tiller.<br><br>In this case, the PARAD declared that respondents “retained” the sugarland with an area of 15.2864 hectares, and 4.8836 hectares thereof was divided into a subdivision lot, while the remaining balance was subdivided among respondents and their children. Hence, the PARAD held that the area of seven hectares that can be retained under P.D. No. 27 can no longer be awarded to respondents, since they already owned an aggregate area of more than seven hectares used for residential and other urban purposes from which they derive adequate income to support themselves and their family.<br><br>Moreover, the PARAD stated that petitioner has absolute ownership of the landholding as he has fully paid the amortizations to the LBP.<br><br>Respondents appealed the decision of the PARAD before the DARAB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On February 2, 2004, the DARAB rendered its Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered, the decision of the Honorable Adjudicator <i>a quo</i>, 'dated October 12, 1998, is hereby AFFIRMED <i>IN TOTO</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>In support of its decision, the DARAB cited Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 1991, which provides:<br><br><blockquote><i>Subject</i>:<b> Supplemental Guidelines Governing the Exercise of Retention Rights by Landowners Under Presidential Decree No. 27</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br><center>B.

Of the total landholding, 9.8683 hectares was riceland, which was subjected to Operation Land Transfer, while 15.3864 hectares was sugarland, which was subdivided by respondents into a 4.8836 subdivision lot to support themselves and their family. Hence, respondents are no longer entitled to retain seven hectares of the land subject to Operation Land Transfer.<br><br>The DARAB also stated that as an emancipation patent has been issued to petitioner, he acquires the vested right of absolute ownership in the landholding.<br><br>Respondents’ motion for reconsideration was denied by the DARAB in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated June 11, 2004.<br><br>Petitioner filed a petition for review of the decision of the DARAB before the Court of Appeals, alleging that the DARAB gravely erred in finding that (1) once an emancipation patent is issued to a qualified beneficiary, the latter acquires a vested right of absolute ownership in the landholding that is no longer open to doubt or controversy; and (2) respondents are no longer entitled to retention, applying LOI No. 474.<br><br>On May 30, 2005, the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in favor of respondents, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, petition for review is hereby <b>GIVEN DUE COURSE </b>and the assailed October 12, 1998 Decision of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board, Region III of San Fernando, Pampanga in DARAB Case No. 537-P'98, is hereby <b>REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</b>. TCT No. 25866 is hereby <b>DECLARED VOID</b> <i>ab initio</i>. The Register of Deeds is hereby <b>DIRECTED TO CANCEL TCT No. 25866</b> in the name of Crispino Pangilinan in order to fully accord to petitioners BALATBAT their rights of retention under Presidential Decree No. 27 and Section 6 of R.A. No. 6657, and <b>TO ISSUE A NEW TCT</b> in the name of petitioners in lieu of TCT No. 25866 in order to replace TCT No. 181466-R under the name of petitioners that the Register of Deeds of Pampanga cancelled. Since land is tenanted, within a period of one (1) year from finality of this decision, the respondent tenant Crispino Pangilinan shall have the option to choose whether to remain therein or be a beneficiary in the same or another agricultural land with similar or comparable features; in case the tenant chooses to remain in the retained area, he shall be considered a leaseholder and shall lose his right to be a beneficiary under this Act; in case the tenant chooses to be a beneficiary in another agricultural land, he loses his right as a leaseholder to the land retained by the landowner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals stated that P.D. No. 27 allows a landowner to retain not more than seven (7) hectares of his land if his aggregate landholding does not exceed twenty-four (24) hectares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In this case, respondents' total landholding is 25.2548 hectares, of which 9.8683 hectares was covered by land reform being riceland, while the balance of 15.3864 hectares was sugarland. Since respondents timely filed their application for retention of seven hectares way back in 1975 and the deadline was in 1985, the Court of Appeals held that respondents were qualified to retain at least seven hectares.<br><br>Moreover, the Court of Appeals stated that under Administrative Order No. 2, Series of 1994, an Emancipation Patent or Certificate of Land Ownership Award may be cancelled if the land covered is later found to be part of the landowner's retained area. The appellate court held that the transfer certificate of title issued on the basis of the certificate of land transfer could not operate to defeat the right of respondents to retain the five hectares they have chosen, which includes the said less than three (3) hectares (29,942 square meters) of riceland involved in this case.<br><br>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was denied for lack of merit by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated December 2, 2005.<br><br>Petitioner filed this petition raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>I. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR WHEN IT DECIDED CA-G.R. [SP] NO. 85017 WITHOUT REQUIRING THAT PETITIONER HEREIN (AS PRIVATE RESPONDENT IN CA-G.R. [SP] NO. 85017) BE FURNISHED WITH A COPY OF THE PETITION, THUS DEPRIVING THE LATTER HIS RIGHT TO BE HEARD AND TO PRESENT EVIDENCE IN OPPOSITION THERETO.<br><br>II.&nbsp; THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT HEREIN PRIVATE RESPONDENTS FILED THE PETITION IN THE COURT OF APPEALS (CA-G.R [SP] NO. 85017) IN UTMOST BAD FAITH AND ARE GUILTY OF WILLFUL AND DELIBERATE FORUM SHOPPING AND PERJURY.<br><br>III. IF THE PETITION IN CA-G.R. SP NO. 85017 DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE APPLICATION FOR RETENTION OF PRIVATE RESPONDENTS IS NOT CONSIDERED FORUM SHOPPING, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SHOULD HAVE, AT THE VERY LEAST, CONSIDERED THE FORMER AS LITIS PENDENTIA WHICH NECESSITATES THE DISMISSAL OF THE LATER SUIT.<br><br>IV. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT DECLARING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTS HAVE NO CAUSE OF ACTION FOR THE CANCELLATION OF THE SUBJECT EMANCIPATION PATENT.<br><br>V.&nbsp; THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS PREMATURE FOR IT TO DECLARE THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTS ARE ENTITLED TO RETAIN THE SUBJECT LANDHOLDING.<br><br>VI. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR IN NOT FINDING THAT THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS FAILED TO EXHAUST THE AVAILABLE ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES PERTAINING TO THEIR APPLICATION FOR RETENTION BEFORE FILING THEIR COMPLAINT AT THE PROVINCIAL AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATOR OF PAMPANGA AND THE PETITION IN CA-G.R. [SP] NO. 85017.<br><br>VII.&nbsp; THE PROVINCIAL AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATOR OF PAMPANGA ERRED IN ADJUDICATING THE RIGHT OF RETENTION OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS.<br><br>VIII.&nbsp; THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT TOOK COGNIZANCE OF THE PETITION IN CA-G.R. [SP] NO. 85017 DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN THE SAME.<br><br>IX. THE DECISION OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS IN CA-G.R. [SP] NO. 85017 CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST THE REGISTRY OF DEEDS OF PAMPANGA CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS NOT IMPLEADED IN THE CASE FILED BEFORE THE PARAD OF PAMPANGA NOR IN CA-G.R. [SP] NO. 85017.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner contends that he was deprived of the right to be heard and denied due process of law because he was not personally furnished a copy of the petition in CA-G.R. SP No.&nbsp; 85017, which copy was furnished to Mr. Fernando Dizon, his legal counsel before the PARAD and the DARAB.&nbsp; According to petitioner, the legal services rendered to him by Mr. Fernando Dizon in DARAB Case No. 5357- P'98 was merely an accommodation to him in Mr. Dizon’s capacity as Legal Officer for the Legal Services Division of the DAR. Petitioner asserts that after the case was decided and resolved by the DARAB, the legal assistance extended to him by Mr. Fernando Dizon ended, simply because Mr. Fernando Dizon is not a full-fledged lawyer, which the respondents knew very well. Thus, the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated May 30, 2005, cannot be enforced against him.<br><br>Petitioner’s contention lacks merit.<br><br>Petitioner was not denied due process or the right to be heard as he was furnished with a copy of the petition through his counsel of record, Mr. Fernando Dizon, who was his legal counsel before the PARAD and the DARAB.&nbsp; The Court notes that the applicable DARAB New Rules of Procedure (1994)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> allows a non-lawyer to appear before the Board or any of its adjudicators if he is a DAR Legal Officer. As Mr. Dizon was his counsel of record before the PARAD and the DARAB, it may be presumed that petitioner and Mr. Dizon communicated with each other as Mr. Dizon even filed a Comment to the Petition for Review filed by respondents before the Court of Appeals. The filing of the said Comment would show that petitioner was informed by Mr. Dizon that respondents filed a Petition for Review of the Decision of the DARAB with the Court of Appeals. Hence, it is the responsibility of petitioner to engage the services of a lawyer to file a Comment in his behalf and to inform the court of any change of counsel.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 13 (Filing and Service of Pleadings, Judgments and Other Papers) of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <b>Filing and service, defined</b>. – Filing is the act of presenting the pleading or other paper to the clerk of court.<br><br>Service is the act of providing a party with a copy of the pleading or paper concerned. <b>If any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court.</b> Where one counsel appears for several parties, he shall only be entitled to one copy of any paper served upon him by the opposite side. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>As petitioner had a counsel of record, service was properly made upon the said counsel, absent any notification by petitioner to the court of circumstances requiring service upon petitioner himself.<br><br>The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard. Such process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before judgment is rendered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i> Rizal Commercial Bank Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; held:<br><br><blockquote>There is no question that the "essence of due process is a hearing before conviction and before an impartial and disinterested tribunal," but due process as a constitutional precept does not always, and in all situations, require a trial-type proceeding.&nbsp; The essence of due process is to be found in the reasonable opportunity to be heard and submit any evidence one may have in support of one's defense.&nbsp; "To be heard" does not only mean verbal arguments in court; one may be heard also through pleadings.&nbsp; Where opportunity to be heard, either through oral arguments or pleadings, is accorded, there is no denial of procedural due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, petitioner was not denied due process as he was able to file a comment before the Court of Appeals through his counsel of record, DAR Legal Officer Dizon.&nbsp; Moreover, records show that petitioner, with the assistance of two lawyers, Atty. Paul S. Maglalang and Atty. Jord Achaes R. David, filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 30, 2005, which motion was denied for lack of merit by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution dated December 2, 2005.<br><br>Next, petitioner contends that respondents were guilty of forum shopping when they filed on February 4, 1998 the complaint for annulment of emancipation patent, ejectment and damages, since they failed to divulge to the PARAD, DARAB and the Court of Appeals that they had filed an application for retention dated September 28, 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> with the DAR Regional Director, and that the DAR Regional Director denied their application for retention in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated March 12, 1998, and respondents moved for the reconsideration of the said Order of denial; hence, their application for retention was still pending.<br><br>Petitioner's contention is unmeritorious.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Chavez v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> held:<br><br><blockquote>x x x By forum shopping, a party initiates two or more actions in separate tribunals, grounded on the same cause, trusting that one or the other tribunal would favorably dispose of the matter. <b><u>The elements of forum shopping are the same as in <i>litis pendentia</i></u> where the final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other</b>. The elements of forum shopping are: (1) identity of parties, or at least such parties as would represent the same interest in both actions; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (3) identity of the two preceding particulars such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>There is no forum shopping in this case as the parties involved and the reliefs prayed for are different.<br><br>In the letter dated September 28, 1996 addressed to the DAR Regional Director, Region III, respondents reiterated their application for retention of their riceland under R.A. No. 6657. On March 12, 1998, respondents' application for retention was denied by the DAR Regional Director, Region III in Agrarian Reform Case No. LSD 0051 '98.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the party involved in the agrarian reform case is only the respondents, who applied for retention of their landholdings under R.A. No. 6657 before the DAR. The relief sought was the exercise of respondents’ right of retention granted to them as landowners under R.A. No. 6657.<br><br>On the other hand, the Complaint filed by respondents against petitioner before the PARAD was for annulment of emancipation patent, ejectment and damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The parties involved were respondents, petitioner, the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer Victorino D. Guevarra, the DAR Secretary represented by the Regional Director, Region III. The&nbsp; reliefs prayed for was the annulment of the emancipation patent granted to petitioner and the ejectment of&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; on the ground that respondents’ application for retention of their agricultural landholdings, which included the land granted to petitioner in the emancipation patent and the subsequent transfer certificate of title issued pursuant to the emancipation patent,&nbsp; was still unacted upon.<br><br>The essence of forum shopping is the filing of multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively, for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the letter of application for retention of land addressed to the DAR is not a suit against petitioner. Moreover, respondents filed the complaint for annulment of emancipation patent <i>after</i> petitioner was awarded Emancipation Patent No. 00728063 and issued TCT No. 25866, despite the fact that the DAR had not yet ruled on their application for retention of their landholdings, including Lot 21-F, which is the parcel of land covered by Emancipation Patent No. 00728063&nbsp; granted to&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; Hence, it is not shown that herein respondents, as plaintiffs, filed two suits against the same defendants, and that the complaint for annulment of emancipation patent was filed to obtain a favorable judgment on the application for retention, but to protest the issuance of the emancipation patent to petitioner, as respondents' application for retention had not yet been acted upon.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner contends that if the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 85017 during the pendency of the application for retention of private respondents is not considered forum shopping, the Court of Appeals should have at least considered the former as <i>litis pendentia</i>, which necessitates the dismissal of the later suit.<br><br>Petitioner’s contention is without merit.<br><br><i>Dotmatrix Trading v. Legaspi</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> explained the meaning and elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia,</span> thus:<br><br><blockquote><i>Litis pendentia</i> is a Latin term, which literally means "a pending suit" and is variously referred to in some decisions as <i>lis pendens</i> and auter action pendant. As a ground for the dismissal of a civil action, it refers to the situation where two actions are pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, so that one of them becomes unnecessary and vexatious. It is based on the policy against multiplicity of suits.<br><br>To constitute <i>litis pendentia</i>, not only must the parties in the two actions be the same; there must as well be substantial identity in the causes of action and in the reliefs sought.

Petitioner avers that on November 6, 1996, the applicable procedure in applications for retention under P.D. No. 27 is Administrative Order No. 4 series of 1991, while applications under CARP are governed by Administrative Order No. 11, series of 1990. In both the aforesaid administrative orders, it is the DAR Regional Director who has the original jurisdiction to approve or deny applications for retention.&nbsp; In both instances, the decision or order of the DAR Regional Director is appealable to the DAR Secretary.<br><br>Respondents counter that the PARAD and the DARAB had jurisdiction over the case, since it is for the annulment of an emancipation patent registered with the Register of Deeds, which falls under Section 1, Rule II of the DARAB&nbsp; New Rules of Procedure.<br><br>On the issue of jurisdiction, the Court is guided by <i>Heirs of Julian Dela Cruz and Leonora Talaro v. Heirs of Alberto Cruz,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which held:<br><br><blockquote>It is axiomatic that<b> the jurisdiction of a tribunal, including a quasi-judicial officer or government agency, over the nature and subject matter of a petition or complaint is determined by the material allegations therein and the character of the relief prayed for, irrespective of whether the petitioner or complainant is entitled to any or all such reliefs.&nbsp; </b>Jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of an action is conferred by the Constitution and the law, and not by the consent or waiver of the parties where the court otherwise would have no jurisdiction over the nature or subject matter of the action.&nbsp; Nor can it be acquired through, or waived by, any act or omission of the parties.&nbsp; Moreover, estoppel does not apply to confer jurisdiction to a tribunal that has none over the cause of action. The failure of the parties to challenge the jurisdiction of the DARAB does not prevent the court from addressing the issue, especially where the DARAB’s lack of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the complaint or petition.<br><br>Indeed, the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal is not affected by the defenses or theories set up by the defendant or respondent in his answer or motion to dismiss.&nbsp; Jurisdiction should be determined by considering not only the status or the relationship of the parties but also the nature of the issues or questions that is the subject of the controversy.&nbsp; <b>If the issues between the parties are intertwined with the resolution of an issue within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DARAB, such dispute must be addressed and resolved by the DARAB.</b>&nbsp; The proceedings before a court or tribunal without jurisdiction, including its decision, are null and void, hence, susceptible to direct and collateral attacks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, respondents alleged in their Complaint:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>2.

That despite private defendant Victorino Guevarra's knowledge of the fact that the land is one of those applied for retention, he acted in bad faith and without notice to the plaintiffs and in wanton disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs and in collusion with the private defendant, Crispino Pangilinan, recommended for the coverage of the latter's land under Operation Land Transfer and through the defendants’ collective efforts, private defendants requested for the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 25866 with Emancipation Patent (E.P.)

The applicable DARAB New Rules of Procedure (1994) did not contain a contrary proviso in Section 1 or Section 1 (f) thereof.<br><br>The Court notes that even before the Provincial Adjudicator rendered his decision dated October 12, 1998 on the complaint for annulment of petitioner's emancipation patent, the DAR Regional Director of Pampanga had already issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated March 12, 1998, denying the application for retention of respondents. The DAR Regional Director held, thus:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he applicant seeks before this Office the grant of five (5) hectares of her landholding as retention rights under the law and, further, requested that said retention area is from her landholding covered and embraced by Title Nos.

Ana, Province of Pampanga.&nbsp; Said application was received by DAR Sta. Ana Office on December 24, 1975, but however, it appears that it was not acted [upon] nor forwarded [to] this Office for action.<br><br>It appears also from the records of this case that it is only now [that] the applicant is re-applying for retention as per letter of her counsel, Atty. Proceso M. Nacino, dated November 6, 1996.&nbsp; This time, the MARO had already processed and forwarded to the PARO the claimfolders of applicant tenant-farmers, whereby, the Emancipation Patent Titles of the applicant farmer-beneficiaries, namely:&nbsp; Maximo Lagman, Crispino Pangilinan and Cecilio Yumul were already generated, issued and distributed to them as evidenced by the certification issued by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).<br><br>Additionally, with respect to the portion of the landholding of the applicant which was utilized as subdivision/condominium project named Carolina Village II, Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 1991, giving close attention to Policy Statements I-B, which provides that:<br><br>“1. Landowners covered by PD 27 are entitled to retain seven hectares[,] except&nbsp; those [whose] entire [tenanted] rice and corn lands are subject of acquisition and distribution under Operation&nbsp; Land&nbsp; Transfer (OLT).&nbsp; An owner of tenanted rice and corn lands may not retain these lands under the following cases:<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br><blockquote>b.&nbsp; [B]y virtue of LOI 474, if he as of 21 October 1976 owned less than 24 hectares of tenanted rice and corn lands but additionally owned the following:<br><br><blockquote>- Other&nbsp; agricultural lands of more than seven (7) hectares, whether tenanted or not, whether cultivated or not, and [regardless of the income derived therefrom]; or<br><br>-&nbsp; Lands used for residential, commercial, industrial, or other urban purposes[,] from which he derives adequate income to support himself and his family.”</blockquote></blockquote><br>Given this situation, it is in this provision of law that this Office strongly deny the application for retention of the herein applicant in favor of the farmer-beneficiaries concerned who had already been issued their Emancipation Patents (EP).<br><br>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing analysis and for the reason indicated therein, an ORDER is hereby issued DENYING the application for retention of Jocelyn Balatbat for utter lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The&nbsp; legal basis of the decision of the DARAB in&nbsp; determining whether respondents&nbsp; were qualified to retain their riceland, in order to resolve the main issue on whether there was a ground for the cancellation of petitioner's emancipation patent, is the same as the legal basis of the DAR Regional Director in denying respondents' application for retention.<br><br>Moreover, the decision of the DARAB is appealable to the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Section 54<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of R.A.

The respective decisions of the PARAD and the DARAB, that there was no ground for the cancellation of petitioner's emancipation patent, hinged on the finding that respondents were disqualified to retain their riceland, and the legal basis of the said disqualification is consistent with the legal basis of the Regional Director's Order dated March 12, 1998, denying respondents' application for retention.<br><br>Administrative Order No. 11, series of 1990, which contains the Rules and Procedures Governing the Exercise of Retention Rights by Landowners and Award to Children Under Section 6 of RA 6657 states that “[t]he decision of the Regional Director approving or disapproving the application of the landowner for the retention and award shall become final after fifteen (15) days upon receipt of the decision, unless an appeal is made to the DAR Secretary.” Moreover, Administrative Order No. 4, series of 1991, which contains the Supplemental Guidelines Governing the Exercise of Retention Rights by Landowners Under Presidential Decree No. 27 states that “[t]he Order of the Regional Director approving or denying the application for retention shall become final fifteen (15) days from receipt of the same unless an appeal is made to the DAR Secretary.”&nbsp; Hence, it is the DAR Secretary who finally approves or denies the application for retention.<br><br>In this case, the Order dated March 12, 1998 of the Regional Director, denying respondents' application for retention, appears to be pending before the DAR Secretary, and respondents failed to present any evidence that the said Order had been reversed to warrant the cancellation of petitioner’s emancipation patent.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals’ Decision dated May 30, 2005 in CA-G.R.
