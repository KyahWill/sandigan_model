Aileen Bernido (P/Sr. Insp. Bernido).&nbsp; The evidence for the prosecution, as summarized in the trial court’s May 7, 2005 Decision, tends to establish the following:<br><br><blockquote>In 2003, P/Supt. Rolando Abutay was the Regional Director of the PDEA based in Cagayan de Oro City.&nbsp; SPO2 Edgardo Englatierra was and still is the Team Leader of the PDEA in Iligan City.&nbsp; His members include SPO2 George Salo and SPO2 Diosdado Cabahug.<br><br>Three days prior to March 30, 2003, Supt. Abutay called by phone Officer Englatierra that there was an expected arrival of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in Iligan City and to watch Room 65 of the Patria Pension at Laya St., Iligan City.<br><br>In the early morning of March 30, 2003, Supt. Abutay arrived in Iligan City with his civilian asset (CA).&nbsp; He conducted a briefing at the PDEA office in Tipanoy, Iligan City.&nbsp; Present were Officers Englatierra, Salo, Cabahug and the CA.&nbsp; He informed [them] that there was going to be a “meet” at Room 65 of Patria Pension.&nbsp; He designated Officer George Salo and his CA to act as poseur buyers.&nbsp; He instructed Officer Salo and his C[A] to check-in at Room 65 of Patria Pension.&nbsp; He assigned himself and Officers Englatierra and Cabahug as the back-up team.&nbsp; He gave to Officer Salo two 500-peso bills to be used as part of the buy-bust money.&nbsp; They caused the two x x x 500-peso bills to be [photocopied] and authenticated at the Office of the City Prosecutor of Iligan City, Exh. A.&nbsp; Then they prepared a boodle money consisting of one genuine 500-peso bill on top, fake money at the middle and one genuine 500-peso bill at the bottom.&nbsp; After that Officer Salo and the CA went to the Patria Pension with the boodle money.&nbsp; They checked in at Rm 65 at about 11:00 a.m.&nbsp; The back-up team stayed at the office.<br><br>At about 4:30 p.m., Supt. Abutay and Officers Englatierra and Cabahug left the PDEA office. They went directly to the Patria Pension and checked in at Rm 64 across the corridor from Rm 65. A little later, the CA entered Rm 64 and handed to them the key to Rm 65.<br><br>At about 7:00 p.m., Officer Salo and the CA were inside Rm 65.&nbsp; The CA received a call on his celphone.&nbsp; After the call, the CA told Officer Salo that someone will check if they had the money.&nbsp; Several minutes later, they heard a knock at the door.&nbsp; They saw a woman they did not know but later learned that she was Mae Elarmo.&nbsp; They invited her inside.&nbsp; Upon entering the room, she asked if they had the money.&nbsp; Officer Salo showed to her the boodle money.&nbsp; She simply looked at the bundle and made a call with her celphone.&nbsp; Sometime later, they heard another knock at the door.&nbsp; The CA opened the door and a man and a woman entered the room.&nbsp; The man asked where is the money.&nbsp; Officer Salo showed to him the bundle of money.&nbsp; He looked at the bundle and introduced himself as Bernabe Aneslag.&nbsp; The female companion did not say anything.&nbsp; They learned later that she was Minda Aneslag.&nbsp; After Bernabe Aneslag looked at the bundle of money, he made a call on his celphone.&nbsp; A minute or two later, there was knock at the door.&nbsp; The CA opened the door.&nbsp; A woman, who was holding a Ferragamo bag colored red, Exh. F, entered the room.&nbsp; They learned later that her name is Jocelyn Concepcion y Lao.&nbsp; Bernabe told her to give the bag to Officer Salo.&nbsp; She handed it to Officer Salo, who received it.&nbsp; He opened the zipper and looked inside.&nbsp; He found two big packs and four smaller packs of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.&nbsp; Then Bernabe Aneslag asked for the money.&nbsp; Officer Salo handed to him the bundle of money.&nbsp; After Bernabe Aneslag received the money, the CA pressed his celphone to give the signal to Supt. Abutay that the transaction was completed.<br><br>When Supt. Abutay received the signal, he said let’s go.&nbsp; They went out of Rm 64, opened the door to Rm 65 with the key and rushed in.&nbsp; They found inside the room Bernabe Aneslag, Minda Aneslag, Jocelyn Concepcion and Mae Elarmo. They introduced themselves as police officers, arrested them and informed them of their rights.&nbsp; Officer Englatierra took possession of the boodle money from Bernabe Aneslag while Officer Salo took possession of the red bag and the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.&nbsp; They brought them to Pol[i]ce Precinct No. 01 for recording purposes and then took them to the PDEA office in Tipanoy, Iligan City.&nbsp; At the office, Officer Salo marked the two big bags as “GRS-1” and “GRS-2”.&nbsp; He also marked the four smaller packs as “GS-1, GS-2, GS-3 and GS-4” respectively.&nbsp; GRS or GS represent[s] his initials.&nbsp; Thereafter, a Request for Laboratory Examination was prepared, Exh. B.&nbsp; The following day, Officer Salo delivered the request and the six packs of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> to the PNP Provincial Crime Laboratory at Tipanoy, Iligan City.&nbsp; The specimens were originally examined by P/Insp. Mary Leocy Jabonillo-Mag-abo, Forensic Chemical Officer of the said laboratory.&nbsp; After her examination, she delivered the specimens to the Office of the City Prosecutor.&nbsp; However, when this case was called for hearing on July 18, 2003, the court was informed that Insp. Mag-abo was not available because she was sent to the Philippine Public Safety College, Makati City to undergo training in Public Safety Advance Course for a period of four (4) months. To avoid further delay, the court issued an order directing the PDEA, Iligan City, to arrange for another laboratory examination of the specimens at the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory, Cagayan de Oro City, Exh. C.&nbsp; On July 21, 2003, Officer Salo retrieved the specimens from the Office of the City Prosecutor, Iligan City and signed a receipt therefor, Exh. B-2.&nbsp; On July 23, 2003, SPO2 Diosdado Cabahug of the PDEA, Iligan City handcarried the specimens, the Request for Laboratory Examination, Exh. B, the receipt signed by Officer Salo, Exh. B-2 and the Order of this court, Exh. C, to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory, Camp Evangelista, Cagayan de Oro City.&nbsp; PO3 Paltinga, receiving clerk of the Regional Crime Laboratory, [received] the specimens and the documents, Exh. C-1. Officer Paltinga turned over the specimen and documents to P/Sr. Insp. Aileen Undag Bernido, Forensic Chemical Officer.&nbsp; Insp. Bernido immediately performed the required laboratory examination of the specimens in three steps, namely: the physical test, color or screening test and the confirmatory test.<br><br>The first step, which is the physical test consists of the ocular inspection and weighing.&nbsp; When she received the specimens, they were inside a closed brown letter envelope, Exh. E-6. She wrote on the surface of the envelope the markings “D-419-03 AUB” representing the dangerous drugs number she assigned to it and her initials.&nbsp; Then she opened the envelope and found inside it two (2) big packs and four (4) smaller packs containing white crystalline substance. She found the packs were marked “GRS-1” and “GRS-2” for the two big packs and “GS-1”, “GS-2”, “GS-3” and “GS-4” respectively for the four small packs.&nbsp; Both ends of each pack were tape-sealed.&nbsp; She opened the packs and weighed the contents of each pack individually.&nbsp; The packs weighed as follows: GRS-1 = 96.4 grams, GRS-2 = 97.2 grams, GS-1, GS-2, GS-3 and GS-4 weighed 4.1 gamrs (sic) each.&nbsp; The total weight was 210 grams.&nbsp; After weighing each pack, she removed a representative sample and proceeded to the color test and confirmatory test.&nbsp; Thus, she followed the following procedure: First, she marked [the] surface of the pack already marked GRS-1 with the dangerous drugs number and her initials “D-419-03 AUB”.&nbsp; Then she opened it and weighed the contents. After that, she removed a representative sample. She returned the remaining contents into the original pack and resealed it with a masking tape. She wrote on the masking tape her identification mark “D-419-03 A1 AUB”.&nbsp; Then she proceeded to the color test by applying on the representative sample a Simons reagent.&nbsp; The results gave a blue color indicating the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. She continued with the confirmatory test using a Thin Layer Chromatography. The results confirmed the findings of the color or screening test.&nbsp; She followed exactly the same procedure for the succeeding packs.&nbsp; Each pack was accordingly given her own identification markings, as follows: GRS-2 was marked “D-419-03 A2 AUB”, GS-1 was marked “D-419-03 A3 AUB”, GS-2 was marked “D-419-03 A4 AUB”, GS-3 was marked “D-419-03 A5 AUB” and GS-4 was marked “D-419-03 A6 AUB”.&nbsp; Each of the packs gave positive result for the presence of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.&nbsp; She prepared Chemistry Report No. D-419-03 (re-exam), Exh. “D” which embodies her findings and conclusion that “Specimens A1 to A6 contain Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>The defense presented the testimonies of Mae, appellant Bernabe and appellant Jocelyn.

Then Joy and Mae crossed back and approached Bernabe and Menda. Joy invited them to dinner.&nbsp; They accepted. They walked to the JoArt Restaurant.&nbsp; They did not ride on a taxi.&nbsp; Joy was holding a red bag.&nbsp; While they were eating, Joy gave to Bernabe a piece of paper with the words Rm 65 Patria Pension and some names written on it.&nbsp; Joy asked Bernabe to send Mae to Patria Pension, find Rm 65 and look for the persons whose names were written on the piece of paper.&nbsp; He instructed Mae accordingly.&nbsp; Joy gave Mae the fare for a PU car.&nbsp; Mae left.&nbsp; About fifteen minutes later, Joy told them that they will follow Mae.&nbsp; They rode on a PU car for Patria Pension.&nbsp; On arrival, Bernabe, Menda and Joy went directly to Rm 65.&nbsp; Bernabe knocked at the door.

No. 9165, defines the chain of custody —<br><br><blockquote>b. “Chain of Custody” means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/ confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction. Such record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Malillin v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> we explained the rationale of the chain of custody rule in this wise -<br><br><blockquote>Prosecutions for illegal possession of prohibited drugs necessitates that the elemental act of possession of a prohibited substance be established with moral certainty, together with the fact that the same is not authorized by law. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very corpus delicti of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. Essential therefore in these cases is that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. Be that as it may, the mere fact of unauthorized possession will not suffice to create in a reasonable mind the moral certainty required to sustain a finding of guilt. More than just the fact of possession, the fact that the substance illegally possessed in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt. The chain of custody requirement performs this function in that it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.<br><br>As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness’ possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, while the procedure under Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 was not strictly complied with, we find that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized <i>shabu </i>was duly preserved consistent with the chain of custody rule.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the appellate court, from the time of the arrest of the appellants and the confiscation of the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs until their turnover for laboratory examination, SPO2 Salo was in sole possession thereof.&nbsp; During his testimony, he identified the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs and the markings that he had previously made thereon, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">And you said this backup team entered Room 65?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Once they were already in Rm. 65 what did you do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">They were the one’s [sic] who arrested and informed them of their rights.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">After the accused were already apprised of their rights by your companions, what happened to the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> subject of the case?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We brought the accused and the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> to Police Station 1.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Who was in possession of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Me sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">From the time of the arrest until the time these people were brought to the Police Station?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">It was me sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Were you able to bring all the accused and the specimens to the police station?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes sir at Police Station 1.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">When they were already at the police station 1, what did you do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The blotter was made and we made an inventory of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> that was confiscated.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Was there any Certificate of Inventory made?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">We do not have a certificate of inventory but we do have logbook.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Were there pictures taken at the time of the inventory?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">ATTY.

Mary Leocy Jabonillo Mag-abo (P/Sr. Insp. Mag-abo), the forensic chemist from the PNP Crime Laboratory of Iligan City who conducted the examination on the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs, was unavailable because she had to undergo training in Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the trial court issued an order for the conduct of another examination on the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs by a forensic chemist in Cagayan de Oro City in order to expedite the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs were turned over to SPO2 Salo, as evidenced by an acknowledgement receipt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and thereafter delivered to the PNP Crime Laboratory of Cagayan de Oro City where the said packs were received by PNCO PO3 Paltinca<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> who, in turn, forwarded the same to P/Sr. Insp. Bernido, the examiner assigned to this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The chemistry report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and testimony of P/Sr. Insp. Bernido corroborated the testimony of SPO2 Salo relative to the markings the latter made on the packs of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> (i.e., GRS-1 and GRS-2 for the bigger packs, and GS-1, GS-2, GS-3, and GS-4 for the smaller packs)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as well as the number and size of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs (i.e., two big packs and four smaller packs).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; P/Sr. Insp. Bernido identified the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs in court as well as the separate markings she made thereon; she further testified that the six packs tested positive for <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, we find that the chain of custody rule was complied with.&nbsp; The prosecution’s evidence sufficiently established an unbroken link in the chain of custody which precluded the alteration, substitution or tampering of the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs.<br><br>Anent appellants’ claim that the total weight of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs as alleged in the Information, i.e., 240 grams,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> varies substantially from the total weight as determined by the forensic chemist,&nbsp; i.e., 210 grams, we find the same insufficient to overcome the previous finding that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> was duly preserved.&nbsp; As noted by the appellate court, there are a host of possible reasons for the variance such as the difference in the accuracy of the weighing scales used by the police operatives vis-à-vis the forensic chemist. We also note that: (1) as previously narrated, the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> packs were twice tested by two different forensic chemists in order to expedite the proceedings as per the order of the trial court so that representative samples of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> were taken from the aforesaid packs by the first forensic chemist (P/Sr. Insp. Mag-abo) which could have affected the total weight as determined by the second forensic chemist (P/Sr. Insp. Bernido), and (2) P/Sr. Insp. Bernido testified that when she weighed each pack of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>, the same was done without the packaging material thereof<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which could have, likewise, affected the total weight of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.<br><br>Appellants further advert to the alleged inconsistent, conflicting and incredible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. According to appellants, SPO2 Salo testified that appellant Jocelyn handed to him (SPO2 Salo) a red bag containing six packs of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> while SPO2 Englatiera testified that the said bag was in front of Mae and that SPO2 Salo told him (SPO2 Englatiera) that the bag was taken from Mae.&nbsp; Furthermore, the prosecution witnesses testified that SPO2 Salo and the civilian asset were inside Room 65 while police officers Abutay, Englatiera and Cabahug were in Room 64.&nbsp; However, paragraph 4 of the joint affidavit executed by police officers Salo, Englatiera and Cabahug before the city prosecutor stated that they were posted facing the area where the transaction is to be conducted and had a clear view of the operation.<br><br>The contention is untenable.<br><br>We have examined the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and we find that the alleged inconsistencies are minor or trivial which serve to strengthen, rather than destroy, the credibility of the said witnesses as they erase doubts that the said testimonies had been coached or rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Anent the matter of who was holding the red bag containing the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> before it was confiscated by the police operatives, the trial court found more credible the testimony of SPO2 Salo that the said bag was given to him (SPO2 Salo) by appellant Jocelyn after he paid for the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> with boodle money.&nbsp; We cannot fault the trial court for making this finding because SPO2 Salo was the one present during the buying transaction. SPO2 Englatiera arrived only after the pre-arranged signal (as to the completion of the sale of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>) was given to him, along with the other members of the backup team, who then entered the room and arrested the appellants.&nbsp; SPO2 Englatiera’s testimony, therefore, on this matter is hearsay.<br><br>Anent appellants’ claim of inconsistency between the joint affidavit executed by the police officers, namely, Salo, Englatiera and Cabahug vis-à-vis the testimonies of police officers Salo and Englatiera in open court, we find the same to be misleading because appellants quoted only a portion of the said affidavit. An examination of the whole joint affidavit reveals that the same is consistent with the testimonies of police officers Salo and Englatiera in open court. Specifically, the joint affidavit states that “while in the area[,] we (referring to Salo, Englatiera, Cabahug) posted ourselves fronting the place of [the] buying transaction [where] we had a clear view of the progress of the operation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, the succeeding paragraphs of the joint affidavit narrated the ensuing events as well as the individual roles of SPO2 Salo and the confidential agent, as poseur buyers, and police officers Englatiera and Cabahug, as part of the backup team, which is consistent with the testimonies of police officers Salo and Englatiera in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Finally, appellants contend that appellant Bernabe was not subjected to ultra-violet powder examination or finger printing casting doubt as to whether he was the one who allegedly received and counted the boodle money.&nbsp; They also question the reliability of the Thin Layer Chromatography used by the forensic chemist in determining the presence of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in the six packs seized from appellants. Moreover, appellants argue that the police officers should have first secured a search warrant given that they conducted a surveillance of the place three days prior to the buy-bust operation.<br><br>The contentions are, likewise, untenable.<br><br>Neither law nor jurisprudence requires that the police must apply fluorescent powder to the buy-bust money to prove the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; The same holds true for the conduct of finger print examination on the money used in the buy-bust operation.&nbsp; What is crucial is that the prosecution proves, as in this case, the delivery of the prohibited drugs to the poseur-buyer and the presentation of the confiscated drugs before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Anent the claim that the Thin Layer Chromatography used by the forensic chemist in determining the presence of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in the six packs is unreliable, we find the same to be unsubstantiated.&nbsp; Except for their bare allegation, the defense did not present clear and convincing evidence to prove that the findings of the forensic chemist were erroneous.<br><br>Lastly, anent appellants’ contention that the police operatives should have first secured a search warrant, we agree with the observation of the trial court that it would have been impracticable to secure such a search warrant because appellants were not residing in the agreed meeting place (i.e., Room 65 of Patria Pension) at the time of the surveillance.&nbsp; The surveillance was conducted for the mere purpose of determining the respective roles and positions of the police operatives in anticipation of the buying transaction which was to happen there three days later.&nbsp; More important, in a buy-bust operation, the police operatives are not required to secure a search warrant because the violator is caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> and the police officers, in the course of the operation, are not only authorized but duty-bound to apprehend the violator and to search him for anything that may have been part of or used in the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>All in all, we find that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the crime of illegal sale of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the drug sold and its payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the conviction of appellants was proper.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The August 27, 2008 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
