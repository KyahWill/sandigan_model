				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>This is an administrative complaint filed by Spouses Jesus G. Crisologo and Nannette B. Crisologo (Sps. Crisologo) against Judge George E. Omelio (Judge Omelio) of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14, Davao City.&nbsp; In their Complaint-Affidavit, Sps. Crisologo charged Judge Omelio with the following:&nbsp; (a) gross ignorance of the law and interference with the proceedings of a co-equal and coordinate court in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction which frustrates the execution of a final and executory decision of RTC, Branch 15; (b) gross ignorance of the law and grave abuse of discretion for issuing a writ of preliminary injunction without an evidentiary hearing and in the absence of a clear and positive ground; and (c) gross ignorance of the law, grave abuse of discretion, gross dereliction of duty and manifest bias for refusing to recognize them as indispensable parties, and giving due course to an action where the plaintiff merely impleads the indispensable parties as John Does and Jane Does despite full knowledge of their identities.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></span></sup><br><br>In the Supplement to the Affidavit-Complaint and Reply, Sps. Crisologo charged Judge Omelio with gross ignorance of the law for granting the contentious Motion to Render Judgment Granting Plaintiff the Relief Prayed for with Memorandum Attached, which was filed on 6 December 2010, but set for hearing on 8 December 2010, in violation of the three-day notice requirement under Section 4, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></span></sup>&nbsp; In their Memorandum, Sps. Crisologo likewise charged Judge Omelio with manifest bias for: (a) proceeding with the case despite non-compliance with the rules on summons; (b) cancelling the registration of sale where Sps. Crisologo are buyers in another case without due process; and (c) issuing two conflicting orders, with one showing prejudgment.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></span></sup><br><br>In response, Judge Omelio filed his Comment and Counter-complaint, claiming that the present administrative complaint was intended to harass him for unfavorable rulings he made against the Sps.

Lam on August 26, 1999.&nbsp; New titles were subsequently issued – TCT Nos. T-316182 and T-316181.&nbsp; Eventually, these properties were sold to JEWM Agro-Industrial Corporation, thus, the TCT Nos. T-325675 and T-325676 were issued in JEWM’s name.&nbsp; Entry Nos. 1127625 and 1127626 for Civil Case No. 26,810-98 and Entry Nos. 1127629 and 1127627 for Civil Case No. 26,811-98, <u>all inscribed on October 7, 1998</u>, were carried over to TCT Nos. T-325675 and T-325676.<br><br>Meanwhile, the complainant-spouses Crisologo obtained a favorable judgment in Civil Case Nos. 26,810-98 and 26,811-98.&nbsp; The same became final and executory on March 3, 2010.&nbsp; Pursuant thereto and upon the instance of the complainant-spouses, a Writ of Execution was issued by RTC, Branch 15 on June 15, 2010.&nbsp; The Writ reads:<br><br><blockquote><center>“xxx&nbsp; xxx&nbsp; xxx</center><br>WHEREAS, on appeal, the Honorable Court of Appeals modified this court’s decision as follows:<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant appeal is partially GRANTED.&nbsp; Accordingly, the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, 11th Judicial Region, Branch 15, Davao City dated July 1, 1999 is hereby MODIFIED in the sense that appellant’s loan obligations are subject to an interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum, to be computed from December 16, 1997 (for Case No. 26,810-98) and September 23, 1998 (for case No. 26,811-98) until fully paid, and that the award for exemplary damage[s] is hereby DELETED.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp; xxx&nbsp; xxx</center><br>WHEREAS, on July 6, 2010, defendants-appellants filed a Petition for Review on certiorari to the Supreme Court which was DENIED by the Honorable Supreme Court per its Resolution dated August 17, 2009 and an Entry of Judgment dated March 3, 2010 was issued declaring the said resolution to be final, unappealable and executory;<br><br>WHEREAS, on June 9, 2010, the court issued an Order granting the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution;<br><br>THEREFORE, you are commanded to implement the writ for the satisfaction of the judgment in the decision in accordance with the Rules of Court xxx xxx xxx.”</blockquote><br>Subsequently, a Notice of Sale was issued by Sheriff Robert M. Medialdea, Sheriff IV, Regional Trial Court on the subject properties: (1) Lot 650-B-2-A-2 covered by TCT No. T-325675, a derivative of TCT No. T-292597; and (2) Lot 3465-A-1-B covered by TCT No. T-325676, a derivative of TCT No. T-292600.<br><br>As the foregoing properties are already in JEWM’s name, JEWM, through its representative, filed an Affidavit of Third-Party Claim and an Urgent Motion Ad Cautelam before RTC, Branch 15.&nbsp; These were denied by the said court in its Order dated August 26, 2010 stating in part that <i>it cannot issue a restraining order directing the sheriff to exclude the subject properties on the basis of AD CAUTELAM motions and affidavit[s] of third party claim as these were not the proper mode of action prescribed by the Rules of Court to seek injunctive relief from the court.</i><br><br>Aggrieved, JEWM filed a complaint for Cancellation of Lien, with Application for Writ of Preliminary Injunction against the Register of Deeds, Davao City, Sheriff Robert Medialdea, JOHN and JANE DOES, and all persons acting under their directions on September 16, 2010[.]&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 33,557-2010; and was subsequently raffled to RTC-Branch 14, Davao City.<br><br>On September 22, 2010, Atty. Rene Andrei Q. Saguisag, Jr., representing herein complainant-spouses, entered his appearance and manifested that spouses Crisologo are parties in interest in Civil Case No. 33,557-2010.&nbsp; He argued that the issuance of the writ of injunction would interfere with the proceedings of a co-equal court, RTC, Branch 15, which ordered the execution of the decision in Civil Case Nos. 26,810-98 and 26,811-98.&nbsp; He also posited that there exist[s] no cause for the issuance of the writ as the bond they posted in Civil Case Nos. 26,810-98 and 26,811-98 is substantial enough to cover any damage JEWM might sustain by reason of the implementation of the Writ of Execution.<br><br>Atty. Saguisag also filed in open court a Very Urgent Manifestation (ad cautelam) and he signified his clients’ intention to file a proper motion to intervene.&nbsp; Thus, on September 27, 2010, herein complainant-spouses filed an Omnibus Motion reiterating their positions manifested during the hearing on the issuance of a preliminary writ of injunction.<br><br>In addition, complainant-spouses posited that JEWM failed to present evidence of damage it would suffer or the amount of damage it would sustain.&nbsp; They stressed that the subject properties are still encumbered, and whoever buys encumbered property purchases the same subject to the attachment thereon.&nbsp; They also argued that they are the John and Jane Does referred to in Civil Case No. 33,557-2010, because the annotations JEWM sought to cancel include their liens. They insisted that they are indispensable parties, being John and Jane Does of Civil Case No. 33-557-2016,&nbsp; hence, intervention is no longer necessary.<br><br>The RTC, Branch 14, issued an Order dated September 27, 2010 directing the issuance of a preliminary writ of injunction enjoining the Register of Deeds, Davao City, Sheriff Robert Medialdea, John and Jane Does and all persons acting in their respective stead from enforcing the first and second notices of auction sale in so far as TCT Nos. T-325675 and T-325676 are concerned.&nbsp; After JEWM posted the required bond of Php500,000.00, a Writ of Preliminary Injunction was issued on October 5, 2010, to quote:<br><br><blockquote>“After a careful scrutiny and analysis on the evidence thus far shown by the plaintiff-applicant, the court is of its considered view and so hold to grant the ancillary relief for preliminary writ of injunction applied for.<br><br>WHEREFORE, let [the] preliminary writ of injunction issue xxx xxx xxx during the pendency or until final adjudication on the merit of this case, or until final order from this Court.”</blockquote><br>Dissatisfied, herein complainant-spouses filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a Very Urgent Omnibus Motion on October 4, 2010 asking the RTC, Branch 14 to resolve the Omnibus Motion filed on September 27, 2010, the Very Urgent Omnibus Motion, and for the reconsideration of the Order dated September 27, 2010.&nbsp; The same was denied and ordered stricken off the records by RTC, Branch 14 in its Order dated November 9, 2010.<br><br>On October 15, 2010, complainant-spouses filed this present case before the Office of the Court Administrator.<br><br><blockquote>Complainant-spouses Crisologo principally aver the following:<br><br>1.They are plaintiffs in a collection suit docketed as Civil Case Nos. 26,810-98 and 26-811-98 raffled to RTC, Branch 15, Davao City.&nbsp; They obtained a favorable judgment which had become final and executory on March 3, 2010.&nbsp; Accordingly, a Writ of Execution dated June 15, 2010 was issued for the satisfaction of said final judgment.&nbsp; Notice of Sale and publication requirements were allegedly complied with.&nbsp; The Notice included two (2) properties covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) Nos. 325675 and 325676, which contained annotations, to wit:<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>2.The subject properties are now in the name of JEWM but were formerly owned by SO KENG KOC and attached by order of the RTC, Branch 15, Davao City as early as 1998 in Civil Case Nos. 26,810-98 and 26,811-98;<br><br>3.JEWM filed an Affidavit of Third Party Claim and a Motion to Exclude the Subject Properties from the Auction Sale, but were all denied by RTC, Branch 15 in its Order dated August 25, 2010.&nbsp; Instead, the court directed the sheriff to proceed with the sale on August 26, 2010;<br><br>4.The auction sale was, however, rescheduled to October 7, 2010 because the sheriff, accordingly, orally demanded the posting of a bond in accordance with Section 16, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court;<br><br>5.JEWM filed an action for cancellation of liens with prayer for the issuance of a preliminary injunction on September 16, 2010 involving two (2) aforesaid properties covered by Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) Nos. 325675 and 325676;<br><br>6.The issuance of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoining the execution of a final and executory judgment of RTC Branch 15, a co-equal and coordinate court was without an evidentiary hearing;<br><br>7.Respondent Judge’s refusal to recognize complainants as indispensable parties being lien holders of the subject properties was tainted with manifest bias and partiality.</blockquote><br>They prayed that respondent Judge be held administratively liable, his actions allegedly constitute gross ignorance of the law, grave abuse of discretion and gross dereliction of duty and manifest bias.<br><br>On January 3, 2011, complainant-spouses again filed a Very Urgent Manifestation (ad cautelam) stating that they cannot be declared in default as they were not yet served with summons.<br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator in its 1st Indorsement dated January 10, 2010 required respondent Judge to submit his Comment to the instant Affidavit-Complaint.&nbsp; In his Comment dated February 8, 2011, he vehemently denied the material allegations in the affidavit-complaint.&nbsp; He contends that to constitute gross ignorance of the law, he must be moved by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption which complainant-spouses allegedly failed to adduce. Furthermore, respondent Judge avers that he did not interfere with the proceedings of a co-equal and coordinate court, RTC, Branch 15, when he issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction.&nbsp; The subject properties had already been made to satisfy the first annotated levy on attachment – the Entry Nos. 1121176 and 1121177 made on September 8, 1998 for Civil Case No. 26,513-98 filed before RTC, Branch 8, Davao City pursuant to a final judgment in said case.<br><br>In addition, JEWM is not a party to Civil Case Nos. 26,810-98 and 26,811-98 both entitled “Nannette B. Crisologo and Jesus Crisologo vs. Robert Allan Limso and So Keng Koc, et al.”&nbsp; He asserts that complainant-spouses did not file a proper Motion to Intervene with Pleading-in-Intervention in observance of the requirements laid down in Rule 19 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; He stresses that while he granted the assailed injunction and denied the appearance of the complainants, the same did not constitute gross ignorance of the law.&nbsp; He likewise points out Supreme Court’s proscription on the filing of an administrative complaint before exhaustion of judicial remedies against questioned errors of a judge in the exercise of its jurisdiction.&nbsp; He also filed a Counter-Complaint where he emphasized the exhaustion of judicial remedies as pre-requisite to the filing of an administrative case.&nbsp; He prayed that complainant-spouses and their counsel be administratively punished for knowingly and unjustly filing the alleged unfounded administrative complaint against him.<br><br>In a Resolution dated September 12, 2011, the Second Division of the Supreme Court resolved to refer the instant administrative complaint to a Justice of the Court of Appeals, Cagayan de Oro City for investigation, report and recommendation within sixty (60) days from receipt of the records thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><u>Report of the Investigating Justice<br>of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>After notice and hearing, the Investigating Justice of the Court of Appeals of Cagayan de Oro City recommended the following:<br><br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, it is respectfully recommended that:<br><br>a) The charge of interference with proceedings of a co-equal and coordinate court be dismissed for lack of merit;<br><br>b) As to the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction without conducting an evidentiary hearing, respondent Judge George E. Omelio be ordered to pay a FINE in the amount of P30,000.00 with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely; and <br><br>c) Anent the charge of refusing to recognize the complainants as indispensable parties, respondent Judge be ADMONISHED to be more careful and diligent in the discharge of his judicial functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>On the charge of interference with the proceedings of a co-equal and coordinate court in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction which frustrates the execution of a final and executory decision, the Investigating Justice found that there was no interference.&nbsp; Section 16, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court allows third-party claimants of properties under execution, such as JEWM Agro Industrial Corp. (JEWM) in this case, to vindicate their claims to the property in a separate action with another court, which in the exercise of its own jurisdiction, may issue a temporary restraining order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On the charge of issuing a writ of preliminary injunction without evidentiary hearing, the Investigating Justice found Judge Omelio guilty.&nbsp; Judge Omelio claimed that Sps. Crisologo were not able to adduce evidence to prove that he was moved by corruption in issuing the injunctive relief.&nbsp; The Investigating Justice, however, found no merit in this argument because lack of malicious intent cannot completely free a respondent judge from liability.&nbsp; The Investigating Justice found that Judge Omelio conducted a summary hearing on 22 September 2010 and issued the writ of preliminary injunction on the same day, despite the absence of any testimonial or documentary evidence.&nbsp; For this reason, the Investigating Justice found Judge Omelio grossly ignorant of the law and recommended a fine of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00) as appropriate penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On the third issue of refusing to recognize Sps. Crisologo as indispensable parties, the Investigating Justice recommended admonishing Judge Omelio for failure to notify the Sps. Crisologo, as well as to order that they be impleaded.&nbsp; Judge Omelio argued that Sps. Crisologo should have filed the proper Motion to Intervene.&nbsp; He further claimed that the Sps. Crisologo failed to show they are the persons in control of the subject property or under the direct orders of defendants Register of Deeds and Sheriff Medialdea.&nbsp; However, the Investigating Justice, citing Gonzales v. Judge Bersamin,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> ruled that notice was required to be given to parties whose annotations appear on the back of the certificate of title in an action for cancellation of the annotations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the Investigating Justice recommended admonishing Judge Omelio for his failure to notify the Sps. Crisologo and to order that they be impleaded in the petition for cancellation of liens annotated on the certificate of title.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>In contrast to the three issues resolved by the Investigating Justice, Sps. Crisologo raised seven issues in their Affidavit-Complaint, Supplement to Affidavit-Complaint and Reply, and Memorandum enumerating the charges against Judge Omelio, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>1. Gross ignorance of the law and interference with the proceedings of a co-equal and coordinate court in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction which frustrates the execution of a final and executory decision;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>2.

Gross ignorance of the law, grave abuse of discretion, gross dereliction of duty and manifest bias for refusing to recognize Sps.

The court issuing the writ of execution may enforce its authority only over properties of the judgment debtor; thus, the sheriff acts properly only when he subjects to execution property undeniably belonging to the judgment debtor. If the sheriff levies upon the assets of a third person in which the judgment debtor has no interest, then he is acting beyond the limits of his authority and is amenable to control and correction by a court of competent jurisdiction in a separate and independent action. This is in consonance with the well-established principle that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger.

Crisologo because they are not parties to the complaint for indirect contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The subject complaint for indirect contempt, Civil Case No. 33,1104-2010, was filed on 14 October 2010 and entitled <i>JEWM Agro-Industrial Corporation v. Sheriff Robert Medialdea and Register of Deeds for the City of Davao</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; JEWM, as plaintiff in the indirect contempt complaint, prayed that: (a) Sheriff Medialdea be found guilty of indirect contempt and be penalized a fine not exceeding P30,000.00 and imprisoned for not more than six months, in accordance with Section 7, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court; and (b) the auction sale annotated on TCT Nos. T-325675 and T-325676, stating&nbsp; Sps. Crisologo are buyers, be declared illegal and the Register of Deeds of Davao City be directed to cancel such annotation of sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In his Decision dated 27 January 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Judge Omelio granted JEWM’s prayers. The dispositive portion of the decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, defendant Sheriff Robert Medialdea is hereby declared GUILTY of indirect contempt and is ordered to pay a fine of Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos.&nbsp; Similar offense in the future will be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>Corollary thereto, for being illegal, the auction sale on October 8, 2010 and the corresponding sheriff’s certificates of sale pertaining to the property of plaintiff covered by TCT No. T-325675 and TCT No. T-325676 are hereby declared null and void and without force and effect of the law.<br><br>The Register of Deeds for Davao City is hereby directed to cancel any registration or annotation of the subject Sheriff’s Certificates of Sale at the back of TCT No. T-325675 and TCT No. T-325676.</b><br><br>Let copy of this decision be furnished the Office of the Court Administrator for proper administrative action.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Judge Omelio’s decision in the indirect contempt complaint ordered the cancellation in TCT Nos. T-325675 and T-325676 of the annotation of the Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale in favor of the Sps. Crisologo.&nbsp; Although the case was an indirect contempt complaint, it can still be considered a petition to cancel annotations because of its prayer.&nbsp; As provided in Section 112 of Act No. 496 and <i>Southwestern University v. Laurente</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> notice is required to be given to parties whose annotations appear on the back of the certificate of&nbsp; title in an action for cancellation of annotations on the certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, however, no summons or notices were issued to Sps. Crisologo.&nbsp; Only the Register of Deeds and Sheriff Medialdea were impleaded.&nbsp; Judge Omelio should have notified the Sps. Crisologo of the indirect contempt complaint because it included the prayer for cancellation of the annotation of sale on the subject titles, where the latter are buyers.&nbsp; Failure to notify the Sps. Crisologo constitutes gross ignorance of the law.<br><br>This is not the first time Judge Omelio has rendered a decision affecting third parties’ interests, without even notifying the indispensable parties.&nbsp; In the first disputed case,&nbsp; <i>JEWM Agro-Industrial Corporation v. Register of Deeds, Sheriff Medialdea, John &amp; Jane Does and all persons acting under their directions,</i> Judge Omelio failed to cause the service of proper summons upon the John and Jane Does impleaded in the complaint.&nbsp; Even when Sps. Crisologo voluntarily appeared in court to be recognized as the John and Jane Does, Judge Omelio refused to acknowledge their appearance and ordered the striking out of Sps. Crisologo’s pleadings.&nbsp; For this&nbsp; reason, the Investigating Justice recommended admonishing Judge Omelio for failing to recognize the Sps. Crisologo as indispensable parties in that case.&nbsp; Here, in the indirect contempt complaint entitled <i>JEWM Agro-Industrial Corporation v. Sheriff Robert Medialdea and Register of Deeds for the City of Davao</i>, which included a prayer for cancellation of annotations on the titles, Judge Omelio once again failed to notify the Sps. Crisologo, the lienholders who would be affected by the cancellation of the annotation.&nbsp; Worse, Judge Omelio granted the prayer for cancellation of the annotations of Sps. Crisologo’s Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale without notifying them of the complaint.&nbsp; Clearly, the cancellation of the annotation of the sale without notifying the buyers, Sps. Crisologo, is a violation of the latter’s right to due process.&nbsp; Since this is the second time that Judge Omelio has issued an order which fails to notify or summon the indispensable parties, we find Judge Omelio guilty of gross ignorance of the law, with a warning that repetition of the same or similar act will merit a stiffer penalty in the future.<br><br><center><b><u>Manifest bias in issuing conflicting orders&nbsp; </u></b></center><br>Sps. Crisologo claim that Judge Omelio exhibited manifest bias when he issued two conflicting orders on the same day, with one already showing prejudgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; In Judge Omelio’s Order dated 7 October 2010, he declared:<br><br><blockquote>The Omnibus Motion dated October 1, 2010 filed by Rene Andrei Q. Saguisag, which is submitted without argument, counsel for the plaintiff is directed to file a comment within five (5) days x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In another Order likewise dated on 7 October 2010, Judge Omelio held:<br><br><blockquote>Atty. R.A.Q. Saguisag, Jr., without first filing a written formal notice of appearance pursuant to the Rules of Court, hence he lacks locus standi in court to participate in the proceeding of the case x x x his very urgent omnibus motion dated October 1, 2010 therefore is denied x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br>Sps. Crisologo allege that Judge Omelio exhibited manifest bias in issuing the conflicting orders, but failed to indicate which provision in the Rules of Court or the Code of Judicial Conduct Juge Omelio violated when he issued these orders.&nbsp; For this reason, we dismiss this charge for lack of merit.<br><br><center><b><u>Application of Penalties</u></b></center><br>In this case, Judge Omelio is found guilty of four counts of gross ignorance of the law for the following acts: (a) refusal to recognize Sps. Crisologo as indispensable parties; (b) granting a contentious motion in violation of the three-day notice rule; (c) non-compliance with the rules on summons; and (d) cancelling the annotation of the Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale on the titles without notifying the buyers, in violation of the latter’s right to due process.<br><br>Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court considers gross ignorance of the law or procedure as a serious charge.&nbsp; Section 11 of Rule 140, on the other hand, provides for the sanctions on respondents guilty of serious charges:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <i>Sanctions</i>. - A.&nbsp; If the respondent is guilty of a serious charge, any of the following sanctions may be imposed:<br><br>1. Dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations. <i>Provided, however,</i> That the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits;<br><br>2. Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three (3) months, but not exceeding six (6) months; or<br><br>3. A fine of more than P20,000 but not exceeding P40,000.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Section 55 of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Revised Uniform Rules) provides that if the respondent is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge or count and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; Section 54(c) of the same Revised Uniform Rules states that the maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present.<br><br>The Court, in a number of cases, has adopted the Revised Uniform Rules in the discipline of erring court officers and judges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Garcia v. Alejo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the Court found Alejo guilty of two offenses:&nbsp; (a) dereliction of duty; and (b) violation of reasonable office rules and regulations.&nbsp; The penalty imposed upon Alejo was the penalty for the more serious charge, dereliction of duty, taking into consideration the fact that he had previously been admonished in an earlier case.<br><br>In this case, Judge Omelio is found guilty of four counts of the serious charge of gross ignorance of the law, with no mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; Based on the rules on penalties in administrative cases, the sanction to be imposed is the penalty for the serious charge of gross ignorance of the law in its maximum, due to the presence of aggravating circumstances.<br><br>In its Resolution dated 28 July 2008, the Court, in A.M. No. MTJ-08-1701,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> imposed a fine of Ten Thousand Pesos (?10,000.00) on Judge Omelio for violation of a Supreme Court Circular with a stern warning that repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.&nbsp; Because of this previous violation, we impose the penalty of fine of Forty Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00) on Judge Omelio for four counts of gross ignorance of the law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DISMISS</b> the following charges against Judge George&nbsp; E. Omelio for lack of merit: (a) gross ignorance of the law for interfering with the proceedings of a co-equal and coordinate court; (b) gross ignorance of the law for issuing a writ of preliminary injunction without an evidentiary hearing; and (c) manifest bias for issuing conflicting orders.&nbsp; We find Judge George E. Omelio <b>GUILTY </b>of four counts of the serious charge of gross ignorance of the law for the following acts: (a) refusing to recognize Spouses Jesus G. Crisologo and Nannette B. Crisologo as indispensable parties; (b) granting a contentious motion in violation of the three-day notice rule; (c) non-compliance with the rules on summons; and (d) rendering a decision in an indirect contempt case that cancels an annotation of a Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale on two titles without notifying the buyer, in violation of the latter’s right to due process.&nbsp; Accordingly, we impose upon Judge George E. Omelio the penalty of fine of Forty Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00), with a warning that repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">*</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Brion, Perez, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1308 dated 21 September 2012.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 226.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 391, 411.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 193.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 194.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Report, pp. 2-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 28-29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 19-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 22-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 325 Phil. 120 (1996).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Report, pp. 25-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> p. 1.<br>&nbsp;<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 226, 411.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 411.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 400 Phil. 829 (2000).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Id. at 66-67.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Supra note 19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Report, pp. 22-23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> A.M.
