CV No. 70530.<br><br><i><b>Factual Antecedents</b></i><br><br>On June 27, 1990, at about 11:15 p.m., three vehicles were traversing the two-lane northbound NLEX in the vicinity of <i>Barangay</i> Tibag, Pulilan, Bulacan.&nbsp; It was raining that night.<br><br>Anacleto Edurese, Jr. (Edurese) was driving a Pathfinder with plate number BBG-334.&nbsp; His Isabela-bound passengers were the owners of said vehicle, spouses Roberto and Josephine Mangalinao (Mangalinao spouses), their daughter Marriane, housemaid Rufina Andres and helper Armando Jebueza (Jebueza).&nbsp; Before them on the outer lane was a Pampanga-bound Fuso 10-wheeler truck (Fuso), with plate number PAE-160, driven by Loreto Lucilo (Loreto), who was with truck helper Charlie Palomar (Charlie).&nbsp; The Fuso was then already moving in an erratic and swerving motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Following behind the Pathfinder was another 10-wheeler truck, an Isuzu Cargo (Isuzu) with plate number PNS-768 driven by Antonio, who was then with helper Rodolfo Navia (Rodolfo).<br><br>Just when the Pathfinder was already cruising along the NLEX’s fast lane and about to overtake the Fuso, the latter suddenly swerved to the left and cut into the Pathfinder’s lane thereby blocking its way. As a result, the Pathfinder hit the Fuso’s left door and left body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The impact caused both vehicles to stop in the middle of the expressway.&nbsp; Almost instantly, the inevitable pileup happened. Although Antonio stepped on the brakes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Isuzu’s front crashed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> into the rear of the Pathfinder leaving it a total wreck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Soon after, the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) patrol arrived at the scene of the accident and informed the Pulilan police about the vehicular mishap.&nbsp; Police Investigator SPO2 Emmanuel Banag responded at about 2:15-2:30 a.m. of June 28, 1990 and investigated the incident as gathered from the information and sketch<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> provided by the PNCC patrol as well as from the statements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> provided by the truck helpers Charlie and Rodolfo.<br><br>In the meantime, the Mangalinao spouses, the driver Edurese, and the helper Jebueza were declared dead on the spot while 6-month old Marriane and the housemaid were declared dead on arrival at a nearby hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The occupants of the trucks escaped serious injuries and death.<br><br>As their letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to the registered owners of the trucks demanding compensation for the accident were ignored, the minor children of the Mangalinao spouses, Dennis, Mylene, Melanie and Marikris, through their legal guardian,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> consequently filed on January 16, 1991 a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for damages based on <i>quasi-delict,</i> before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati which was docketed as Civil Case No. 91-123.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They impleaded the drivers Loreto and Antonio, as well as the registered owners of the Fuso and the Isuzu trucks, namely Orix and Sonny,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> respectively.&nbsp; The children imputed recklessness, negligence, and imprudence on the truck drivers for the deaths of their sister and parents; while they hold Sonny and Orix equally liable for failing to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of their respective drivers.&nbsp; The children demanded payment of more than P10.5 million representing damages and attorney’s fees.<br><br>Orix in its Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> interposed that it is not the actual owner of the Fuso truck.&nbsp; As the trial court denied the motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> it then filed its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim and Cross-claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Orix reiterated that the children had no cause of action against it because on September 9, 1983, it already sold the Fuso truck to MMO Trucking owned by Manuel Ong (Manuel).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The latter being the alleged owner at the time of the collision, Orix filed a Third Party Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> against Manuel, a.k.a. Manuel Tan.<br><br>In their Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim and Cross-Claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Sonny and Antonio attributed fault for the accident solely on Loreto’s reckless driving of his truck which suddenly stopped and slid across the highway.&nbsp; They claimed that Sonny had exercised the expected diligence required of an employer; that Antonio had been all along driving with care; and, that with the abrupt and unexpected collision of the vehicles before him and their precarious proximity, he had no way of preventing his truck from hitting the Pathfinder.<br><br>For failing to file any responsive pleading, both Manuel and Loreto were declared in default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><i><b>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</b></i><br><br>After trial, the court <i>a quo </i>issued a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> on February 9, 2001 finding Sonny, Antonio, Loreto and Orix liable for damages.&nbsp; It likewise ruled in favor of Orix anent its third party complaint, the latter having sufficiently proven that Manuel of MMO Trucking is the real owner of the Fuso.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision states:<br><br><blockquote>Wherefore, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiffs and against the defendants, ordering the latter to pay plaintiffs, jointly and severally, the following:<br><br> (a) P3,077,000.00 as actual damages; <br>(b) P2,000,000.00 as moral damages; <br>(c) P1,000,000.00 as exemplary damages; and <br>(d) P400,000.00 as and for reasonable attorney’s fees <br>(e) legal interest at six percent (6%) per annum on the above-stated amounts from the filing of the complaint on January 16, 1991 until fully paid; and<br> (f)costs of suit and expenses of litigation. <br>Third party defendant Manuel M. Ong is ordered to indemnify third party plaintiff [Orix] for the amounts adjudged against the latter in this case.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Ratiocinating its finding of recklessness on both truck drivers, the RTC said:<br><br><blockquote>The evidence leaves no doubt that both truck drivers were at fault and should be held liable. Lucilo, who was driving the Fuso truck, was reckless when he caused the swerving of his vehicle directly on the lane of the Pathfinder to his left. The Pathfinder had no way to avoid a collision because it was about to pass the truck when suddenly blocked. On the other hand, the Isuzu truck was practically tailgating the Pathfinder on the dark slippery highway such that when the Pathfinder collided with the Fuso truck, it became inevitable for the Isuzu truck to crash into the Pathfinder.&nbsp; So, de los Santos, the driver of the Isuzu truck was likewise reckless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>In an attempt to exonerate itself, Orix appealed to the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> followed by Sonny and Antonio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> All of them challenged the factual findings and conclusions of the court <i>a quo</i> with regard to their respective liabilities, each pinpointing to the negligence of the other and vice versa.&nbsp; All of them likewise assailed the amounts the RTC awarded to the minors for lack of basis.<br><br><i><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></i><br><br>On October 27, 2005, the CA rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> affirming the factual findings of the trial court of reckless driving.&nbsp; It said:<br><br><blockquote>It may be true that it was the Nissan Pathfinder which first hit and bumped and eventually crashed into the Fuso truck.&nbsp; However, this would not have happened if the truck did not swerve into the lane of the Nissan Pathfinder.&nbsp; As afore-mentioned [sic], the latter had no way then to avoid a collision because it was about to overtake the former.<br><br>As a motorist, Lucilo [Loreto] should have operated his truck with reasonable caution considering the width, traffic, grades, crossing, curvatures, visibility and other conditions of the highway and the conditions of the atmosphere and weather.&nbsp; He should have carefully and cautiously driven his vehicle so as not to have endangered the property or the safety or rights of other persons.&nbsp; By failing to drive with reasonable caution, Lucilo is, hence, liable for the resultant vehicle collision.<br><br>Neither do [we] find credence in delos Santos’ claim that he is without liability for the vehicular collision.&nbsp; We cannot overemphasize the primacy in probative value of physical evidence, that mute but eloquent manifestation of the truth.&nbsp; An examination of the destroyed front part of the Isuzu truck, as shown by photographic evidence, clearly indicates strong bumping of the rear of the Pathfinder.&nbsp; The photographs belie delos Santos’ claim that he was driving at a safe speed and even slowed down when he noticed the [erratic] traveling of the Fuso truck.&nbsp; In fact, by his own admission, it was a matter of seconds before his Isuzu truck hit the Nissan Pathfinder - a clear indication that he did not actually [slow] down considering the weather and road condition at that time.&nbsp; Had he been actually prudent in driving, the impact on the Nissan Pathfinder would not have been that great or he might have even taken evasive action to avoid hitting it.&nbsp; Sadly, that was not the case as shown by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA also ruled that Orix, as the registered owner of the Fuso, is considered in the eyes of the law and of third persons responsible for the deaths of the passengers of the Pathfinder, regardless of the lack of an employer-employee relationship between it and the driver Loreto.<br><br>The CA modified the award of damages as follows:<br><br><blockquote> (a) P150,000.00 as indemnity for the death of Spouses Roberto and Josephine Mangalinao and their daughter Marianne Mangalinao;&nbsp; <br>(b) P2,000,000.00 for loss of earning capacity;&nbsp; <br>(c) P64,200.00 for funeral expenses;&nbsp; <br>(d) P1,000,000.00 as moral damages;&nbsp; <br>(e) P1,000,000.00 as exemplary damages;&nbsp; <br>(f) P400,000.00 as attorney’s fees.<br><br>If the amounts adjudged remain unpaid upon the finality of this decision, the interest rate shall be twelve percent (12%) per annum computed from the time the judgment bec[a]me final and executory until fully satisfied.<br><br>The six percent (6%) interest per annum from the filing of the complaint indicated in the assailed decision is DELETED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Orix and Sonny joined by Antonio, filed their separate Motions for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> but same were denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated August 17, 2006.<br><br>Hence, these consolidated petitions.<br><br><i><b>Petitioners’ Respective Arguments </b></i><br><br>Orix’s contentions in its petition may be summarized as follows:<br><br> (a) It is not the owner and operator of the Fuso at the time of the collision and should not be held responsible for compensating the minor children of the Mangalinaos;<br><br>(b) The Fuso’s swerving towards the inner lane where the Pathfinder is cruising is attributable not to the alleged negligence of Loreto but to adverse driving conditions, <i>i.e.,</i> the stormy weather and slippery road;<br><br>(c) The CA has no reliable evidentiary basis for computing loss of earning capacity as the Balance Sheet and Income Statement of Roberto Mangalinao, as certified by accountant Wilfredo de Jesus for the year 1989, is hearsay evidence; and<br><br>(e) The award of attorney’s fees sustained by the CA is not justified and is exorbitant. <br><br>On the other hand, Sonny and Antonio argue in their petition that:<br><br> (a) the CA erred in affirming the trial court’s erroneous finding that the Isuzu was tailgating, which is contradicted by the material evidence on record;<br>(b) the proximate cause of the death of the victims is Loreto’s gross negligence.&nbsp; Antonio should have been accorded the benefit of the ‘emergency rule’ wherein he was immediately confronted with a sudden danger and had no time to think of how to avoid it;<br>(c) the CA should not have awarded damages and attorney’s fees because of the total absence of evidence to substantiate them.<br><br>In short, petitioners want us to review the finding of negligence by the CA of both truck drivers, the solidary liability of Orix as the registered owner of the Fuso, and the propriety of the damages the CA awarded in favor of the Mangalinao children.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><i>The finding of negligence of petitioners as<br> found by the lower courts is binding </i><br><br>Negligence and proximate cause are factual issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Settled is the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts, and the concurrence of the findings of fact of the courts below are conclusive.&nbsp; “A petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should include only questions of law - questions of fact are not reviewable”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> save for several exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> two of which petitioners invoke, <i>i.e</i>., that ‘the finding is grounded on speculations, surmises, and conjectures,’ and that ‘the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.’<br><br>There is no compelling reason to disturb the lower courts’ factual conclusions.<br><br>With regard to the Fuso, we note the statement given by the helper Charlie before the Pulilan police immediately after the incident:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">T:</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Pakisalaysay mo nga ang mga pangyayari?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">S: </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Nuon nga pong oras at petsang nabanggit habang ako ay sakay ng isang truck patungo Pampanga at sa lugar ng pinangyarihan ay namireno ang aking driver dahil sa madulas at nagawi kami sa gawing kaliwa (inner lane) na isang mabilis na pajero (Nissan 4x4) ang bumangga sa gawing unahan hanggang sa tagiliran gawing kaliwa, na ang nasabing pajero ay papalusot (overtake) na pagkatapos nuon ay may isa (1) pang truck na bumangga sa hulihan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></blockquote><br>Based on the helper’s statement, the Fuso had lost control, skidded to the left and blocked the way of the Pathfinder, which was about to overtake.&nbsp; The Pathfinder had absolutely no chance to avoid the truck.&nbsp; Instead of slowing down and moving towards the shoulder in the highway if it really needed to stop, it was very negligent of Loreto to abruptly hit the brake in a major highway wherein vehicles are highly likely to be at his rear.&nbsp; He opened himself up to a major danger and naturally, a collision was imminent.<br><br>On the other hand, the parties for the Isuzu contend that the CA erred in ruling that the truck was moving at a fast speed and was tailgating.&nbsp; They assert that they be absolved because the fault lay entirely on the Fuso, which had been zigzagging along the highway. They aver that when the Fuso and the Pathfinder collided in the middle of the highway with the Fuso blocking both lanes of the northbound stretch, there was no room left for driver Antonio to maneuver to avoid them, and that the Pathfinder was hit as a natural consequence.<br><br>The Isuzu’s driver, Antonio, claims that he and the two vehicles before him were travelling at the right lane of the highway, and on his part, he was travelling at a speed of 50-60 kph and that he was three cars away from the Pathfinder.&nbsp; When the Pathfinder hit the left side of the Fuso, he stepped on the brake but still struck the Pathfinder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He further narrated:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ATTY.
