Ricardo Layug, Jr. (P/Insp. Layug) and the members of SAID-SOTU that a certain “Meriam” was conducting illegal shabu activities along Isla Puting Bato, Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; P/Insp. Layug instructed Senior Police Officer (SPO) 3 Rolando del Rosario (SPO3 Del Rosario) to verify the information and, if possible, carry out a buy-bust operation.&nbsp; At around 6:30 p.m. that day, PO1 Juaño, SPO3 Del Rosario, and the confidential informant proceeded to an alley in Isla Puting Bato identified by the informant to conduct the surveillance, but the subject could not be located.&nbsp; They returned to the station where P/Insp. Layug instructed them to return to the place the following day to continue the operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The confidential informant returned to the station at around 12:00 noon the following day, September 24, 2004.&nbsp; SPO3 Del Rosario conducted a briefing to plan their operation against the subject.&nbsp; PO1 Juaño was designated as <i>poseur-buyer</i>, while PO1 Earlkeats Bajarias (PO1 Bajarias) and SPO3 Del Rosario were designated as perimeter backups.&nbsp; SPO3 Del Rosario handed PO1 Juaño a 100-peso bill marked “RR,” the initials of Del Rosario.&nbsp; PO1 Arnel Tubbali (PO1 Tubbali) prepared a Coordination and Pre-Operation Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which was received by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) on the same day. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The buy-bust team and the confidential informant arrived at Isla Puting Bato at around 4:00 p.m.&nbsp; They found accused-appellant seated in an alley in front of her house.&nbsp; They approached accused-appellant, who recognized the confidential informant, and asked, “<i>Kukuha ka ba?&nbsp; Magkano?</i>”&nbsp; The informant replied, “<i>Siya daw kukuha</i>,” pointing to PO1 Juaño.&nbsp; PO1 Juaño confirmed, “<i>Piso lang</i>” (P100.00), and showed accused-appellant the money.&nbsp; Accused-appellant took a small plastic sachet from her pants’ back pocket and handed it to PO1 Juaño.&nbsp; PO1 Juaño introduced himself as a police officer.&nbsp; Accused-appellant was surprised.&nbsp; PO1 Juaño arrested accused-appellant, while SPO3 Del Rosario and PO1 Bajarias rushed to the scene for assistance.&nbsp; The marked P100-bill was recovered from accused-appellant.&nbsp; Accused-appellant was asked to empty her pocket.&nbsp; Another small transparent plastic sachet was recovered from accused-appellant. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The team conveyed accused-appellant to the station, where the items recovered were marked by the investigator in front of PO1 Juaño.&nbsp;

He clarified that the Coordination and Pre-Operation Report prepared by PO1 Tubbali was faxed to PDEA, which in turn returned it with a certification giving them authority for the operation.&nbsp; When confronted by the fact that the name of accused-appellant was not mentioned in the Coordination and Pre-Operation Report, PO1 Juaño testified that it was not the policy of the PDEA in 2005 to state the name of the subject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>PO1 Bajarias corroborated PO1 Juaño’s testimony that they, together with SPO3 Del Rosario and the confidential informant, were at Isla Puting Bato, Tondo, Manila on September 24, 2004, at around 4:00 p.m.&nbsp; PO1 Bajarias was around 10 meters away from PO1 Juaño during the operation for 10 to 15 minutes.&nbsp; At this time, PO1 Juaño and the confidential informant talked to a woman, who was later identified as accused-appellant.&nbsp; PO1 Juaño handed the buy-bust money to accused-appellant, while the latter handed to the former a transparent plastic sachet.&nbsp; PO1 Bajarias saw PO1 Juaño introducing himself as a police officer, arresting the accused-appellant and informing her of her constitutional rights.&nbsp; Throughout the operation, PO1 Bajarias guarded the place to ensure their safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, PO1 Bajarias disclosed that he saw what PO1 Juaño, the accused-appellant, and the informant were doing, but could not hear what they were saying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; However, during the time PO1 Juaño was informing accused-appellant of her constitutional rights, PO1 Bajarias was already within four meters from the suspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The defense presented the testimony of accused-appellant herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accused-appellant&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; at&nbsp; home on September 24, 2004.&nbsp; She was praying at around 3:00 p.m. that day, when a group of men arrived.&nbsp; Two of them simply entered her house, which was left open, while four were left outside.&nbsp; They waited for her to finish her prayers, before asking her to go with them.&nbsp; She was told that she should explain herself at the precinct.&nbsp; She cried since she does not know why she was arrested and she believed that she did not violate any law.&nbsp; She was brought to the police station, detained, and was asked what she was selling.&nbsp; She told them that she was not selling anything.&nbsp; She was in Manila to apply for a job abroad.&nbsp; She denied the charges filed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Bhoy Tagadaya, who was fetching his brother-in-law in the vicinity where accused-appellant was arrested, testified that at around 3:00 p.m. on September 24, 2004, he saw six men in civilian clothes alight from a Ford Fiera.&nbsp; Two men went inside the house in front of that of his brother-in-law.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later, the two men came out of the house with the accused-appellant, who was crying and shouting, and left.&nbsp; Someone had asked his brother-in-law about the incident.&nbsp; Tagadaya’s brother-in-law told that person that it was Tagadaya who saw the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On April 12, 2008, the RTC rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which is as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered as follows, to wit:<br><ol><li> In Criminal Case No. 04-230545, finding accused, Meriam Guru y Kazan, <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, she is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay the fine of P500,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. 04-230546, finding accused, Meriam Guru y Kazan, <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, she is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of 12 years and 1 day as minimum to 17 years and 4 months as maximum;

On the other hand, accused-appellant failed to show any ill motive on the part of the police officers to testify against her.&nbsp; As regards the testimony of Tagadaya, the court held that there was no showing that he witnessed the incident leading to accused-appellant’s arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On August 12, 2009, the Court of Appeals rendered its Decision in accused-appellant’s appeal, affirming the RTC Decision <i>in toto</i>.&nbsp; According to the Court of Appeals, the alleged failure of the police officers to indicate the name of the accused-appellant in the pre-operation report did not affect the legality of the buy-bust operation, and was adequately explained by PO1 Juaño, who had testified that it was not yet the policy of the PDEA in 2005 to indicate the name of the subject of the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Neither is the examination of marked money for fingerprints required.&nbsp; It is sufficient that the marked money was received by the accused during the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; As regards the allegation of accused-appellant that the prosecution failed to comply with the procedure for the proper custody and disposition of the confiscated drugs, the Court of Appeals held that the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165 explicitly provides that noncompliance with the prescribed procedure can be excused if there are justifiable grounds therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals emphasized that, contrary to established jurisprudence, accused-appellant was not shown to have questioned the custody of the confiscated drugs or raised the issue of disposition and preservation of said drugs before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On appeal before this Court, accused-appellant manifested that she is adopting the Appellant’s Brief submitted to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp;

People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> we discussed how the chain of custody of seized items should be established:<br><br><blockquote>As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness’ possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<br><br>While testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard because it is almost always impossible to obtain, an unbroken chain of custody becomes indispensable and essential when the item of real evidence is not distinctive and is not readily identifiable, or when its condition at the time of testing or trial is critical, or when a witness has failed to observe its uniqueness. The same standard likewise obtains in case the evidence is susceptible to alteration, tampering, contamination and even substitution and exchange. In other words, the exhibit’s level of susceptibility to fungibility, alteration or tampering — without regard to whether the same is advertent or otherwise not — dictates the level of strictness in the application of the chain of custody rule.
