Abaño (petitioners) the total sum of P13,903,722.94.<br><br><center><b><i>The Antecedent Facts&nbsp; </i></b></center><br>In early 2003, respondent, an educational institution created and existing under Philippine laws, decided to build a central library building on its campus which would likewise house the classrooms and laboratory facilities of its Nursing program.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Petitioners were commissioned to undertake the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The corresponding Contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (the Contract) was executed on 17 November 2003 for a total project cost of P52,319,927.20.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In connection with this, petitioners gave respondent a Technical Specifications Book<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which formed part of the Contract and which detailed how petitioners would implement the construction project. The parties agreed on a project duration of fourteen (14) months effective upon the signing of the Contract and the issuance of the necessary building permit. The requisite building permit was issued on 27 January 2004;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> hence, petitioners had until 27 March 2005 to complete the project.<br><br>On 16 February 2004, petitioners reminded respondent of the down payment consisting of 25% of the contract price, or a sum equivalent to P13,079,981.80. By this date, respondent had already paid a total of P6,000,000.00 starting 5 December 2003. The full amount of the down payment was settled on 27 February 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 16 April 2004, upon petitioners’ request and representation that they needed urgent substantial funding, respondent paid P10 million although no progress report had been submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioners again requested payment on 12 July 2004 in the amount of P14,325,196.07 for work accomplishment equivalent to 27.38%. This time respondent required a progress report to substantiate the request for payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Accordingly, on 2 August 2004, petitioners submitted their First Progress Billing Report covering the period 1 December 2003 to 30 June 2004. Respondent paid the billed amount in installments beginning 28 July 2004 until 26 October 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In their First Progress Billing Report, petitioners indicated “28 February 2005” as the completion date of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As a result, respondent sent a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to petitioners, dated 21 January 2005, requesting documents necessary for the procurement of a Certificate of Occupancy. Instead of delivering the requested documents, petitioners submitted its Second Progress Billing Report on 8 February 2005, demanding payment of P9,586,057.06 and indicating a new move-out date:<br><br>April 2005 – a date fixed without prior consultation with and approval from respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, in a meeting held on 28 February 2005, petitioners undertook to turn over on 15 March 2005 the first two floors of the building and to make a partial turn over on 15 April 2005 of the third floor. For its part, respondent committed to pay P4,994,927.20 out of the P14,994,927.20 balance from the contract price. While respondent complied with its undertaking, petitioners failed to make even one partial turn over. Thus, 14 months after the construction permits were secured, or by 27 March 2005, the building had not been completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 30 April 2005, petitioners submitted to respondent its Final Billing: (1) indicating a 100% completion of the project; (2) informing respondent that its unpaid balance was P10 million; and (3) requesting a final inspection of the building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The joint inspection was carried out on 16 and 17 May 2005. During the two-day inspection, serious problems regarding workmanship and the materials used were discovered and documented by respondents. The parties agreed that all the necessary corrective and completion works on the project would be done in accordance with the inspection results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Petitioners resumed repair, rehabilitation and cleaning works on the building on 13 June 2005 only. At the same time, petitioners wrote respondent two letters: first, expressing readiness to comply with their undertaking to accomplish the incomplete works, but denying that they conformed to the punch list resulting from the joint inspection and second, demanding arbitration for respondent’s unpaid amounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Respondent replied through counsel, asserting that petitioners cannot deny having expressed conformity to the punch list report after accepting the obligation to correct and complete the project based on the same report. Respondent also rejected the demand for arbitration for being premature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On 8 July 2005, petitioners’ counsel wrote respondent to convey that petitioners had fully accomplished the project under the Contract, including the agreements reached on 6 June 2005, and requested a joint inspection anew. The second joint inspection was conducted on 25 July 2005. The following day, 26 July 2005, respondent wrote petitioners a letter detailing the various defects and deficiencies in the building that need to be corrected and completed before respondent finally accepts the project and pay the final billing. The defects highlighted were: (1) the brand of electrical wirings used were not “Phelps Dodge” or its accepted equivalent, as specified in the Contract; (2) absence of any waterproofing in the gutters; (3) uneven floor patterns; and (4) absence of a number of electrical materials required to be installed. Respondent reiterated its demand for corrective and other rehabilitative works on the project in a letter dated 12 August 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In another meeting held on 26 August 2005, petitioners demanded full payment of its billings. No payment from respondent apparently forthcoming, petitioners, on 26 September 2005, gave respondent a second notice and demand for arbitration to press settlement of their unpaid claims. Petitioners named their arbitrator and gave respondent fifteen days within which to respond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated 10 October 2005, counsel for respondent denied the request for arbitration and insisted that petitioners enter the construction site within seven days from notice to complete and correct all the unfinished and defective works consistent with respondent’s letter of 26 July 2005. Respondent warned petitioners that should they ignore the matter, they would be considered to have abandoned the project, giving respondent the right to take full possession of the building and allow other contractors to complete the unfinished works, with a right to collect the costs of completion from petitioners.<br><br>Petitioners did not respond to respondent’s ultimatum within the given period; neither did they undertake remedial measures to correct and finish the deficiencies in the project. With no word either from petitioners or their counsel, respondent was compelled to take-over the building on 19 October 2005 in the presence of <i>barangay</i> and police officials from Calamba City. Upon take-over of the building, respondent re-confirmed and re-documented the various defects and deficiencies earlier noted and determined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In order to ascertain the extent of petitioners’ accomplishment on the project and its corresponding value, respondent engaged the services of Davis Langdon and Seah Philippines, Inc. (DLSPI), a specialized quantity surveyor firm. Contrary to petitioners’ claim of 100% project completion, the cost analysis and evaluation performed by DLSPI revealed that the building was only 94.12% complete and that the actual cost of work performed was worth only P49,244,814.09. Aggrieved, respondent filed an arbitration complaint before the CIAC pursuant to the arbitration clause contained in the Technical Specifications Book.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Respondent claimed that it is entitled to payment in the total amount of P18,923,519.54 representing expenses incurred in the construction of temporary facilities, hiring of consultants for the detailed inspection of the building, damages, attorney’s fees and arbitration expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Decision of the CIAC</i></b><br></center><br>After hearing, the CIAC issued a Final Award in favor of petitioners, ordering respondent to pay the following amounts:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="65%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Unpaid balance of Progress Billing No. 2 dated 10 February 2005 </div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="RIGHT">P4,581,129.86</div></td> <td width="15%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Final Billing</div></td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">5,418,870.14</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Monthly surcharge of 2% on unpaid claims</div></td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">799,999.99</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Moral damages </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">1,500,000.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Exemplary damages </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">500,000.00 </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Attorney’s fees and litigation expenses</div></td> <td> <div align="RIGHT">800,000.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Arbitration cost </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">303,722.94</span> </div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;">TOTAL: </td> <td><div align="RIGHT">P13,903,722.94<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>The award of the CIAC is basically anchored on the fact that respondent did not pay the down payment and progress billings within the time and manner provided for in the Contract and Technical Specifications.<br><br>According to the CIAC, respondent’s legal basis for its claims was petitioners’ failure to deliver on schedule a complete building pursuant to their Contract. The CIAC noted, however, that respondent did not pay the 25% down payment and progress billings in accordance with the Contract and Technical Specifications. Under the Contract, the down payment should be paid within seven (7) days from the signing of the Contract, or on 24 November 2003, since the Contract was signed on 17 November 2003. However, respondent paid the full amount of the down payment only on 27 February 2004 or three (3) months after the Contract was signed and on a staggered basis starting 9 December 2003. Also, by 12 July 2004, petitioners had accomplished works on the project equivalent to P14,325,196.07 but respondent paid the amount over a period of more than three (3) months starting 28 July 2004 up to 26 October 2004. Then, on 8 February 2005, petitioners submitted their second progress billing for the sum of P9,586,057.06 but respondent paid only P4,994,927.20, likewise on a staggered basis from March to April 2005. Under the Technical Specifications Book, approved requests for payment should be paid within five (5) days from date of approval of the request or the issuance of a certificate of payment by the Architect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Considering that respondent did not pay the down payment and progress billings on time, the CIAC declared that it cannot demand that petitioners deliver on time a 100% completed building. The CIAC held that the Contract between petitioners and respondent created reciprocal obligations between them so that respondent, who did not comply faithfully with its terms, cannot demand performance by petitioners of their obligations thereunder, nor recover damages by reason of its own breach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The CIAC justified its grant of the amounts claimed by petitioners in the following manner:<br><br>1. Petitioners are entitled to their claim for the unpaid balance of Progress Billing No. 2 because respondent refused to pay the amount, not because there was no accomplishment, but because it allegedly represented only 18.32% performance over a 6-month period compared to an 80% accomplishment earlier over the same period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <br><br>2. Petitioners should be paid their Final Billing covering accomplished works from 9 February to 30 April 2005 because the works performed resulted in the completion of the project as evidenced by the fact that respondent took over the building and had it blessed in the presence of officials from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and other guests and since then respondent has been using it for its purpose as a college of nursing and central library. The CIAC considered as “wrong” the Cost Evaluation Report of DLSPI engineer Mary Joyce C. Areola (Engr. Areola) stating that the percentage of completion of the building was only 94.12% because she did not consider the revised plans, Bill of Quantities (BOQ) and detailed cost estimates. The CIAC believed that the opinion of petitioners’ expert witness, Engr. Eustaquio T. Coronel (Engr. Coronel), that completion was 100% based on the joint inspection, review of construction plan, as-built plan, BOQ, and comparative table of costs, had more weight. The ocular inspection conducted by the Arbitration Tribunal on 12 February 2007 also gave it strong basis to support the conclusion that completion was 100% as the items inspected were observed to be punch list in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <br><br>3. Considering respondent’s failure to pay the amounts demanded by petitioners, the latter are entitled to their claim for a monthly surcharge of 2% on the total of their claims from the time they were due until fully paid. The CIAC held that the reckoning date of the 2% surcharge on the unpaid Second and Final Billings totaling P9,999,999.99 is 30 April 2006, the date of expiration of the one (1) year retention period. Thus: from 30 April 2006 to 17 August 2006 (date of filing of the arbitration case), there are four (4) months. Hence, the total amount of the surcharge is P799,999.99 (P9,999,999.99 x 4 months = P39,999,999.96 x 2%).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>4. Petitioners are entitled to moral damages for respondent’s gross violation of their contract amounting to bad faith or malicious breach thereof. Respondent did not only fail to pay the down payment within seven (7) days from the signing of the Contract, it also paid the amount on a staggered basis. When respondent paid the sum of P4,994,927.20 for the Second Progress Billing, the same was paid in installments but the remaining balance of P4,581,129.86 was not paid. Lastly, respondent refused to pay the final billing of P5,418,870.14 even if the building had been completed. These circumstances drained the petitioners financially and emotionally. They had to apply for additional loans to finish the project. Their reputation and credit standing were adversely affected. They could not participate in biddings for other projects because of their financial problems. Considering that petitioners are entitled to moral damages, the CIAC ruled that they are also entitled to recover exemplary damages by way of example or correction for the public good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>5. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorney’s fees inasmuch as they retained the services of counsel to protect their rights and interests under the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <br><br>6. Respondent should pay for the entire cost of arbitration having unnecessarily filed the Request for Arbitration. The CIAC administrative staff reported that respondent’s share in the cost of arbitration was 45.34%, or the amount of P251,935.57 whereas petitioners’ share was 54.66%, or the amount of P303,722.95. Hence, respondent should pay petitioners the sum of P303,722.95.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center style="font-style: italic;"><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals&nbsp; </b></center><br>On appeal by respondent, the CA completely reversed and set aside the ruling of the CIAC. The challenged Decision held:<br><br><blockquote>x x x CIAC opined that <b>“[respondent] cannot demand fulfillment of [petitioners’] obligation to deliver a 100% completed project on time because [respondent] failed to pay the 25% down payment and the progress billings as provided in the contract.”</b> CIAC construed the argued “25% down payment” as a suspensive condition to [petitioners’] obligation to deliver a 100% completed building.<br><br>When a contract is subject to a suspensive condition, its birth or efficacy can take place only if and when the event which constitutes the condition, happens or is fulfilled. If the suspensive condition does not take place, the parties would stand as if the conditional obligation had never existed. Pertinently, the parties’ x x x <b>Contract</b> provides:<br><br><blockquote>“1. That the CONTRACTOR <b>shall complete</b> the project for the period of fourteen (14) months effective upon signing of this contract and issuance of necessary permits.” x x x<br></blockquote><br>Concededly, the argued suspensive condition of prior payment of “25% down payment” <b>does not exist.</b> Neither does said paragraph mandate that completion of the project is dependent <b>on [respondent’s] payment of “progress billings</b>”. Clearly, the CIAC gravely erred when it read into the contract a suspensive condition that did not exist. x x x.<br><br>If the parties’ contract was subjected to any suspensive condition, the same was limited to: (1) the <b>parties’ signing of the contract;</b> and (2) the issuance of necessary permits, particularly, <b>the issuance of a building permit.</b> It is undisputed that the parties’ contract was signed on <b>“17 November 2003”</b>, and <b>“the building permit was secured on January 27, 2004”</b>. When, therefore, the CIAC conceded that:<br><blockquote><br>“Considering that <b>the building permit was secured on January 27, 2004, the project should be completed</b> on <b>March 27, 2005</b> and [petitioners] <b>admitted that the building was completed in April, 2005</b> x x x.”</blockquote><br>it became jurisdictionally obliged to <b>deny [petitioners’] claims</b> and instead, <b>grant [respondent] its claims</b> which, after all, were admittedly raised for determination by the CIAC. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphases in the original).</blockquote><br>Thus, the CA concluded, the CIAC had no basis in granting the monetary awards contained in its challenged decision. According to the CA, respondent and not petitioners deserved the awarded moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees, in addition to actual and liquidated damages. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Resolving now the question of how much each of the parties here owe each other, [petitioners] contends that the agreed project cost was <b>“P52,319,927.20.”</b> Since per “DLSPI’s report” the project was only “94.12% finished at the time [respondent] took over the project, [petitioners’] billable cost would therefore amount to only “P49,244,814.99.” And considering that the <b>total payments made by [respondent]</b> to [petitioners] amounted to <b>P42,319,927.20</b>, it then follows that [petitioners’] collectible amounts would only be <b>“P6,924,887.79.”</b> Deducting from it the <b>actual expenses</b> incurred by [respondent] in finishing the <b>work on overtime basis</b>, which as conceded by CIAC in its final award, amounted to <b>“P2,959,534.10”</b>, petitioners’ reconciled collectible would only amount to <b>“P3,965,353.69”</b>.<br><br>Applying [petitioners’] aforesaid collectible to what it owes respondent as liquidated damages in the sum of <b>P10,463,985.44</b>, [petitioners] would now owe [respondent] <b>P6,498,631.75”</b>. Adding thereto the moral damages of <b>P1,500,000.00</b>, exemplary damages of P500,000.00, and attorney’s fees of P800,000.00 which the <b>CIAC held to be due to the aggrieved party</b>, [petitioners are] consequently obligated to pay [respondent] <b>P9,298,631.75.</b><br><br>Finally, it being clear here that the <b>erring party</b> [are the petitioners] (and not [respondent]), it is duty bound to pay CIAC the <b>Arbitration cost of P303,722.95.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphases in the original).</blockquote><br>As a result of the foregoing disquisition of the CA, petitioners are now before us praying for, among others, the setting aside of the Decision of the CA and the reinstatement of the Final Award of the CIAC.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b><br></center><br>The issues for resolution in this case are:<br><br>1. Whether or not petitioners were able to complete the project on time; and <br><br>2. Whether or not petitioners were able to deliver a 100% complete building. <br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b></center><br>At the outset, it must be pointed out that the issues presented in this case are factual in nature and, therefore, generally not subject to review by this Court. As a rule, in the exercise of its power of review, the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the reexamination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during the trial of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Nevertheless, there are recognized exceptions to this rule, one of which is when the findings of fact of the lower court and the Court of Appeals are conflicting,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> as in the case at bar.<br><br>Here, a glaring contradiction exists between the factual findings of the CIAC and the CA. While the CIAC granted most of petitioners’ claims and none of respondent’s, the CA, on the other hand, completely reversed the award of the CIAC in favor of petitioners and granted respondent’s claims.<br><br>In view of the diametrically opposed findings and conclusions of the CIAC and the CA, a review of the respective factual determinations of the two tribunals is in order, if only to fully and finally settle the conflicting claims of the parties.<br><br>From the narrated facts of this case, it is apparent that both parties failed to strictly comply with the provisions of their contract. The CIAC and the CA affirm this in their respective decisions. Thus, respondent failed to pay the down payment on the contract on time; whereas petitioners, on the other hand, failed to deliver a completed building within the period stipulated in the contract, did not follow the procedure for requesting payments as specified in the Contract, and made changes in the execution of the terms of the Contract without respondent’s approval.<br><br><center><b><i>Respondent Letran’s Breach&nbsp; </i></b></center><br>Paragraph 6(a) of the Contract provides that “the OWNER [respondent] shall pay the CONTRACTOR [petitioners] x x x 25% down payment payable within seven days upon signing of this Contract.” This provision is clear and unqualified: thus, the full amount of P13,079,981.80, representing 25% of the contract price of P52,319,927.20, should have been paid by respondent not later than 24 November 2003, the seventh day after the signing of the Contract. Instead, respondent paid the down payment in installments beginning 9 December 2003, finally settling the amount in full on 27 February 2004 or three (3) months after the Contract was signed.<br><br>Respondent is, therefore, indisputably guilty of violating the terms of the Contract on the payment of the down payment.<br><br><center><b><i>Petitioner Contractor’s Breach</i></b></center><br><i>1. Failure to finish the project on time&nbsp; </i><br><br>Paragraph 1 of the Contract states that “the CONTRACTOR shall complete the project for the period of fourteen (14) months effective upon the signing of this contract and issuance of necessary permits.” The Contract was signed on 17 November 2003 and the corresponding building permit was issued on 27 January 2004. Hence, petitioners should have completed the building on 27 March 2005. However, contrary to petitioners’ claim and the findings of the CIAC, the records of this case clearly reveal that as of the latter date, the building had not been turned-over to respondent because the same had not been finished.

Even petitioner Emelyne Abaño, in her Affidavit dated 17 January 2007, admitted her and her co-petitioners’ failure to complete the building on time. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Q: Despite the faults and broken promises of the claimant Letran, when did you complete the construction of the building? <br><br>A: <b>We completed the construction of the building by month of April 2005</b>. x x x;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote><br>7.

Emelyne Abaño, agreed to a staggered payment of the First Progress Billing. Hence:<br><br><blockquote>MR. R. C. ONDEVILLA [respondent’s comptroller]:<br><br>x x x when she [Emelyne] submitted the billing for P14 million, Exhibit “H”, [1st Progress Billing] she was actually asking already for the payment.

Having agreed to the payment of the progress billings in installments, petitioners cannot now claim that the same caused delays in the project.<br><br>In any case, the records confirm that despite respondent’s delay in the payment of the down payment and the staggered payment of the progress billings, construction was actually ahead of schedule. Thus:<br><br>1. Petitioners’ 1<sup>st</sup> Progress Billing Report indicated a revised completion period of 12 months from the original contract duration of 14 months. Thus, the revised completion date was set to 31 December 2004 and&nbsp;&nbsp; the move-out date to 28 February 2005;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>2. Construction of the building began only on 27 January 2004, the date when the building permit was issued. By this time, however, respondent had already paid petitioners a total of P6 million;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>3. More telling is the testimony of petitioner Emelyne Abaño during the hearings before the CIAC:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY. B. G. FAJARDO (Chairman, Arbitration Panel):<br><b>The delay in the payment of the down payment, did it cause delay</b>?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ENGR. E. P. CAYETANO-ABAÑO:<br>In one way or another, it really caused the delay, in one way or another. But <b>it was not really the main point.</b> There are so many factors contributing to the delay, and <b>I cannot single out the payment alone</b>, the rain alone or the weather alone, or the cause of delay by trade and subcontractors hired by the owner. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>ATTY. R. C. CREENCIA:<br><b>Would you agree with me Madame Witness, that the down payment, the schedule by which the down payment was fully settled, would not have caused the delay</b>, because as of your August 2 payment certificate no. 1, you in fact reported that the actual physical accomplishment is [sic] already 80%.

Petitioners, however, chose not to avail of this prerogative. Hence, they cannot now shift the blame to respondent for their own lapse.<br><br><i>2. Failure to deliver a complete building<br><br>a.) 94.12% completion as found by DLSPI vs. 100% completion as determined by the CIAC</i><br><br>The report of DLSPI, the quantity surveyor engaged by respondent to ascertain the extent of work accomplished by petitioners on the project, indicate a 94.12% work completion, valued at P49,244,814.09. The ocular inspection conducted by the CIAC, on the other hand, convinced its arbitrators that petitioners’ accomplishment on the project is 100%.<br><br>After a thorough and comprehensive study of the records of this case, particularly the exhibits submitted by the parties, this Court finds and so holds that the DLSPI report is more reliable.<br><br>In the first place, contrary to the allegation of petitioners and the finding of the CIAC that the report prepared by DLSPI was based on the unrevised plans, the report itself states that the contract cost is P52,319,927.20 – a clear indication that DLSPI relied upon the revised plans and not the original ones. It will be recalled that the contract price originally proposed by petitioners was P64.2 Million. This was later on reduced to P55 Million, and after further negotiations, the contract price of P52,319,927.20 was finally agreed upon by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> This latter amount was what was reflected in the report of DLSPI. Notable are the following:<br><br><ol><li>Page D / 1 (Summary) of the report states that the contract cost is P52,319,927.20;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br></li><li> Table 1 of page D / 2 of the report (Cost of the items considered in the report) likewise indicates a contract cost of P52,319,927.20;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br></li><li>In the computation of liquidated damages to which respondent may be entitled, DLSPI once more based the amount on the “Original Contract Value” of P52,319,927.20; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69 ]</sup><br><br></li><li>Appendix A–1 (Summary of Cost) of the report states a total contract cost of [P]52,319,927.20;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and<br><br></li><li>Appendix B of the report once more indicates a total contract cost of P52,319,927.20.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></li></ol><br>In fact, nowhere in said report were the amounts of P64.2 Million or P55 Million even mentioned. Certainly, if the report was based on the unrevised plans, DLSPI would have pegged the amount of the contract at either P64.2 Million or P55 Million, in which case, the value of work accomplished, which DLSPI assessed at P49,244,814.09, would not have amounted to an accomplishment rate of 94.12%.<br><br>In the second place and, again, contrary to the finding of the CIAC that the DLSPI report did not consider the Detailed Cost Estimates, the report specifically states:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>In connection with the preparation of the report, the following were used as reference:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>C. Copy of <b>cost break down</b> x x x;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and<br><br></li><li>In doing the evaluation, the following were performed by DLSPI to obtain the objective: x x x x<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">D. Evaluated the <b>summary of cost that was provided by the Contractor</b>, and list [sic] down the works deleted from their cost breakdown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</div> </blockquote><br>The foregoing considered, it is questionable how the CIAC came to its conclusion that: “the Cost Evaluation Report [of DLSPI stating] that the percentage of completion x x x was 94.12% was wrong because [it] did not consider the revised plans and BOQ and Detailed Cost Estimates.” There is no doubt that DLSPI took into consideration the Detailed Cost Estimates in the preparation of its report. In addition, and more significantly, Appendix B<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Break Down of Cost) of the report is merely a reproduction of the Detailed Cost Estimates<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> provided by petitioners to respondent. The Detailed Cost Estimates specify the details of the works that petitioners were required to accomplish.<br><br>Petitioners and the CIAC likewise lament the failure of the DLSPI report to consider the BOQ. A comparative study of the BOQ<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> and Detailed Cost Estimates<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> reveals, however, that the two documents are actually the same in terms of the items listed therein. Thus, the items enumerated in the BOQ are all also included in the Detailed Cost Estimates, the only difference being that the latter document contains the details as to the quantity (number of units, unit measures, per unit cost, etc.) of each item of work and is, therefore, a more comprehensive listing of the scope of work of petitioners than the BOQ.<br><br>The foregoing, consequently, also belie petitioners’ claim that Engr. Areola of DLSPI was not familiar with petitioners’ scope of work.<br><br>Third, petitioners’ allegation that the report of DLSPI cannot be given credence because DLSPI had only the architectural and structural plans but not the electrical, plumbing and sanitary plans, is, once more, contradicted by the records of this case:<br><br><blockquote>ENGR. P. C. CAL (Member, Arbitration Panel):<br>I’m confused. I want clarification. Iyong comparison na 94-100 [%], syempre on the basis of plans, di ba?<br><br>ENGR. M. J. AREOLA (DLSPI engineer who prepared the report):<br>Yes.<br><br>ENGR. P. C. CAL:<br>Kung me mga missing plans, how would you factor in, na covered ba ito o hindi covered.<br><br>ENGR. M. J. AREOLA:<br>So, iyong mga missing plans which are sanitary, plumbing…<br><br>ENGR. P. C. CAL:<br>Electrical meron?<br><br>ENGR. M. J.

CAL:<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">In-assumed mo na 100%</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphases supplied).</blockquote><br>Thus, the 94.12% accomplishment rate determined by DLSPI already assumed a 100% completion of the electrical, sanitary and plumbing works on the project. Hence, petitioners have no basis in claiming that the report is inaccurate.<br><br>Fourth, with respect to the additives and the deductives, the testimony of Engr. Areola clearly shows that these had also been factored in the report:<br><br><blockquote>ENGR. P. C. CAL:<br>From your standpoint, would you accept iyong sinabi ni Engr.

The first ocular inspection was done on 6 December 2005 – almost two months after the take-over by respondent of the building – and the second one was carried out on 27 March 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The second inspection was done in order to confirm the observations made during the first inspection prior to the preparation and submission of the report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> which was completed on 17 July 2006. In contrast, petitioners’ expert witness, Engr. Coronel, whose “wellconsidered opinion x x x that completion was 100%” was given more weight by the CIAC because the same was based on an ocular inspection and a review of the construction and as-built plans, as well as the BOQ and comparative table of costs, did not even bother returning to the site in order to verify and validate the correctness of the findings and evaluation of DLSPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> As pointed out by respondent: “[i]f he did not go back to inspect the building, what was his basis for concluding that the building was fully completed?” Such inspection would have been proper considering his many comments to the report prepared by DLSPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><i>b.) Finding of the CIAC that “items inspected were observed to be punchlists in nature”</i><br><br>The CIAC, after ocular inspection of the project, concluded that completion of the building was 100% as the items inspected were allegedly mere punch list in nature. Apparently, the CIAC considered the items included in the punch list as in the character of “finishing touches.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Perini Corporation v. Greate Bay Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> the Supreme Court of New Jersey had the occasion to define “punch list” as “a comprehensive list of items to be completed or corrected.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Generally, the punch list includes those items that restrict the final completion of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Also, in <i>J.A. Sullivan Corporation v. Commonwealth</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stated that a punch list is an itemized list of finish work, corrections, repairs, and services to be performed in order to complete a construction contract. In the more recent cases of <i>Weitz Company v. MH Washington, et. al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and <i>Arch Insurance Company, et. al. v. Precision Stone, Inc</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> the United States Court of Appeals defined “punch list” as “the report of unfinished work identified during an inspection by the owner and contractor just before completion of a building” and “work called for by the original contract (or subcontract) which the contractor (or subcontractor) has not satisfactorily completed.” Clearly, by its very nature, unless and until the items in a punch list are completed and/or corrected, accomplishment on a project can never be considered 100%.<br><br>Given the many defects and unfinished works on the building subject of this case, the items in the punch list submitted by respondent for petitioners’ action are definitely not in the nature of mere “finishing touches.” Even assuming that there may be instances when a punch list may contain only items which are in the character of finishing touches, the photographs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> submitted by respondent documenting the state of the building after it took over the same in October 2005 unmistakably rebut this presumption. Thus:<br><br><ol><li>Photograph 49 shows a very thin layer of paint coating on the steel railings of the stairs going to the upper floors of the building, such that the primer coat can actually be seen; <br><br></li><li>Photographs 50-52 and 55 show cracks on the interior walls of the building – understandably a serious cause of concern for respondent considering that this affects the stability of the structure and considering further that the building is only a few months old.

The missing fixtures are the result of petitioners’ act of installing a single-hole faucet to a sink requiring a center-set faucet; thus, leaving two holes where the hot and cold taps should have been; <br><br></li><li>Photographs 69, 193, and 202 show the surface of the building’s interior walls with uneven portions – an indication of poor or improper wall plastering; <br><br></li><li>Photograph 79 shows a hole on the roof of the building big enough to cause a possible flooding within the building in case of rains; <br><br></li><li>Photograph 85 shows the absence of a down spout for the drainage in the outer walls of the building in order to prevent the adherence of moss or algae on the walls of the building; <br><br></li><li>Photographs 86, 95, 96, 99, and 100 seek to demonstrate that the ramp for the disabled is not wide enough so as to provide ease of access to wheelchairs;<br><br></li><li>Photographs 92-94 show an exposed electrical outlet on the exterior wall of the building – an electric shock hazard;<br><br></li><li>Photograph 175 shows improper grouting of floor tiles; <br><br></li><li>Photographs 188-189 show the interior walls of the building with peeled or peeling paint; <br><br></li><li>Photographs 190-191 show that the tiles used on the floor of the building are of different shades, resulting in an uneven floor pattern/appearance; <br><br></li><li> Photograph 196 shows a rain gutter with the spout aimed/directed at the roof of the building so that when it rains (as was the case when the photograph was taken), rainwater floods the roof of the building; <br><br></li><li> Photograph 200 shows electrical conduits clamped with galvanized iron wires only instead of proper electrical hangers or clamps. As pointed out by Engr. Reynaldo Natividad, one of respondent’s consultant, during the ocular inspection of the building with the CIAC:<br><br><blockquote>If you will see the layout of the PVC it is not properly provided with bracket and some of the connections has [sic] no fitting specially some of dummies just hanging on the cross angular of the structural.

The afore-enumerated defective and incomplete works strongly militate against a finding of 100% completion of the project. The above findings likewise lend credence to the report of DLSPI that the completion rate is only 94.12%.<br><br>More importantly, the fact that petitioners failed, and even refused, espite several demands from respondent, to correct and finish the defective and deficient works supports the allegation of respondent that petitioners eventually abandoned the project. It may be recalled that prior to its takeover of the building on 19 October 2005, respondent wrote petitioners no less than three letters (dated 26 July 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> 12 August 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> and 10 October 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup>) demanding that petitioners correct and complete their works on the building, with the last letter containing a warning that should petitioners fail to act on respondent’s demands, they would be considered to have abandoned the project. Petitioners, however, ignored the demands of respondent. Thereby, the fact of abandonment of the project was established.<br><br>Justifiably, respondent cannot be expected to accept an incomplete building. The completion of the punch list was, therefore, essential before respondent could finally accept the building.<br><br><i>3. Requests for payment without accompanying photographs&nbsp; </i><br><br>The Technical Specifications Book requires that requests for payment must be supported by progress photographs and that “no partial payment shall be considered for approval without the above mentioned prints accompanying the Request for Payment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> It is an admitted fact,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> however, that on 12 July 2004, petitioners requested payment from respondent in the amount of P14,325,196.07 without the requisite photographs, as in fact, petitioners’ First Progress Billing Report was submitted only on 2 August 2004.<br><br>Indeed, even prior to the submission of their First Progress Billing, and after the 12 July 2004 request for payment, petitioners again requested, on 20 July 2004, payment for additional works on the ground floor amounting to P1,598,698.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> without the necessary accompanying photographs. Respondent, however, did not pay this amount as the alleged additional works were not previously approved by respondent.<br><br><i>4.

It cannot be denied, however, that the expenses were indeed incurred and were the direct result of petitioners’ failure to finish the building on time. If the project had been completed as planned, there would not have been any need for the afore-enumerated expenses. As testified to by Mr. Rodolfo Ondevilla (Mr. Ondevilla) during the hearings before the CIAC:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY. V. F. ABAÑO: <br>And you had these temporary classrooms constructed when, Mr. Witness?<br><br>MR. R. C. ONDEVILLA: <br>Actually, that was constructed June already, x x x, <b>we have nowhere to go but to make these classrooms</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>ATTY.

ONDEVILLA: <br>Yes, your Honor.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. R. C. ONDEVILLA:<br><b>And the reason for that is because we are already short of classrooms, because the classrooms supposed to be delivered were not actually delivered</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br>More instructive is the following portion of his testimony:<br><br><blockquote>MR. R. C. ONDEVILLA:<br>x x x, your Honor, we have [sic] the punch listing in May, we are about ready to transfer in time for the opening of the school year, because at that time, we knew that they will be doing the reworks. However, in June 2006 [should be 2005], when Father [unintelligible] said we could [transfer] already, x x x they said they will do the rework in twenty seven days. It is impossible for us to open classes without [a] library. So, what we did is those shelves and chairs which were already transferred to that building were again pulled out to be brought to the Humbert Hall, the temporary library. That is the reason why there was overtime at that time, because we have to do it at night. We cannot do it in the morning when there are a lot of students in the school. So, that is the reason why we have to transfer some of those chairs, because then at that time, we are about ready, because they were saying it is finished. x x x. But because the academic departments are complaining and they were saying that we cannot open the school year without a library, we have to make a temporary library. So, that is the reason why we have to pull out again those bookshelves which were already transferred there to the temporary library. Your Honor, on the retiling, the second floor of the canteen building is not actually tiled, it is unfinished. So, the center part was actually made the <blockquote></blockquote>temporary office of the Nursing Dean, because the office which was occupied by the Nursing Dean was converted into a temporary laboratory. Because those temporary rooms will be occupied by the nursing students, it is but right that the dean should be located in that area. So, that is why, also because there is no other room that can be converted into a temporary library. That is why that one room being occupied by the dean and other faculty was transferred to that canteen where the temporary classrooms were made. x x x. And the other classrooms, your Honor, opposite the temporary laboratory, because this Nursing faculty cannot be accommodated in that room, the other classrooms were also made a temporary faculty room, x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup></blockquote><br>Nevertheless, the Court is disinclined to grant the following claims of respondent:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1.

Petitioners should only be liable for the cost of converting areas of the building into temporary classrooms, the total cost of which, based on the testimony of Mr. Ondevilla, is P855,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> This amount is already covered by Annexes “U-1” to “U-3,” under the list<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> of respondent’s claims to which this Court believes respondent to be entitled.<br><br>2.

It was not constituted as a result of the delays in the project.<br><br>Hence, the payment of their allowance is an expense ordinarily associated with any construction project and has no connection with petitioners’ delay in completing the building, which delay necessitated the construction of temporary facilities to accommodate respondent’s students. Consequently, the expenses incurred by respondent in the payment of the honorarium of the PEC members should not be charged to petitioners.<br><br></div>With respect to the charges for the investigation and rectification of the nursing building comfort rooms (Annexes “U-24” and “U-25”), waterproofing (Annex “U-26” and “U-27”) and taxes (Annexes “U-28” to “U-30”), these items were not included in the Terms of Reference, hence, were not considered during the hearings and were deemed excluded from the claims of respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br><i>3. Actual Damages (Professional Fees of DLSPI)<br></i><br>Based on the evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> presented by respondent, it incurred expenses in the amount of P200,000.00 as professional fees in the hiring of DLSPI, a specialized quantity surveyor firm, to conduct a cost analysis and evaluation of the total works done on the project.<br><br>Considering petitioners’ failure to complete the building and their eventual abandonment of the project, respondent was compelled to engage the services of DLSPI to ascertain the extent of petitioners’ accomplishment on the building. Had petitioners finished the project, there would not have been any need for respondent to resort to this measure. Petitioners should, consequently, be held answerable for this expense.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners’ monetary claims&nbsp; </i></b><br><br><i>1.) Unpaid balance of Progress Billing No. 2&nbsp; </i><br><br>In connection with the payment of progress billings, the Technical Specifications require approval of the request for payment and progress photographs to accompany the request. It is significant to note that, as evidenced by the progress billings themselves, respondent never signed the certificate of payments to signify its approval thereof. Nevertheless, respondent paid petitioners’ 1<sup>st</sup> Progress Billing in full and part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Progress Billing without such approval. Considering respondent’s act of paying part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Progress Billing, it may be reasonably concluded that it has impliedly approved payment thereof. Therefore, respondent is under obligation to pay its balance in the amount of P4,581,129.86.<br><br>Besides, the foregoing amount is part of the unpaid value of the work accomplished by petitioners on the building equivalent to 94.12%.<br><br><i>2. Final Billing&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><br>Petitioners are not entitled to the payment of their final billing because they failed to finish the project. The Contract between petitioners and respondent stipulates that “the final payment shall be released only after the acceptance of the project.” Since petitioners did not finish the building, there was never any occasion for respondent to accept the same. Hence, the obligation of respondent to make the final payment did not arise.<br><br>Nevertheless, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that petitioners were able to deliver a 100% complete building, their failure to comply with the provisions of the Contract on the documentary requirements prior to final payment effectively hinders settlement of the final billing:<br><br><blockquote>That the final payment shall be released only after the acceptance of the project and <b>submission of As-Built Plans, Affidavit, and other documents as may be required by the OWNER</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The Technical Specifications contains the following additional requisites which were likewise not complied with by petitioners:<br><br><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>CORRECTION OF WORK BEFORE FINAL PAYMENT: The Contractor shall promptly remove from the premises all work condemned by the Architect as failing [to] conform to the Contract, [w]hether incorporated or [not], and the Contractor shall promptly replace and re-execute his own work in accordance with the Contract and without expense to the Owner and shall bear the expenses of making good all work of other Contractors destroyed or damaged by such removal or replacement. x x x. <br><br></li><li>OTHER REQUIREMENTS BEFORE FINAL PAYMENT: The Contractor shall submit (aside from those provided in the Contract Document) the following before final payment is made:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>Certificate of Final Building Occupancy.<br><br></li><li>Certificate of Final Inspection of electrical, telephone, sanitary, mechanical, water, gas, safety and other utilities. <br><br></li><li>Original and three (3) sets of prints of “As-built Drawings” of Electrical, Sanitary, Gas, Telephone and Mechanical Works. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br></li></ol><br><ol start="7" type="a"><li>Guarantee bond equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the Contract Price covering a period of one year after the final Acceptance of the Contract work and materials installed. x x x. </li></ol><br><br></li><li>ACCEPTANCE AND FINAL PAYMENT: x x x.

It failed to take into consideration Our foregoing determinations that as of that period, works on the building were still ongoing. Such finding also disregarded the clear testimony of respondent’s comptroller, Mr. Ondevilla, that the building cannot be used at that time, or even in November of that same year, since the building officials of Calamba City did not permit its use because of safety concerns. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>ATTY. V. F. ABAÑO: <br>And isn’t it a fact Mr. Witness that the ground floor of this subject building was used starting in June 2004?<br><br>MR. R. C.

The retention period, on the other hand, was to be reckoned from the date of final turnover and acceptance of the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Since petitioners did not finish the building, there was no formal turn-over and acceptance of the project. Hence, the retention period, from which the surcharge must be computed, did not start to run.<br><br><i>4. Amount of work accomplished equivalent to 94.12%&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><br><br>As per report of DLSPI, the 94.12% work accomplishment of petitioners on the project amounts to P49,244,814.99. Since respondent has made payments in the total amount of P42,319,927.20, there remains a balance of P6,924,887.79. This amount includes the P4,581,129.86 unpaid balance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Progress Billing to which, as We already declared above, petitioners are entitled. Thus, of the total work accomplished by petitioners, respondent still has a balance of P2,343,757.93, in addition to the P4,581,129.86 unpaid balance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Progress Billing (P4,581,129.86 + P2,343,757.93 = P6,924,887.79).<br><br><b><i>Other monetary claims</i></b><br><br><i>1.

The CIAC gave merit to the allegations of petitioners that the delayed and staggered payments drained them financially and emotionally, compelled them to apply for additional loans, affected their reputation and credit standing adversely, made them suffer mental anguish, serious anxiety and sleepless nights, and prevented them from participating in the bidding of other projects because of their financial problems. However, as already explained above, with the exception of the down payment, petitioners agreed to a staggered payment of the progress billings; hence, they cannot now claim that they were adversely affected by respondent’s payments in installment. Also, with respect to the down payment, there was no showing that respondent’s failure to pay the same on time and in full was attended by fraud or bad faith or was in wanton or oppressive disregard of petitioners’ rights.<br><br>More importantly, an award of moral damages must be anchored on a <b>clear showing</b> that the party entitled thereto <b>actually experienced</b> mental anguish, besmirched reputation, sleepless nights, wounded feelings, or similar injury. Here, while petitioners alleged that their finances were adversely affected, they did not present any evidence thereof, such as documents evidencing the loans they were supposedly compelled to obtain.<br><br>In the same manner, respondent also failed to present sufficient evidence of their entitlement to moral and exemplary damages. The alleged besmirched reputation it allegedly suffered as a result of the building not having been finished on time was not supported by any evidence other than respondent’s bare allegation.<br><br>Absent any showing that the parties are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, their respective claims therefor must be disallowed.<br><br><i>2.
