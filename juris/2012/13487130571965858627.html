Templo for him to return the same.<br><br>The above-mentioned unremitted amount was discovered after representatives from the COA-NAIA Customhouse discovered discrepancies in the collections and remittances of respondent Fajardo during the period covering January 1, 2002 to October 30, 2002 amounting to P20,118,355.00 which was initially communicated to District Collector Celso Templo through an Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2002-008 dated November 26, 2002. This leads to a further investigation resulting to the analysis of Monthly Sales of Accountable Forms and Stamps prepared by the COA State Auditors covering the period January 1, 2000 to October 30, 2002, which showed that the total amount of unremitted collections for the sale of accountable forms with money value and customs documentary and BIR stamps amounted to P53,658,371.00.<br><br>The following table shows a comparison of collections and remittances per report of Mr. Ernesto Fajardo and per audit by the team for the period January 2000 to October 30, 2002. As per audit report, the total amount of collections is P440,623,111.00, whereas respondent’s report disclosed total collections in the amount of P387,913,381.00.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The above-cited comparison focused on the examination and verification of documents covering collections and remittances of Fajardo. The documents composed of liquidated and unliquidated entries coming from the following offices:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>1) </em></div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>Liquidation and Billing Division – which has the function of verifying, reviewing and checking computation of formal entries; </em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>2) </em></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>Cashiers – [who submit] to COA all informal entries after they have collected customs duties, taxes and other charges for the imported good; and also the Bonds Division and Office of the Deputy Collector for Operations which also have custody of various forms without money value such as bonds, clearances, etc., where Customs Documentary Stamps (CDS) [are] required by regulations to be affixed. The audit likewise concentrated on Confirmation with from Brokers regarding the sale of CDS.</em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>In fact, confirmation letters were sent to 212 [b]rokers who purchased BOC Accountable Forms from NAIA for the period January 2000 to October 2002. Selection was based on the volume of purchases made by the brokers. The selected brokers had the highest number of purchases of BOC Accountable Forms with money value requiring payment of CDS.<br><br>From the existing procedural flowchart of the Collection Division, NAIA [Customs House], it appeared that the Collection Division has a Section in charge [of] the sale of BOC Forms and CDS. Per Organizational Chart of the Collection Division, Mr. Fajardo is the Collecting Officer assigned to perform such function. The organizational chart also shows that there are three (3) other personnel [under] Fajardo’s supervision such as the BC Forms Clerk, CDS Clerk and the one in charge [of] the sale of BC Forms with CDS at Pair Cargo, a Customs Bonded Warehouse. The Flow Chart of Accountable Forms submitted by the Collection Division shows that it is the Collecting Officer (Fajardo) who is authorized to accept payment for the sale of Forms and CDS. The assigned Clerk assists him in the stamping on the forms of the required CDS, but returns the same to the Collecting Officer already stamped for release to the [b]rokers.<br><br>The Collecting Officer thereafter prepares Report of Collections and deposit[s] collections to the LBP. He also records transactions in his official cash book where he tallies his collections with the remittances made for the day.<br><br>This flow of transactions is also supported by the Sworn Statements executed by Mr. Pica and Ms. Caber who attested that they assisted Fajardo in the performance of his functions. Ms. Caber stamps the forms with required CDS using the franking machine while Mr. Pica has the following duties, among others:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>1)</em></div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><em>Checks correctness of RIV of forms requisitions;</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>2) </em></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>Checks serial number of entries to be sold for the day;</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><em>3) </em></div></td> <td><p align="JUSTIFY"><em>Assists in the issuance of OR and having it signed by Mr. Fajardo as Collecting Officer.</em></p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>Both of them further attested that payments are personally received by Fajardo. There are times, however, that they receive the payment but turn the same over to Fajardo.<br><br>Since Fajardo is the only Collecting Officer authorized to receive payment from the Sale of BOC Forms and CDS at the Collection Division, NAIA [Customs House], he is accountable for all the collections from the sale by NAIA [Customs House] of Bureau of Customs Accountable Forms and Customs Documentary and BIR Stamps (CDS).<br><br>To explain how that total aggregate amount was arrived at, COA State Auditor Nancy Marco said that from her Analysis on the Monthly Sales of Accountable Forms and Stamps of respondent for the period January 1, 2002 to October 31, 2002, said respondent was able to sell accountable forms with money value and stamps in the sum of P157,612,585.00 but remitted only P137,494,230.00 to the LandBank, NAIA Customs. On January 2001 – December 2001, respondent sold forms and stamps in the sum of P237,905,834.00 but remitted only P123,753,065.00. For the year 2000 said respondent sold the same forms and stamps in the sum of P145,320,000.00 but remitted only P126,666,186.00. From her summary, the total forms and stamps which respondent sold for said period was in the total sum of P441,127,739.00. However, respondent remitted only the sum of P389,913,481.00. Therefor[e], the total sum which respondent failed to remit amounted to P53,214,258.00.00, which was later on corrected in the COA final audit report [to] P53,658,371.00 or an increase of P444,113.00.<br><br>A review of the above analysis initiated by COA State Auditors [Filomena Bascon] Tolorio and Prudencia S. Bautista, confirmed the [foregoing] findings.<br><br>The investigating panel is, therefore, of the view that respondent ERNESTO A. FAJARDO, being a special collecting officer of the NAIA Custom[s] House, is duty bound to remit collections of payments from the sale of Bureau of Customs (BOC) accountable forms with money value as well as Customs Documentary Stamps, to the Government via Landbank, the government’s authorized depositary bank. Respondent’s failure to remit the amount he collected constitutes Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><i>FOREGOING CONSIDERED</i></b>, pursuant to Section 52 (A-1) and (A3), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases (CSC Resolution No. 991936), dated August 31, 1999, respondent ERNESTO A.

</i></b><br><br>Petitioner imputes irregularities in the proceedings before the Ombudsman.<br><br>He claims that the CA and the Ombudsman should not have relied on the report on the results of the audit because it was not lawfully introduced or offered in evidence before the Office of the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Such allegation deserves scant consideration. No evidence was presented by petitioner to prove such allegation. As we have often said, in the absence of clear and convincing proof to the contrary, public officers or employees are presumed to have performed their official duties regularly, properly and lawfully.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Besides, the report on the results of the audit was not the sole basis for his dismissal from public service. Affidavits and testimonies of witnesses taken during the bail hearing in the criminal case were also submitted as evidence in the administrative case to prove the charges against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In fact, the final report merely confirmed the contents of the audit report of State Auditor Marco as pointed out by Assistant Ombudsman Pelagio S. Apostol in his marginal note in the Order dated July 22, 2005, which reads:<br><br>The findings of discrepancies as contained in the audit observation memorandum prepared by State Auditor Nancy Marco was already verified and validated per COA final audit report which was indubitably considered in the drafting of the questioned Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b><i>There is substantial evidence to support the<br> finding that petitioner is guilty of dishonesty<br> and grave misconduct.</i></b><br><br>The audit report of State Auditor Marco revealed that petitioner’s remittance fell short of P53,658,371.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Said figure was arrived at by deducting the total amount remitted by petitioner from the total “audit sales” of all the accountable forms. The “audit sales” of each accountable form was computed by dividing the total sale of each form by the price of the form multiplied by the corresponding amount of the documentary stamps.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The computations were made in accordance with Customs Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 19-77<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> dated April 14, 1977 which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>In order to simplify the processing of entry papers and other customs documents, it is directed that <b>metered customs documentary stamps be impressed beforehand and the amount thereof added to the cost of the documents when sold</b>. x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, contrary to the view of petitioner, the “audit sales” are not based on mere speculations but are based on CMO No. 19-77. In fact, during the initial audit, petitioner and his staff confirmed that “accountable forms, namely: BC 236, BC 177, BC 199, BC 43 and BC 242 are always sold with documentary stamps.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>To disprove the correctness of the “audit sales,” petitioner harps on the fact that the amount loaded on the machine per month was less than the monthly “audit sales” of State Auditor Marco. He insists that this proves that there was no under remittance on his part. We do not agree. The mere fact that the load in the machine is less than the “audit sale” does not prove his innocence. Rather, it only means that either petitioner sold the accountable forms without the corresponding documentary stamp, which is a clear violation of CMO No. 19-77, or that he used another machine, not authorized by his office, as theorized by State Auditor Marco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>To us, the discrepancy between the “audit sales” and the actual amount remitted by petitioner is sufficient evidence of dishonesty and grave misconduct warranting his dismissal from public service. We need not belabor the point that unlike in a criminal case where proof beyond reasonable doubt is required, administrative proceedings only require substantial evidence or “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Neither do we find any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA in not considering the finding of the RTC “that the evidence of guilt of [petitioner] is not strong.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> To begin with, the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> dated January 6, 2004, granting petitioner’s application for bail, was not attached to the Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> he filed with the CA, nor was it submitted as evidence before the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It is likewise significant to mention that the said Order merely resolved petitioner’s entitlement to bail. More important, the Ombudsman and the CA are not bound by the RTC’s finding because as a rule, administrative cases are independent from criminal proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In fact, the dismissal of one case does not necessarily merit the dismissal of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>All told, we find that there is substantial evidence to show that petitioner failed to remit the amount of P53,658,371.00 from the sale of accountable forms with money value and documentary stamps for the period January 2000 up to October 2002.<br><br><b><i>The Ombudsman has the power to dismiss<br> erring public officials or employees.</i></b><br><br>As a last ditch effort to save himself, petitioner now puts in issue the power of the Ombudsman to order his dismissal from service.
