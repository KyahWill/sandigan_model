				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is a petition for certiorari and prohibition seeking to permanently enjoin the sale of the Angat Hydro-Electric Power Plant (AHEPP) to Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-Water) which won the public bidding conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM).<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>Respondent PSALM is a government-owned and controlled corporation created by virtue of Republic Act No. 9136,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> otherwise known as the “Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001” (EPIRA).&nbsp; The EPIRA provided a framework for the restructuring of the electric power industry, including the privatization of the assets of the National Power Corporation (NPC), the transition to the desired competitive structure, and the definition of the responsibilities of the various government agencies and private entities.&nbsp; Said law mandated PSALM to manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and Independent Power Producer (IPP) contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner, which liquidation is to be completed within PSALM’s 25-year term of existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Sometime in August 2005, PSALM commenced the privatization of the 246-megawatt (MW) AHEPP located in San Lorenzo, Norzagaray, Bulacan.&nbsp; AHEPP’s main units built in 1967 and 1968, and 5 auxiliary units, form part of the Angat Complex which includes the Angat Dam, Angat Reservoir and the outlying watershed area. A portion of the AHEPP -- the 10 MW Auxiliary Unit No. 4 completed on June 16, 1986 and the 18 MW Auxiliary Unit No. 5 completed on January 14, 1993 -- is owned by respondent Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; The main units produce a total of 200 MW of power while the auxiliary units yield the remaining 46 MW of power.&nbsp; The Angat Dam and AHEPP are utilized for power generation, irrigation, water supply and flood control purposes.&nbsp; Because of its multi-functional design, the operation of the Angat Complex involves various government agencies, namely: (1) NPC; (2) National Water Resources Board (NWRB); (3) MWSS; (4) respondent National Irrigation Administration (NIA); and (5) Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAG-ASA).<br><br>On December 15, 2009, PSALM’s Board of Directors approved the Bidding Procedures for the privatization of the AHEPP. An Invitation to Bid was published on January 11, 12 and 13, 2010 in three major national newspapers. Subject of the bid was the AHEPP consisting of 4 main units and 3 auxiliary units with an aggregate installed capacity of 218 MW.&nbsp; The two auxiliary units owned by MWSS were excluded from the bid.<br><br>The following terms and conditions for the purchase of AHEPP were set forth in the Bidding Package:<br><br><blockquote>IB-05 CONDITION OF THE SALE<br><br>The Asset shall be sold on an “<i><u>AS IS, WHERE IS</u></i>” basis.<br><br>The Angat Dam (which is part of the Non-Power Components) is a multi-purpose hydro facility which currently supplies water for domestic use, irrigation and power generation.&nbsp; The four main units of the Angat Plant release water to an underground trailrace that flows towards the Bustos Dam which is owned and operated by the National Irrigation Administration (“NIA”) and provides irrigation requirements to certain areas in Bulacan.&nbsp; The water from the auxiliary units 1, 2 and 3 flows to the Ipo Dam which is owned and operated by MWSS and supplies domestic water to Metro Manila and other surrounding cities.<br><br><b>The priority of water usage under Philippine Law would have to be observed by the Buyer/Operator.</b><br><br>The Winning Bidder/Buyer shall be requested to enter into <b>an operations and maintenance agreement with PSALM for the Non-Power Components</b> in accordance with the terms and conditions of the O &amp; M Agreement to be issued as part of the Final Transaction Documents.&nbsp; The Buyer, as Operator, shall be required to operate and maintain the Non-Power Components at its own cost and expense.<br><br>PSALM is currently negotiating a water protocol agreement with various parties which are currently the MWSS, NIA, the National Water Resources Board and NPC.&nbsp; If required by PSALM, <b>the Buyer will be required to enter into the said water protocol agreement as a condition to the award of the Asset.</b><br><br>The Buyer shall be responsible for securing the necessary rights to occupy the land underlying the Asset.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>All participating bidders were required to comply with the following: (a) submission of a Letter of Interest; (b) execution of Confidentiality Agreement and Undertaking; and (c) payment of a non-refundable fee of US$ 2,500 as Participation Fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; After holding pre-bid conferences and forum discussions with various stakeholders, PSALM received the following bids from six competing firms:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">K-Water</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">US$ 440,880,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">First Gen Northern Energy Corporation</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">365,000,678.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">San Miguel Corporation</p></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">312,500,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">SN Aboitiz Power-Pangasinan, Inc.</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">256,000,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Trans-Asia Oil &amp; Energy Development Corporation</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">237,000,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">DMCI Power Corporation</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">188,890,000.00</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>On May 5, 2010, and after a post-bid evaluation, PSALM’s Board of Directors approved and confirmed the issuance of a Notice of Award to the highest bidder, K-Water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On May 19, 2010, the present petition with prayer for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction was filed by the Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment Through Alternative Legal Services, Inc. (IDEALS), Freedom from Debt Coalition (FDC), AKBAYAN Citizen’s Action Party (AKBAYAN) and Alliance of Progressive Labor.<br><br>On May 24, 2010, this Court issued a <i>Status Quo Ante </i>Order directing the respondents to maintain the <i>status quo</i> prevailing before the filing of the petition and to file their respective Comments on the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Arguments of the Parties</u>&nbsp; </b></center><br>Petitioners contend that PSALM gravely abused its discretion when, in the conduct of the bidding it disregarded and violated the people’s right to information guaranteed under the <u>Constitution</u>, as follows: (1) the bidding process was commenced by PSALM without having previously released to the public critical information such as the terms and conditions of the sale,&nbsp; the parties qualified to bid and the minimum bid price, as laid down in the case of <i>Chavez v. Public Estates Authority</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>; (2) PSALM refused to divulge significant information requested by petitioners, matters which are of public concern; and (3) the bidding was not conducted in an open and transparent manner, participation was indiscriminately restricted to the private sectors in violation of the EPIRA which provides that its provisions shall be “construed in favor of the establishment, promotion, preservation of competition and people empowerment so that the widest participation of the people, whether directly or indirectly, is ensured.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also assail the PSALM in not offering the sale of the AHEPP to MWSS which co-owned the Angat Complex together with NPC and NIA.&nbsp; Being a mere co-owner, PSALM cannot sell the AHEPP without the consent of co-owners MWSS and NIA, and being an indivisible thing, PSALM has a positive obligation to offer its undivided interest to the other co-owners before selling the same to an outsider. Hence, PSALM’s unilateral disposition of the said hydro complex facility violates the Civil Code rules on co-ownership (Art. 498) and Sec. 47 (e) of the EPIRA which granted PSALM the legal option of transferring possession, control and operation of NPC generating assets like the AHEPP to another entity in order “to protect potable water, irrigation and all other requirements imbued with public interest.”<br><br>As to the participation in the bidding of and award of contract to K-Water which is a foreign corporation, petitioners contend that PSALM clearly violated the constitutional provisions on the appropriation and utilization of water as a natural resource, as implemented by the <u>Water Code of the Philippines</u> limiting water rights to Filipino citizens and corporations which are at least 60% Filipino-owned.&nbsp; Further considering the importance of the Angat Dam which is the source of 97% of Metro Manila’s water supply, as well as irrigation for farmlands in 20 municipalities and towns in Pampanga and Bulacan, petitioners assert that PSALM should prioritize such domestic and community use of water over that of power generation. They maintain that the Philippine Government, along with its agencies and subdivisions, have an obligation under international law, to recognize and protect the legally enforceable human right to water of petitioners and the public in general.<br><br>Petitioners cite the Advisory on the “Right to Water in Light of the Privatization of the Angat Hydro-Electric Power Plant”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated November 9, 2009 issued by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) urging the Government to revisit and reassess its policy on water resources vis-à-vis its concurrent obligations under international law to provide, and ensure and sustain, among others, “safe, sufficient, affordable and convenient access to drinking water.” Since investment in hydropower business is primarily driven by generation of revenues both for the government and private sector, the CHR warns that once the AHEPP is privatized, there will be less accessible water&nbsp; supply, particularly for those living in Metro Manila and the Province of Bulacan and nearby areas which are currently benefited by the AHEPP.&nbsp; The CHR believes that the management of AHEPP is better left to MWSS being a government body and considering the public interest involved. However, should the decision to privatize the AHEPP become inevitable, the CHR strongly calls for specific and concrete safeguards to ensure the right to water of all, as the domestic use of water is more fundamental than the need for electric power.<br><br>Petitioners thus argue that the protection of their right to water and of public interest requires that the bidding process initiated by PSALM be declared null and void for violating such right, as defined by international law and by domestic law establishing the State’s obligation to ensure water security for its people.<br><br>In its Comment With Urgent Motion to Lift <i>Status Quo Ante</i> Order, respondent PSALM prayed for the dismissal of the petition on the following procedural grounds: (a) a petition for certiorari is not the proper remedy because PSALM was not acting as a tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions when it commenced the privatization of AHEPP; (b) the present petition is rendered moot by the issuance of a Notice of Award in favor of K-Water; (c) assuming the petition is not mooted by such contract award, this Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy involving a political question, and also because if it were the intent of Congress&nbsp; to exclude the AHEPP in the privatization of NPC assets, it should have clearly expressed such intent as it did with the Agus and Pulangui power plants under Sec. 47 of the EPIRA; (d) petitioners’ lack of standing to question the bidding process for failure to show any injury as a result thereof, while Rep. Walden Bello likewise does not have such legal standing in his capacity as a duly elected member of the House of Representatives as can be gleaned from the rulings in&nbsp; <i>David v. Arroyo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <i>Philippine Constitutional Association v. Enriquez</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On the alleged violation of petitioners’ right to information, PSALM avers that it conducted the bidding in an open and transparent manner, through a series of events in accordance with the governing rules on public bidding.&nbsp; The non-disclosure of certain information in the invitation to bid was understandable, such as the minimum or reserve price which are still subject to negotiation and approval of PSALM’s Board of Directors.&nbsp; The ruling in <i>Chavez v. Public Estates Authority</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>is inapplicable since it involved government property which has become unserviceable or was no longer needed and thus fell under Sec. 79 of the <u>Government Auditing Code</u> whereas the instant case concerns a hydroelectric power plant adjacent to a dam which still provides water supply to Metro Manila. In the bidding for the AHEPP, PSALM claims that it relied on the Rules and Regulations Implementing the EPIRA, as well as COA Circular No. 89-296 on the general procedures for bidding by government agencies and instrumentalities of assets that will be divested or government property that will be disposed of.&nbsp; PSALM likewise avers that it was constrained to deny petitioner IDEALS’ letter dated April 20, 2010 requesting documents relative to the privatization of Angat Dam due to non-submission of a Letter of Interest, Confidentiality and Undertaking and non-payment of the Participation Fee.&nbsp; With regard to IDEALS’ request for information about the winning bidder, as contained in its letter dated May 14, 2010, the same was already referred to respondent K-Water’s counsel for appropriate action.&nbsp; In any case, PSALM maintains that not all details relative to the privatization of the AHEPP can be readily disclosed; the confidentiality of certain matters was necessary to ensure the optimum bid price for the property.<br><br>PSALM further refutes the assertion of petitioners that the Angat Complex is an indivisible system and co-owned with MWSS and NIA. It contends that MWSS’s contribution in the funds used for the construction of the AHEPP did not give rise to a regime of co-ownership as the said funds were merely in exchange for the supply of water that MWSS would get from the Angat Dam, while the Umiray-AngatTransbasin Rehabilitation Project the improvement and repair of which were funded by MWSS, did not imply a co-ownership as these facilities are located in remote places.&nbsp; Moreover, PSALM points out that PSALM, MWSS and NIA each was issued a water permit, and are thus holders of separate water rights.<br><br>On the alleged violation of petitioners’ and the people’s right to water, PSALM contends that such is baseless and proceeds from the mistaken assumption that the Angat Dam was sold and as a result thereof, the continuity and availability of domestic water supply will be interrupted. PSALM stresses that only the hydroelectric facility is being sold and not the Angat Dam which remains to be owned by PSALM, and that the NWRB still governs the water allocation therein while the NPC-FFWSDO still retains exclusive control over the opening of spillway gates during rainy season. The foregoing evinces the continued collective control by government agencies over the Angat Dam, which in the meantime, is in dire need of repairs, the cost of which cannot be borne by the Government.<br><br>PSALM further debunks the nationality issue raised by petitioners, citing previous opinions rendered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) consistently holding that the utilization of water by a hydroelectric power plant does not constitute appropriation of water from its natural source considering that the source of water (dam) that enters the intake gate of the power plant is an artificial structure.&nbsp; Moreover, PSALM is mindful of the State’s duty to protect the public’s right to water when it sold the AHEPP.&nbsp; In fact, such concern as taken into consideration by PSALM in devising a privatization scheme for the AHEPP whereby the water allocation is continuously regulated by the NWRB and the dam and its spillway gates remain under the ownership and control of NPC.<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> respondent MWSS asserts that by virtue of its various statutory powers since its creation in 1971, which includes the construction, maintenance and operation of dams, reservoir and other waterworks within its territorial jurisdiction, it has supervision and control over the Angat Dam given that the Angat Reservoir supplies approximately 97% of the water requirements of Metro Manila.&nbsp; Over the course of its authority over the Angat Dam, Dykes and Reservoir, MWSS has incurred expenses to maintain their upkeep, improve and upgrade their facilities. Thus, in 1962, MWSS contributed about 20% for the construction cost of the Angat Dam and Dykes (then equivalent to about P21 million); in 1992, MWSS contributed about P218 million for the construction of Auxiliary Unit No. 5; in 1998, MWSS contributed P73.5 million for the construction&nbsp; cost of the low level outlet; and subsequently, MWSS invested P3.3 billion to build the Umiray-AngatTransbasin Tunnel to supplement the water supply available from the Angat Dam, which tunnel contributes a minimum of&nbsp; about 9 cubic meters per second to the Angat Reservoir, thus increasing power generation.&nbsp; MWSS argues that its powers over waterworks are vested upon it by a special law (MWSS Charter) which prevails over the EPIRA which is a general law, as well as other special laws, issuances and presidential edicts.&nbsp; And as contained in Sec. 1 of the MWSS Charter, which remains valid and effective, it is expressly provided that the establishment, operation and maintenance of waterworks systems must always be supervised by the State.<br><br>MWSS further alleges that after the enactment of EPIRA, it had expressed the desire to acquire ownership and control of the AHEPP so as not to leave the operation of the Angat Reservoir to private discretion that may prejudice the water allocation to MWSS as dictated by NWRB rules.&nbsp; Representations were thereafter made with the Office of the President (OP) for the turn over of the management of these facilities to MWSS, and joint consultation was also held with PSALM officials for the possibility of a Management Committee to manage and control the Angat Dam Complex under the chairmanship of the water sector, which position was supported by former Secretary HermogenesEbdane of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).&nbsp; In March 2008, PSALM proposed the creation of an inter-agency technical working group (TWG) to draft the Operations and Maintenance (O &amp; M) Agreement for the AHEPP that will be in effect after its privatization. PSALM likewise sought the view of the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) which opined that PSALM may turn over the facility to a qualified entity such as MWSS without need of public bidding. In 2009, various local governments supported the transfer of the control and management of the AHEPP to MWSS, while the League of Cities and Municipalities interposed its opposition to the privatization of the AHEPP fearing that it might increase the cost of water in Metro Manila, and also because it will be disadvantageous to the national government since the AHEPP only contributes 246 MW of electricity to the Luzon Grid.&nbsp; Even the CHR has advised the Government to reassess its privatization policy and to always consider paramount the most basic resources necessary and indispensable for human survival, which includes water.<br><br>MWSS further avers that upon the facilitation of the OGCC and participated in by various stakeholders, including its two concessionaires, Manila Water Company, Inc. and Maynilad Water Services, Inc., various meetings and conferences were held relative to the drafting of the Memorandum of Agreement on the Angat Water Protocol.&nbsp; On April 20, 2010, the final draft of the Angat Water Protocol was finally complete.&nbsp; However, as of June 18, 2010, only MWSS and NIA signed the said final draft.&nbsp; MWSS thus contends that PSALM failed to institute any safeguards as prescribed in Sec. 47 of the EPIRA when it proceeded with the privatization of the AHEPP.<br><br>As to the issue of nationality requirement in the appropriation of water resources under the <u>Constitution</u>, MWSS cites the case of <i>Manila Prince Hotel v. Government Service Insurance System</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which interpreted paragraph 2, Sec. 10, Art. XII of the <u>1987 Constitution</u> providing that “[i]n the grant of rights, privileges, and concessions covering the national economy and patrimony, the State shall give preference to qualified Filipinos” to imply “a mandatory, positive command which is complete in itself and which needs no further guidelines or implementing laws or rules for its enforcement x xx and is <i>per se </i>judicially enforceable.” In this case, the AHEPP is in dire danger of being wholly-owned by a Korean corporation which probably merely considers it as just another business opportunity, and as such cannot be expected to observe and ensure the smooth facilitation of the more critical purposes of water supply and irrigation.<br><br>Respondent First Gen Northern Energy Corporation (FGNEC) also filed a Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> disagreeing with the contentions of petitioners and respondent MWSS on account of the following: (1) the NPC charter vested upon it complete jurisdiction and control over watersheds like the Angat Watershed surrounding the reservoir of the power plants, and hence Art. 498 of the <u>Civil Code</u> is inapplicable; (2) NPC, MWSS and NIA are not co-owners of the various rights over the Angat Dam as in fact each of them holds its own water rights; (3) the State through the EPIRA expressly mandates PSALM to privatize all NPC assets, which necessarily includes the AHEPP; (4) the privatization of the AHEPP will not affect the priority of water for domestic and municipal uses as there are sufficient safeguards to ensure the same, and also because the <u>Water Code</u> specifically mandates that such use shall take precedence over other uses, and even the&nbsp; EPIRA itself gives priority to use of water for domestic and municipal purposes over power generation; (5) the Water Protocol also safeguards priority of use of water for domestic purposes; (6) the bidding procedure for the AHEPP was valid, and the bidding was conducted by PSALM in an open and transparent manner; and (7) the right to information of petitioners and the public in general was fully satisfied, and PSALM adopted reasonable rules and regulations for the orderly conduct of its functions pursuant to its mandate under the EPIRA.<br><br>FGNEC nevertheless prays of this Court to declare the nationality requirements for the ownership, operation and maintenance of the AHEPP as prescribed by the <u>Constitution</u> and pertinent laws. Considering the allegation of petitioners that K-Water is owned by the Republic of South Korea, FGNEC asserts that PSALM should not have allowed said entity to participate in the bidding because under our <u>Constitution</u>, the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources are reserved to Filipino citizens or to corporations with 60% of their capital being owned by Filipinos.<br><br>Respondent NIA filed its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> stating that its interest in this case is limited only to the protection of its water allocation drawn from the Angat Dam as determined by the NWRB.&nbsp; Acknowledging that it has to share the meager water resources with other government agencies in fulfilment of their respective mandate, NIA submits that it is willing to sit down and discuss issues relating to water allocation, as evidenced by the draft Memorandum of Agreement on the Angat Water Protocol.&nbsp; Since the reliefs prayed for in the instant petition will not be applicable to NIA which was not involved in the bidding conducted by PSALM, it will thus not be affected by the outcome of the case.<br><br>Respondents San Miguel Corporation (SMC), DMCI Power Corporation,&nbsp; Trans-Asia Oil and Energy Development Corporation and SNAboitiz&nbsp; Power-Pangasinan, Inc. filed their respective Comments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> with common submission that they are not real parties-in-interest and should be excluded from the case.&nbsp; They assert that PSALM acted pursuant to its mandate to privatize the AHEPP when it conducted the bidding, and there exists no reason for them to take any action to invalidate the said bidding wherein they lost to the highest bidder K-Water.<br><br>On its part, respondent K-Water filed a Manifestation In Lieu of Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> stating that it is not in a position to respond to petitioners’ allegations, having justifiably relied on the mandate and expertise of PSALM in the conduct of public bidding for the privatization of the AHEPP and had no reason to question the legality or constitutionality of the privatization process, including the bidding.&nbsp; K-Water submits that its participation in the bidding for the AHEPP was guided at all times by an abiding respect for the <u>Constitution</u> and the laws of the Philippines, and hopes for a prompt resolution of the present petition to further strengthen and enhance the investment environment – considering the level of investment entailed, not only in financial terms – by providing a definitive resolution and reliable guidance for investors, whether Filipino or foreign, as basis for effective investment and business decisions.<br><br>In their Consolidated Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> petitioners contend that the instant petition is not mooted with the issuance of a Notice of Award to K-Water because the privatization of AHEPP is not finished until and unless the deed of absolute sale has been executed.&nbsp; They cite the ruling in <i>David v.

XII, Sec. 2 of the <u>Constitution</u>.&nbsp; PSALM likewise has not stated that all stakeholders have signed the Water Protocol.&nbsp; Such absence of a signed Water Protocol is alarming in the light of PSALM’s pronouncement that the terms of the sale to K-Water would still subject to negotiation.&nbsp; Is PSALM’s refusal to sign the Water Protocol part of its strategy to negotiate the terms of the sale with the bidders?&nbsp; If so, then PSALM is blithely and cavalierly bargaining away the Filipinos’ right to water.<br><br>Responding to the claims of MWSS in its Comment, PSALM contends that MWSS’s allegations regarding the bidding process is belied by MWSS’s own admission that it held discussions with PSALM to highlight the important points and issues surrounding the AHEPP privatization that needed to be threshed out.&nbsp; Moreover, MWSS also admits having participated, along with other agencies and stakeholders, various meetings and conferences relative to the drafting of a Memorandum of Agreement on the Angat Water Protocol.<br><br>As regards the Angat Dam, PSALM emphasizes that MWSS never exercised jurisdiction and control over the said facility.&nbsp; PSALM points out that the Angat Dam was constructed in 1967, or four years before the enactment of Republic Act No. 6234, upon the commissioning thereof by the NPC and the consequent construction by Grogun, Inc., a private corporation.&nbsp; MWSS’ attempt to base its claim of jurisdiction over the Angat Dam upon its characterization of EPIRA as a general law must likewise fail.&nbsp; PSALM explains that EPIRA cannot be classified as a general law as it applies to a particular portion of the State, i.e., the energy sector.&nbsp; The EPIRA must be deemed an exception to the provision in the Revised MWSS Charter on MWSS’s general jurisdiction over waterworks systems.<br><br>PSALM stresses that pursuant to the EPIRA, PSALM took ownership of all existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, IPP contracts, real estate and other disposable assets, which necessarily includes the AHEPP Complex, of which the Angat Dam is part.&nbsp; As to the OGCC opinion cited by MWSS to support its position that control and management of the Angat Dam Complex should be turned over to MWSS, the OGCC had already issued a second opinion dated August 20, 2008 which clarified the tenor of its earlier Opinion No. 107, s. 2008, stating that “the disposal of the [Angat] HEPP by sale through public bidding – the principal mode of disposition under [EPIRA] – remains PSALM’s primary option.”&nbsp; Moreover, as pointed out by the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) in its letter dated September 16, 2009, the ownership and operation of a hydropower plant goes beyond the mandate of MWSS.&nbsp; This view is consistent with the provisions of EPIRA mandating the transfer of ownership and control of NPC generation assets, IPP Contracts, real estate and other disposable assets to a private person or entity.&nbsp; Consequently, a transfer to another government entity of the said NPC assets would be a clear violation of the EPIRA. Even assuming such is allowed by EPIRA, it would not serve the objective of the EPIRA, <i>i.e.</i>, that of liquidating all NPC’s financial obligations and would merely transfer NPC’s debts from the hands of one government entity to another, the funds that would be utilized by MWSS in the acquisition of the AHEPP would doubtless come from the pockets of the Filipino people.<br><br>As regards the opposition of various local government units to the sale of the AHEPP, PSALM said that a forum was held specifically to address their concerns.&nbsp; After the said forum, these LGUs did not anymore raise the same concerns; such inaction on their part could be taken as an acquiescence to, and acceptance of, the explanations made by PSALM during the forum.&nbsp; PSALM had made it clear that it is only the AHEPP and not the Angat Dam which was being privatized. The same wrong premise underpinned the position of the CHR with its erroneous allegation that MWSS is allowed, under its Revised Charter, to operate and maintain a power plant.<br><br>PSALM further contends that the sale of AHEPP to K-Water did not violate the Constitution’s provision on the State’s natural resources and neither is the ruling in <i>Manila Prince Hotel</i> applicable as said case was decided under different factual circumstances.&nbsp; It reiterates that the AHEPP, being a generation asset, can be sold to a foreign entity, under the EPIRA, in accordance with the policy reforms said law introduced in the power sector; the EPIRA aims to enable open access in the electricity market and then enable the government to concentrate more fully on the supply of basic needs to the Filipino people.&nbsp; Owing to the competitive and open nature of the generation sector, foreign corporation may own generation assets.<br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b></center><br>The present controversy raised the following issues:<br><blockquote>1)&nbsp; Legal standing of petitioners;<br>2)&nbsp; Mootness of the petition;<br>3)&nbsp; Violation of the right to information;<br>4)&nbsp; Ownership of the AHEPP;<br>5)&nbsp; Violation of Sec. 2, Art.

But regardless of such qualification of water permit holders/transferees, it is to be noted that there is no provision in the EPIRA itself authorizing the NPC to assign or transfer its water rights in case of transfer of operation and possession of multi-purpose hydropower facilities.&nbsp; Since only the power plant is to be sold and privatized, the operation of the non-power components such as the dam and reservoir, including the maintenance of the surrounding watershed, should remain under the jurisdiction and control of NPC which continue to be a government corporation.&nbsp; There is therefore no necessity for NPC to transfer its permit over the water rights to K-Water.&nbsp; Pursuant to its purchase and operation/management contracts with K-Water, NPC may authorize the latter to use water in the dam to generate electricity.<br><br>NPC’s water rights remain an integral aspect of its jurisdiction and control over the dam and reservoir.&nbsp; That the EPIRA <u>itself</u> did not ordain any transfer of water rights leads us to infer that Congress intended NPC to continue exercising full supervision over the dam, reservoir and, more importantly, to remain in complete control of the extraction or diversion of water from the Angat River.&nbsp; Indeed, there can be no debate that the best means of ensuring that&nbsp; PSALM/NPC can fulfill the duty to prescribe “safeguards to enable the national government to direct water usage to protect potable water, irrigation, and all other requirements imbued with public interest” is for it to retain the water rights over those water resources from where the dam waters are extracted.&nbsp; In this way, the State’s full supervision and control over the country’s water resources is also assured notwithstanding the privatized power generation business.<br><br>Section 6 (a) of the IRR of R.A. No. 9136 insofar as it directs the transfer of water rights in the privatization of multi-purpose hydropower facilities, is thus merely directory.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that the <u>Water Code</u> explicitly provides that Filipino citizens and juridical persons who may apply for water permits should be “duly qualified by law to exploit and develop water resources.” Thus, aside from the grant of authority to construct and operate dams and power plants, NPC’s Revised Charter specifically authorized it –<br><br><blockquote>(f)&nbsp; To take water from any public stream, river, creek, lake, spring or waterfall in the Philippines, for the purposes specified in this Act; to intercept and divert the flow of waters from lands of riparian owners and from persons owning or interested in waters which are or may be necessary for said purposes, upon payment of just compensation therefor; to alter, straighten, obstruct or increase the flow of water in streams or water channels intersecting or connecting therewith or contiguous to its works or any part thereof: <i>Provided</i>, That just compensation shall be paid to any person or persons whose property is, directly or indirectly, adversely affected or damaged thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></blockquote><br>The MWSS is likewise vested with the power to construct, maintain and operate dams and reservoirs for the purpose of supplying water for domestic and other purposes, as well to construct, develop, maintain and operate such artesian wells and springs as may be needed in its operation within its territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> On the other hand, NIA, also a water permit holder in Angat River, is vested with similar authority to utilize water resources, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(b) To investigate all available and possible water resources in the country for the purpose of utilizing the same for irrigation, and to plan, design and construct the necessary projects to make the ten to twenty-year period following the approval of this Act as the Irrigation Age of the Republic of the Philippines;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>(c) To construct multiple-purpose water resources projects designed primarily for irrigation, and secondarily for hydraulic power development and/or other uses such as flood control, drainage, land reclamation, domestic water supply, roads and highway construction and reforestation, among others, provided, that the plans, designs and the construction thereof, shall be undertaken in coordination with the agencies concerned;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></blockquote><br>To reiterate, there is nothing in the EPIRAwhich declares that it is mandatory forPSALM or NPC to transfer or assign NPC’s water rights to buyers of its multi-purpose hydropower facilities as part of the privatization process.&nbsp; While PSALM was mandated to transfer the ownership of all hydropower plants except those mentioned in Sec. 47 (f), any transfer of possession, operation and control of the multi-purpose hydropower facilities, the intent to preserve water resources under the full supervision and control of the State is evident when PSALM was obligated to prescribe safeguards to enable the national government to direct water usage to domestic and other requirements “imbued with public interest.”&nbsp; There is no express requirement for the transfer of water rights in all cases where the operation of hydropower facilities in a multi-purpose dam complex is turned over to the private sector.<br><br>As the new owner of the AHEPP, K-Water will have to utilize the waters in the Angat Dam for hydropower generation.&nbsp; Consistent with the goals of the EPIRA, private entities are allowed to undertake power generation activities and acquire NPC’s generation assets.&nbsp; But since only the hydroelectric power plants and appurtenances are being sold, the privatization scheme should enable the buyer of a hydroelectric power plant in NPC’s multi-purpose dam complex to have beneficialuse of the waters diverted or collected in the Angat Dam for its hydropower generation activities, and at the same time ensure that the NPC retains full supervision and control over the extraction and diversion of waters from the Angat River.<br><br>In fine, the Court rules that while the sale of AHEPP to a foreign corporation pursuant to the privatization mandated by the EPIRA did not violate Sec. 2, Art. XII of the <u>1987 Constitution</u> which limits the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources under the full supervision and control of the State or the State’s undertaking the same through joint venture, co-production or production sharing agreements with Filipino corporations 60% of the capital of which is owned by Filipino citizens, the stipulation in the Asset Purchase Agreement and Operations and Maintenance Agreement whereby NPC consents to the transfer of water rights to the foreign buyer, K-Water, contravenes the aforesaid constitutional provision and the <u>Water Code.</u><br><br>Section 6, Rule 23 of the IRR of EPIRA, insofar as it ordered NPC’s water rights in multi-purpose hydropower facilities to be included in the sale thereof, is declared as merely directoryand not an absolute condition in the privatization scheme.&nbsp; In this case, we hold that NPC shall continue to be the holder of the water permit even as the operational control and day-to-day management of the AHEPP is turned over to K-Water under the terms and conditions of their APA and O &amp; M Agreement, whereby NPC grants authority to K-Water to utilize the waters diverted or collected in the Angat Dam for hydropower generation. Further, NPC and K-Water shall faithfully comply with the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Agreement on Water Protocol, as well as with such other regulations and issuances of the NWRB governing water rights and water usage.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present petition for certiorari and prohibition with prayer for injunctive relief/s is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.<br><br>The following <b>DISPOSITIONS</b> are in <b>ORDER</b>:<br><br>1) The bidding conducted and the Notice of Award issued by PSALM in favor of the winning bidder, KOREA WATER RESOURCES CORPORATION (K-WATER), are declared <b>VALID and LEGAL</b>;<br><br>2)&nbsp; PSALM is directed to <b>FURNISH</b> the petitioners with copies of all documents and records in its files pertaining to K-Water;<br><br>3) Section 6 (a), Rule 23, IRR of the EPIRA, is hereby declared as merely <b>DIRECTORY</b>, and not an absolute condition in all cases where NPC-owned hydropower generation facilities are privatized;<br><br>4) NPC shall <b>CONTINUE</b> to be the <b>HOLDER</b> of Water Permit No. 6512 issued by the National Water Resources Board.&nbsp; NPC shall authorize K-Water to utilize the waters in the Angat Dam for hydropower generation, subject to the NWRB’s rules and regulations governing water right and usage.

The first agreement, denominated as Asset Purchase Agreement (APA), covers AHEPP, while the second, the Operation and Maintenance Agreement (O &amp; M), covers the non-power components of AHEPP, including Angat Dam.&nbsp; PSALM entered into the said agreements pursuant to its mandate under Republic Act No. (RA) 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA) to privatize the assets of National Power Corporation (NPC).<br><br>Petitioners question the validity of the said agreements for being repugnant to the 1987 Constitution, specifically Sec. 2, Art. XII thereof, Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1067 or the Water Code of the Philippines (Water Code), and the EPIRA. They allege that PSALM acted with grave abuse of discretion when it allowed K-Water, a corporate entity wholly owned by the Republic of Korea, to participate in the bidding process, and thereafter declaring it the winning bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>I submit that the two Agreements themselves are, in their entirety, null and void for infringing the ownership and nationality limitations in Sec. 2, Art. XII of the 1987 Constitution, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. All lands of the public domain, <b><u>waters</u></b>, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, <b><u>and other natural resources are owned by the State</u></b>. With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated. <b><u>The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State.</u></b> The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements <b><u>with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens</u></b>. Such agreements may be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and under such terms and conditions as may be provided by law. In cases of water rights for irrigation, water supply fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of water power, beneficial use may be the measure and limit of the grant.” (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The Agreements fall squarely within the ambit of the aforequoted constitutional provision, and are, thus, properly subject to the nationality restriction provided therein.<br><br>K-Water, being a wholly foreign-owned corporation, is disqualified from engaging in activities involving the exploration, development, and utilization of water and natural resources belonging to the state. Necessarily, it is barred from operating Angat Dam, a structure indispensable in ensuring water security in Metro Manila. PSALM, therefore, committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it allowed K-Water to participate in the bidding out of properties that will directly extract and utilize natural resources of the Philippines.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>On June 8, 2001, RA 9136 or the EPIRA was passed into law.

PSALM, however, in its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> admitted that K-Water is a Korean state-owned corporation.<br><br>In the instant petition, petitioners assert that the sale of AHEPP is imbued with public interest, 97% of the water supply of Metro Manila&nbsp; sourced as it were directly from Angat Dam. They argue that the physical control and management of Angat Dam, as well as the security of the water supply, are matters of transcendental interest to them as residents of Metro Manila. In spite of this, petitioners claim, PSALM kept the bidding process largely confidential, and information over such process withheld from the public. Further, they maintain that the bidding process for AHEPP undermined the elements of the right to water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Lastly, they argue that PSALM, in grave abuse of its discretion, overstepped the Constitution and the Water Code in allowing foreign-owned corporation, K-Water, to participate in the bidding, and later favoring it with a Notice of Award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> They, thus, urge the nullification of the same, and the enjoinment of the privatization of AHEPP.<br><br>On May 24, 2010, this Court issued a <i>Status Quo Ante </i>Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> directing the parties and all concerned to maintain the <i>status quo</i> prevailing before the filing of the petition, until further orders from the Court.<br><br>Respondents Trans-Asia, DMCI, SN Aboitiz, and SMC forthwith filed their respective Comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> all averring that they are merely nominal parties to the petition, and thus are not real parties-in-interest.<br><br>In its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated June 17, 2010, respondent NIA disclaimed involvement in the bidding conducted by PSALM concerning AHEPP, adding that its interest is “only limited to the protection of its water allocation drawn from the Angat Dam as determined by the National Water Resources Board (NWRB).”<br><br>In its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated June 22, 2010, respondent PSALM stressed its compliance with the relevant laws and the Constitution in conducting the bidding process for AHEPP, describing the process as open and transparent manner, and with full respect to the limitations set forth in the Constitution. It further alleged that contrary to the petitioners’ posture, the agreements will have no effect on the right to water, as they do not involve the sale of Angat Dam itself.<br><br>On the procedural aspect, PSALM claimed that the petitioners have no standing to file the petition, and that a petition for certiorari is not the proper remedy, PSALM not exercising discretionary powers. Further, they take the view that the controversy has been rendered moot and academic by the issuance of a Notice of Award. In any case, they added, the petition poses a political question over which the Court has no jurisdiction.<br><br>Vis-à-vis the AHEPP and Angat Dam, PSALM argued that it is the sole owner of the two facilities, by virtue of the transfer of ownership from NPC under Sec. 49 of the EPIRA. Neither MWSS nor NIA, it said, was a co-owner of the said structures. Further, transfer of ownership of AHEPP to MWSS or NIA would not be in accordance with the law, since the respective charters of MWSS and NIA do not have provisions for their operating a hydro-power facility like AHEPP.<br><br>Finally, PSALM, citing DOJ Opinions to the effect that there is no constitutional barrier to the operation of a power plant by a foreign entity, would assert that the award of the AHEPP to K-Water&nbsp; is in accordance with the law, since AHEPP, as a generation asset, may be sold to a foreign entity.<br><br>Respondent First Gen, in its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated June 23, 2010, supported the position of PSALM with respect to the AHEPP being subject to privatization under the terms of the EPIRA. AHEPP, it concurred, is merely one facility in the Angat Complex, exclusively owned and operated by NPC. Further, it claimed that the watershed is under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of NPC, pursuant to Executive Order No. (EO) 258,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. NPC’s jurisdiction and control over the Angat Watershed Reservation is hereby restored. Accordingly, NPC shall be responsible for its management, protection, development and rehabilitation in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 3(n) of Republic Act No. 6359, as amended, Sec. 2 of Executive Order No. 224 and the preceding Section.</blockquote>For its part, respondent MWSS, in its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of July 19, 2010, stated that AHEPP is not like any other hydro-electric power plant, because while its power contribution to the Luzon grid is negligible, its water supply to the commercial and domestic needs of the clientele of MWSS is incontestable and indispensable. Pushing this point, MWSS would argue that the case is really about the virtual surrender of the control and operation of the Angat Dam and Reservoir to a foreign country, thereby impinging on the water supply of twelve million Filipinos.<br><br>Respondent MWSS further asserted that, by statutory mandate, part of the waterworks that are within its jurisdiction and under its control and supervision <i>ipso jure </i>are the Angat Dam, Dykes and Reservoir. This is by virtue of Sections 1 and 3 of the MWSS Charter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which vests MWSS with the powers of control, supervision, and regulation of the use of all waterworks systems, including dams, reservoirs, and other waterworks for the purpose of supplying water to inhabitants of its territory. It claimed that in the exercise of its jurisdiction over Angat Dam, it even incurred expenses for its upkeep and maintenance.<br><br>MWSS related that upon the passage of EPIRA, it wrote PSALM informing the latter of its desire to acquire ownership or control, upon payment of just compensation, over AHEPP. In this regard, MWSS draws attention to the support it got for its desire from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and various local government units.<br><br>In 2006, PSALM also acknowledged the need to come up with effective strategies for the implementation of the privatization of AHEPP. MWSS and PSALM thereafter engaged in several discussions over AHEPP and the control and management of AHEPP and Angat Dam. A draft of the Angat Water Protocol was made between MWSS, PSALM, NIA, NPC, and NWRB. However, only MWSS and NIA signed the draft protocol.<br><br>MWSS then went on to argue that due to the non-signing of the Water Protocol, respondent PSALM failed to provide safeguards to protect potable water, irrigation, and all other requirements imbued with public interest, in violation of the EPIRA. It then went on to say that the sale of AHEPP to a foreign corporation violates the Constitution. It said that the waters of the Angat River that propel the AHEPP to supply water and irrigation and generate power form part of the National Patrimony. It added that K-Water would probably simply consider AHEPP as another business opportunity, contrary to the role that the Angat Dam Complex plays in the life of the Filipino people. Thus, MWSS prayed for the granting of the petition, and in the alternative, to order PSALM to turn over control and management of AHEPP to MWSS.<br><br>Meanwhile, respondent K-Water filed a Manifestation in lieu of Comment, wherein it averred that it merely relied on the mandate and expertise of PSALM in conducting the bidding process for the privatization of AHEPP. It stated that in participating with the bidding process, it was guided at all times by the Constitution and the laws of the Philippines.<br><br>Petitioners, in their Consolidated Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated October 29, 2010, traversed in some detail respondent PSALM’s allegations and supportive arguments on the issues of legal standing, mootness of the petition, and on whether a political question is posed in the controversy. On the matter of mootness, they claimed that the issuance of a Notice of Award does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> render the case moot, as it is not the final step for the privatization of AHEPP. On the claim that the controversy constitutes a political question, they replied that they have amply argued that PSALM’s exercise of power is limited by the Constitution, the EPIRA, other laws, as well as binding norms of international law. Thus, its acts in conducting the bidding process fall within the expanded jurisdiction of this Court. On the matter of standing, they claimed to have sufficient personality as the issue involves a public right. Moreover, they invoked the transcendental importance doctrine and the rule on liberality when it comes to public rights.<br><br>And on the matter of how PSALM conducted the bidding, the petitioners reiterated their contention that PSALM ran roughshod over the public’s right to be informed of the bidding process, the terms and conditions of the privatization, the bidding procedures, minimum price, and other similar information. They related that Initiatives for Dialogue and Empowerment through Alternative Legal Services, Inc.’s (IDEAL’s) request for information on the winning bidder was unheeded, with PSALM merely referring the matter to the counsel of K-Water for appropriate action.<br><br>On the matter of water rights, they related that the provisions of the APA itself negate PSALM’s contention that it is erroneous to conclude that water rights will be necessarily transferred to respondent K-Water as a result of the AHEPP. They claimed that this is a wanton disregard of the provisions of the Water Code.<br><br>While conceding that Angat Dam is not being sold, petitioners nonetheless maintain that, by the terms of the Agreements in question, the control over Angat Dam, among other non-power components will also be given to the buyer. This, taken with the fact that the Water Protocol continues to be unsigned, the petitioners argue, leads to no other conclusion except PSALM’s failure to provide safeguards to ensure adequate water supply coming from Angat Dam. This, they claimed, would result in the winning K-Water having complete control over the entire Angat Dam Complex.<br><br>As a counterpoint, particularly to the allegations of MWSS in its Comment, respondent PSALM, in its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> stated that the non-signing of the Water Protocol was merely due to its observance of this Court’s <i>Status Quo Ante</i> Order. It claimed that MWSS admitted participating, along with various stakeholders, in the discussions over AHEPP, through the various meetings and correspondences held relative to the drafting of the Memorandum of Agreement on the Angat Water Protocol.<br><br>On the issue of jurisdiction over Angat Dam, PSALM replied that MWSS never exercised control and jurisdiction over Angat Dam. The arguments of MWSS, so PSALM claims, are based on the faulty characterization of EPIRA as a general law and the MWSS Charter as a special law.<br><br>Further, PSALM stressed that its mandate under the EPIRA is to privatize the assets of NPC, <i>i.e.,</i> to transfer ownership and control thereof to a private person or entity, not to another government entity.<br><br>PSALM also reiterated that AHEPP may be sold to a foreign entity, in accordance with the policy reforms espoused by EPIRA, i.e., to enable open access in the electricity market and then enable the government to concentrate more fully on the supply of basic needs of the people. Even assuming that the transfer of AHEPP to MWSS is allowed under EPIRA, the same would not serve the objective of EPIRA of liquidating all of the financial obligations of NPC.<br><br><blockquote><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br><center>1.<br></center>WHETHER THE PETITIONERS AVAILED OF THE PROPER REMEDY BY FILING THIS PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i> AND PROHIBITION.<br><br><center>2.<br></center>WHETHER THE PETITION HAS BEEN RENDERED MOOT AND ACADEMIC BY THE ISSUANCE OF A NOTICE OF AWARD IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENT K-WATER ON MAY 5, 2010<br><br><center>3.<br></center>WHETHER THE PETITION INVOLVES A POLITICAL QUESTION<br><br><center>4.<br></center>WHETHER THE PETITIONERS HAVE LEGAL STANDING TO FILE THE INSTANT PETITION<br><br><center>5.<br></center>WHETHER THE PETITIONER’S RIGHT TO INFORMATION HAS BEEN VIOLATED BY THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT PSALM<br><br><center>6.<br></center>WHETHER PETITIONER ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT UNDERTOOK THE PRIVATIZATION OF AHEPP<br><br><center>7.<br></center>WHETHER THE PUBLIC RESPONDENT PSALM ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT ALLOWED K-WATER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE BIDDING FOR AHEPP, AND LATER AWARDED K-WATER AS THE HIGHEST BIDDER</blockquote><br><center><b>Discussion</b><br></center><br><b>First Issue:<br>Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition as the Proper Remedy</b><br><br>The Court’s jurisdiction over questions of grave abuse of discretion finds expression in Art. VIII, Sec. 1 of the&nbsp; Constitution vesting the Court&nbsp; the power to “determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.” This expanded power of judicial review allows the Court to review acts of other branches of the government, to determine whether such acts are committed with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion generally refers to:<br><br><blockquote>capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br>However, not all errors in exercise of judgment amount to grave abuse of discretion. The transgression, jurisprudence teaches, must be “so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the case before Us, the petitioners allege that respondent PSALM exceeded its jurisdiction when it allowed K-Water to participate in the bidding for the privatization of AHEPP, and later awarded the contract to it. In its exercise of its mandate under the EPIRA, PSALM exercises not only ministerial, but also discretionary powers. The EPIRA merely provides that the privatization be done “in an open and transparent manner through public bidding,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> suggesting that it is up to PSALM to decide the specific manner and method in conducting the bidding process.<br><br>In determining the terms of reference of the public bidding to be conducted, as well as in determining the qualifications of the respective bidders, respondent PSALM exercises discretionary, not ministerial, powers. Corollarily, when it allowed K-Water to participate in the bidding, and when it eventually awarded the contract to K-Water as the highest bidder, PSALM was engaged not in ministerial functions, but was actually exercising its discretionary powers.<br><br>Hence, as a government agency discharging official functions, its actions are subject to judicial review by this Court, as expressly provided under Art. VIII, Sec. 1, par. 2 of the Constitution.<br><br>This Court’s jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 is concurrent with Regional Trial Courts. This jurisdiction arrangement calls for the application of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, such that this Court generally will not entertain petitions filed directly before it. However, direct recourse to this Court may be allowed in certain situations. As We said in <i>Chavez v. National Housing Authority (NHA)</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[S]uch resort may be allowed in certain situations, wherein this Court ruled that petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, though cognizable by other courts, may directly be filed with us if the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts or where exceptions compelling circumstances justify availment of a remedy within and calling for the exercise of this Court’s primary jurisdiction. (citation omitted)</blockquote><br>As in <i>Chavez</i>, herein petitioners have made serious constitutional challenges not only with respect to the constitutional provision on exploitation, development, and utilization of natural resources, but also the primordial right of the people to access to clean water. The matter concerning Angat Dam and its impact on the water supply to the entire Metro Manila area and neighboring cities and provinces, involving a huge number of people has, to be sure, far-reaching consequences. These imperatives merit direct consideration by this Court, and compel us, as now, to turn a blind eye to the judicial structure, like that envisioned in the hierarchy of courts rule, “meant to provide an orderly dispensation of justice and consider the instant petition as a justified deviation from an established precept.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>Second Issue:<br>Mootness of the Petition</b><br><br>PSALM maintains that the petition no longer presents an actual justiciable controversy due to the mootness of the issues presented in the petition, for, as claimed, the petitioners are seeking to enjoin the performance of an act that it has already performed, i.e., that of the issuance of a Notice of Award to the highest winning bidder in the public bidding for AHEPP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>PSALM’s contention on mootness cannot be sustained. What the petitioners seek in this recourse is to enjoin the privatization of AHEPP altogether, arguing that it runs counter to the nationality limitation in the Constitution. Moreover, they claim that the issues raised would have consequences to their primordial right to access to clean water. And, as the petitioners aptly argued, the Notice of Award itself is not the final act in the privatization of AHEPP. Also telling is the fact that the water protocol has yet to be finalized. In short, all the acts that, for all intents and purposes, would bring about the privatization of AHEPP have yet to ensue.<br><br>Even assuming that the Notice of Award finalizes the privatization of AHEPP, this Court will not shirk from its duty to prevent the execution of a contract award violative of the Constitution. This Court can still enjoin, if it must, the transfer of ownership of AHEPP if such transfer is repugnant to the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. As We said in Chavez: “it becomes more compelling for the Court to resolve the issue to ensure the government itself does not violate a provision of the Constitution intended to safeguard the national patrimony. Supervening events, whether intended or accidental, cannot prevent the Court from rendering a decision if there is a grave violation of the Constitution.”<br><br><b>Third Issue:<br>Application of the Political Question Doctrine</b><br><br>Political questions, as defined in <i>Tañada v. Cuenco,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> refer to:<br><br><blockquote>those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity, or in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislature or the executive branch of the Government.<br></blockquote><br>Simply put, the political question doctrine applies when the question calls for a ruling on the wisdom, and not the legality, of a particular governmental act or issuance.<br><br>The political question doctrine has no application in the case here. In the privatization of AHEPP, PSALM’s discretion is circumscribed not only by the provisions of EPIRA and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), but also by pertinent laws that are consequential and relevant to its mandate of privatizing the power generation assets of NPC. Needless to stress, PSALM is duty bound to abide by the parameters set by the Constitution. In case it violates any existing law or the Constitution, it cannot hide behind the mantle of the political question doctrine, because such violation inevitably calls for the exercise of judicial review by this Court.<br><br>This is the very question the petitioners pose. They allege that in the process of pursuing its mandate under EPIRA, PSALM transgressed the Constitution, particularly when it failed to observe the petitioners’ right to information, and when it allowed a foreign corporation to utilize the natural resources of the Philippines.<br><br>Respondent PSALM’s contention that the petition partakes of the nature of a collateral attack on EPIRA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> is misplaced. Petitioners’ challenge is not directed, as it were, against the wisdom of or the inherent infirmity of the EPIRA, but the legality of PSALM’s acts, which, to the petitioners, violate their paramount constitutional rights.&nbsp; This falls squarely within the expanded jurisdiction of this Court.<br><br>At any rate, political questions, without more, are now cognizable by the Court under its expanded judicial review power. The Court said so in <i>Osmeña v. COMELEC</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We would still not be precluded from resolving it under the expanded jurisdiction conferred upon us that now covers in proper cases even political questions (<i>Daza v. Singson, 180 SCRA 496</i>), provided naturally, that the question is not solely and exclusively political (as when the Executive extends recognition to a foreign government) but one which really necessitates a forthright determination of constitutionality, involving as it does a question of national importance.</blockquote><br><b>Fourth Issue:<br>Legal Standing of Petitioners</b><br><br>The petitioners have sufficient <i>locus standi</i> to file the instant petition.<br><br>The petitioners raise questions relating to two different provisions of the Constitution, to wit: (1) the right to information on matters of public concern<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and (2) the limitation on the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources to Filipino citizens and corporations and associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the first constitutional question, the petition urges the Court to compel PSALM to disclose publicly the details and records of the Agreements with K-Water. On the second issue, the petition seeks to declare the Agreements as unconstitutional, for violating the constitutional limitation that only Filipino citizens and Filipino corporations may engage in the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources.<br><br>Where the issue revolves around the people’s right to information, the requisite legal standing is met by the mere fact that the petitioner is a citizen. The Court said as much in <i>Akbayan Citizens Action Party v. Aquino</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In a petition anchored upon the right of the people to information on matters of public concern, which is a public right by its very nature, petitioners need not show that they have any legal or special interest in the result, <b>it being sufficient to show that they are citizens and, therefore, part of the general public which possesses the right</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>Of the same tenor is the Court’s pronouncement in <i>Guingona, Jr. v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> “[I]f the petition is anchored on the people’s right to information on matters of public concern, any citizen can be a real party in interest.”<br><br>Here, the members of the petitioner-organizations are Filipino citizens. In view of the relevant jurisprudence on the matter, that fact alone is sufficient to confer upon them legal personality to file this case to assert their right to information on matters of public concern.<br><br>On the second constitutional question, on the constitutional limitation on the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources, the rule on <i>locus standi</i> is not sufficiently overcome by the mere fact that the petitioners are citizens. The general rule applies and the petition must show that the party filing has a “personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> As stated in <i>Telecommunications and Broadcast Attorneys of the Philippines, Inc., v. COMELEC,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> “there must be a showing that the citizen personally suffered some actual or threatened injury arising from the alleged illegal official act.” Thus, petitioners here technically lack the requisite legal standing to file the petition as taxpayers, as they have no direct and personal interest in the controversy.<br><br>The above notwithstanding, the petitioners have sufficiently crafted an issue involving matters of transcendental importance to the public. Thus, the technical procedural rules on <i>locus standi</i> may be set aside to allow this Court to make a pronouncement on the issue. We have held before that the Court:<br><br><blockquote>has discretion to take cognizance of a suit which does not satisfy the requirement of legal standing when paramount interest is involved. In not a few cases, the Court has adopted a liberal attitude on the <i>locus standi </i>of a petitioner where the petitioner is able to craft an issue of transcendental significance to the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>Here, the interest of the petitioners is inchoate in that neither they as organizations nor their respective members will suffer any direct injury in the allowing of a foreign corporation to utilize Philippine water resources. As residents of Metro Manila, the consequences of the privatization of AHEPP will have an impact on the petitioners, albeit not the direct injury contemplated by law.<br><br>The issues they have raised, including the effect of the Agreements on water security in Metro Manila, and the significance of Angat Dam as part of the Angat-Ipo-La Mesa system, is, however, a matter of transcendental importance. Hence, the technical rules on standing may be brushed aside, and enable this Court to exercise judicial review.<br><br><b>Fifth Issue:<br>Alleged Violation of Petitioners’ Right to Information</b><br><br>Petitioners fault PSALM for failing to provide them with information on the details of the transaction that PSALM was entering into, in breach of their constitutional right to information regarding matters of public concern.&nbsp; In particular, petitioners rue that the Invitation to Bid published by PSALM did not specify crucial information related to the sale of the water facility, including the terms and conditions of the disposition, the qualification of bidders, the minimum price, and other basic details.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> They allege that PSALM should have publicly disclosed such crucial information on the privatization of AHEPP, pursuant to its legal obligation to conduct the bidding in an open and transparent manner.<br><br>As a counter-argument, PSALM states that it had discharged its duty of disclosure when it publicly disseminated information regarding the privatization of AHEPP, effected&nbsp; not only through the publication of the Invitation to Bid, but right “from the very start of the disposition process.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> First, PSALM points out, it wrote the Regional Director of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), informing him of the planned disposition of AHEPP, and inviting him to a meeting to discuss matters related to the concerns of indigenous peoples in the area. Then, it conducted a forum in a hotel, with various stakeholders in attendance, “to provide them an opportunity to share relevant information and to thoroughly discuss the structure and pertinent provisions of the sale.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Third, it also published the relevant information on its website, in the form of press releases.<br><br>On April 20, 2010, the petitioners sent a letter to respondent PSALM requesting certain documents and information relating to the privatization of AHEPP. This request was denied, however, allegedly due to a violation of the bidding procedures. In its letter dated April 30, 2010, PSALM stated that it can only release such documents to persons and entities which submitted a Letter of Interest, paid the participation fee, and executed a Confidentiality Agreement and Undertaking.<br><br>On May 14, 2010, the petitioners sent a second letter specifically requesting for detailed information on the winning bidder, including its company profile, contact person or responsible officer, office address and Philippine registration. PSALM replied, in a letter dated May 19, 2010, that the petitioner’s request has been referred to the counsel of K-Water.<br><br>The people’s right to information is based on Art. III, Sec. 7 of the Constitution, which states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 7. The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents, and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.</blockquote><br>The policy of public disclosure and transparency of governmental transactions involving public interest enunciated in Art. II, Sec. 28 of the Constitution complements the right of the people to information:<br><br><blockquote>Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest.</blockquote><br>The purpose of these two constitutional provisions, as we observed in <i>Chavez v. Public Estates Authority</i>, is:<br><br><blockquote>to promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights. These twin provisions are essential to the exercise of freedom of expression. x x x Armed with the right information, citizens can participate in public discussions leading to the formulation of government policies and their effective implementation. An informed citizenry is essential to the existence and proper functioning of any democracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote><br>This right to information, however, is not without limitation. Fr. Joaquin Bernas S.J. notes that the two sentences of Section 7 guarantee only one general right, the right to information on matters of public concern. The right to access official records merely implements the right to information. Thus, regulatory discretion must include both authority to determine what matters are of public concern and authority to determine the manner of access to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>We have sufficiently elucidated the matter of right to information in Chavez, where We said:<br><br><blockquote>We must first distinguish between information the law on public bidding requires PEA to disclose publicly, and information the constitutional right to information requires PEA to release to the public. <b>Before the consummation of the contract, PEA must, on its own and without demand from anyone, disclose to the public matters relating to the disposition of its property.&nbsp; These include the size, location, technical description and nature of the property being disposed of, the terms and conditions of the disposition, the parties qualified to bid, the minimum price and similar information.</b> PEA must prepare all these data and disclose them to the public at the start of the disposition process, long before the consummation of the contract, because the Government Auditing Code requires public bidding.&nbsp; <b>If PEA fails to make this disclosure, any citizen can demand from PEA this information at any time during the bidding process.</b><br><br><b>Information, however, on on-going evaluation or review of bids or proposals being undertaken by the bidding or review committee is not immediately accessible under the right to information.</b> While the evaluation or review is still on-going, there are no “official acts, transactions, or decisions” on the bids or proposals.&nbsp; However, once the committee makes its official recommendation, there arises a “definite proposition” on the part of the government.&nbsp; From this moment, the public’s right to information attaches, and any citizen can access all the non-proprietary information leading to such definite proposition.&nbsp; In <i>Chavez v. PCGG</i>, the Court ruled as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">“Considering the intent of the framers of the Constitution, we believe that it is incumbent upon the PCGG and its officers, as well as other government representatives, to disclose sufficient public information on any proposed settlement they have decided to take up with the ostensible owners and holders of ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; Such information, though, must pertain to definite propositions of the government, not necessarily to intra-agency or inter-agency recommendations or communications during the stage when common assertions are still in the process of being formulated or are in the “exploratory” stage. There is need, of course, to observe the same restrictions on disclosure of information in general, as discussed earlier – such as on matters involving national security, diplomatic or foreign relations, intelligence and other classified information.”&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></div><br><b>The right covers three categories of information which are “matters of public concern,” namely: (1) official records; (2) documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions and decisions; and (3) government research data used in formulating policies</b>.&nbsp; The first category refers to any document that is part of the public records in the custody of government agencies or officials.&nbsp; The second category refers to documents and papers recording, evidencing, establishing, confirming, supporting, justifying or explaining official acts, transactions or decisions of government agencies or officials.&nbsp; The third category refers to research data, whether raw, collated or processed, owned by the government and used in formulating government policies.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We rule, therefore, that <b>the constitutional right to information includes official information on on-going negotiations before a final contract</b>.&nbsp; The information, however, must constitute definite propositions by the government and should not cover recognized exceptions like privileged information, military and diplomatic secrets and similar matters affecting national security and public order. Congress has also prescribed other limitations on the right to information in several legislations. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><br>We further explored the matter of right to information in <i>Chavez v. NHA,</i> where We ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [G]overnment agencies, without need of demand from anyone, must bring into public view all the steps and negotiations leading to the consummation of the transaction and the contents of the perfected contract. Such information must pertain to "definite propositions of the government," meaning official recommendations or final positions reached on the different matters subject of negotiation. The government agency, however, need not disclose "intra-agency or inter-agency recommendations or communications during the stage when common assertions are still in the process of being formulated or are in the exploratory stage." The limitation also covers privileged communication like information on military and diplomatic secrets; information affecting national security; information on investigations of crimes by law enforcement agencies before the prosecution of the accused; information on foreign relations, intelligence, and other classified information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>Even without any demand from anyone then, it behooved PSALM to publicly disclose, information regarding the disposition of AHEPP. Here, PSALM routinely published news and updates on the sale of AHEPP on its website.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It also organized several forums where various stakeholders were apprised of the procedure to be implemented in the privatization of AHEPP. As there is yet no sufficient enabling law to provide the specific requirements in the discharge of its duty under the Constitution, these unilateral actions from PSALM must be construed to be a sufficient compliance of its duty under the Constitution. As We observed in <i>Chavez v. NHA</i>:<br><br><blockquote>It is unfortunate, however, that after almost twenty (20) years from birth of the 1987 Constitution, there is still no enabling law that provides the mechanics for the compulsory duty of government agencies to disclose information on government transactions. Hopefully, the desired enabling law will finally see the light of day if and when Congress decides to approve the proposed “Freedom of Access to Information Act.”<span style="font-weight: bold;"> In the meantime, it would suffice that government agencies post on their bulletin boards the documents incorporating the information on the steps and negotiations that produced the agreements and the agreements themselves, and if finances permit, to upload said information on their respective websites for easy access by interested parties.</span> Without any law or regulation governing the right to disclose information, the NHA or any of the respondents cannot be faulted if they were not able to disclose information relative to the SMDRP to the public in general.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br><br>It must be noted however, that aside from its duty to disclose material information regarding the sale of AHEPP, which, We hold, it had sufficiently discharged when it regularly published updates on its website, PSALM further has the duty to <i>allow</i> access to information on matters of public concern. This burden requires a demand or request from a member of the public, to which the right properly belongs. “The gateway to information opens to the public the following: (1) official records; (2) documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions; and (3) government research data used as a basis for policy development.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>When petitioners’ wrote PSALM a letter of April 20, 2010 requesting certain documents and information relating to the privatization of AHEPP but was denied, PSALM veritably violated the petitioners’ right to information.&nbsp; It should have permitted access to the specific documents containing the desired information, in light of the disclosure of the same information thus made in its website. The documents referred to are neither confidential nor privileged in nature, as the gist thereof had already been published in the news bulletins in the website of PSALM, and as such, access thereto must be granted to the petitioner. On the contrary, the documents requested partake of the nature of official information.<br><br>The Court also takes stock of the fact that on May 14, 2010, petitioners requested via another letter specifically requesting detailed information on the winning bidder, including its company profile, contact person or responsible officer, office address and Philippine registration. By way of reply, PSALM informed the petitioners that their request has been referred to the counsel of K-Water.<br><br>PSALM’s reply to the petitioners’ adverted second letter is insufficient to discharge its duty under the Constitution. The reply is evasive, at best. At that stage of the bidding process, PSALM already had possession of and can provide, if so minded, the information requested. As such, there was hardly any need to refer the request to K-Water.<br><br>Given the above perspective, the petitioners must be granted relief by granting them access to such documents and papers relating to the disposition of AHEPP, provided the accommodation is limited to official documents and official acts and transactions.<br><br><b>Sixth Issue:<br>The Legality of the Privatization of AHEPP</b><br><br>The mandate of PSALM under EPIRA is clear––privatization sale of NPC generation assets, real estate, and other disposable assets. Toward the accomplishment of this mandate, EPIRA has vested the PSALM with the following powers:<br><br><blockquote>(a) To formulate and implement a program for the sale and privatization of the NPC assets and IPP contracts and the liquidation of NPC debts and stranded contract costs, such liquidation to be completed within the Corporation’s term of existence;<br><br>(b) To take title to and possession of, administer and conserve the assets and IPP contracts transferred to it; to sell or dispose of the same at such price and under such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary or proper, subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(i) To own, hold, acquire, or lease real and personal properties as may be necessary or required in the discharge of its functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote><br>PSALM, as may be noted, was not empowered under the EPIRA to determine which NPC assets are to be privatized. The law merely authorized PSALM to decide upon the specific program to utilize in the disposition of NPC assets, and not the power to determine the coverage of the privatization. The EPIRA itself had laid down which particular assets are to be privatized, and which are not. Sec. 47 thereof provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 47. NPC Privatization. - <b>Except for the assets of SPUG, the generating assets, real estate, and other disposable assets as well as generation contracts of NPC shall be privatized in accordance with this Act.</b> Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, the PSALM Corp. shall submit a plan for the endorsement by the Joint Congressional Power Commission and the approval of the President of the Philippines, on the total privatization of the generation assets, real estate, other disposable assets as well as existing generation contracts of NPC and thereafter, implement the same, in accordance with the following guidelines, except as provided for in paragraph (e) herein:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br><br>(f) The <b>Agus and the Pulangui complexes in Mindanao shall be excluded from among the generating companies that will be initially privatized</b>. Their ownership shall be transferred to the PSALM Corp. and both shall continue to be operated by NPC. In case of privatization, said complexes may be privatized not earlier than ten (10) years from the effectivity of this Act, and, until privatized, shall not be subject to Build-Operate-Transfer (B-O-T), Build-Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer (B-R-O-T) and other variations pursuant to Republic Act No. 6957, as amended by Republic Act No. 7718. The <b>privatization of Agus and Pulangui complexes shall be left to the discretion of PSALM Corp. in consultation with Congress</b>;<br><br>x x x x<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(g) The ownership of the Caliraya-Botokan-Kalayaan (CBK) pump storage complex shall be transferred to the PSALM Corporation and shall continue to be operated by NPC.</div></blockquote><br>It is clear from the aforequoted provision that the intention of EPIRA is to include in the privatization program all generating assets, real estate, and other disposable assets of NPC, save those specifically excluded under the same Act.&nbsp; By express provision, only three facilities are excepted from privatization, viz.: Agus and Pulangui Complexes, and the Caliraya-Botokan-Kalayaan pump storage complex, and the assets of the Small Power Utilities Group (SPUG). Nowhere in EPIRA is the AHEPP mentioned as part of the excluded properties. It can, thus, be inferred that the legislative intent is to include AHEPP in the privatization scheme that PSALM will implement. <i>Expresio unius est exclusio alterius</i>.<br><br>PSALM is correct in arguing, therefore, that in privatizing AHEPP, it did no more than to perform its mandate under EPIRA. PSALM is also correct in its position that the respective charters of MWSS and NIA do not grant either of them the power to operate a power plant. It is clear that under the EPIRA, the fate of AHEPP is that of being privatized––PSALM neither has discretion to exclude the property from privatization, nor choose to abandon its duty to dispose of them through public bidding. Thus, PSALM committed no grave abuse of discretion in its decision to privatize AHEPP, and in its subsequent acts toward that end.<br><br>Petitioners’ prayer to enjoin the privatization sale of AHEPP must therefore, fail. The provisions of EPIRA are determinative of the matter, and where the EPIRA provides that the assets of NPC must be privatized, then the command of the law must reign supreme. This Court must uphold the letter and the spirit of EPIRA, even in light of petitioners’ argument on the possible repercussions of the privatization of AHEPP.<br><br><b>Seventh Issue:<br>The Validity of the APA and O&amp;M agreements</b><br><br>This brings Us to the substantive issue of the case.

XIII that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. All agricultural, timber, and mineral lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, <b><u>and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the State</u></b> x x x (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>That this doctrine was enshrined in the Constitution was merely a means to an end, as “state ownership of natural resources was seen as a necessary starting point to secure recognition of the state’s power to control their disposition, exploitation, development, or utilization.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In<i> Miners Association of the Philippines, Inc. v.

The recognition of the importance of the country's natural resources was expressed as early as the 1984 Constitutional Convention. In connection therewith, the 1986 U.P. Constitution Project observed: "The 1984 Constitutional Convention recognized the importance of our natural resources not only for its security and national defense. Our natural resources <b>which constitute the exclusive heritage of the Filipino nation, should be preserved for those under the sovereign authority of that nation and for their prosperity.</b> This will ensure the country's survival as a viable and sovereign republic."

The use and exploitation of water resources critical for power generation is doubtless the underlying purpose of the contract involving the sale of the physical structure of AHEPP.<br><br><b>The waters of Angat Dam and <br>Reservoir form part of the natural<br>resources of the Philippines</b><br><br>Based on the foregoing factual backdrop, I submit that the APA and O &amp; M Agreements, individually or as a package, are themselves infringing on the constitutional imperative limiting the exploration, development, and utilization of the natural resources of the Philippines to Filipino citizens and associations or corporations sixty percent of the capital of which is owned by Filipinos. I also take the view that K-Water was, from the start, disqualified from participating in the bidding for the two projects in question.<br><br>Consider:<br><br>The waters flowing through Angat River, and eventually to the Angat Dam and Reservoir, form part of the country’s natural resources. There cannot be a substantial distinction between the waters in Angat River, on one hand, and those settling in the Angat Dam and Reservoir, on the other. There is no rhyme or reason to claim that the waters in the dam cease to be part of the protected natural resources envisaged in the Constitution.<br><br><i>First</i>, the fact that an artificial structure was constructed to provide a temporary catchment for the naturally-flowing waters does not necessarily remove the waters from being part of the natural resources of the Philippines. The waters themselves are natural in that it is “brought about by nature, as opposed to artificial means.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>From the spillway gates of the Angat Dam, some of the waters are diverted to Ipo Dam, and others still flow to Bustos Dam. Eventually, the waters passing through Ipo Dam end up in Tullahan River in Metro Manila. If there is any detention of the waters, it is merely temporary, as Angat Dam is not meant to permanently impound the waters. An examination of the flow of waters from Angat River readily shows that the waters go through a contiguous series of dams and rivers, and the waters are not actually extracted from it, when they pass through structures such as the AHEPP.<br><br>To say that the waters in the Angat Dam and Reservoir have already been extracted or appropriated by the mere fact that there is a catchment system in Angat Dam would be to make a distinction between the nature of the waters in different parts of this contiguous series. On the contrary, the waters have not been extracted from its natural source, the river and the dam forming a unitary system. The waters naturally flowing through Angat River are the very same waters that are stored in Angat Dam. Their characteristics, quality, and purity cannot be distinguished from each other. It is the mechanisms in AHEPP that permanently extract water from its natural source. Angat Dam merely serves to temporarily impound the waters, which are later allowed to flow downstream.<br><br>Were We to hold that the waters in Angat Dam cease to become a natural resource, the same logic would lead to the conclusion that the waters downstream in Ipo Dam are sourced partly from natural resources (i.e. those directly flowing from Ipo River) and partly from artificial sources, since part of the waters passing through Ipo Dam already passed through Angat Dam. By extension, Tullahan River would not be considered a natural resource, as the waters there are sourced from La Mesa Dam. The law could not have intended such absurd distinctions. <i>Lex simper intendit quod convenitrationi</i>. The law always intends that which is agreeable to reason.<br><br>Appropriation of water implies beneficial use of the water, for any of the particular purposes enumerated in the Water Code. In the case of Angat Dam, the waters in the dam, so long as they remain in the dam or in the reservoir, carry with them no economic value––they cannot be directly used for any beneficial purpose. They cannot be directly used for any of the purposes specified in the Water Code, including power generation, the intended use of the waters in AHEPP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, the definition of <b>water</b> in the Water Code is broad enough to cover the waters of Angat Dam. Waters are defined simply as “water under the grounds, water above the ground, water in the atmosphere and the waters of the sea within the territorial jurisdiction of the Philippines.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The requirement of water permits is also broad enough to cover those coming from Angat Dam, because the only exceptions provided in the Code are waters appropriated by means of hand carried receptacles, and those used for bathing, washing, watering or dipping of domestic or farm animals, and navigation of watercrafts or transportation of logs and other objects by floatation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to this water permit requirement, the waters of Angat Dam are presently covered by three separate water permits granted to three different entities, all for specific purposes: (1) Water Permit No. 6504<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> to NIA, for irrigation purposes; (2) Water Permit No. 6512<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> to NPC, for power purposes; and (3) Water Permit No. 11462<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> to MWSS for municipal/industrial purposes. Needless to state, all the entities currently holding water permits over Angat Dam are qualified to hold such permits, both under the Constitution and the Water Code.<br><br>The grant by NWRB of permits covering the waters not only within the Angat River but also those already impounded in the dam reveals an intention on the part of the agency to treat the waters of Angat River, including the waters in Angat Dam, as part of the water resources of the Philippines. There is an intention to treat the waters flowing from the river to the dam system as one contiguous system, all falling within the ambit of protection afforded by the Constitution and the Water Code to such water resources. Had NWRB through these years viewed the waters in Angat River as not part of the natural resources of the Philippines when they end up in the dam, how explain the water permits extended covering the waters in the dam itself; it would have suffice to grant a single water permit for the sole purpose of building and operating a dam.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the DOJ Opinions cited by PSALM are not authoritative statements of the rule on the matter. Indeed, the DOJ Opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> saying that the agreement between PSALM and K-Water does not violate the constitution is not binding on this Court.&nbsp; Its probative value is limited to just that, an opinion.<br><br>The opinion of the DOJ that the waters to be used in the operation of AHEPP have already been extracted is based on a misapplication of a US Supreme Court ruling. The cited <i>U.S. v. State of New York,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; concerning the Saratoga Springs Reservation, is not in point with the facts here. In that case, the issue revolves around the taxability of the bottling for sale and selling of mineral and table water from Saratoga Springs by the State of New York, Saratoga Springs Commission, and Saratoga Springs Authority. The US Supreme Court there ruled that they are subject to taxation, because the activity was a business enterprise and not merely a sale of natural resources. The US Supreme Court noted that the State: “took its natural resources and, through a bottling process, put those resources into a preserved condition where they could be sold to the public in competition with private waters.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>The process of bottling water involves the permanent extraction of water from its natural source. There lies the difference. Here, there is no actual extraction of waters, as the waters remain in the river-dam system. What we have here is the operation of a power plant using resources that originate from Angat River and held in the Angat Dam and Reservoir.<br><br>The DOJ further opined that:<br><br><blockquote>The fact that under the proposal, the non-power components and structures shall be retained and maintained by the government entities concerned is, to us, not only a sufficient compliance of constitutional requirement of “full control and supervision of the State” in the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources. It is also an enough safeguard against the evil sought to be avoided by the constitutional reservation x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br></blockquote><br>This opinion is based on a clear misapprehension of facts. A cursory reading of the express terms of the O &amp; M Agreement reveals that the operation and management of Angat Dam is being handed over the operator, K-Water. There is no such safeguard anywhere in the APA and O &amp; M Agreement.<br><br><b>K-Water is disqualified from <br>participating in the bidding</b><br><br>PSALM argues that NPC’s obligation to transfer its water permit is subject to a suspensive condition, i.e., K-Water has to become a Filipino corporation, to become the transferee of NPC of its water permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> This is an implied admission that PSALM knew of K-Water’s disqualification to participate in the bidding. PSALM knew that the use of waters is indispensable in the operation of the power plant, and it goes against the spirit of EPIRA to sell the power plant to an entity which is legally barred from operating it. PSALM, therefore, should have disqualified K-Water at the outset.<br><br>It is unfortunate that instead of disqualifying K-Water, PSALM allowed the former to bid and eventually inked an Agreement with it on the operation of Angat Dam. That PSALM allowed this course of events to transpire constitutes a grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><b>The Agreements Violate the Constitution&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br><br>The APA transfers ownership of the Angat Hydro-electric Power Plant to the buyer, K-Water. To operate this power plant, K-Water, as the new owner, will have to utilize the waters coming from Angat Dam, as it is the energy generated by the downstream of water that will be used to generate electricity. The use of natural resources in the operation of a power plant by a foreign corporation is contrary to the words and spirit of the Constitution.<br><br>The O &amp; M is more straightforward, in that it expressly authorizes the operator, K-Water, to administer and manage non-power components, which it defines as “the Angat Dam, non-power equipment, facilities and installations, and appurtenant devices and structures which are particularly described in Annex 1.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> While it is true, as PSALM argues, that Angat Dam itself is not being sold, the operation and management of the same is being handed to a wholly foreign corporation. This is cannot be countenanced under the express limitations in Constitution and the Water Code.<br><br>In fine, the Agreements between PSALM and K-Water necessarily grant to corporation wholly owned by a foreign state not just access to but direct control over the water resources of Angat Dam, and consequently some portions of the Angat River as well. On this ground, both agreements are constitutionally and statutorily infirm.&nbsp; They must be nullified.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> would rule toward the validity of the Agreements, but would disallow the transfer or assignment of NPC of its Water Rights under its Water Permit to K-Water. NPC retains control over the flow of waters (presumably by maintaining control over the spillway gates of Angat Dam), while K-Water is given the right to use the waters coming from the dam to generate electricity.<br><br>The Water Permit of NPC itself however, states that the right given to NPC is limited to power generation, and precisely for the purpose of operating the AHEPP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>&nbsp; It is not given complete control over the waters of Angat River and Angat Dam, because the waters there are covered by separate water permits for different purposes. What NPC is actually giving up to K-Water is its right to utilize the waters of Angat River for power generation, the very right granted to it under its Water Permit. This, it cannot do, because of an express prohibition under the Water Code and the Constitution.<br><br>It would be splitting hairs to differentiate between the control of waters by the NPC and the K-Water’s right to use the water for power generation. Water Permit No. 6512 granted to NPC will be rendered inutile if NPC assigns its right to use the water for power generation. That ensuing arrangement has the same effect as an assignment or transfer. To allow K-Water to utilize the waters without a corresponding water permit indirectly circumvents the regulatory measures imposed by the Water Code in appropriating water resources.<br><br>Thus, the Agreement concerning water rights is in direct contravention of the Water Code and Sec. 2, Art. XII of the Constitution. K-Water, being a wholly foreign-owned corporation, is disqualified from obtaining water permits and from being the transferee or assignee of an existing Water Permit. It is further barred from entering into any agreement that has the effect of transferring any of the water rights covered by existing water permits.<br><br>PSALM argues on this point that it will not be K-Water, as the operator of Angat Dam, which will extract or utilize the water from its natural source. They allege that it will be NPC, MWSS, and NIA that will continue to utilize and extract water, store them in the reservoir, then pass through Angat Dam where the operator, K-Water, will be subjected to rules on water releases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>PSALM would have Us believe that the operator of Angat Dam will merely play a passive role in the control of the waters in Angat Dam, yielding instead to MWSS, NIA and NPC, the last being the very entity which grants the operator its rights under its water permit. This argument is hardly convincing, if not altogether implausible. It is foolhardy to believe that NPC, the assignor of the water permit, would get to retain some control over the water, much less retain the right to extract the waters. This goes contrary to the very nature of an assignment. Once it assigns its water permit to the operator, it necessarily relinquishes any right it may have under the water permit. In fact, if it does further engage in water-related activities in Angat River and Angat Dam, it will be violating the Water Code for engaging in appropriation of water without the requisite permit.<br><br>Moreover, PSALM made an express admission that it is not NPC alone that engages in water-related activities in Angat Dam, as MWSS and NIA, pursuant to their respective water permits, engage in appropriation of water in Angat Dam. Even PAGASA engages in activities within the dam complex. Yet the O&amp;M Agreement readily grants the operator the power to administer the entire Dam, without consent from the other agencies operating in Angat Dam, as the Water Protocol between the concerned agencies and entities has yet to be finalized.<br><br><b>Power generation may not covered<br>by the nationality restrictions, but use of<br>natural resources for power generation is <br>subject to the limitation in the Constitution</b><br><br>While it is established that power generation is not considered a public utility operation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> thus not subject to the nationality requirement for public utilities, the operator of a power plant is nevertheless bound to comply with the pertinent constitutional provision when using natural resources of the Philippines, including water resources. As already discussed, the operation of AHEPP necessarily requires the utilization and extraction of water resources. Thus, its operation should be limited to Filipino citizens and corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens, following the clear mandate of the Constitution.<br><br><b>PSALM has no power to cede control over Angat Dam&nbsp; </b><br><br>The O&amp;M Agreement, in no uncertain terms, confers the operation of Angat Dam, among other non-power components, to the operator; that is, the buyer of AHEPP. But by express admission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> of respondent PSALM, the following governmental agencies jointly operate within the Angat Dam Complex:<br><br><i>First</i>, NWRB controls the exploitation, development, and conservation of the waters. It regulates the water from Angat River and allocates them to the three water permit holders, NPC, MWSS, and NIA.<br><br><i>Second</i>, NIA appropriates the water coming from the outflow of the main units of AHEPP to Bustos Dam, for use in its irrigation systems.<br><br>Third, MWSS appropriates water coming from the outflow of the auxiliary units of AHEPP, for domestic and other purposes through its two concessionaires, Manila Water Company, Inc. and Maynilad Water Services, Inc.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, PAGASA uses its facilities located within the Angat Complex to forecast weather in the area, forecasts which are vital to the operation of the complex itself.<br><br><i>Fifth,</i> the Flood Forecasting and Warning System for Dam Operations (NPC-FFWSDO) is responsible for the opening of the spillway gates during the rainy season. It has sole authority to disseminate flood warning and notifies the public, particularly those residing along the riverbanks, during spilling operation.<br><br><i>Sixth</i>, the NPC-Watershed is responsible for preserving and conserving the forest of Angat Watershed, vital to the maintenance of water storage in the Dam.<br><br>The O&amp;M Agreement hands over to the operator, lock, stock, and barrel, the operation of the entire Angat Dam, among other non-power components within the Angat Dam Complex, to K-Water. This agreement undermines the capacity and power of the various governmental agencies to operate within the dam, as the operation thereof is being handed over to a private entity.<br><br>The distinction that PSALM intends to create is more illusory than real. The O&amp;M Agreement is explicit in handing over the operation of the dam to the operator/buyer of AHEPP. There is an utter lack of supposed protocols in the management of water between the operator and the various government agencies, as there is yet no finalized Water Protocol. The provisions of the O&amp;M Agreement by themselves unreasonably limit the powers and responsibilities of the different government agencies involved insofar as control of the waters of Angat Dam is concerned. Their participation in the finalization of the Water Protocol is already unjustly limited in that the provisions they may propose to include in the Protocol must respect the powers already given to the operator in the O&amp;M Agreement.<br><br>This may result in dangerous consequences, as the operator can effectively inhibit the responsible governmental agencies from conducting activities within Angat Dam––activities that are vital not only to those entities with operation within Angat Dam, but also to the general public who will suffer the consequences of improper management of the waters in Angat Dam. In the event of unnatural swelling of the waters in the dam, for purposes of public accountability, the proper government agencies should be the ones to manage the outflow of water from the dam, and not a private operator.<br><br>To require the buyer to operate Angat Dam and the non-power components is null and void. The operation must always be in the hands of the government. The buyer can only be obliged to maintain the non-power components, but still under the control and supervision of the government.<br><br>The flow of waters to and from Angat Dam must at all times be within the control of the government, lest it lose control over vital functions including ensuring water security and flood control. Water security of the consuming public must take precedence over proprietary interests such as the operation of a power plant. Flood control, an increasingly important government function in light of the changing times, should never be left to a private entity, especially one with proprietary interests.<br><br>The operation of Angat Dam not only involves the utilization and extraction of waters, but also important government functions, including flood control, weather forecasting, and providing adequate water supply to the populace. Had it only been the former, the government under the Constitution is permitted to enter into joint venture agreements with those entities qualified under Sec. 2, Art. XII of the Constitution. However, the latter are necessary government functions which the government cannot devolve to private entities, including Filipino citizens and corporations.<br><br>It leads Us then to conclude that the pivotal provisions of the O&amp;M Agreement entered into with K-Water, specifically those referring to the operation of Angat Dam, are repugnant to the letter and spirit of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup>&nbsp; The control and supervision of such areas must at all times be under the direct control and supervision of the government.<br><br>The maintenance of the dam, however, is a different matter. It is a proprietary function that the government may assign or impose to private entities. In the case here, We find it just to impose such duty to maintain the facility to the buyer of AHEPP, as it is in the best interest of the operations of AHEPP to ensure the optimal conditions of the structures of the dam. The performance of this duty, however, must still be under the supervision of the government.<br><br>In view of the urgency and time constraints in the privatization of AHEPP, PSALM has the option to award the sale of AHEPP to any of the losing qualified bidders, provided that the Angat Water Protocol is executed and signed by all the concerned government agencies and that the Operations &amp; Maintenance Agreement shall contain the provision that the operation of the Angat Dam, and the non-power components shall remain with the government while the maintenance and repair of the Dam and other non-power components shall be shouldered by the winning bidder, under the supervision and control of the government.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Petition.
