				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">We resolve the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioner Charles Gotardo, to challenge the March 5, 2004 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the July 27, 2004 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals<i> (CA)</i> in CA GR CV No. 76326. The CA decision ordered the petitioner to recognize and provide legal support to his minor son, Gliffze O. Buling. The CA resolution denied the petitioner's subsequent motion for reconsideration.<br><br><center><b><u>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</u></b><br></center><br>On September 6, 1995, respondent Divina Buling filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>) of Maasin, Southern Leyte, Branch 25, for compulsory recognition and support <i>pendente lite</i>, claiming that the petitioner is the father of her child Gliffze.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In his answer, the petitioner denied the imputed paternity of Gliffze.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> For the parties’ failure to amicably settle the dispute, the RTC terminated the pre-trial proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The respondent testified for herself and presented Rodulfo Lopez as witness. Evidence for the respondent showed that she met the petitioner on December 1, 1992 at the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank, Maasin, Southern Leyte branch where she had been hired as a casual employee, while the petitioner worked as accounting supervisor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The petitioner started courting the respondent in the third week of December 1992 and they became sweethearts in the last week of January 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The petitioner gave the respondent greeting cards on special occasions, such as on Valentine’s Day and her birthday; she reciprocated his love and took care of him when he was ill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Sometime in September 1993, the petitioner started intimate sexual relations with the respondent in the former’s rented room in the boarding house managed by Rodulfo, the respondent’s uncle, on Tomas Oppus St., Agbao, Maasin, Southern Leyte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The petitioner rented the room from March 1, 1993 to August 30, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The sexual encounters occurred twice a month and became more frequent in June 1994; eventually, on August 8, 1994, the respondent found out that she was pregnant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> When told of the pregnancy, the petitioner was happy and made plans to marry the respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> They in fact applied for a marriage license.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The petitioner even inquired about the costs of a wedding reception and the bridal gown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Subsequently, however, the petitioner backed out of the wedding plans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The respondent responded by filing a complaint with the Municipal Trial Court of Maasin, Southern Leyte for damages against the petitioner for breach of promise to marry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Later, however, the petitioner and the respondent amicably settled the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The respondent gave birth to their son Gliffze on March 9, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> When the petitioner did not show up and failed to provide support to Gliffze, the respondent sent him a letter on July 24, 1995 demanding recognition of and support for their child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When the petitioner did not answer the demand, the respondent filed her complaint for compulsory recognition and support <i>pendente lite</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The petitioner took the witness stand and testified for himself. He denied the imputed paternity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> claiming that he first had sexual contact with the respondent in the first week of August 1994 and she could not have been pregnant for twelve (12) weeks (or three (3) months) when he was informed of the pregnancy on September 15, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the case, the RTC, on the respondent’s motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> granted a P2,000.00 monthly child support, retroactive from March 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>THE RTC RULING</u></b><br></center><br>In its June 25, 2002 decision, the RTC dismissed the complaint for insufficiency of evidence proving Gliffze’s filiation. It found the respondent’s testimony inconsistent on the question of when she had her first sexual contact with the petitioner, <i>i.e.</i>, “September 1993” in her direct testimony while “last week of January 1993” during her cross-testimony, and her reason for engaging in sexual contact even after she had refused the petitioner’s initial marriage proposal. It ordered the respondent to return the amount of support <i>pendente lite</i> erroneously awarded, and to pay P10,000.00 as attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The respondent appealed the RTC ruling to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>THE CA RULING</u></b><br></center><br>In its March 5, 2004 decision, the CA departed from the RTC's appreciation of the respondent’s testimony, concluding that the latter merely made an honest mistake in her understanding of the questions of the petitioner’s counsel. It noted that the petitioner and the respondent had sexual relationship even before August 1994; that the respondent had only one boyfriend, the petitioner, from January 1993 to August 1994; and that the petitioner’s allegation that the respondent had previous relationships with other men remained unsubstantiated. The CA consequently set aside the RTC decision and ordered the petitioner to recognize his minor son Gliffze. It also reinstated the RTC order granting a P2,000.00 monthly child support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>When the CA denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the petitioner’s motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the petitioner filed the present petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari.</span><br><br><center><b><u>THE PETITION</u></b><br></center><br>The petitioner argues that the CA committed a reversible error in rejecting the RTC’s appreciation of the respondent’s testimony, and that the evidence on record is insufficient to prove paternity.<br><br><center><b><u>THE CASE FOR THE RESPONDENT</u></b><br></center><br>The respondent submits that the CA correctly explained that the inconsistency in the respondent’s testimony was due to an incorrect appreciation of the questions asked, and that the record is replete with evidence proving that the petitioner was her lover and that they had several intimate sexual encounters during their relationship, resulting in her pregnancy and Gliffze’s birth on March 9, 1995.<br><br><center><b><u>THE ISSUE</u></b></center><br>The sole issue before us is whether the CA committed a reversible error when it set aside the RTC’s findings and ordered the petitioner to recognize and provide legal support to his minor son Gliffze.<br><br><center><b><u>OUR RULING</u></b><br></center><br><b><i>We do not find any reversible error in the CA’s ruling.</i></b><br><br>We have recognized that “[f]iliation proceedings are usually filed not just to adjudicate paternity but also to secure a legal right associated with paternity, such as citizenship, support (as in this case) or inheritance. [In paternity cases, the burden of proof] is on the person who alleges that the putative father is the biological father of the child.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>One can prove filiation, either legitimate or illegitimate, through the record of birth appearing in the civil register or a final judgment, an admission of filiation in a public document or a private handwritten instrument and signed by the parent concerned, or the open and continuous possession of the status of a legitimate or illegitimate child, or any other means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> We have held that such other proof of one's filiation may be a “baptismal certificate, a judicial admission, a family bible in which [his] name has been entered, common reputation respecting [his] pedigree, admission by silence, the [testimonies] of witnesses, and other kinds of proof [admissible] under Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In <i>Herrera v. Alba,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we stressed that there are four significant procedural aspects of a traditional paternity action that parties have to face: a <i>prima facie</i> case, affirmative defenses, presumption of legitimacy, and physical resemblance between the putative father and the child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> We explained that a <i>prima facie </i>case exists if a woman declares — supported by corroborative proof — that she had sexual relations with the putative father; at this point, the burden of evidence shifts to the putative father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We explained further that the two affirmative defenses available to the putative father are: (1) incapability of sexual relations with the mother due to either physical absence or impotency, or (2) that the mother had sexual relations with other men at the time of conception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In this case, the respondent established a <i>prima facie</i> case that the petitioner is the putative father of Gliffze through testimony that she had been sexually involved only with one man, the petitioner, at the time of her conception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Rodulfo corroborated her testimony that the petitioner and the respondent had intimate relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the petitioner did not deny that he had sexual encounters with the respondent, only that it occurred on a much later date than the respondent asserted, such that it was physically impossible for the respondent to have been three (3) months pregnant already in September 1994 when he was informed of the pregnancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> However, the petitioner failed to substantiate his allegations of infidelity and insinuations of promiscuity. His allegations, therefore, cannot be given credence for lack of evidentiary support. The petitioner’s denial cannot overcome the respondent’s clear and categorical assertions.<br><br>The petitioner, as the RTC did, made much of the variance between the respondent’s direct testimony regarding their first sexual contact as “sometime in September 1993” and her cross-testimony when she stated that their first sexual contact was “last week of January 1993,” as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">ATTY.

Indeed, when confronted for her contradictory statements, the respondent explained that that portion of the transcript of stenographic notes was incorrect and she had brought it to the attention of Atty. Josefino Go Cinco (her former counsel) but the latter took no action on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence teaches that in assessing the credibility of a witness, his testimony must be considered in its entirety instead of in truncated parts. The technique in deciphering a testimony is not to consider only its isolated parts and to anchor a conclusion based on these parts. "In ascertaining the facts established by a witness, everything stated by him on direct, cross and redirect examinations must be calibrated and considered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Evidently, the totality of the respondent's testimony positively and convincingly shows that no real inconsistency exists. The respondent has consistently asserted that she started intimate sexual relations with the petitioner sometime in September 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Since filiation is beyond question, support follows as a matter of obligation; a parent is obliged to support his child, whether legitimate or illegitimate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Support consists of everything indispensable for sustenance, dwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation, in keeping with the financial capacity of the family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, the amount of support is variable and, for this reason, no final judgment on the amount of support is made as the amount shall be in proportion to the resources or means of the giver and the necessities of the recipient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It may be reduced or increased proportionately according to the reduction or increase of the necessities of the recipient and the resources or means of the person obliged to support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In this case, we Sustain the award of P2,000.00 monthly child support, without prejudice to the filing of the proper motion in the RTC for the determination of any support in arrears, considering the needs of the child, Gliffze, during the pendency ofthis case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we hereby <b>DENY</b> the petition for lack of merit.
