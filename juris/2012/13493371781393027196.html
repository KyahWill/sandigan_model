The third billing worth P273,729.47 was not paid due to its disallowance by the Commission on Audit (COA). Despite the lifting of the disallowance, the UP failed to pay the billing, prompting Stern Builders and dela Cruz to sue the UP and its corespondent officials to collect the unpaid billing and to recover various damages. The suit, entitled <i>Stern Builders Corporation and Servillano R. Dela Cruz v. University of the Philippines Systems, Jose V. Abueva, Raul P. de Guzman, Ruben P. Aspiras, Emmanuel P.

The UP countered that the notice of appeal was filed within the reglementary period because the UP’s Office of Legal Affairs (OLS) in Diliman, Quezon City received the order of denial only on May 31, 2002. On September 26, 2002, the RTC denied due course to the notice of appeal for having been filed out of time and granted the private respondents’ motion for execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The RTC issued the writ of execution on October 4, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the sheriff of the RTC served the writ of execution and notice of demand upon the UP, through its counsel, on October 9, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The UP filed an urgent motion to reconsider the order dated September 26, 2002, to quash the writ of execution dated October 4, 2002, and to restrain the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, the RTC denied the urgent motion on April 1, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On June 24, 2003, the UP assailed the denial of due course to its appeal through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court of Appeals (CA), docketed as CA-G.R. No. 77395.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On February 24, 2004, the CA dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari </i>upon finding that the UP’s notice of appeal had been filed late,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> stating:<br><br><blockquote>Records clearly show that petitioners received a copy of the Decision dated November 28, 2001 and January 7, 2002, thus, they had until January 22, 2002 within which to file their appeal. On January 16, 2002 or after the lapse of nine (9) days, petitioners through their counsel Atty. Nolasco filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the aforesaid decision, hence, pursuant to the rules, petitioners still had six (6) remaining days to file their appeal. As admitted by the petitioners in their petition (Rollo, p. 25), Atty. Nolasco received a copy of the Order denying their motion for reconsideration on May 17, 2002, thus, petitioners still has until May 23, 2002 (the remaining six (6) days) within which to file their appeal. Obviously, petitioners were not able to file their Notice of Appeal on May 23, 2002 as it was only filed on June 3, 2002.<br><br>In view of the said circumstances, We are of the belief and so holds that the Notice of Appeal filed by the petitioners was really filed out of time, the same having been filed seventeen (17) days late of the reglementary period. By reason of which, the decision dated November 28, 2001 had already become final and executory. “Settled is the rule that the perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory but jurisdictional, and failure to perfect that appeal renders the challenged judgment final and executory. This is not an empty procedural rule but is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice.” (Ram’s Studio and Photographic Equipment, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 346 SCRA 691, 696). Indeed, Atty. Nolasco received the order of denial of the Motion for Reconsideration on May 17, 2002 but filed a Notice of Appeal only on June 3, 3003.&nbsp; As such, the decision of the lower court <i>ipso facto</i> became final when no appeal was perfected after the lapse of the reglementary period. This procedural caveat cannot be trifled with, not even by the High Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The UP sought a reconsideration, but the CA denied the UP’s motion for reconsideration on April 19, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On May 11, 2004, the UP appealed to the Court by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> (G.R.

Citing Department of Agriculture vs. NLRC, University of the Philippines Board of Regents vs. Hon. Ligot-Telan, petitioners contend that UP deposits at Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, being government funds, may not be released absent an appropriations bill from Congress.<br><br>The argument is specious. UP entered into a contract with private respondents for the expansion and renovation of the Arts and Sciences Building of its campus in Los Baños, Laguna. Decidedly, there was already an appropriations earmarked for the said project. The said funds are retained by UP, in a fiduciary capacity, pending completion of the construction project.<br><br>We agree with the trial Court [sic] observation on this score:<br><br><blockquote>“4. Executive Order No. 109 (Directing all National Government Agencies to Revert Certain Accounts Payable to the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government and for Other Purposes) Section 9. Reversion of Accounts Payable, provides that, all 1995 and prior years documented accounts payable and all undocumented accounts regardless of the year they were incurred shall be reverted to the Cumulative Result of Operations of the National Government (CROU). This shall apply to accounts payable of all funds, except fiduciary funds, as long as the purpose for which the funds were created have not been accomplished and accounts payable under foreign assisted projects for the duration of the said project. In this regard, the Department of Budget and Management issued Joint-Circular No. 99-6 4.0 (4.3) Procedural Guidelines which provides that all accounts payable that reverted to the CROU may be considered for payment upon determination thru administrative process, of the existence, validity and legality of the claim. Thus, the allegation of the defendants that considering no appropriation for the payment of any amount awarded to plaintiffs appellee the funds of defendant-appellants may not be seized pursuant to a writ of execution issued by the regular court is misplaced. Surely when the defendants and the plaintiff entered into the General Construction of Agreement there is an amount already allocated by the latter for the said project which is no longer subject of future appropriation.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </blockquote></blockquote><br>After the CA denied their motion for reconsideration on December 23, 2005, the petitioners appealed by petition for review.<br><br><center><b>Matters Arising During the Pendency of the Petition<br></b></center><br>On January 30, 2006, Judge Dizon of the RTC (Branch 80) denied Stern Builders and dela Cruz’s motion to withdraw the deposit, in consideration of the UP’s intention to appeal to the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> stating:<br><br><blockquote>Since it appears that the defendants are intending to file a petition for review of the Court of Appeals resolution in CA-G.R. No. 88125 within the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of resolution, the Court agrees with the defendants stand that the granting of plaintiffs’ subject motion is premature.<br><br>Let it be stated that what the Court meant by its Order dated July 8, 2005 which states in part that the “disposition of the amount represented therein being subject to the final outcome of the case of the University of the Philippines, et. al., vs. Hon. Agustin S. Dizon et al., (CA G.R. No. 88125 before the Court of Appeals) is that the judgment or resolution of said court has to be final and executory, for if the same will still be elevated to the Supreme Court, it will not attain finality yet until the highest court has rendered its own final judgment or resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote><br>However, on January 22, 2007, the UP filed an <i>Urgent Application for A Temporary Restraining Order and/or A Writ of Preliminary Injunction</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> averring that on January 3, 2007, Judge Maria Theresa dela Torre-Yadao (who had meanwhile replaced Judge Dizon upon the latter’s appointment to the CA) had issued another order allowing Stern Builders and dela Cruz to withdraw the deposit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>It bears stressing that defendants’ liability for the payment of the judgment obligation has become indubitable due to the final and executory nature of the Decision dated November 28, 2001. Insofar as the payment of the [sic] judgment obligation is concerned, the Court believes that there is nothing more the defendant can do to escape liability. It is observed that there is nothing more the defendant can do to escape liability. It is observed that defendant U.P. System had already exhausted all its legal remedies to overturn, set aside or modify the decision (dated November 28, 2001( rendered against it. The way the Court sees it, defendant U.P. System’s petition before the Supreme Court concerns only with the manner by which said judgment award should be satisfied. It has nothing to do with the legality or propriety thereof, although it prays for the deletion of [sic] reduction of the award of moral damages.<br><br>It must be emphasized that this Court’s finding, i.e., that there was sufficient appropriation earmarked for the project, was upheld by the Court of Appeals in its decision dated September 16, 2005. Being a finding of fact, the Supreme Court will, ordinarily, not disturb the same was said Court is not a trier of fact. Such being the case, defendants’ arguments that there was no sufficient appropriation for the payment of the judgment obligation must fail.<br><br>While it is true that the former Presiding Judge of this Court in its Order dated January 30, 2006 had stated that:<br><br><blockquote>Let it be stated that what the Court meant by its Order dated July 8, 2005 which states in part that the “disposition of the amount represented therein being subject to the final outcome of the case of the University of the Philippines, et. al., vs. Hon.

In fact, in its present petition for review before the Supreme Court, U.P. System has not prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Thus, the Court doubts whether such writ is forthcoming.<br><br>The Court honestly believes that if defendants’ petition assailing the Order of this Court dated December 31, 2004 granting the motion for the release of the garnished amount was meritorious, the Court of Appeals would have issued a writ of injunction enjoining the same. Instead, said appellate [c]ourt not only refused to issue a wit of preliminary injunction prayed for by U.P. System but denied the petition, as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br>The UP contended that Judge Yadao thereby effectively reversed the January 30, 2006 order of Judge Dizon disallowing the withdrawal of the garnished amount until after the decision in the case would have become final and executory.<br><br>Although the Court issued a TRO on January 24, 2007 to enjoin Judge Yadao and all persons acting pursuant to her authority from enforcing her order of January 3, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> it appears that on January 16, 2007, or prior to the issuance of the TRO, she had already directed the DBP to forthwith release the garnished amount to Stern Builders and dela Cruz;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and that DBP had forthwith complied with the order on January 17, 2007 upon the sheriff’s service of the order of Judge Yadao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>These intervening developments impelled the UP to file in this Court a supplemental petition on January 26, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> alleging that the RTC (Judge Yadao) gravely erred in ordering the immediate release of the garnished amount despite the pendency of the petition for review in this Court.<br><br>The UP filed a second supplemental petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> after the RTC (Judge Yadao) denied the UP’s motion for the redeposit of the withdrawn amount on April 10, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>This resolves defendant U.P. System’s Urgent Motion to Redeposit Judgment Award praying that plaintiffs be directed to redeposit the judgment award to DBP pursuant to the Temporary Restraining Order issued by the Supreme Court. Plaintiffs opposed the motion and countered that the Temporary Restraining Order issued by the Supreme Court has become moot and academic considering that the act sought to be restrained by it has already been performed. They also alleged that the redeposit of the judgment award was no longer feasible as they have already spent the same.<br><br>It bears stressing, if only to set the record straight, that this Court did not – in its Order dated January 3, 2007 (the implementation of which was restrained by the Supreme Court in its Resolution dated January 24, 2002) – direct that that garnished amount “be deposited with the garnishee bank (Development Bank of the Philippines)”. In the first place, there was no need to order DBP to make such deposit, as the garnished amount was already deposited in the account of plaintiffs with the DBP as early as May 13, 2005. What the Court granted in its Order dated January 3, 2007 was plaintiff’s motion to allow the release of said deposit. It must be recalled that the Court found plaintiff’s motion meritorious and, at that time, there was no restraining order or preliminary injunction from either the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court which could have enjoined the release of plaintiffs’ deposit. The Court also took into account the following factors:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="CENTER">a) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">the Decision in this case had long been final and executory after it was rendered on November 28, 2001;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">b)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">the propriety of the dismissal of U.P.

(c), Section 9, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, the judgment obligation has already been fully satisfied as per Report of the Deputy Sheriff.<br><br>Anent the Temporary Restraining Order issued by the Supreme Court, the same has become <i>functus oficio</i>, having been issued after the garnished amount had been released to the plaintiffs. The judgment debt was released to the plaintiffs on January 17, 2007, while the Temporary Restraining Order issued by the Supreme Court was received by this Court on February 2, 2007. At the time of the issuance of the Restraining Order, the act sought to be restrained had already been done, thereby rendering the said Order ineffectual.<br><br>After a careful and thorough study of the arguments advanced by the parties, the Court is of the considered opinion that there is no legal basis to grant defendant U.P. System’s motion to redeposit the judgment amount. Granting said motion is not only contrary to law, but it will also render this Court’s final executory judgment nugatory. Litigation must end and terminate sometime and somewhere, and it is essential to an effective administration of justice that once a judgment has become final the issue or cause involved therein should be laid to rest. This doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice. In fact, nothing is more settled in law than that once a judgment attains finality it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable. It may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, finding defendant U.P.

In support of its argument, the UP cited Article 12.2 of the General Construction Agreement, which stipulated that no deductions would be allowed for the payment of claims, damages, losses and expenses, including attorney’s fees, in case of any litigation arising out of the performance of the work. The UP insists that the CA decision was inconsistent with the rulings in <i>Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and <i>Department of Agriculture v. NLRC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> to the effect that government funds and properties could not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy judgment awards.<br><br>Furthermore, the UP contends that the CA contravened Section 5, Article XIV of the Constitution by allowing the garnishment of UP funds, because the garnishment resulted in a substantial reduction of the UP’s limited budget allocated for the remuneration, job satisfaction and fulfillment of the best available teachers; that Judge Yadao should have exhibited judicial courtesy towards the Court due to the pendency of the UP’s petition for review; and that she should have also desisted from declaring that the TRO issued by this Court had become <i>functus officio</i>.<br><br>Lastly, the UP states that the awards of actual damages of P5,716,729.00 and moral damages of P10 million should be reduced, if not entirely deleted, due to its being unconscionable, inequitable and detrimental to public service.<br><br>In contrast, Stern Builders and dela Cruz aver that the petition for review was fatally defective for its failure to mention the other cases upon the same issues pending between the parties (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, CA-G.R. No. 77395 and G.R No. 163501); that the UP was evidently resorting to forum shopping, and to delaying the satisfaction of the final judgment by the filing of its petition for review; that the ruling in <i>Commissioner of Public Works v. San Diego</i> had no application because there was an appropriation for the project; that the UP retained the funds allotted for the project only in a fiduciary capacity; that the contract price had been meanwhile adjusted to P22,338,553.25, an amount already more than sufficient to cover the judgment award; that the UP’s prayer to reduce or delete the award of damages had no factual basis, because they had been gravely wronged, had been deprived of their source of income, and had suffered untold miseries, discomfort, humiliation and sleepless years; that dela Cruz had even been constrained to sell his house, his equipment and the implements of his trade, and together with his family had been forced to live miserably because of the wrongful actuations of the UP; and that the RTC correctly declared the Court’s TRO to be already <i>functus officio</i> by reason of the withdrawal of the garnished amount from the DBP. <br><br>The decisive issues to be considered and passed upon are, therefore: (a) whether the funds of the UP were the proper subject of garnishment in order to satisfy the judgment award; and (b) whether the UP’s prayer for the deletion of the awards of actual damages of P5,716,729.00, moral damages of P10,000,000.00 and attorney’s fees of P150,000.00 plus P1,500.00 per appearance could be granted despite the finality of the judgment of the RTC. <br><br><center><b>Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition for review is meritorious.<br><br><center><b>I. <br>UP’s funds, being government funds, <br>are not subject to garnishment</b></center><br>The UP was founded on June 18, 1908 through Act 1870 to provide advanced instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences, and arts, and to give professional and technical training to deserving students.63 Despite its establishment as a body corporate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the UP remains to be a “chartered institution”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> performing a legitimate government function.

The circumstance that a state is suable does not necessarily mean that it is liable; on the other hand, it can never be held liable if it does not first consent to be sued. Liability is not conceded by the mere fact that the state has allowed itself to be sued. When the state does waive its sovereign immunity, it is only giving the plaintiff the chance to prove, if it can, that the defendant is liable.<br></blockquote><br>Also, in <i>Republic v. Villasor</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> where the issuance of an alias writ of execution directed against the funds of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to satisfy a final and executory judgment was nullified, the Court said:<br><br><blockquote>xxx The universal rule that where the State gives its consent to be sued by private parties either by general or special law, it may limit claimant’s action “only up to the completion of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution” and that the power of the Courts ends when the judgment is rendered, since government funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy such judgments, is based on obvious considerations of public policy. Disbursements of public funds must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by law. The functions and public services rendered by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed or disrupted by the diversion of public funds from their legitimate and specific objects, as appropriated by law.</blockquote><br>The UP correctly submits here that the garnishment of its funds to satisfy the judgment awards of actual and moral damages (including attorney’s fees) was not validly made if there was no special appropriation by Congress to cover the liability. It was, therefore, legally unwarranted for the CA to agree with the RTC’s holding in the order issued on April 1, 2003 that no appropriation by Congress to allocate and set aside the payment of the judgment awards was necessary because “there (were) already an appropriations (<i>sic</i>) earmarked for the said project.”82 The CA and the RTC thereby unjustifiably ignored the legal restriction imposed on the trust funds of the Government and its agencies and instrumentalities to be used <i>exclusively</i> to fulfill the purposes for which the trusts were created or for which the funds were received except upon express authorization by Congress or by the head of a government agency in control of the funds, and subject to pertinent budgetary laws, rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Indeed, an appropriation by Congress was required before the judgment that rendered the UP liable for moral and actual damages (including attorney’s fees) would be satisfied considering that such monetary liabilities were not covered by the “appropriations earmarked for the said project.” The Constitution strictly mandated that “(n)o money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><center><b>II <br>COA must adjudicate private respondents’ claim<br>before execution should proceed</b></center><br>The execution of the monetary judgment against the UP was within the primary jurisdiction of the COA.

The settlement of the monetary claim was still subject to the primary jurisdiction of the COA despite the final decision of the RTC having already validated the claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> As such, Stern Builders and dela Cruz as the claimants had no alternative except to first seek the approval of the COA of their monetary claim.<br><br>On its part, the RTC should have exercised utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness in dealing with the motions for execution against the UP and the garnishment of the UP’s funds. The RTC had no authority to direct the immediate withdrawal of any portion of the garnished funds from the depository banks of the UP. By eschewing utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness in dealing with the execution and garnishment, and by authorizing the withdrawal of the garnished funds of the UP, the RTC acted beyond its jurisdiction, and all its orders and issuances thereon were void and of no legal effect, specifically: (<i>a</i>) the order Judge Yadao issued on January 3, 2007 allowing Stern Builders and dela Cruz to withdraw the deposited garnished amount; (<i>b</i>) the order Judge Yadao issued on January 16, 2007 directing DBP to forthwith release the garnish amount to Stern Builders and dela Cruz; (<i>c</i>) the sheriff’s report of January 17, 2007 manifesting the full satisfaction of the writ of execution; and (<i>d</i>) the order of April 10, 2007 deying the UP’s motion for the redeposit of the withdrawn amount. Hence, such orders and issuances should be struck down without exception.<br><br>Nothing extenuated Judge Yadao’s successive violations of Presidential Decree No. 1445. She was aware of Presidential Decree No. 1445, considering that the Court circulated to all judges its Administrative Circular No. 10-2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> issued on October 25, 2000, enjoining them “to observe utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness in the issuance of writs of execution to satisfy money judgments against government agencies and local government units” precisely in order to prevent the circumvention of Presidential Decree No. 1445, as well as of the rules and procedures of the COA, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>In order to prevent possible circumvention of the rules and procedures of the Commission on Audit, judges are hereby enjoined to observe utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness in the issuance of writs of execution to satisfy money judgments against government agencies and local government units.</b><br><br>Judges should bear in mind that in Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego (31 SCRA 617, 625 [1970]), this Court explicitly stated:<br><br><blockquote>“The universal rule that where the State gives its consent to be sued by private parties either by general or special law, it may limit claimant’s action ‘only up to the completion of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution’ and that the power of the Court ends when the judgment is rendered, since government funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy such judgments, is based on obvious considerations of public policy. Disbursements of public funds must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by law. The functions and public services rendered by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed or disrupted by the diversion of public funds from their legitimate and specific objects, as appropriated by law.</blockquote><br><b>Moreover, it is settled jurisprudence that upon determination of State liability, the prosecution, enforcement or satisfaction thereof must still be pursued in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in P.D. No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (Department of Agriculture v. NLRC, 227 SCRA 693, 701-02 [1993] citing Republic vs. Villasor, 54 SCRA 84 [1973]). All money claims against the Government must first be filed with the Commission on Audit which must act upon it within sixty days. Rejection of the claim will authorize the claimant to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court on <i>certiorari</i> and in effect, sue the State thereby (P.D. 1445, Sections 49-50).</b> <br><br>However, notwithstanding the rule that government properties are not subject to levy and execution unless otherwise provided for by statute (Republic v. Palacio, 23 SCRA 899 [1968]; Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego, supra) or municipal ordinance (Municipality of Makati v. Court of Appeals, 190 SCRA 206 [1990]), the Court has, in various instances, distinguished between government funds and properties for public use and those not held for public use. Thus, in Viuda de Tan Toco v. Municipal Council of Iloilo (49 Phil 52 [1926]), the Court ruled that “[w]here property of a municipal or other public corporation is sought to be subjected to execution to satisfy judgments recovered against such corporation, the question as to whether such property is leviable or not is to be determined by the usage and purposes for which it is held.” The following can be culled from Viuda de Tan Toco v. Municipal Council of Iloilo:<br><br><b>1. Properties held for public uses – and generally everything held for governmental purposes – are not subject to levy and sale under execution against such corporation. The same rule applies to funds in the hands of a public officer and taxes due to a municipal corporation.</b><br><br>2. Where a municipal corporation owns in its proprietary capacity, as distinguished from its public or government capacity, property not used or used for a public purpose but for quasi-private purposes, it is the general rule that such property may be seized and sold under execution against the corporation.<br><br>3. Property held for public purposes is not subject to execution merely because it is temporarily used for private purposes. If the public use is wholly abandoned, such property becomes subject to execution. This Administrative Circular shall take effect immediately and the Court Administrator shall see to it that it is faithfully implemented.</blockquote><br>Although Judge Yadao pointed out that neither the CA nor the Court had issued <i>as of then</i> any writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the release or withdrawal of the garnished amount, she did not need any writ of injunction from a superior court to compel her obedience to the law. The Court is disturbed that an experienced judge like her should look at public laws like Presidential Decree No. 1445 dismissively instead of loyally following and unquestioningly implementing them. That she did so turned her court into an oppressive bastion of mindless tyranny instead of having it as a true haven for the seekers of justice like the UP.<br><br><center><b>III<br>Period of appeal did not start without effective<br>service of decision upon counsel of record;<br><i>Fresh-period</i> rule announced in<br><i>Neypes v.

At stake in the UP’s plea for equity was the return of the amount of P16,370,191.74 illegally garnished from its trust funds. Obstructing the plea is the finality of the judgment based on the supposed tardiness of UP’s appeal, which the RTC declared on September 26, 2002. The CA upheld the declaration of finality on February 24, 2004, and the Court itself denied the UP’s petition for review on that issue on May 11, 2004 (G.R. No. 163501). The denial became final on November 12, 2004.<br><br>It is true that a decision that has attained finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and cannot be modified in any respect,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and whether the modification is made by the court that rendered it or by this Court as the highest court of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Public policy dictates that once a judgment becomes final, executory and unappealable, the prevailing party should not be deprived of the fruits of victory by some subterfuge devised by the losing party.

They based their finding on the fact that only six days remained of the UP’s reglementary 15-day period within which to file the notice of appeal because the UP had filed a motion for reconsideration on January 16, 2002 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the RTC’s decision the UP received on January 7, 2002; and that because the denial of the motion for reconsideration had been served upon Atty. Felimon D. Nolasco of the UPLB Legal Office on May 17, 2002, the UP had only until May 23, 2002 within which to file the notice of appeal.<br><br>The UP counters that the service of the denial of the motion for reconsideration upon Atty. Nolasco was defective considering that its counsel of record was not Atty. Nolasco of the UPLB Legal Office but the OLS in Diliman, Quezon City; and that the period of appeal should be reckoned from May 31, 2002, the date when the OLS received the order. The UP submits that the filing of the notice of appeal on June 3, 2002 was well within the reglementary period to appeal.<br><br>We agree with the submission of the UP.<br><br>Firstly, the service of the denial of the motion for reconsideration upon Atty. Nolasco of the UPLB Legal Office was invalid and ineffectual because he was admittedly not the counsel of record of the UP. The rule is that it is on the counsel and not the client that the service should be made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> That counsel was the OLS in Diliman, Quezon City, which was served with the denial only on May 31, 2002. As such, the running of the remaining period of six days resumed only on June 1, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> rendering the filing of the UP’s notice of appeal on June 3, 2002 timely and well within the remaining days of the UP’s period to appeal.<br><br>Verily, the service of the denial of the motion for reconsideration could only be validly made upon the OLS in Diliman, and no other. The fact that Atty. Nolasco was in the employ of the UP at the UPLB Legal Office did not render the service upon him effective. It is settled that where a party has appeared by counsel, service must be made upon such counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Service on the party or the party’s employee is not effective because such notice is not notice in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> This is clear enough from Section 2, second paragraph, of Rule 13, <i>Rules of Court</i>, which explicitly states that: “If any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court. Where one counsel appears for several parties, he shall only be entitled to one copy of any paper served upon him by the opposite side.” As such, the period to appeal resumed only on June 1, 2002, the date following the service on May 31, 2002 upon the OLS in Diliman of the copy of the decision of the RTC, not from the date when the UP was notified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the declaration of finality of the judgment of the RTC, being devoid of factual and legal bases, is set aside.<br><br>Secondly, even assuming that the service upon Atty. Nolasco was valid and effective, such that the remaining period for the UP to take a timely appeal would end by May 23, 2002, it would still not be correct to find that the judgment of the RTC became final and immutable thereafter due to the notice of appeal being filed too late on June 3, 2002.<br><br>In so declaring the judgment of the RTC as final against the UP, the CA and the RTC applied the rule contained in the second paragraph of Section 3, Rule 41 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> to the effect that the filing of a motion for reconsideration interrupted the running of the period for filing the appeal; and that the period resumed upon notice of the denial of the motion for reconsideration. For that reason, the CA and the RTC might not be taken to task for strictly adhering to the rule then prevailing.<br><br>However, equity calls for the retroactive application in the UP’s favor of the <i>fresh-period rule</i> that the Court first announced in mid-September of 2005 through its ruling in <i>Neypes v.

For the UP, the fresh period of 15-days counted from service of the denial of the motion for reconsideration would end on June 1, 2002, which was a Saturday. Hence, the UP had until the next working day, or June 3, 2002, a Monday, within which to appeal, conformably with Section 1 of Rule 22, <i>Rules of Court,</i> which holds that: “If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day.”<br><br><center><b>IV <br>Awards of monetary damages,<br>being devoid of factual and legal bases,<br>did not attain finality and should be deleted<br></b></center><br>Section 14 of Article VIII of the Constitution prescribes that express findings of fact and of law should be made in the decision rendered by any court, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14. No decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.<br><br>No petition for review or motion for reconsideration of a decision of the court shall be refused due course or denied without stating the legal basis therefor.</blockquote><br>Implementing the constitutional provision in civil actions is Section 1 of Rule 36, <i>Rules of Court, viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Rendition of judgments and final orders</i>. — A judgment or final order determining the merits of the case shall be in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based, signed by him, and filed with the clerk of the court. (1a)</blockquote><br>The Constitution and the <i>Rules of Court</i> apparently delineate two main essential parts of a judgment, namely: the<i> body</i> and the <i>decretal portion</i>. Although the latter is the controlling part,106 the importance of the former is not to be lightly regarded because it is there where the court clearly and distinctly states its findings of fact and of law on which the decision is based. To state it differently, one without the other is ineffectual and useless. The omission of either inevitably results in a judgment that violates the letter and the spirit of the Constitution and the <i>Rules of Court.</i><br><br>The term <i>findings of fact </i>that must be found in the body of the decision refers to statements of fact, not to conclusions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Unlike in pleadings where ultimate facts alone need to be stated, the Constitution and the <i>Rules of Court</i> require not only that a decision should state the ultimate facts but also that it should specify the supporting evidentiary facts, for they are what are called the findings of fact.<br><br>The importance of the findings of fact and of law cannot be overstated. The reason and purpose of the Constitution and the <i>Rules of Court</i> in that regard are obviously to inform the parties why they win or lose, and what their rights and obligations are. Only thereby is the demand of due process met as to the parties. As Justice Isagani A. Cruz explained in<i> Nicos Industrial Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is a requirement of due process that the parties to a litigation be informed of how it was decided, with an explanation of the factual and legal reasons that led to the conclusions of the court. The court cannot simply say that judgment is rendered in favor of X and against Y and just leave it at that without any justification whatsoever for its action. The losing party is entitled to know why he lost, so he may appeal to a higher court, if permitted, should he believe that the decision should be reversed. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is especially prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal.</blockquote><br>Here, the decision of the RTC justified the grant of actual and moral damages, and attorney’s fees in the following terse manner, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>xxx The Court is not unmindful that due to defendants’ unjustified refusal to pay their outstanding obligation to plaintiff, the same suffered losses and incurred expenses as he was forced to re-mortgage his house and lot located in Quezon City to Metrobank (Exh. “CC”) and BPI Bank just to pay its monetary obligations in the form of interest and penalties incurred in the course of the construction of the subject project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup></blockquote><br>The statement that “due to defendants’ unjustified refusal to pay their outstanding obligation to plaintiff, the same suffered losses and incurred expenses as he was forced to re-mortgage his house and lot located in Quezon City to Metrobank (Exh. “CC”) and BPI Bank just to pay its monetary obligations in the form of interest and penalties incurred in the course of the construction of the subject project” was only a conclusion of fact and law that did not comply with the constitutional and statutory prescription. The statement specified no detailed expenses or losses constituting the P5,716,729.00 actual damages sustained by Stern Builders in relation to the construction project or to other pecuniary hardships. The omission of such expenses or losses directly indicated that Stern Builders did not prove them at all, which then contravened Article 2199, <i>Civil Code</i>, the statutory basis for the award of actual damages, which entitled a person to an adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss suffered by him as he <i>has duly proved</i>. As such, the actual damages allowed by the RTC, being bereft of factual support, were speculative and whimsical. Without the clear and distinct findings of fact and law, the award amounted only to an <i>ipse dixit</i> on the part of the RTC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> and did not attain finality.<br><br>There was also no clear and distinct statement of the factual and legal support for the award of moral damages in the substantial amount of P10,000,000.00. The award was thus also speculative and whimsical. Like the actual damages, the moral damages constituted another judicial <i>ipse dixit,</i> the inevitable consequence of which was to render the award of moral damages incapable of attaining finality. In addition, the grant of moral damages in that manner contravened the law that permitted the recovery of moral damages as the means to assuage “physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The contravention of the law was manifest considering that Stern Builders, as an artificial person, was incapable of experiencing pain and moral sufferings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Assuming that in granting the substantial amount of P10,000,000.00 as moral damages, the RTC might have had in mind that dela Cruz had himself suffered mental anguish and anxiety. If that was the case, then the RTC obviously disregarded his separate and distinct personality from that of Stern Builders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Moreover, his moral and emotional sufferings as the President of Stern Builders were not the sufferings of Stern Builders. Lastly, the RTC violated the basic principle that moral damages were not intended to enrich the plaintiff at the expense of the defendant, but to restore the plaintiff to his status quo ante as much as possible. Taken together, therefore, all these considerations exposed the substantial amount of P10,000,000.00 allowed as moral damages not only to be factually baseless and legally indefensible, but also to be unconscionable, inequitable and unreasonable.<br><br>Like the actual and moral damages, the P150,000.00, plus P1,500.00 per appearance, granted as attorney’s fees were factually unwarranted and devoid of legal basis. The general rule is that a successful litigant cannot recover attorney’s fees as part of the damages to be assessed against the losing party because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Prior to the effectivity of the present <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil Code</span>, indeed, such fees could be recovered only when there was a stipulation to that effect. It was only under the present <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil Code</span> that the right to collect attorney’s fees in the cases mentioned in Article 2208<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Civil Code</span> came to be recognized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Nonetheless, with attorney’s fees being allowed in the concept of actual damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> their amounts must be factually and legally justified in the body of the decision and not stated for the first time in the decretal portion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Stating the amounts only in the dispositive portion of the judgment is not enough;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> a rendition of the factual and legal justifications for them must also be laid out in the body of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>That the attorney’s fees granted to the private respondents did not satisfy the foregoing requirement suffices for the Court to undo them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> The grant was ineffectual for being contrary to law and public policy, it being clear that the express findings of fact and law were intended to bring the case within the exception and thereby justify the award of the attorney’s fees. Devoid of such express findings, the award was a conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the absence of findings of fact and of any statement of the law and jurisprudence on which the awards of actual and moral damages, as well as of attorney’s fees, were based was a fatal flaw that invalidated the decision of the RTC only as to such awards. As the Court declared in <i>Velarde v. Social Justice Society,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> the failure to comply with the constitutional requirement for a clear and distinct statement of the supporting facts and law “is a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction” and that “(d)ecisions or orders issued in careless disregard of the constitutional mandate are a patent nullity and must be struck down as void.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> The other item granted by the RTC (<i>i.e</i>., P503,462.74) shall stand, subject to the action of the COA as stated herein.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the petition for review on certiorari; <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals under review; <b>ANNULS</b> the orders for the garnishment of the funds of the University of the Philippines and for the release of the garnished amount to Stern Builders Corporation and Servillano dela Cruz; and <b>DELETES</b> from the decision of the Regional Trial Court dated November 28, 2001 for being void only the awards of actual damages of P5,716,729.00, moral damages of P10,000,000.00, and attorney's fees of P150,000.00, plus P1,500.00 per appearance, in favor of Stern Builders Corporation and Servillano dela Cruz.<br><br>The Court <b>ORDERS</b> Stem Builders Corporation and Servillano dela Cruz to redeposit the amount of P16,370,191.74 within 10 days from receipt of this decision.<br><br>Costs of suit to be paid by the private respondents.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.&nbsp; </b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Leonardo-De Castro, (Acting Chairperson), Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr.</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Administrative Circular No. 10-2000 dated October 25, 2000.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 39-54; penned by Associate Justice Ruben T.
