Nos. 175418-20) as trustee for the holders of said notes.&nbsp; Pursuant to the said Indenture, the notes are due in 2006 and Bayantel shall pay interest on them semi-annually.&nbsp; Bayantel managed to make two interest payments, on January 15, 2000 and July 15, 2000, before it defaulted on its obligation.<br><br>Foreseeing the impossibility of further meeting its obligations, Bayantel sent, in October 2001, a proposal for the restructuring of its debts to the Bank Creditors and the Holders of Notes.&nbsp; To facilitate the negotiations between Bayantel and its creditors, an Informal Steering Committee was formed composed of Avenue Asia Investments, L.P., Avenue Asia International, Ltd., Avenue Asia Special Situations Fund II, L.P., Avenue Asia Capital Partners, L.P. (petitioners in G.R. Nos. 175418-20) and Van Eck Global Opportunity Masterfund, Ltd.&nbsp; The members of the Informal Steering Committee are the assignees of the unsecured credits extended to Bayantel by J.P. Morgan Europe, Ltd., Bayerische Landesbank Singapore Branch and Deutsche Bank AG, London in the total principal amount of US$13,637,485.20.&nbsp; They are holders, as well, of the Notes issued by Bayantel pursuant to the Indenture dated July 22, 1999.<br><br>In its initial proposal called the “First Term Sheet,” Bayantel suggested a 25% write-off of the principal owing to the Holders of Notes.&nbsp; The Informal Steering Committee rejected the idea, but accepted Bayantel’s proposal to pay the restructured debt, <i>pari passu</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> out of its cash flow.&nbsp; This pari passu or equal treatment of debts, however, was opposed by the Bank Creditors who invoked their security interest under the Assignment Agreement.<br><br>Bayantel continued to pay reduced interest on its debt to the Bank Creditors but stopped paying the Holders of Notes starting July 17, 2000.&nbsp; By May 31, 2003, Bayantel’s total indebtedness had reached US$674 million or P35.928 billion in unpaid principal and interest, based on the prevailing conversion rate of US$1 = P53.282.&nbsp; Out of its total liabilities, Bayantel allegedly owes 43.2% or US$291 million (P15.539 billion) to the Holders of the Notes.<br><br>On July 25, 2003, The Bank of New York, as trustee for the Holders of the Notes, wrote Bayantel an Acceleration Letter declaring immediately due and payable the principal, premium interest, and other monetary obligations on all outstanding Notes.&nbsp; Then, on July 30, 2003, The Bank of New York filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> for the corporate rehabilitation of Bayantel upon the instructions of the Informal Steering Committee.<br><br>On August 8, 2003, the Pasig RTC, Branch 158, issued a Stay Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which directed, among others, the suspension of all claims against Bayantel and required the latter’s creditors and other interested parties to file a comment or opposition to the petition.&nbsp; The court appointed Dr. Conchita L.

Noval classified Bayantel’s debts into three: (1) those owed to secured Bank Creditors pursuant to the Omnibus Agreements (Omnibus Creditors) in the total&nbsp; amount of US$334 million or P17.781 billion; (2) those owed to Holders of the Senior Notes and Bank Creditors combined (Chattel Creditors), comprising US$625 million, of which US$473 million (P25.214 billion) is principal and US$152 million (P8.106 billion) is accrued unpaid interest; and (3) those that Bayantel owed to persons other than Financial Creditors/unsecured creditors in the amount of US$49 million or P2.608 billion.<br><br>According to The Bank of New York, out of the US$674 million that respondent owes its creditors under groups 2 and 3 above, the amount outstanding under the Senior Notes represent 43.2% of its liabilities as of May 31, 2003.&nbsp; Subsequently, negotiations for the restructuring of Bayantel’s debt reached an impasse when the Informal Steering Committee insisted on a <i>pari passu</i> treatment of the claims of both secured and unsecured creditors.<br><br>Meanwhile, on January 20, 2004, Bayantel filed a “Motion to Include Radio Communications Philippines, Inc.

SP No. 87100.&nbsp; This was accepted by the Court of Appeals, Seventh Division, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated March 29, 2005.&nbsp; Then, in the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated June 10, 2005, the Court of Appeals, First Division, ordered the consolidation of CA-G.R. SP No. 87111 with 87100 and the transmittal of the records of the three cases to the Seventh Division.<br><br>Meanwhile, on January 10, 2005, Atty. Noval submitted to the Rehabilitation Court an Implementing Term Sheet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to serve as a guide for Bayantel’s Rehabilitation.&nbsp; The same was approved in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated March 15, 2005.&nbsp; In the same Order, the Rehabilitation Court appointed Avenue Asia Investments L.P. and Export Development Canada to represent the unsecured and secured creditors, respectively, in the Monitoring Committee.<br><br>On May 26, 2005, Bayantel filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 89894 in the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Said petition assailed the Rehabilitation Court’s Orders dated November 9, 2004 and March 15, 2005, for purportedly conferring upon the Monitoring Committee, powers of management and control over its operations.<br><br><b><i><u>The Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R. Nos. 87100, 87111 and 87203&nbsp; </u></i></b><br><br>In the assailed August 18, 2006 Decision, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petitions in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 87100, 87111 and 87203 for lack of merit.&nbsp; The appellate court upheld the Rehabilitation Court’s determination of Bayantel’s sustainable debt at US$325 million payable in 19 years.&nbsp; It rejected the Receiver’s proposal to set the sustainable debt at US$370 million payable in 15 years, and the proposal of the Avenue Asia Capital Group to set it at US$471 million payable in 12 years.<br><br>The Court of Appeals agreed with the Rehabilitation Court that it is reasonable to adopt a level of sustainable debt that approximates respondent Bayantel’s proposal because the latter is in the best position to determine the level of sustainable debt that it can manage.&nbsp; It found Bayantel’s proposal more credible considering that it was prepared using “updated financial information with realistic cash flow figures.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; The appellate court noted that Bayantel’s proposal was drafted without regard for its status as a “niche player” in the telecommunications market and after factoring the cost of reorganization.&nbsp; In contrast, it expressed concern that the proposals submitted by Avenue Asia Capital Group and the Receiver might eventually leave Bayantel with an unworkable financial debt-to-revenue ratio.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also confirmed the Rehabilitation Court’s authority to approve, reject, substitute, or even change the rehabilitation plans submitted by the Receiver and the parties.&nbsp; It upheld the trial court in adopting the Receiver’s recommendation to limit the equity conversion of Bayantel’s unsustainable debt to 40% of its paid-up capital.&nbsp; This percentage, the appellate court explains, is consistent with the constitutional limitation on the allowable foreign equity in Filipino corporations.&nbsp; It also maintained the write-off of penalties and default interest and recomputation of Bayantel’s past due interest, as a valid exercise of discretion by the Rehabilitation Court under the <u>Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitatio</u>n (Interim Rules).&nbsp; The appellate court negated any violation of the <i>pari passu</i> principle with the use of these measures since they shall apply to all classes of creditors.<br><br>As to the claim of the secured creditors in CA-G.R. SP No. 87203, the Court of Appeals ruled that while rehabilitation is ongoing, the sole control over the security on the receivables and cash flow of Bayantel is vested in the Rehabilitation Court.&nbsp; To allow otherwise would not only violate the Stay Order but interfere as well with the duty of the Receiver to “take possession, control and custody of the debtor’s assets.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Ultimately, the Court of Appeals ruled that preference in payment cannot be accorded the secured creditors since preference applies only in liquidation proceedings.<br><br>Discontented, The Bank of New York and the Avenue Asia Capital Group (petitioners in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 87100 and 87111) filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Said motion was, however, denied in the Resolution dated November 8, 2006.<br><br>In the meantime, Express Investments III Private Ltd. and Export Development Canada had filed before this Court a Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari of the Court of Appeals Decision docketed as G.R. Nos. 174457-59.&nbsp; According to petitioners, the other secured creditors who were also petitioners in CA-G.R. SP No. 87203 had not remained in contact with them and had not authorized them to file further petitions on their behalf.<br><br>On December 28, 2006, The Bank of New York and the Avenue Asia Capital Group also filed their own Petition for Review on Certiorari which was docketed as G.R. Nos. 175418-20.<br><br><b><i><u>The Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 89894</u></i></b><br><br>In CA-G.R. SP No. 89894, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision dated October 27, 2006 declaring null and void the November 9, 2004 and March 15, 2005 Orders of the Rehabilitation Court insofar as they defined the powers and functions of the Monitoring Committee.<br><br>The appellate court found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Rehabilitation Court for conferring upon the Monitoring Committee the power to modify, reverse or overrule the proposals of Bayantel’s Board of Directors relative to operations.&nbsp; It stressed that the Committee’s functions are confined to monitoring and overseeing the operations of Bayantel to ensure its compliance with the terms and conditions of the Rehabilitation Plan.&nbsp; To conform therewith, the appellate court restated the Committee’s powers as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The Monitoring Committee shall participate with the Receiver in monitoring and overseeing the operations of Bayantel to ensure compliance by Bayantel with the terms and conditions of the Rehabilitation Plan. In the event Bayantel fails to meet any of the milestones under the Rehabilitation Plan or fails to comply with any material provision thereunder, the Monitoring Committee may, by majority vote, <b>recommend</b> modifications, revisions and substitutions of the following items:<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals likewise approved of the Implementing Term Sheet, clarifying that the same is not intended to address every contingency that may arise in the implementation of the Plan.&nbsp; It assured that any doubt in the interpretation of the Term Sheet shall be resolved by the Rehabilitation Court.<br><br>Lastly, the appellate court affirmed the creation of a convertible debt instrument to cover the unsustainable portion of respondent’s debt.&nbsp; It perceives such instrument as a tool to generate surplus cash to satisfy Bayantel’s debt under Tranche B.&nbsp; As well, it serves as a buy-back scheme for the assignment and transfer of credits by the Financial Creditors in a manner that will not unduly burden Bayantel.<br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></center><br>On October 19, 2006, Express Investments III Private Ltd. and Export Development Canada<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> filed a Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari which was docketed as G.R.

Nos. 174457-59</u></i></b><br><br>The petitioners/secured creditors argue primarily that the pari passu treatment of creditors during rehabilitation has no basis in law.&nbsp; According to petitioners, all that Presidential Decree No. 902-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (PD 902-A) provides is the suspension of all claims against the debtor corporation during rehabilitation so that the Receiver can exercise his powers free from judicial or extrajudicial interference.&nbsp; If the equity policy is to be considered at all, they believe that the equity policy should be construed to accord creditors with similar rights or uniform treatment.&nbsp; In line with this, petitioners assert priority under the Assignment Agreement to receive from Bayantel’s surplus cash flow and to be paid in full, ahead of all other creditors.<br><br>The petitioners/secured creditors contend that the <i>pari passu</i> treatment of claims impairs the Omnibus Agreement and the Assignment Agreement.&nbsp; Such impairment, they posit, cannot be justified as a proper exercise of police power for three reasons: <i>first,</i> there is no law which authorizes the equal treatment of claims; <i>second</i>, there is no enabling law; and<i> third,</i> it is not reasonably necessary for the success of the rehabilitation.<br><br>Petitioners point out that the <u>Interim Rules</u> mandates instead that the rehabilitation plan shall give due regard to the interest of the secured creditors.&nbsp; For petitioners, the preservation of Bayantel’s chattels alone is inadequate to meet said requirement since the value thereof depreciates over time.&nbsp; They go on to invoke international practices on bankruptcy and rehabilitation which purportedly recognize the distinction between the rights of secured and unsecured creditors.&nbsp; Petitioners warn of dire consequences to the international credit standing of the Philippines, the financial market, and the influx of foreign investments if the <i>pari passu</i> principle would be upheld.&nbsp; Finally, petitioners maintain that a “Trigger Event”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> had occurred which rendered respondent’s obligations due and demandable.&nbsp; Thus, despite their failure to notify respondent of the alleged Events of Default, petitioners believe that they can rightfully proceed against the securities.<br><br>For its part, respondent Bayantel reasons that enforcing preference in payment at this stage of the rehabilitation would only disrupt the progress it has made so far.&nbsp; It assures petitioners that their security rights are adequately protected in case the collateral assets are disposed.&nbsp; Respondent adds that no single payment scheme is applicable in all rehabilitation proceedings and the peculiar circumstances of its case warrant the <i>pari passu</i> treatment of its creditors.<br><br><b><i><u>In G.R.

While Section 24(d), Rule 4 of the <u>Interim Rules</u> states that contracts and other arrangements between the debtor and its creditors shall be interpreted as continuing to apply, this holds true only to the extent that they do not conflict with the provisions of the plan.<br><br>Here, the stipulation in the Assignment Agreement to the effect that respondent Bayantel shall pay petitioners in full and ahead of other creditors out of its cash flow during rehabilitation directly impinges on the provision of the approved Rehabilitation Plan that “[t]he creditors of Bayantel, whether secured or unsecured, should be treated equally and on the same footing or <i>pari passu</i> until the rehabilitation proceedings is terminated in accordance with the <u>Interim Rules</u>.”<br><br>During rehabilitation, the only payments sanctioned by the <u>Interim Rules</u> are those made to creditors in accordance with the provisions of the plan.&nbsp; Pertinent to this is Section 5(b), Rule 4 of the <u>Interim Rules</u> which states that the terms and conditions of the rehabilitation plan shall include the manner of its implementation, <i>giving due regard to the interests of secured creditors</i>.&nbsp; This very phrase is what petitioners invoke as basis for&nbsp;&nbsp; demanding priority in payment out of respondent’s cash flow.<br><br>But petitioners’ reliance thereon is misplaced.<br><br>By definition, due regard means consideration in a degree appropriate to the demands of a particular case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, security interest is a form of interest in property which provides that the property may be sold on default in order to satisfy the obligation for which the security interest is given.&nbsp; Often, the term “lien” is used as a synonym, although lien most commonly refers only to interests providing security that are created by operation of law, not through agreement of the debtor and creditor.&nbsp; In contrast, the term “security interest” means any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Under the <u>Interim Rules</u>, the only pertinent reference to creditor security is found in Section 12, Rule 4 on relief from, modification or termination of stay order.&nbsp; Said provision states that the creditor is regarded as lacking adequate protection if it can be shown that: (a) the debtor fails or refuses to honor a pre-existing agreement with the creditor to keep the property insured; (b) the debtor fails or refuses to take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the property; or (c) the property has depreciated to an extent that the creditor is undersecured.<br><br>Upon a showing that the creditor is lacking in protection, the court shall order the rehabilitation receiver to take steps to ensure that the property is insured or maintained or to make payment or provide replacement security such that the obligation is fully secured.&nbsp; If such arrangements are not feasible, the court may allow the secured creditor to enforce its claim against the debtor.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the court may deny the creditor the foregoing remedies if allowing so would prevent the continuation of the debtor as a going concern or otherwise prevent the approval and implementation of a rehabilitation plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In the context of the foregoing provisions, “giving due regard to the interests of secured creditors” primarily entails ensuring that the property comprising the collateral is insured, maintained or replacement security is provided such that the obligation is fully secured.&nbsp; The reason for this rule is simple, in the event that the court terminates the proceedings for reasons other than the successful implementation of the plan, the secured creditors may foreclose the securities and the proceeds thereof applied to the satisfaction of their preferred claims.<br><br>When the <u>Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation</u> took effect on January 16, 2009, the “due regard” provision was amended to read:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 18. <i>Rehabilitation Plan</i>. – The rehabilitation plan shall include (a) the desired business targets or goals and the duration and coverage of the rehabilitation; (b) the terms and conditions of such rehabilitation which shall include the manner of its implementation, giving due regard to the interests of secured creditors such as, <b>but not limited, to the non-impairment of their security liens or interests</b>; x x x. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Despite the additional phrase, however, it is our view that the amendment simply amplifies the meaning of the “due regard provision” in the<u> Interim Rules</u>.&nbsp; First, the amendment exemplifies what giving “due regard to the interests of secured creditors” contemplates, mainly, the non-impairment of securities.&nbsp; At the same time, the specific reference to “security liens” and “interests,” separated by the disjunctive “or,” describes what “the interests of secured creditors” consist of.&nbsp; Again, lien pertains only to interests providing security that are created by operation of law while security interests include those acquired by contract for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability.&nbsp; Lastly, the addition of the phrase “but not limited” in the amendment shuns a rigid application of the provision by recognizing that “giving due regard to the interest of secured creditors” may be rendered in other ways than taking care that the security liens and interests of secured creditors are adequately protected.<br><br>In this case, petitioners Express Investments III Private Ltd. and Export Development Canada are concerned, not so much with the adequacy of the securities offered by respondent, but with the devaluation of such securities over time.&nbsp; Petitioners fear that the proceeds of respondent’s collateral would be insufficient to cover their claims in the event of liquidation.<br><br>On this point, suffice it to state that petitioners are not without any remedy to address a deficiency in securities, if and when it comes about.&nbsp; Under Section 12, Rule 4 of the <u>Interim Rules</u>, a secured creditor may file a motion with the Rehabilitation Court for the modification or termination of the stay order.&nbsp; If petitioners can show that arrangements to insure or maintain the property or to make payment or provide additional security therefor is not feasible, the court shall modify the stay order to allow&nbsp; petitioners to enforce their claim - that is, to foreclose the mortgage and apply the proceeds thereof to their claims.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the court may deny the creditor this remedy if allowing so would prevent the continuation of the debtor as a going concern or otherwise prevent the approval and implementation of a rehabilitation plan.<br><br>Indeed, neither the “due regard provision” nor contractual arrangements can shackle the Rehabilitation Court in determining the best means of rehabilitating a distressed corporation.&nbsp; Truth be told, the Rehabilitation Court may approve a rehabilitation plan even over the opposition of creditors holding a majority of the total liabilities of the debtor if, in its judgment, the rehabilitation of the debtor is feasible and the opposition of the creditors is manifestly unreasonable.&nbsp; In determining whether or not the opposition of the creditors is manifestly unreasonable, the court shall consider the following: (a) That the plan would likely provide the objecting class of creditors with compensation greater than that which they would have received if the assets of the debtor were sold by a liquidator within a three-month period; (b) That the shareholders or owners of the debtor lose at least their controlling interest as a result of the plan; and (c) The Rehabilitation Receiver has recommended approval of the plan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>According to the Liquidation Analysis<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> prepared by KPMG at the request of the Receiver, the Fair Market Value of respondent’s fixed assets is P18.7 billion while its Forced Liquidation Value is P9.3 billion.&nbsp; Together with cash and receivables in the amount of P911 million, respondent’s total liquidation assets are valued at P10.2 billion.&nbsp; From this amount, the estimated liquidation return to the Omnibus Creditors is&nbsp;&nbsp; P6,102,150,000 or approximately 52.9% of their claims in the amount of&nbsp; P11,539,776,000.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Chattel Creditors can recoup 61% of its claims.&nbsp; As regards the Unsecured Creditors, they will share in the pool of assets that respondents have acquired since 1998, which were not specifically registered under the Omnibus Agreement Mortgage Supplements.&nbsp; Said assets are estimated to have a value of P3.5 Billion.&nbsp; This accounts for 10.7% of the Unsecured Creditors’ claims.<br><br>Reckoned from these figures, the Receiver concluded that the shareholders shall receive nothing on respondent’s liquidation while the latter’s creditors can expect significantly less than full repayment.&nbsp; Moreover, regardless of whether the shareholders will lose at least their controlling interest as a result of the plan, petitioners, in their Memorandum dated April 30, 2009, have signified their conformity with the Court of Appeals decision to limit the conversion of the unsustainable debt to a maximum of 40% of the fully-paid up capital of respondent corporation.&nbsp; Lastly, the Receiver not only recommended the approval of the Plan by the Rehabilitation Court, he, himself, prepared it.&nbsp; The concurrence of these conditions renders the opposition of petitioners manifestly unreasonable.<br><br>As regards the second issue, petitioners submit that the <i>pari passu</i> treatment of claims offends the Contract Clause under the <u>1987 Constitution</u>.&nbsp; Article III, Section 10 of the Constitution mandates that no law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be passed.&nbsp; Any law which enlarges, abridges, or in any manner changes the intention of the parties, necessarily impairs the contract itself.&nbsp; And even when the change in the contract is done by indirection, there is impairment nonetheless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>At this point, it bears stressing that the non-impairment clause is a limitation on the exercise of legislative power and not of judicial or quasi-judicial power.&nbsp;

Meanwhile, Section 6(c) of PD 902-A provides for the appointment of a receiver of the subject property whenever necessary in order to preserve the rights of the parties and to protect the interest of the investing public and the creditors.&nbsp; Upon the appointment of such receiver, all actions for claims against the corporation pending before any court, tribunal, board or body shall be suspended accordingly.&nbsp; On the other hand, Section 5(d), PD 902-A expands the power of the Commission to allow the creation and appointment of a management committee to undertake the management of the corporation when there is imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or destruction of assets or other properties or paralyzation of the business of the corporation which may be prejudicial to the interest of minority stockholders, parties-litigants or the general public.<br><br>The underlying objective behind these provisions is to foster the rehabilitation of the debtor by insulating it against claims, preserving its assets and taking steps to ensure that the rights of all parties concerned are adequately protected.<br><br>This Court is convinced that the Court of Appeals ruled in accord with this policy when it upheld the Rehabilitation Court’s determination of respondent’s sustainable debt.&nbsp; We find the sustainable debt of US$325 million, spread over 19 years, to be a more realistically achievable amount considering respondent’s modest revenue projections.&nbsp; Bayantel projected a constant rise in its revenues at the range of 1.16%-4.91% with periodic reverses every two years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, petitioner’s proposal of a sustainable debt of US$471 million to be paid in 12 years and the Receiver’s proposal of US$370 million to be paid in 15 years betray an over optimism that could leave Bayantel with nothing to spend for its operations.<br><br>Next, petitioners contest the admission of respondent’s rehabilitation plan for being filed in violation of the <u>Interim Rules</u>.&nbsp; It is petitioner’s view that in a creditor-initiated petition for rehabilitation, the debtor may only submit either a comment or opposition but not its own rehabilitation plan.<br><br>We cannot agree.<br><br>Rule 4 of the <u>Interim Rules</u> treats of rehabilitation in general, without distinction as to who between the debtor and the creditor initiated the petition.&nbsp; Nowhere in said Rule is there any provision that prohibits the debtor in a creditor-initiated petition to file its own rehabilitation plan for consideration by the court.&nbsp; Quite the reverse, one of the functions and powers of the rehabilitation receiver under Section 14(m) of said Rule is to study the rehabilitation plan <i>proposed by the debtor </i>or any rehabilitation plan submitted during the proceedings, together with any comments made thereon.&nbsp; This provision makes particular reference to a debtor-initiated proceeding in which the debtor principally files a rehabilitation plan.&nbsp; In such case, the receiver is tasked, among other things, to study the rehabilitation plan presented by the debtor along with any rehabilitation plan submitted during the proceedings.&nbsp; This implies that the creditors of the distressed corporation, and even the receiver, may file their respective rehabilitation plans.&nbsp; We perceive no good reason why the same option should not be available, by analogy, to a debtor in creditor-initiated proceedings, which is also found in Rule 4 of the <u>Interim Rules.</u><br><br>Third, petitioners fault the Court of Appeals for ruling that the debt-to-equity conversion rate of 77.7%, as proposed by The Bank of New York, violates the Filipinization provision of the Constitution.&nbsp; Petitioners explain that the acquisition of shares by foreign Omnibus and Financial Creditors shall be done, both directly and indirectly in order to meet the control test principle under RA 7042<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> or the <u>Foreign Investments Act of 1991</u>.&nbsp; Under the proposed structure, said creditors shall own 40% of the outstanding capital stock of the telecommunications company on a direct basis, while the remaining 40% of shares shall be registered to a holding company that shall retain, on a direct basis, the other 60% equity reserved for Filipino citizens.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners maintain that it is only fair to impose upon the Omnibus and Financial Creditors a bigger equity conversion in Bayantel considering that petitioners will bear the bulk of the accrued interests and penalties to be written off.&nbsp; Initially, the Rehabilitation Court approved the Receiver’s recommendation to write-off interests and penalties in the amount of US$34,044,553.00.&nbsp; The Rehabilitation Court likewise ordered a re-computation of past due interest in accordance with the rate proposed by the Receiver.&nbsp; Following this, petitioners estimate the total unpaid accrued interest of Bayantel as of July 30, 2003 to be at US$140,098,750.66 while the Rehabilitation Court arrived at the total amount of past due interest and penalties of US$114,855,369.59 upon recomputation.&nbsp; This makes for a difference of US$25,243,381.07 which, petitioners claim, represents an additional write-off to be borne by them for a total write-off of US$59,287,934.07.<br><br>The provision adverted to is Article XII, Section 11 of the <u>1987 Constitution</u> which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 11.

Neither shall any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. The State shall encourage equity participation in public utilities by the general public. The participation of foreign investors in the governing body of any public utility enterprise shall be limited to their proportionate share in its capital, and all the executive and managing officers of such corporation or association must be citizens of the Philippines.</blockquote><br>This provision explicitly reserves to Filipino citizens control over public utilities, pursuant to an overriding economic goal of the 1987 Constitution: to “conserve and develop our patrimony” and ensure “a self-reliant and independent national economy <b><i>effectively controlled</i></b> by Filipinos.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>In the recent case of <i>Gamboa v.

Costs, expenses and taxes that may be due on the execution of the convertible debt instrument shall be charged to Bayantel as costs of the rehabilitation proceedings;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>iv. the Receiver shall devise a mode or procedure whereby<b> the Monitoring Committee can have immediate and direct access to any information</b> that the Receiver has obtained or received from Bayantel or the Monitoring Accountant <b>in regard to the management and business operations of Bayantel;</b><br><br>v. the trading of debt mentioned in the Implementing Term Sheet shall be governed by the pre-petition documents which do not conflict with the Decision of this Court and provided that no transfer shall be made to the Bayantel Group Companies, or any controlling shareholders thereof including Bayan Telecommunications Holdings Corporation (“BTHC”); however, any “buy back” scheme <b>as may be approved by the Monitoring Committee</b> and Bayantel shall be open to all creditors whether secured or unsecured;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals nullified the Orders dated November 9, 2004 and March 15, 2005 insofar as they defined the powers and functions of the Monitoring Committee.&nbsp; The appellate court ruled that the Rehabilitation Court committed grave abuse of discretion in vesting the Monitoring Committee with powers beyond monitoring and overseeing Bayantel’s operations.<br><br>Before us, petitioner contends that the Rehabilitation Court intended for the Monitoring Committee to exercise powers greater than those of the Receiver.<br><br>We find no merit in petitioner’s argument.<br><br>In the Decision dated June 28, 2004, the Rehabilitation Court discussed the circumstances surrounding the creation of the monitoring committee, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Both Bayantel and the Opposing Creditors contend that the Rehabilitation Receiver, under his Report and Recommendations, appear to be vested with too much discretion in the implementation of his proposed rehabilitation plan. Bayantel and the Opposing Creditors for one, argue against the power of the Rehabilitation Receiver to be able to further restructure Restructured Debt as well as the Rehabilitation Receiver's power relating to matters of Bayantel’s budget.<br><br>The [c]ourt wishes to stress that the Interim Rules prohibit the Rehabilitation Receiver from taking over the management and control of the company under rehabilitation, and limit his role to merely overseeing and monitoring the operations of the company (Section 14, Rule 4, Interim Rules). However, the [c]ourt also appreciates that the Rehabilitation Receiver must oversee the implementation of the rehabilitation plan as approved by the [c]ourt. In line with petitioner’s proposal,<b> the creation of a Monitoring Committee composed of representatives from all classes of the restructured debt addresses the concerns raised by the creditors.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>It can be gleaned from the foregoing that the Rehabilitation Court’s decision to form a monitoring committee was borne out of creditors’ concerns over the possession of vast powers by the Receiver.&nbsp; While the Rehabilitation Court was quick to delineate the Receiver’s authority, it nevertheless, underscored the value of his role in overseeing the implementation of the Plan.&nbsp; It was on this premise that the Rehabilitation Court appointed the Monitoring Committee - to “[address] the concerns raised by the creditors.” Yet, in its Orders dated November 9, 2004 and March 15, 2005, the Rehabilitation Court equipped the Monitoring Committee with powers well beyond those of the Receiver’s.&nbsp; Apart from control over respondent’s budget, the Monitoring Committee may also adopt, modify, revise or even substitute any other proposed actions by respondent’s Board of Directors, including, without limitation issuance of new shares, sale of core and non-core assets, change of business and others that will materially affect the terms and conditions of the rehabilitation plan and its implementation.&nbsp; Ironically, the court <i>a quo</i> diluted the seeming concentration of power in the hands of the Receiver but appointed a Committee possessed of even wider discretion over respondent’s operations.<br><br>From all indications, however, the tenor of the Rehabilitation Court’s Decision dated June 28, 2004 does not contemplate the creation of a Monitoring Committee with broader powers than the Receiver.&nbsp; As the name of the Monitoring Committee itself suggests, its job is “to watch, observe or check especially for a special purpose.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup>&nbsp; In the context of the Decision dated June 28, 2004, the fundamental task of the Monitoring Committee herein is to oversee the implementation of the rehabilitation plan as approved by the court.&nbsp; This should not be confused with the functions of the Receiver under the <u>Interim Rules</u> or a management committee under PD 902-A.<br><br>Under Section 14, Rule 4 of the <u>Interim Rules</u>, the Receiver shall not take over the management and control of the debtor but shall closely oversee and monitor its operations during the pendency of the rehabilitation proceeding.&nbsp; The Rehabilitation Receiver shall be considered an officer of the court and his core duty is to assess how best to rehabilitate the debtor and to preserve its assets pending the determination of whether or not it should be rehabilitated and to implement the approved plan.<br><br>It is a basic precept in Corporation Law that the corporate powers of all corporations formed under <i>Batas Pambansa Blg.</i> 68 or the <u>Corporation Code</u> shall be exercised, all business conducted and all property of such corporations controlled and held by the board of directors or trustees.&nbsp; Nonetheless, PD 902-A presents an exception to this rule.<br><br>Section 6(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> of PD 902-A empowers the Rehabilitation Court to create and appoint a management committee to undertake the management of corporations when there is imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or destruction of assets or other properties or paralyzation of business operations of such corporations which may be prejudicial to the interest of minority stockholders, parties-litigants or the general public.&nbsp; In the case of corporations supervised or regulated by government agencies, such as banks and insurance companies, the appointment shall be made upon the request of the government agency concerned.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Rehabilitation Court may, upon petition or <i>motu proprio</i>, appoint such management committee.<br><br>The management committee or rehabilitation receiver, board or body shall have the following powers: (1) to take custody of, and control over, all the existing assets and property of the distressed corporation; (2) to evaluate the existing assets and liabilities, earnings and operations of the corporation; (3) to determine the best way to salvage and protect the interest of the investors and creditors; (4) to study, review and evaluate the feasibility of continuing operations and restructure and rehabilitate such entities if determined to be feasible by the Rehabilitation Court; and (5) it may overrule or revoke the actions of the previous management and board of directors of the entity or entities under management notwithstanding any provision of law, articles of incorporation or by-laws to the contrary.<br><br>In this case, petitioner neither filed a petition for the appointment of a management committee nor presented evidence to show that there is imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or destruction of assets or other properties or paralyzation of business operations of respondent corporation which may be prejudicial to the interest of the minority stockholders, the creditors or the public.&nbsp; Unless petitioner satisfies these requisites, we cannot sanction the exercise by the Monitoring Committee of powers that will amount to management of respondent’s operations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court hereby <b>RESOLVES</b> to dispose of these consolidated petitions, as follows:<br><br>(1) The petition for review on certiorari in G.R.
