CEB-SP No. 01377. The Court of Appeals affirmed Resolution Nos. 0506543<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and 051646<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Civil Service Commission, which affirmed the Decision dated 20 September 2004 of the Civil Service Commission Regional Office (CSCRO) No. VI, Iloilo City, approving the appointment of respondent Atty. Rex G. Rojo (respondent) as <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> Secretary under a permanent status.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The facts as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>On March 18, 2004, [the] then Vice-Mayor Rex R. Jalandoon of La Carlota City, Negros Occidental appointed Atty. Rex G. Rojo (or Rojo) who had just tendered his resignation as member of the Sangguniang Panlungsod the day preceding such appointment, as Sangguniang Panlungsod Secretary. The status of the appointment was permanent. The next day, March 19, 2004, the Vice-Mayor submitted Rojo’s appointment papers to the Civil Service Commission Negros Occidental Field Office (CSCFO-Negros Occidental) for attestation. In a Letter dated March 24, 2004, the said CSCFO wrote Jalandoon to inform him of the infirmities the office found on the appointment documents, i.e. the Chairman of the Personnel Selection Board and the Human Resource Management Officer did not sign the certifications, the latter relative to the completeness of the documents as well as to the publication requirement. In view of the failure of the appointing authority to comply with the directive, the said CSCFO considered the appointment of Rojo permanently recalled or withdrawn, in a subsequent Letter to Jalandoon dated April 14, 2004.<br><br>Jalandoon deemed the recall a disapproval of the appointment, hence, he brought the matter to the CSC Regional Office No. 6 in Iloilo City, by way of an appeal. He averred that the Human Resource Management Officer of La Carlota City refused to affix his signature on Rojo’s appointment documents but nonetheless transmitted them to the CSCFO. Such transmittal, according to Jalandoon, should be construed that the appointment was complete and regular and that it complied with the pertinent requirements of a valid appointment. Before the said CSC Regional Office No. 6 [could resolve the appeal], the City of La Carlota represented by the newly elected mayor, Hon. Jeffrey P. Ferrer and the Sangguniang Panlungsod represented by the newly elected Vice-Mayor, Hon. Demie John C. Honrado, collectively, the petitioners herein, intervened. They argued that Jalandoon is not the real party in interest in the appeal but Rojo who, by his inaction, should be considered to have waived his right to appeal from the disapproval of his appointment; that the appointment was made within the period of the election ban prior to the May 14, 2004 national and local elections, and finally, that the resignation of Rojo as member of the Sangguniang Panlungsod is ineffective having not complied with the provision on quorum under Section 82(d) of R.A. No. 7160.<br><br>In a Decision dated September 20, 2004, the CSC Regional Office No. 6 reversed and set aside the CSCFO’s earlier ruling. On the argument of the intervenors that the former Vice-Mayor lacked legal personality to elevate the case on appeal, the regional office cited settled jurisprudence that the disapproval of an appointment affects the discretionary authority of the appointing authority. Hence, he alone may request for reconsideration of or appeal the disapproval of an appointment. The regional office likewise ruled that Rojo’s appointment on March 18, 2004 was made outside the period of the election ban from March 26 to May 9, 2004, and that his resignation from the Sangguniang Panlungsod was valid having been tendered with the majority of the council members in attendance (seven (7) out of the thirteen councilors were present). Considering that the appointment of Rojo sufficiently complied with the publication requirement, deliberation by the Personnel Selection Board, certification that it was issued in accordance with the limitations provided for under Section 325 of R.A. 7160 and that appropriations or funds are available for said position, the regional office approved the same. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Mayor Ferrer and Vice-Mayor Honrado appealed the foregoing Decision of the CSC Regional Office No. 6 to the Civil Service Commission (or Commission). On May 17, 2005, the Commission dismissed said appeal on the ground that the appellants were not the appointing authority and were therefore improper parties to the appeal. Despite its ruling of dismissal, the Commission went on to reiterate CSC Regional Office’s discussion on the appointing authority’s compliance with the certification and deliberation requirements, as well as the validity of appointee’s tender of resignation. x x x<br><br>It likewise denied the motion for reconsideration thereafter filed by the petitioners in a Resolution dated November 8, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals. On 14 September 2007, the Court of Appeals denied the petition, and affirmed Resolution Nos. 050654 and 051646 of the Civil Service Commission, dated 17 May 2005 and 8 November 2005, respectively. Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied in its Resolution dated 18 January 2008.<br><br>Hence, this petition for review.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>Citing Section 9(h), Article V of Presidential Decree No. 807<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> or the Civil Service Decree, the Court of Appeals held that “in the attestation of an appointment made by a head of agency, the duty of the Civil Service Commission does not go beyond ascertaining whether the appointee possesses the appropriate civil service eligibility and the minimum statutory qualifications.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In this case, the Court of Appeals found that respondent met the minimum qualifications for the position of Secretary of the Sanggunian, as enumerated under Section 469(b), Article I, Title V of the Local Government Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In fact, the Court of Appeals held that respondent is more than qualified for the position considering that respondent is a lawyer and an active member of the bar. Furthermore, the requirements for the appointment of respondent have been substantially complied with: (a) publication; (b) Personnel Selection Board deliberation; and (c) certification from the appropriate offices that appropriations or funds are available for the position. Thus, the Court of Appeals ruled that there was no sufficient reason for the Commission to disapprove respondent’s appointment.<br><br>On the issue of the lack of signature of the Human Resource Management Officer of La Carlota City on respondent’s appointment papers, the Court of Appeals held that such refusal of the officer to affix his signature should not affect the validity of the appointment. Otherwise, “it would be tantamount to putting the appointing power under the mercy of a department head who may without reason refuse to perform a ministerial function, as what happened in the instant case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also found that the appointment of respondent on 18 March 2004 did not violate the election ban period which was from 26 March to 9 May 2004. Furthermore, there was no substantial evidence to show that the appointment was a “midnight appointment.”<br><br>Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that since respondent possessed the minimum qualifications for the position of <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> Secretary, and the appointing authority has adequately complied with the other requirements for a valid appointment, then the Civil Service Commission’s approval of the appointment was only proper.<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>Petitioners raise the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li> WHETHER THE APPOINTMENT OF RESPONDENT AS <i>SANGGUNIANG PANLUNGSOD</i> SECRETARY VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROSCRIPTION AGAINST ELIGIBILITY OF AN ELECTIVE OFFICIAL FOR APPOINTMENT DURING HIS TENURE; and<br><br></li><li>WHETHER RESPONDENT’S APPOINTMENT AS <i>SANGGUNIANG PANLUNGSOD</i> SECRETARY WAS ISSUED CONTRARY TO EXISTING CIVIL SERVICE RULES AND REGULATIONS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b></center><br>Petitioners allege that respondent’s appointment as <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> Secretary is void. Petitioners maintain that respondent’s irrevocable resignation as a <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod </i>member was not deemed accepted when it was presented on 17 March 2004 during the scheduled regular session of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of La Carlota City, Negros Occidental for lack of quorum. Consequently, respondent was still an incumbent regular <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> member when then Vice Mayor Jalandoon appointed him as<i> Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> Secretary on 18 March 2004, which contravenes Section 7, Article IX-B of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The resolution of this case requires the application and interpretation of certain provisions of Republic Act No. 7160 (RA 7160), otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. The pertinent provisions read:<br><br><blockquote>Section 82. <i>Resignation of Elective Local Officials.</i> <b>(a) Resignations by elective local officials shall be deemed effective only upon acceptance by the following authorities</b>:<br><br>(1) The President, in the case of governors, vice-governors, and mayors and vice-mayors of highly urbanized cities and independent component cities;<br>(2) The governor, in the case of municipal mayors, municipal vice-mayors, city mayors and city vice-mayors of component cities;<br>(3) <b>The sanggunian concerned, in case of sanggunian members</b>; and<br>(4) The city or municipal mayor, in the case of barangay officials.<br><br>(b) Copies of the resignation letters of elective local officials, together with the action taken by the aforesaid authorities, shall be furnished the Department of Interior and Local Government.<br>(c) The resignation shall be deemed accepted if not acted upon by the authority concerned within fifteen (15) working days from receipt thereof.<br>(d)<b> Irrevocable resignations by sanggunian members shall be deemed accepted upon presentation before an open session of the sanggunian concerned and duly entered in its records</b>: <i>Provided, however</i>, That this subsection does not apply to sanggunian members who are subject to recall elections or to cases where existing laws prescribe the manner of acting upon such resignations.<br><br>Section 49. <b><i>Presiding Officer.</i></b> (a) The vice-governor shall be the presiding officer of the sangguniang panlalawigan; <b>the city vice-mayor, of the sangguniang panlungsod;</b> the municipal vice-mayor, of the sangguniang bayan; and the punong barangay, of the sangguniang barangay. <b>The presiding officer shall vote only to break a tie.</b><br><br>(b) In the event of the inability of the regular presiding officer to preside at a sanggunian session, the members present and consisting a quorum shall elect from among themselves a temporary presiding officer. He shall certify within ten (10) days from the passage of ordinances enacted and resolutions adopted by the sanggunian in the session over which he temporarily presided.<br><br>Section 52. <i>Sessions.</i> (a) On the first day of the session immediately following the election of its members, the sanggunian shall, by resolution, fix the day, time, and place of its regular sessions. The minimum number of regular sessions shall be once a week for the sangguniang panlalawigan, sangguniang panlungsod, and sangguniang bayan, and twice a month for the sangguniang barangay.<br><br>(b) When public interest so demands, special session may be called by the local chief executive or by a majority of the members of the sanggunian.<br>(c) All sanggunian sessions shall be open to the public unless a closed-door session is ordered by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members present, there being a quorum, in the public interest or for reasons of security, decency, or morality. No two (2) sessions, regular or special, may be held in a single day.<br>(d) In the case of special sessions of the sanggunian, a written notice to the members shall be served personally at the member’s usual place of residence at least twenty-four (24) hours before the special session is held. Unless otherwise concurred in by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the sanggunian members present, there being a quorum, no other matters may be considered at a special session except those stated in the notice.<br>(e) Each sanggunian shall keep a journal and record of its proceedings which may be published upon resolution of the sanggunian concerned.<br><br>Section 53.<b><i> Quorum</i></b>. (a) <b>A majority of all the members of the sanggunian who have been elected and qualified shall constitute a quorum to transact official business</b>. Should a question of quorum be raised during a session, the presiding officer shall immediately proceed to call the roll of the members and thereafter announce the results.<br><br>(b) Where there is no quorum, the presiding officer may declare a recess until such time as a quorum is constituted, or a majority of the members present may adjourn from day to day and may compel the immediate attendance of any member absent without justifiable cause by designating a member of the sanggunian, to be assisted by a member or members of the police force assigned in the territorial jurisdiction of the local government unit concerned, to arrest the absent member and present him at the session.<br>(c) If there is still no quorum despite the enforcement of the immediately preceding subsection, no business shall be transacted. The presiding officer, upon proper motion duly approved by the members present, shall then declare the session adjourned for lack of quorum.<br><br>Section 457. <b><i>Composition</i></b>. (a) <b>The sangguniang panlungsod, the legislative body of the city, shall be composed of the city vice-mayor as presiding officer, the regular sanggunian members, the president of the city chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the panlungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members.</b><br><br>(b) In addition thereto, there shall be three (3) sectoral representatives: one (1) from the women; and as shall be determined by the sanggunian concerned within ninety (90) days prior to the holding of the local elections, one (1) from the agricultural or industrial workers; and one (1) from the other sectors, including the urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, or disabled persons.<br>(c) The regular members of the sangguniang panlungsod and the sectoral representatives shall be elected in the manner as may be provided for by law. (Boldfacing supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioners insist that the vice-mayor, as presiding officer of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod,</i> should not be counted in determining whether a quorum exists. Excluding the vice-mayor, there were only six (6) out of the twelve (12) members of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> who were present on 17 March 2004. Since the required majority of seven (7) was not reached to constitute a quorum, then no business could have validly been transacted on that day including the acceptance of respondent’s irrevocable resignation.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent maintains that in this case, the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> consists of the presiding officer, ten (10) regular members, and two (2) ex-officio members, or a total of thirteen (13) members. Citing the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Opinion No. 28, s. 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated 17 April 2000, respondent asserts that the vice-mayor, as presiding officer, should be included in determining the existence of a quorum. Thus, since there were six (6) members plus the presiding officer, or a total of seven (7) who were present on the 17 March 2004 regular session of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, clearly there was a quorum such that the irrevocable resignation of respondent was validly accepted.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution mandates Congress to enact a local government code which provides, among others, the powers, functions and duties of local officials and all other matters relating to the organization and operation of the local government units. Section 3, Article X of the 1987 Constitution states:<br><br><blockquote><i>Section 3.</i> The Congress shall enact a local government code which shall provide for a more responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization with effective mechanism of recall, initiative, and referendum, allocate among the different local government units their powers, responsibilities, and resources, and provide for the qualifications, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, <b>powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all other matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, the Local Government Code “shall x x x provide for the x x x powers and functions and duties of local officials, and all other matters relating to the organization and operation of the local units.”<b> In short, whether a vice-mayor has the power, function or duty of a member of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> is determined by the Local Government Code.</b><br><br>On 10 October 1991, the Congress approved RA 7160 or the Local Government Code. Under RA 7160, the city vice-mayor, as presiding officer, is a member of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 49. <b><i>Presiding Officer. </i></b>(a) The vice-governor shall be the presiding officer of the sangguniang panlalawigan; <b>the city vice-mayor, of the sangguniang panlungsod</b>; the municipal vice-mayor, of the sangguniang bayan; and the punong barangay, of the sangguniang barangay. <b>The presiding officer shall vote only to break a tie.</b><br><br>(b) In the event of the inability of the regular presiding officer to preside at a sanggunian session, the members present and consisting a quorum shall elect from among themselves a temporary presiding officer. He shall certify within ten (10) days from the passage of ordinances enacted and resolutions adopted by the sanggunian in the session over which he temporarily presided.<br><br>Section 457. <b><i>Composition</i>. (a) The sangguniang panlungsod, the legislative body of the city, <u>shall be composed of the city vice-mayor as presiding officer</u>, the regular sanggunian members, the president of the city chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the panlungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members.</b><br><br>(b) In addition thereto, there shall be three (3) sectoral representatives: one (1) from the women; and as shall be determined by the sanggunian concerned within ninety (90) days prior to the holding of the local elections, one (1) from the agricultural or industrial workers; and one (1) from the other sectors, including the urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, or disabled persons.<br><br>(c) The regular members of the sangguniang panlungsod and the sectoral representatives shall be elected in the manner as may be provided for by law. (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>RA 7160 clearly states that the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> “<b>shall be composed of the city vice-mayor as presiding officer,</b> the regular sanggunian members, the president of the city chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the panlungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines “composed of” as “<b>formed of</b>” or “<b>consisting of.</b>” As the presiding officer, the vice-mayor can vote only to break a tie. In effect, the presiding officer votes when it matters the most, that is, to break a deadlock in the votes. Clearly, the vice-mayor, as presiding officer, is a “member” of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> considering that he is mandated under Section 49 of RA 7160 to vote to break a tie. To construe otherwise would create an anomalous and absurd situation where the presiding officer who votes to break a tie during a <i>Sanggunian</i> session is not considered a “member” of the <i>Sanggunian.</i><br><br>The Senate deliberations on Senate Bill No. 155 (Local Government Code) show the intent of the Legislature to treat the vice-mayor not only as the presiding officer of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> but also as a member of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>. The pertinent portions of the deliberations read:<br><br><blockquote><i>Senator Pimentel</i>. Before Senator Rasul and Senator Lina take the floor, Mr. President, may I reiterate this observation, that changes in the presiding officership of the local sanggunians are embodied for the municipality where the vice-mayor will now be the presiding officer of the sanggunian and the province where the vice-governor will now be the presiding officer. We did not make any change in the city because the city vice-mayor is already the presiding officer.<br><br><i>The President.</i> All right.<br><br>Senator Rasul, Senator Lina, and Senator Gonzales.<br><br><i>Senator Gonzales</i>. May I just add something to that statement of Senator Pimentel?<br><br><i>The President</i>. All right.<br><br><i>Senator Gonzales</i>. <b>Reading this bill, there is also a fundamental change in the sense that the provincial governor, the city mayor, the municipal mayor, as well as, the punong barangay are no longer members of their respective sanggunian; they are no longer members. Unlike before, when they were members of their respective sanggunian, now they are not only the presiding officers also, they are not members of their respective sanggunian.</b><br><br><i>Senator Pimentel.</i> May I thank Senator Gonzales for that observation. (Boldfacing supplied)</blockquote><br>During the deliberations, Senator Pimentel, the principal author of the the Local Government Code of 1991, clearly agrees with Senator Gonzales that the provincial governor, the city mayor, and the municipal mayor who were previously the presiding officers of their respective<i> sanggunian </i>are no longer the presiding officers under the proposed Local Government Code, and thus, they ceased to be members of their respective <i>sanggunian</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In the same manner that under the Local Government Code of 1991, the vice-governor, the city vice-mayor, and the municipal vice-mayor, as presiding officers of the<i> Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Sangguniang Panlungsod, Sangguniang Bayan</i>, respectively, are members of their respective <i>sanggunian.</i><br><br>In the 2004 case of <i>Zamora v. Governor Caballero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court interpreted Section 53 of RA 7160 to mean that the entire membership must be taken into account in computing the quorum of the sangguniang panlalawigan. The Court held:<br><br><blockquote>“Quorum” is defined as that number of members of a body which, when legally assembled in their proper places, will enable the body to transact its proper business or that number which makes a lawful body and gives it power to pass upon a law or ordinance or do any valid act. “Majority,” when required to constitute a quorum, means the number greater than half or more than half of any total. In fine, the <i>entire membership</i> must be taken into account in computing the quorum of the <i>sangguniang panlalawigan,</i> for while the constitution merely states that “majority of each House shall constitute a quorum,” Section 53 of the LGC is more exacting as it requires that the “majority of all members of the <i>sanggunian</i> . . . <i>elected and qualified</i>” shall constitute a quorum.<br><br>The trial court should thus have based its determination of the existence of a quorum on the total number of members of the Sanggunian without regard to the filing of a leave of absence by Board Member Sotto. The fear that a majority may, for reasons of political affiliation, file leaves of absence in order to cripple the functioning of the <i>sanggunian</i> is already addressed by the grant of coercive power to a mere majority of <i>sanggunian</i> members present when there is no quorum.<br><br>A <i>sanggunian </i>is a collegial body. Legislation, which is the principal function and duty of the<i> sanggunian</i>, requires the participation of all its members so that they may not only represent the interests of their respective constituents but also help in the making of decisions by voting upon every question put upon the body. The acts of only a part of the Sanggunian done outside the parameters of the legal provisions aforementioned are legally infirm, highly questionable and are, more importantly, null and void. And all such acts cannot be given binding force and effect for they are considered unofficial acts done during an unauthorized session.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>In stating that there were fourteen (14) members of the <i>Sanggunian</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court in <i>Zamora</i> clearly included the Vice-Governor, as presiding officer, as part of the entire membership of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> which must be taken into account in computing the quorum.<br><br>DILG Opinions, which directly ruled on the issue of whether the presiding officer should be included to determine the quorum of the <i>sanggunian</i>, have consistently conformed to the Court’s ruling in <i>Zamora.</i><br><br>In DILG Opinion No. 46, s. 2007, the Undersecretary for Local Government clearly stated that the vice-mayor is included in the determination of a quorum in the <i>sanggunian</i>. The DILG Opinion reads:<br><br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 360px; text-align: center;">DILG Opinion No. 46, s. 2007<br>02 July 2007<br></div><br>MESSRS. JAMES L. ENGLE,<br>FEDERICO O.

MENZON<br>Sangguniang Bayan Membership<br>Babatngon, Leyte<br><br>Dear Gentlemen and Lady:<br><br>This has reference to your earlier letter asking our opinion on several issues, which we quoted herein in toto:<br><br><blockquote><i>“(1) <b>What is the number that would determine the quorum of our sanggunian that has a total membership of eleven (11) including the vice-mayor?</b><br><br>(2) Are the resolutions adopted by a sanggunian without quorum valid?</i><br></blockquote><br>In reply to your first query, may we invite your attention to Section 446 (a) of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) which provides and we quote:<br><br><blockquote><i>“SECTION 446. Composition. – (a) The Sangguniang bayan, the legislative body of the municipality, shall be composed of the municipal vice-mayor as the presiding officer, the regular sangguniang members, the president of the municipal chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the pambayang pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members.”</i></blockquote><br>Based on the aforequoted provision, <b>the Sangguniang Bayan is composed of eight (8) regular members, the Liga ng mga Barangay President, the SK Federation President, the Vice-Mayor as Presiding Officer and the sectoral representatives.<br><br>Under the old Local Government Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 337), the Presiding Officer then of the sanggunian was the Mayor. Thus, there was a dilemma as to whether or not the Vice-Mayor, as Presiding Officer, is to be included in the determination of quorum in the Sangguniang Bayan. This issue was, however, resolved with the advent of the new Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) providing the aforequoted provision. Hence, the vice-mayor is included in the determination of a quorum in the sanggunian.</b><br><br>Based on the aforequoted provision, sectoral representatives are also included in the determination of quorum in the sangguniang bayan. Let it be noted however that sectoral representatives in the local sanggunian are, pursuant to Section 41 (c) of RA 7160 and Section 10 (b) of RA 9264, to be elected “<i>in a manner as may be provided for by law.</i>” Meantime however, Congress has yet to enact a law providing for the manner of electing sectoral representatives at the local sanggunians. Such being the case, sectoral representatives are not, in the meantime, included in the determination of quorum in the local sanggunians.<br><br><b>In view of the foregoing, the Sangguniang Bayan is composed of the 8 regular members, the Liga ng mga Barangay President and the SK Federation President as ex-officio members, and the Vice-Mayor as Presiding Officer. The total membership in that sanggunian, therefore, is eleven (11)</b>. Relative thereto, Section 53 of the Local Government Code of 1991 provides that a majority of all the members of the sanggunian who have been elected and qualified shall constitute a quorum to transact official business. “<i>Majority</i>” has been defined in <u>Santiago vs. Guingona, et al</u>. (G.R. No. 134577, 18 November 1998) as that which is greater than half of the membership of the body. Following the said ruling, since the total membership of the sanggunian being 11, 11 divided by 2 will give us a quotient of 5.5. Let it be noted however that a fraction cannot be considered as one whole vote, since it is physically and legally impossible to divide a person or even his vote into a fractional part. Accordingly, we have to go up to the next whole number which is 6. In this regard, 6 is more than 5.5 and therefore, more than one-half of the total membership of the sangguniang bayan in conformity with the jurisprudential definition of the term majority.

PIÑOL<br>Provincial Capitol Building<br>Province of Cotabato<br><br>Gentlemen:<br><br>This has reference to your earlier separate letters, which we herein consolidated, considering that they both pertain to one subject matter.<br><br>Per your letters, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan held its regular session on 12 January 2010 where the August Body embarked upon the approval of the Annual Budget. According to you, all fourteen (14) members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan attended said session, namely: <i>ten (10) regular Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members, three (3) ex-officio Sangguniang Panlalawigan Members and the Vice-Governor as the Presiding Officer.</i> You further represented that when said approval of the Annual Budget was submitted for votation of said August Body, the result was:<i> seven (7) members voted for the approval of the Annual Budget and six (6) voted against.</i><br><br>Specifically, you want us to shed light on the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>“1) Whether or not the august body has reached the required majority of all the members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as provided for in Sections 53 and 54 of the Local Government Code and in relation to Article 107 (g) of its Implementing Rules and Regulations?<br><br>2) <b>Whether or not the vice governor as the presiding officer is included in the count in determining the majority of all the members of the sangguniang panlalawigan to validly pass an appropriation ordinance.</b><br><br>3) Whether or not the board member who signed the Committee Report endorsing the 2010 Proposed Annual Performance Budget may withdraw without just and valid cause his signature thereon and vote against the approval thereof?<br><br>4) In the event that the Province operates under a re-enacted budget, what are those expenditures included in the term “essential operating expenses” that may be incurred by the Province?”<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>For the sanggunian to officially transact business, there should be a quorum. A quorum is defined by Section 53 of the Local Government Code of 1991 as referring to the presence of the majority of all the members of the sanggunian who have been duly elected and qualified. Relative thereto, generally, ordinary measures require for its enactment only the approval of a simple majority of the sanggunian members present, there being a quorum. These pertain to the normal transactions of the sanggunian which are approved by the sanggunian through a vote of simple majority of those present. On the other hand, there are certain measures where the Local Government Code requires for its approval the vote of majority of all the members who were duly elected and qualified. This is what we call approval by the qualified majority of the sanggunian. In this case, the approval is to be voted not just by the majority of those present in a session there being a quorum but by the majority of all the members of the sanggunian duly elected and qualified regardless of whether all of them were present or not in a particular session, there being a quorum.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><blockquote>In determining a quorum, Section 53 of the Local Government Code of 1991 provides that a majority of all the members of the sanggunian who have been elected and qualified shall constitute a quorum. Along this line, it bears to emphasize that per Section 467 (a) of the Local Government Code of 1991, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is a composite body where the Vice-Governor as Presiding Officer is a composite member thereof. As a composite member in the sangguniang panlalawigan, he is therefore included in the determination of a quorum.</blockquote><br>“Majority” has been defined by the Supreme Court in <i>Santiago vs. Guingona, et al.</i> (G.R. No. 134577, 18 November 1998) as that which is greater than half of the membership of the body or that number which is 50% + 1 of the entire membership. We note, however, that using either formula will give us the same result. To illustrate, using the 50% +1 formula, the 50% of a sanggunian composed of 14 members is 7. Hence 7 + 1 will give us a sum of 8. On the other hand, if we use the second formula which is that number greater than half, then 8, in relation to 7, is definitely greater than the latter. The simple majority of the sangguniang panlalawigan with fourteen (14) members where all of them were present in that particular session is therefore 8.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 360px;">Very truly yours,<br><br>(signed)<br>AUSTERE A.

In this case, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of La Carlota City, Negros Occidental is composed of the presiding officer, ten (10) regular members, and two (2) ex-officio members, or a total of thirteen (13) members. A majority of the 13 “members” of the<i> Sangguniang Panlungsod,</i> or at least seven (7) members, is needed to constitute a quorum to transact official business. Since seven (7) members (including the presiding officer) were present on the 17 March 2004 regular session of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod,</i> clearly there was a quorum such that the irrevocable resignation of respondent was validly accepted.<br><br>The <i>Perez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> case cited in the Dissenting Opinion was decided in 1969 prior to the 1987 Constitution, and prior to the enactment of RA 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991. In fact, the Perez case was decided even prior to the old Local Government Code which was enacted in 1983. In ruling that the vice-mayor is not a constituent member of the municipal board, the Court in the <i>Perez</i> case relied mainly on the provisions of Republic Act No. 305 (RA 305) creating the City of Naga and the amendatory provisions of Republic Act No. 2259<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (RA 2259) making the vice-mayor the presiding officer of the municipal board. Under RA 2259, the vice-mayor was the presiding officer of the City Council or Municipal Board in chartered cities. <b>However, RA 305 and 2259 were silent on whether as presiding officer the vice-mayor could vote.</b> Thus, the applicable laws in Perez are no longer the applicable laws in the present case.<br><br>On the other hand, the 2004 case of <i>Zamora v.

In stating that there were fourteen (14) members of the<i> Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> of Compostela Valley,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court in <i>Zamora</i> clearly included the Vice- Governor, as presiding officer, as part of the entire membership of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i> which must be taken into account in computing the quorum.<br><br>On the issue that respondent’s appointment was issued during the effectivity of the election ban, the Court agrees with the finding of the Court of Appeals and the Civil Service Commission that since the respondent’s appointment was validly issued on 18 March 2004, then the appointment did not violate the election ban period which was from 26 March to 9 May 2004. Indeed, the Civil Service Commission found that despite the lack of signature and certification of the Human Resource Management Officer of La Carlota City on respondent’s appointment papers, respondent’s appointment is deemed effective as of 18 March 2004 considering that there was substantial compliance with the appointment requirements, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Records show that Atty. Rojo’s appointment was transmitted to the CSC Negros Occidental Field Office on March 19, 2004 by the office of Gelongo without his certification and signature at the back of the appointment. Nonetheless, records show that the position to which Atty. Rojo was appointed was published on January 6, 2004. The qualifications of Atty. Rojo were deliberated upon by the Personnel Selection Board on March 5, 2004, attended by Vice Mayor Jalandoon as Chairman and Jose Leofric F. De Paola, SP member and Sonia P. Delgado, Records Officer, as members. Records likewise show that a certification was issued by Vice Mayor Jalandoon, as appointing authority, that the appointment was issued in accordance with the limitations provided for under Section 325 of RA 7160 and the said appointment was reviewed and found in order pursuant to Section 5, Rule V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Executive Order No. 292. Further, certifications were issued by the City Budget Officer, Acting City Accountant, City Treasurer and City Vice Mayor that appropriations or funds are available for said position.

With the phrase “<u>majority</u> of <u>all</u> the members of the sanggunian”, it is thus evident therefrom that the reckoning point should be the entire composition of the [of] the sangguniang bayan. In that regard, Section 446(a) of the Code enumerates the membership of the sangguniang bayan, consisting of “the municipal vice-mayor as presiding officer, the regular (elective) sanggunian members, the president of the municipal chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the pambayang pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members.” Clearly then, the vice-mayor, as presiding officer , is also a member of the sangguniang bayan and should, therefore,be included in determining the existence of a quorum since he is included in the enumeration as to who composes the said legislative body. As a matter of fact, in the case of GAMBOA VS. AGUIRRE AND ARANETA (G.R. No 134213, July 20, 1999), the Supreme Court recognized the membership of the vice-governor (vice-mayor) in the sangguniang panlalawigan (sangguniang bayan). Accordingly, since the Sangguniang Bayan of Naujan is composed of a total [of] eleven (11) member who have been duly elected and have qualified, at least six (6) of its members, including the vice-mayor, must be present during any session to be able to be able to muster a quorum and to legally transact official business.<br><br>Hoping that we have clarified the matter accordingly.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 480px;">Very truly yours,<br><br>ALFREDO S.

Since Rojo’s resignation could not have been validly accepted for lack of quorum, it was argued that Rojo continued to be an elective official who was ineligible for appointment to a public office under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b>Core Issue</b><br></center><br>I submit that the quorum issue in this case can be decided by approaching the problem from the point of the question: <b><i> to whom does the LGC vests the power to <u>accept</u> the resignation of a member of the sanggunian</i></b>?<br><br><center><b>My Position</b><br></center><br>Article 82 of the LGC reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 82.&nbsp; Resignation of Elective Officials. – (a)&nbsp; Resignations by elective local officials shall be deemed effective only upon acceptance by the following authorities:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The President, in case of governors, vice-governors, and mayors and vice-mayors of highly urbanized cities and independent component cities: </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The governor, in case of municipal mayors, municipal vice-mayors, city mayors and city vice-mayors of component cities:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The <b>sanggunian concerned</b>, in the case of sanggunian members; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(4) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">The city or municipal mayor, in case of barangay officials.<br><br></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>(d)&nbsp; Irrevocable resignations by sanggunian members shall be deemed accepted upon presentation before an open session of the <b>sanggunian concerned </b>and duly entered in its records:&nbsp; Provided, however, that this subsection does not apply to sanggunian members who are subject to recall elections or to cases where existing laws prescribe the manner of acting upon such resignations.</blockquote><br>This Article lays down the rule on resignations and identifies the authorities with the power to accept the resignation of particular local government officials.&nbsp; In the case of sanggunian members, that authority is the local legislative body – the <u>sanggunian concerned</u> of which the resignee is a member.<br><br>Before determining what the law exactly means in making reference to the “sanggunian concerned,” Section 53 of the LGC prescribes a quorum requirement before the sanggunian can validly transact its regular official business.<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 53</b>.<i> Quorum.</i> -<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">A <b>majority of all the members</b> of the sanggunian <b>who have been elected</b> and qualified shall constitute a quorum to transact official business.

As previously discussed, the present case does not involve the <b><u>active</u></b> role of the sanggunian as a body, exercising discretion whether to favorably vote or not; only the sanggunian’s <b>passive</b> role in accepting the resignation of a sanggunian member is involved.&nbsp; Recall in this regard that under Section 82 of the LGC, the authority to accept a resignation resides in the “sanggunian concerned,” and that under Article 457, the Vice-Mayor is part of the composition of the sanggunian.&nbsp; These distinctions can only lead to the conclusion that the Dissent cannot draw strength from <i>Perez</i> in determining whether there was quorum for the purpose of acting on petitioner Rojo’s resignation.<br><br>Contrary to the Dissent’s posture, we are not here giving additional role and prerogative to a presiding officer.&nbsp; Nor does our interpretation purport to give an active role to a presiding officer aside from what inheres to his position.&nbsp; We only resolve the issue of whether he should be counted for purposes of quorum on an administrative matter which relates to his duties and inheres to his position – a passive participation in the affairs of the body over which he actually presides and which he presumably influences for the common good.<br><br><b><i>The case of Zamora v.

The Court ruled in the affirmative, holding that -<br><br><blockquote>In fine, the entire membership must be taken into account in computing the quorum of the <i>sangguniang panlalawigan</i>, for while the constitution merely states that “majority of each House shall constitute a quorum,” Section 53 of the LGC is more exacting as it requires that the “majority of all members of the <i>sanggunian…elected and qualified</i>” shall constitute a quorum.<br><br>The difference in the wordings of the Constitution and the LGC is not merely “a matter of style and writing” as respondents would argue, but is actually a matter of “meaning and intention.”&nbsp; The qualification in the LGC that the majority be based on “those elected and qualified” was meant to allow sanggunians to function even when not all members thereof have been proclaimed.&nbsp; And, while the intent of the legislature in qualifying the quorum requirement was to allow <i>sanggunians</i> to function even when not all members thereof have been proclaimed and have assumed office, the provision necessarily applies when, after all the members of the <i>sanggunian </i>have assumed office, one or some of its members file for leave.&nbsp; What should be important then is the concurrence of election to and qualification for the office.&nbsp; And election to, and qualification as member of, a local legislative body are not altered by the simple expedient of filing a leave of absence.</blockquote><br>Read in light of <i>Zamora</i>, the fact that the Vice-Mayor is “elected” and, by virtue of his position, “qualifies” as the sanggunian’s presiding officer assumes added significance.<br><br>I submit, however, that the force of <i>Zamora</i> should not go beyond what the Court decreed in that case. The legality of the Vice-Mayor’s (as presiding officer) inclusion as member of the sanggunian did not confront <i>Zamora</i>, which simply <b><i>assumed</i></b> that the presiding officer was included in the determination of the number of members required to constitute a quorum. For emphasis,<i> Zamora</i> resolved the issue of whether an absent regular member should be included in quorum determination; it did not rule on the inclusion of the Vice-Mayor, as presiding officer, in the sanggunian membership.&nbsp; The latter issue is what the Court now resolves.<br><br>The sanggunian is a collegial body performing several legislative and non-legislative functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Under the LGC, the voting requirement for an affirmative action on the part of the sanggunian varies depending on the particular power to be exercised or the measure to be adopted.

The presiding officer’s innocuous inclusion as sanggunian member negatively impacts on the prohibition against him from voting since his mere inclusion affects the numerical value of the required voting level on a matter where generally and by law he has no concern.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons and qualifications, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petition and join the result of Justice Carpio’s ponencia.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Article IX-B, Section 7, 1987 Constitution.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; Article IX-B, Section 7, par. 1, 1987 Constitution.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Local Government Code, Section 49(a).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id., Section 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> For an offense under Republic Act No. 3019 or under the Revised Penal Code provisions on Bribery, (RA 3019, Section 12).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Section 18 (2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Estrada v.

Majority is defined as a number greater than half of the total.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, respondent’s resignation was read in a session where six councilors and the presiding officer were in attendance, while six other councilors were absent.&nbsp; Given that councilors in attendance and in <i>absentia</i> were equal in number, it became imperative to determine whether the presiding officer should be counted for purposes of quorum.&nbsp; If he is counted, there was a quorum of the <i>sanggunian</i> and respondent’s resignation was effective.&nbsp; If the presiding officer is not counted, there was no quorum and respondent’s resignation was ineffective.&nbsp; Thus, the resolution of the controversy is centered on whether the phrase “<b>of all the members of the <i>sanggunian</i></b>” in Section 53 of the LGC refers to the entire composition of the <i>sanggunian</i> (including the presiding officer) or only the members of the <i>sanggunian </i>(excluding the presiding officer).<br><br>While both parties referred to Section 457 of the LGC on the composition of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> for their respective positions, they emphasized different phrases thereof.&nbsp; For the respondent, the phrase “of all the members of the <i>sanggunian</i>” includes the presiding officer because he is included in the composition of the legislative body.&nbsp; Respondent’s reading of Section 457 thus made the following emphasis:<br><br><blockquote>Section 457.&nbsp; Composition.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The <i>sangguniang panglungsod</i>, the legislative body of the city, <b>shall be composed</b> of the city vice-mayor as presiding officer, the regular <i>sanggunian</i> members, the president of the city chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the panglungsod na pederasyon ng mga <i>sangguniang kabataan</i>, and the sectoral representatives, as members.<br></blockquote><br>Respondent contends that since the presiding officer is included in the composition of the<i> sanggunian</i>, he should also be included in the phrase “of all the members of the <i>sanggunian</i>.”<br><br>On the other hand, petitioners argue that the presiding officer is not included in the phrase “of all the members of the <i>sanggunian</i>” because Section 457 does not make him a member of the <i>sanggunian.</i>&nbsp; Petitioners’ reading of Section 457 focuses on the following qualifying phrases:<br><br><blockquote>Section 457.&nbsp; Composition.&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The <i>sangguniang panglungsod</i>, the legislative body of the city, shall be composed of the city vice-mayor as <b>presiding officer</b>, the regular <i>sanggunian</i> members, the president of the city chapter of the<i> liga ng mga barangay</i>, the president of the<i> panglungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan</i>, and the sectoral representatives,<b> as members</b>.</blockquote><br>In finding that the presiding officer is also a member counted for purposes of quorum, the <i>ponencia</i> cites three grounds:&nbsp; First, it argues that Section 457 clearly includes the presiding officer in the composition of the <i>sanggunian</i>, which necessarily means that he is a member counted for purposes of quorum.&nbsp; It submits that a contrary construction would present an anomaly where the presiding officer has the power to break a tie-vote in the sanggunian but is not counted for purposes of quorum.&nbsp; Second, it claims that in <i>Zamora v. Caballero</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> this Court has ruled that the Vice Governor, as Presiding Officer of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i>, is part of the entire membership of the <i>sanggunian</i> who must be included in computing the quorum.&nbsp; Finally, it cites DILG Opinion Nos. 46, S. 2007 and 13, S. 2010 stating that the vice-mayor is included in determining the quorum of the <i>sanggunian.</i><br><br>I regret that I cannot accept the ponencia's arguments.<br><br>I. <i> Section 457 of the LGC does not include the presiding officer as member of the sanggunian for purposes of quorum.</i><br><br>The vice-mayor is not a member, even if he is a part of the composition of the<i> Sanggunian.</i>&nbsp; Section 457 itself does <b>not</b> treat everyone in the composition of the <i>sanggunian</i> as members.&nbsp; Instead, Section 457 divides the composition of the <i>sanggunian</i> into two:&nbsp; (a) the vice-mayor, as presiding officer, and (b) the rest, as members.&nbsp; This division is not an imaginary distinction, but is dictated by the very language of Section 457:<br><br><blockquote>Section 457.&nbsp; <i>Composition.</i>&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The<i> sangguniang panglungsod,</i> the legislative body of the city, shall be composed of the city vice-mayor <b>as presiding officer</b>, the regular <i>sanggunian </i>members, the president of the city chapter of the <i>liga ng mga barangay,</i> the president of the<i> panglungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan,</i> and the sectoral representatives, <b>as members.</b></blockquote><br>There are two qualifying phrases in this provision – “as presiding officer” and “as members.”&nbsp; Qualifying phrases refer only to the words to which they are immediately associated.&nbsp; The phrase “as presiding officer” refers only to the vice- mayor, while the phrase “as members” refers only to the component parts that are mentioned after the phrase “as presiding officer.” Since the phrase “as members” cannot in any manner refer to the vice-mayor, Section 457 itself does not support the argument that the vice-mayor is a member that is included in the quorum requirement “<i>of all the members of the sanggunian.</i>”<br><br>With due respect, the <i>ponencia</i> ignores the foregoing division or distinction made by Section 457, by the expedient of ignoring the qualifiers found in Section 457.&nbsp; I am unable to accept this because no valid reason was offered for such selective reading of Section 457.&nbsp; It is a basic rule of statutory construction that all the words in a statute should be given effect; thus, the qualifiers cannot be disregarded without doing violence to the provision.<br><br>Going over the relevant provisions of the LGC, I find nothing therein which makes the presiding officer also a member of the legislative body.&nbsp; Even in Section 457, which respondent cites, the city vice-mayor was described as the presiding officer of the <i>sanggunian</i>, not a member:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 457.&nbsp; <i>Composition</i>. – (a) The sangguniang panlungsod, the legislative body of the city, shall be composed of the city vice-mayor as <b><i>presiding officer,</i></b> the regular sanggunian members, the president of the city chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the president of the panlungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; In addition thereto, there shall be three (3) sectoral representatives:&nbsp; one (1) from the women; and, as shall be determined by the sanggunian concerned within ninety (90) days prior to the holding of the local elections, one (1) from the agricultural or industrial workers; and one (1) from the other sectors, including the urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, or disabled persons.<br><br>(c)&nbsp; The regular members of the sangguniang panlungsod and the sectoral representatives shall be elected in the manner as may be provided by law.<br></blockquote><br>In describing the composition of the <i>sangguniang panlungsod</i>, Section 457 states that it has the city vice-mayor as its presiding officer, and the regular members, <i>ex officio</i> members, and sectoral representatives, as members.&nbsp; The present wording of the <i>sanggunian’s </i>composition, when read in conjunction with Section 53, which describes quorum as “a majority of <i>all </i>the members,” leads to the conclusion that quorum refers to the majority of the regular, <i>ex officio</i> and sectoral members.&nbsp; The word “all” was added to encompass the three kinds of members of the <i>sanggunian</i>; not to encompass its entire composition.<br><br>The inclusion of the presiding officer in the composition of the <i>sangguniang panlungsod</i> is only logical considering that the presiding officer is the administrative head of the said body.&nbsp; But his inclusion as such does not automatically make him a member thereof.&nbsp; If it was the lawmakers’ intent to make him a member of the body, the provision could have easily been made to reflect such an intention.<br><br>Moreover, the Local Government Code treats the vice-mayor and his office separately from that of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>.&nbsp; The powers and duties of the vice-mayor are provided in Section 456 and there is nothing therein which states or even suggests that he is also a member of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod:</i><br><br><blockquote><center>Article Two. – The City Vice-Mayor<br></center><br>SEC. 456.&nbsp;

Cuenco]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to the present case:&nbsp; The issue in said case was whether there was a quorum in a meeting attended by only 12 of 24 senators, one having been in the hospital while another was out of the country.&nbsp; This Court held that although the total membership of the Senate was 24, the presence of 12 members already constituted a quorum since the 24th member was outside the country and beyond the coercive power of the Senate.<br><br>In the instant case, there is nothing on record, save for respondents’ allegation, to show that Board Member Sotto was out of the country and to thereby conclude that she was outside the coercive power of the <i>Sanggunian</i> when the February 8 and 26, 2001 sessions were held.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Also, in <i>Avelino</i>, the legislative body involved was the Senate and the applicable rule on quorum was that embodied in Article VI, Section 10 of the 1935 Constitution x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The present case, however, involves a local legislative body, the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan </i>of Compostela Valley Province, and the applicable rule respecting quorum is found in Section 53 (a) of the LGC x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The difference in the wordings of the Constitution [on senate quorum requirement] and the LGC is not merely “a matter of style and writing” as respondents would argue, but is actually a matter of “meaning and intention.” <b> The qualification in the LGC that the majority be based on those “elected and qualified”</b> was meant to allow sanggunians to function even when not all members thereof have been proclaimed.&nbsp; And, while the intent of the legislature in qualifying the quorum requirement was to allow <i>sanggunians</i> to function even when not all members thereof have been proclaimed and have assumed office, the provision necessarily applies when, after all the members of the <i>sanggunian</i> have assumed office, one or some of its members file for leave.&nbsp; <i><b>What should be important then is the concurrence of election to and qualification for the office.</b></i>&nbsp; And election to, and qualification as member of, a local legislative body are not altered by the simple expedient of filing a leave of absence.<br><br>The trial court should thus have based its determination of the existence of a quorum on the <i>total number of members of the Sanggunian </i>without regard to the filing of a leave of absence by Board Member Sotto.&nbsp; The fear that a majority may, for reasons of political affiliation, file leaves of absence in order to cripple the functioning of the <i>sanggunian</i> is already addressed by the grant of coercive power to a mere majority of the <i>sanggunian</i> members present when there is no quorum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><i>Zamora</i> thus construed quorum of the <i>sanggunian</i> with respect to the phrase “<i>elected and qualified</i>” (vis-à-vis the yardstick of “within the coercive power of the body,” as pronounced in <i>Avelino)</i>.&nbsp; It did not in any manner resolve the issue of whether the phrase in Section 53 of the LGC “of all the members of the <i>sanggunian</i>” refers to the entire composition in Section 457, or only to the members.&nbsp; It was never the issue because the parties in<i> Zamora </i>presented their case upon the assumption that the presiding officer is counted in the quorum.&nbsp; Neither party raised this matter as an issue; hence, <i>Zamora</i> did not resolve the issue.<br><br><i>III. The DILG Opinions are mere declarations of the DILG <br>as the implementing agency; they do not bind the Court <br>which has the primary mandate and duty to interpret the law.</i><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> also cites the opinions emanating from the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) that the presiding officer is included for purposes of quorum.&nbsp; A careful reading of the DILG opinions, however, will expose them as totally bereft of rational and legal basis.&nbsp; These opinions, in a nutshell, state that the presiding officer is included in the quorum merely because he is included in the composition of the <i>sanggunian</i>.&nbsp; It assumes that everyone in the composition of the <i>sanggunian</i> is a member, which assumption is false because, as I have already discussed, Section 457 itself divides the composition of the <i>sanggunian </i>into two: (a) the vice-mayor, as presiding officer, and (b) the rest, as members.<br><br>While these DILG opinions may have persuasive effect because the DILG is the implementing agency of the LGC, this Court is not in any way bound by the DILG’s pronouncements, especially when its opinion does not seek to persuade a critical mind but merely makes a declaration.&nbsp; The Court has the primary duty to interpret the law, and any construction that is clearly erroneous cannot prevent the Court from exercising its duty.&nbsp; The court’s mandate is to the law and laws remain despite non-use, non-observance and customs to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The resistance to the idea that a presiding officer is not necessarily a member, may perhaps spring from the fact that in our political system, the two houses of Philippine Congress have presiding officers who are also members thereof.&nbsp; But what must be remembered is that the House Speaker and the Senate President were elected first and foremost as a congressman and a senator, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They are both elected by their respective constituency as legislators, just as the rest of the members of their respective houses.&nbsp; Their roles of presiding officers are mere adjuncts to their primary duties as legislators.<br><br>Clearly, the role of the vice-mayor is different from that of the House Speaker and the Senate President.&nbsp; Unlike the two, the vice-mayor is not elected as a legislator.&nbsp; He is elected as an executive or, more particularly, as the successor of the local chief executive.<br><br>Of interest and distinct nature is the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC).&nbsp; Article VIII, Sections 8 and 9 of the Constitution describes the Judicial and Bar Council and its duties, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 8 (1).&nbsp; A Judicial and Bar Council is hereby created under the supervision of the Supreme Court composed of the Chief Justice <b>as <i>ex officio</i> Chairman</b>, the Secretary of Justice, and a representative of the Congress <b><i>as ex officio Members</i></b>, a representative of the Integrated Bar, a professor of law, a retired Member of the Supreme Court, and a representative of the private sector.<br><br>(2)&nbsp;

Such appointments need no confirmation.<br><br>For the lower courts, the President shall issue the appointments within ninety days from the submission of the list.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>At first blush, Section 8(1) above may appear to be the same as that of Section 457 of the LGC on the composition of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod,</i> because it describes the Chief Justice “as Chairman” and the others as “Members”.&nbsp; However, unlike the LGC provisions on the <i>sanggunian</i>, the constitutional provisions on the JBC do not include any provision that refers solely to the members of the JBC.&nbsp; Thus, any apparent distinction between the JBC chairman and the JBC members is not real.&nbsp; The JBC chairman and the members are on equal terms in performing tasks within the JBC, as shown by the phrases “prepared <b>by the</b> Judicial and Bar Council,” “<b>the Council</b> shall have the principal function of recommending appointees,” and “<b>it</b> (the Council) may exercise such other functions and duties as the Supreme Court may assign to it.”&nbsp; This is in stark contrast to the LGC provisions on quorum and voting, which do not refer to “the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>” as a whole, but only to “all the members of the <i>sanggunian.</i>”<br><br>The conclusion that the vice-mayor, as presiding officer of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod,</i> is not a member for purposes of determining quorum also serves to protect the checks and balances between the executive and the legislative powers within the local government units.<br><br>It must be remembered that while the vice-mayor is not strictly speaking vested with executive power while he sits as presiding officer of the <i>sanggunian</i>, among his functions is to take over the chief executive position, either temporarily or permanently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; When he does take over, one of the crucial functions of the mayor that he assumes is the power to approve or veto<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> ordinances of the <i>sanggunian</i>.&nbsp; If we construe the quorum requirement to include the vice-mayor, the vice-mayor will occupy a unique position of affecting an ordinance both at the legislative and executive levels.&nbsp; The presiding officer could affect legislation by his attendance or absence from sessions (thereby creating or preventing a quorum for the transaction of official business) and, if he later occupies the mayoral seat in a temporary or permanent capacity, he would also affect the same legislation by approving or vetoing the <i>sanggunian’s </i>actions.&nbsp; This potential fusion of powers is inimical to the checks and balances created by the separation of powers between the local chief executives and the legislative bodies.<br><br>My position, in sum, is this:&nbsp; The presiding officer of the <i>sanggunian</i>, while a part thereof, is not a member that should be counted for purposes of quorum.&nbsp; He&nbsp; is not defined by the law as a member; and the law, by denying him the right to vote as the other members, does not make his presence determinative of whether the body can proceed to transact its business.&nbsp; Quorum is not just a matter of counting attendance.&nbsp; It requires counting the people that matter for the conduct of a valid business.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, to be a presiding officer, whether a member or not, is to be part of the <i>sanggunian</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp;
