They explain that the Mike Arroyo petition presents no actual controversy that necessitates the exercise by the Court of its power of judicial review, considering that he was not among those indicted for electoral sabotage in the 2007 national elections as the Comelec dismissed the case against him for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Anent the 2004 national elections, the Fact-Finding Team is yet to complete its investigation so Mike Arroyo’s apprehensions are merely speculative and anticipatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As to the GMA petition, respondents aver that any judgment of the Court will have no practical legal effect because an Information has already been filed against her in Branch 112, RTC of Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> With the filing of the Information, the RTC has already acquired jurisdiction over the case, including all issues relating to the constitutionality or legality of her preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Respondents also claim that the issues relating to the constitutionality and validity of the conduct of the preliminary investigation of GMA are best left to the trial court, considering that it involves questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Respondents add that considering that the RTC has concurrent jurisdiction to determine a constitutional issue, it will be practical for the Court to allow the RTC to determine the constitutional issues in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We do not agree.<br><br><i>Mootness</i><br><br>It cannot be gainsaid that for a court to exercise its power of adjudication, there must be an actual case or controversy, that is, one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The case must not be moot or academic or based on extra-legal or other similar considerations not cognizable by a court of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>A case becomes moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy so that a declaration on the issue would be of no practical use or value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, a case should not be dismissed simply because one of the issues raised therein had become moot and academic by the onset of a supervening event, whether intended or incidental, if there are other causes which need to be resolved after trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Here, the consolidated cases are not rendered moot and academic by the promulgation of the Joint Resolution by the Joint Committee and the approval thereof by the Comelec. It must be recalled that the main issues in the three petitions before us are the constitutionality and legality of the creation of the Joint Committee and the Fact-Finding Team as well as the proceedings undertaken pursuant thereto. The assailed Joint Order specifically provides that the Joint Committee was created for purposes of investigating the alleged massive electoral fraud during the 2004 and 2007 national elections. However, in the Fact-Finding Team’s Initial Report, the team specifically agreed that the report would focus on the irregularities during the 2007 elections. Also, in its November 18, 2011 Resolution, the Comelec, while directing the filing of information against petitioners Abalos and GMA, ordered that further investigations be conducted against the other respondents therein. Apparently, the Fact-Finding Team’s and Joint Committee’s respective mandates have not been fulfilled and they are, therefore, bound to continue discharging their duties set forth in the assailed Joint Order. Moreover, petitioners question the validity of the proceedings undertaken by the Fact-Finding Team and the Joint Committee leading to the filing of information, on constitutional grounds. We are not, therefore, barred from deciding on the petitions simply by the occurrence of the supervening events of filing an information and dismissal of the charges.<br><br><i>Jurisdiction over the validity of the <br>conduct of the preliminary investigation</i><br><br>This is not the first time that the Court is confronted with the issue of jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation and at the same time with the propriety of the conduct of preliminary investigation. In<i> Cojuangco, Jr. v. Presidential Commission on Good Government [PCGG]</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court resolved two issues, namely: (1) whether or not the PCGG has the power to conduct a preliminary investigation of the anti-graft and corruption cases filed by the Solicitor General against Eduardo Conjuangco, Jr. and other respondents for the alleged misuse of coconut levy funds; and (2) on the&nbsp; assumption that it has jurisdiction to conduct such a preliminary investigation, whether or not its conduct constitutes a violation of petitioner’s right to due process and equal protection of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The Court decided these issues notwithstanding the fact that Informations had already been filed with the trial court.<br><br>In <i>Allado v. Diokno</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> assailing the propriety of the issuance of a warrant of arrest, the Court could not ignore the undue haste in the filing of the information and the inordinate interest of the government in filing the same. Thus, this Court took time to determine whether or not there was, indeed, probable cause to warrant the filing of information. This, notwithstanding the fact that information had been filed and a warrant of arrest had been issued. Petitioners therein came directly to this Court and sought relief to rectify the injustice that they suffered.<br><br><i>Hierarchy of courts</i><br><br>Neither can the petitions be dismissed solely because of violation of the principle of hierarchy of courts. This principle requires that recourse must first be made to the lower-ranked court exercising concurrent jurisdiction with a higher court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over petitions for <i>certiorari,</i> prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto</i>, and <i>habeas corpus</i>. While this jurisdiction is shared with the Court of Appeals and the RTC, a direct invocation of this Court’s jurisdiction is allowed when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and especially set out in the petition, as in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In the consolidated petitions, petitioners invoke exemption from the observance of the rule on hierarchy of courts in keeping with the Court’s duty to determine whether or not the other branches of government have kept themselves within the limits of the Constitution and the laws, and that they have not abused the discretion given to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>It is noteworthy that the consolidated petitions assail the constitutionality of issuances and resolutions of the DOJ and the Comelec. The general rule is that this Court shall exercise only appellate jurisdiction over cases involving the constitutionality of a statute, treaty or regulation. However, such rule is subject to exception, that is, in circumstances where the Court believes that resolving the issue of constitutionality of a law or regulation at the first instance is of paramount importance and immediately affects the social, economic, and moral well-being of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> This case falls within the exception. An expeditious resolution of the issues raised in the petitions is necessary. Besides, the Court has entertained a direct resort to the Court without the requisite motion for reconsideration filed below or without exhaustion of administrative remedies where there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of the question and any further delay would prejudice the interests of the government or of the petitioners and when there is an alleged violation of due process, as in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> We apply the same relaxation of the Rules in the present case and, thus, entertain direct resort to this Court.<br><br><center><i>Substantive Issues</i></center><br><i>Bases for the Creation of the <br>Fact-Finding Team and Joint Committee</i><br><br>Section 2, Article IX-C of the 1987 Constitution enumerates the powers and functions of the Comelec. Paragraph (6) thereof vests in the Comelec the power to:<br><br><blockquote>(6) File, upon a verified complaint, or on its own initiative, petitions in court for inclusion or exclusion of voters; investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices.</blockquote><br>This was an important innovation introduced by the 1987 Constitution, because the above-quoted provision was not in the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The grant to the Comelec of the power to investigate and prosecute election offenses as an adjunct to the enforcement and administration of all election laws is intended to enable the Comelec to effectively insure to the people the free, orderly, and honest conduct of elections. The failure of the Comelec to exercise this power could result in the frustration of the true will of the people and make a mere idle ceremony of the sacred right and duty of every qualified citizen to vote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The constitutional grant of prosecutorial power in the Comelec was reflected in Section 265 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the <i>Omnibus Election Code</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Section 265. <i>Prosecution</i>. The Commission shall, through its duly authorized legal officers, have the exclusive power to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses punishable under this Code, and to prosecute the same. The Commission may avail of the assistance of other prosecuting arms of the government: <i>Provided, however</i>, That in the event that the Commission fails to act on any complaint within four months from his filing, the complainant may file the complaint with the office of the fiscal [public prosecutor], or with the Ministry [Department] of Justice for proper investigation and prosecution, if warranted.</blockquote><br>Under the above provision of law, the power to conduct preliminary investigation is vested exclusively with the Comelec. The latter, however, was given by the same provision of law the authority to avail itself of the assistance of other prosecuting arms of the government.64 Thus, under Section 2,65 Rule 34 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure, provincial and city prosecutors and their assistants are given continuing authority as deputies to conduct preliminary investigation of complaints involving election offenses under election laws and to prosecute the same. The complaints may be filed directly with them or may be indorsed to them by the petitioner or its duly authorized representatives.66<br><br>Thus, under the Omnibus Election Code, while the exclusive jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation had been lodged with the Comelec, the prosecutors had been conducting preliminary investigations pursuant to the continuing delegated authority given by the Comelec. The reason for this delegation of authority has been explained in<i> Commission on Elections v. Español</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The deputation of the Provincial and City Prosecutors is necessitated by the need for prompt investigation and dispensation of election cases as an indispensable part of the task of securing fine, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections. Enfeebled by lack of funds and the magnitude of its workload, the petitioner does not have a sufficient number of legal officers to conduct such investigation and to prosecute such cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote><br>Moreover, as we acknowledged in <i>People v. Basilla,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the prompt and fair investigation and prosecution of election offenses committed before or in the course of nationwide elections would simply not be possible without the assistance of provincial and city fiscals [prosecutors] and their assistants and staff members, and of the state prosecutors of the DOJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Section 265 of the Omnibus Election Code was amended by Section 43 of R.A. No. 9369,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 43.

Pursuant to the above constitutional and statutory provisions, and as will be explained further below, we find no impediment for the Comelec and the DOJ to create the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team for the purpose of conducting a thorough investigation of the alleged massive electoral fraud and the manipulation of election results in the 2004 and 2007 national elections relating in particular to the presidential and senatorial elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><i>Constitutionality of Joint-Order No. 001-2011</i><br><br><i>A. Equal Protection Clause</i><br><br>Petitioners claim that the creation of the Joint Committee and Fact- Finding Team is in violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution because its sole purpose is the investigation and prosecution of certain persons and incidents. They argue that there is no substantial distinction between the allegations of massive electoral fraud in 2004 and 2007, on the one hand, and previous and subsequent national elections, on the other hand; and no substantial distinction between petitioners and the other persons or public officials who might have been involved in previous election offenses. They insist that the Joint Panel was created to target only the Arroyo Administration as well as public officials linked to the Arroyo Administration. To bolster their claim, petitioners explain that Joint Order No. 001-2011 is similar to Executive Order No. 1 (creating the Philippine Truth Commission) which this Court had already nullified for being violative of the equal protection clause.<br><br>Respondents, however, refute the above contentions and argue that the wide array of the possible election offenses and broad spectrum of individuals who may have committed them, if any, immediately negate the assertion that the assailed orders are aimed only at the officials of the Arroyo Administration.<br><br>We agree with the respondents.<br><br>The equal protection clause is enshrined in Section 1, Article III of the Constitution which reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law,<b><i> nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br>The concept of equal protection has been laid down in<i> Biraogo v. Philippine Truth Commission of 2010</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><blockquote>One of the basic principles on which this government was founded is that of the equality of right which is embodied in Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution. The equal protection of the laws is embraced in the concept of due process, as every unfair discrimination offends the requirements of justice and fair play. It has been embodied in a separate clause, however, to provide for a more specific guaranty against any form of undue favoritism or hostility from the government. Arbitrariness in and general may be challenged on the basis of the due process clause. But if the particular act assailed partakes of an unwarranted partiality or prejudice, the sharper weapon to cut it down is the equal protection clause.<br><br>According to a long line of decisions, equal protection simply requires that all persons or things similarly situated should be treated alike, both as to rights conferred and responsibilities imposed. It requires public bodies and institutions to treat similarly-situated individuals in a similar manner. The purpose of the equal protection clause is to secure every person within a state's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by the express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through the state's duly-constituted authorities. In other words, the concept of equal justice under the law requires the state to govern impartially, and it may not draw distinctions between individuals solely on differences that are irrelevant to a legitimate governmental objective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote><br>Unlike the matter addressed by the Court’s ruling in <i>Biraogo v. Philippine Truth Commission of 2010</i>, Joint Order No. 001-2011 cannot be nullified on the ground that it singles out the officials of the Arroyo Administration and, therefore, it infringes the equal protection clause. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010 was expressly created for the purpose of investigating alleged graft and corruption during the Arroyo Administration since Executive Order No. 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> specifically referred to the “previous administration”; while the Joint Committee was created for the purpose of conducting preliminary investigation of election offenses during the 2004 and 2007 elections. While GMA and Mike Arroyo were among those subjected to preliminary investigation, not all respondents therein were linked to GMA as there were public officers who were investigated upon in connection with their acts in the performance of their official duties. Private individuals were also subjected to the investigation by the Joint Committee.<br><br>The equal protection guarantee exists to prevent undue favor or privilege. It is intended to eliminate discrimination and oppression based on inequality. Recognizing the existence of real differences among men, it does not demand absolute equality. It merely requires that all persons under like circumstances and conditions shall be treated alike both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>We once held that the Office of the Ombudsman is granted virtually plenary investigatory powers by the Constitution and by law and thus may, for every particular investigation, whether commenced by complaint or on its own initiative, decide how best to pursue each investigation. Since the Office of the Ombudsman is granted such latitude, its varying treatment of similarly situated investigations cannot by itself be considered a violation of any of the parties’ rights to the equal protection of the laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> This same doctrine should likewise apply in the present case.<br><br>Thus, as the constitutional body granted with the broad power of enforcing and administering all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum and recall,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and tasked to ensure free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the Comelec has the authority to determine how best to perform such constitutional mandate. Pursuant to this authority, the Comelec issues various resolutions prior to every local or national elections setting forth the guidelines to be observed in the conduct of the elections. This shows that every election is distinct and requires different guidelines in order to ensure that the rules are updated to respond to existing circumstances.<br><br>Moreover, as has been practiced in the past, complaints for violations of election laws may be filed either with the Comelec or with the DOJ. The Comelec may even initiate, <i>motu proprio,</i> complaints for election offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Pursuant to law and the Comelec’s own Rules, investigations may be conducted either by the Comelec itself through its law department or through the prosecutors of the DOJ. These varying procedures and treatment do not, however, mean that respondents are not treated alike. Thus, petitioners’ insistence of infringement of their constitutional right to equal protection of the law is misplaced.<br><br><i>B. Due Process</i><br><br>Petitioners claim that the Joint Panel does not possess the required cold neutrality of an impartial judge because it is all at once the evidence- gatherer, prosecutor and judge. They explain that since the Fact-Finding Team has found probable cause to subject them to preliminary investigation, it is impossible for the Joint Committee to arrive at an opposite conclusion. Petitioners likewise express doubts of any possibility that the Joint Committee will be fair and impartial to them as Secretary De Lima and Chairman Brillantes had repeatedly expressed prejudgment against petitioners through their statements captured by the media.<br><br>For their part, respondents contend that petitioners failed to present proof that the President of the Philippines, Secretary of Justice, and Chairman of the Comelec actually made the statements allegedly prejudging their case and in the context in which they interpreted them. They likewise contend that assuming that said statements were made, there was no showing that Secretary De Lima had tried to intervene in the investigation to influence its outcome nor was it proven that the Joint Committee itself had prejudged the case. Lastly, they point out that Joint Order No. 001-2011 created two bodies, the Fact-Finding Team and the Joint Committee, with their respective mandates. Hence, they cannot be considered as one.<br><br>We find for respondents.<br><br>It is settled that the conduct of preliminary investigation is, like court proceedings, subject to the requirements of both substantive and procedural due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Preliminary investigation is considered as a judicial proceeding wherein the prosecutor or investigating officer, by the nature of his functions, acts as a quasi-judicial officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The authority of a prosecutor or investigating officer duly empowered to preside over or to conduct a preliminary investigation is no less than that of a municipal judge or even an RTC Judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Thus, as emphasized by the <i>Court in Ladlad v. Velasco</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x We cannot emphasize too strongly that prosecutors should not allow, and should avoid, giving the impression that their noble office is being used or prostituted, wittingly or unwittingly, for political ends, or other purposes alien to, or subversive of, the basic and fundamental objective of serving the interest of justice evenhandedly, without fear or favor to any and all litigants alike, whether rich or poor, weak or strong, powerless or mighty. Only by strict adherence to the established procedure may public's perception of the impartiality of the prosecutor be enhanced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></blockquote><br>In this case, as correctly pointed out by respondents, there was no showing that the statements claimed to have prejudged the case against petitioners were made by Secretary De Lima and Chairman Brillantes or were in the prejudicial context in which petitioners claimed the statements were made. A reading of the statements allegedly made by them reveals that they were just responding to hypothetical questions in the event that probable cause would eventually be found by the Joint Committee.<br><br>More importantly, there was no proof or even an allegation that the Joint Committee itself, tasked to conduct the requisite preliminary investigation against petitioners, made biased statements that would convey to the public that the members were favoring a particular party. Neither did the petitioners show that the President of the Philippines, the Secretary of Justice or the Chairman of the Comelec intervened in the conduct of the preliminary investigation or exerted undue pressure on their subordinates to tailor their decision with their public declarations and adhere to a predetermined result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Moreover, insofar as the Comelec is concerned, it must be emphasized that the constitutional body is collegial. The act of the head of a collegial body cannot be considered as that of the entire body itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In equating the alleged bias of the above-named officials with that of the Joint Committee, there would be no arm of the government credible enough to conduct a preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>It must also be emphasized that Joint Order No. 001-2011 created two bodies, namely: (1) the Fact-Finding Team tasked to gather real, documentary and testimonial evidence which can be utilized in the preliminary investigation to be conducted by the Joint Committee; and (2) the Joint Committee mandated to conduct preliminary investigation. It is, therefore, inaccurate to say that there is only one body which acted as evidence-gatherer, prosecutor and judge.<br><br><i>C. Separation of powers </i><br><br>Petitioners claim that the Joint Panel is a new public office as shown by its composition, the creation of its own Rules of Procedure, and the source of funding for its operation. It is their position that the power of the DOJ to investigate the commission of crimes and the Comelec’s constitutional mandate to investigate and prosecute violations of election laws do not include the power to create a new public office in the guise of a joint committee. Thus, in creating the Joint Panel, the DOJ and the Comelec encroached upon the power of the Legislature to create public office.<br><br>Respondents dispute this and contend that the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team are not new public offices, but merely collaborations between two existing government agencies sharing concurrent jurisdiction. This is shown by the fact that the members of the Joint Panel are existing officers of the DOJ and the Comelec who exercise duties and functions that are already vested in them.<br><br>Again, we agree with respondents.<br><br>As clearly explained above, the Comelec is granted the power to investigate, and where appropriate, prosecute cases of election offenses. This is necessary in ensuring free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections. On the other hand, the DOJ is mandated to administer the criminal justice system in accordance with the accepted processes thereof consisting in the investigation of the crimes, prosecution of offenders and administration of the correctional system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> It is specifically empowered to “investigate the commission of crimes, prosecute offenders and administer the probation and correction system.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Also, the provincial or city prosecutors and their assistants, as well as the national and regional state prosecutors, are specifically named as the officers authorized to conduct preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Recently, the Comelec, through its duly authorized legal offices, is given the power, concurrent with the other prosecuting arms of the government such as the DOJ, to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Undoubtedly, it is the Constitution, statutes, and the Rules of Court and not the assailed Joint Order which give the DOJ and the Comelec the power to conduct preliminary investigation. No new power is given to them by virtue of the assailed order. As to the members of the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team, they perform such functions that they already perform by virtue of their current positions as prosecutors of the DOJ and legal officers of the Comelec. Thus, in no way can we consider the Joint Committee as a new public office.<br><br><i>D. Independence of the Comelec </i><br><br>Petitioners claim that in creating the Joint Panel, the Comelec has effectively abdicated its constitutional mandate to investigate and, where appropriate, to prosecute cases of violation of election laws including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices in favor of the Executive Department acting through the DOJ Secretary. Under the set-up, the Comelec personnel is placed under the supervision and control of the DOJ. The chairperson is a DOJ official. Thus, the Comelec has willingly surrendered its independence to the DOJ and has acceded to share its exercise of judgment and discretion with the Executive Branch.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Section 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution expressly describes all the Constitutional Commissions as independent. Although essentially executive in nature, they are not under the control of the President of the Philippines in the discharge of their respective functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The Constitution envisions a truly independent Comelec committed to ensure free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections and to serve as the guardian of the people’s sacred right of suffrage – the citizenry’s vital weapon in effecting a peaceful change of government and in achieving and promoting political stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Prior to the amendment of Section 265 of the Omnibus Election Code, the Comelec had the exclusive authority to investigate and prosecute election offenses. In the discharge of this exclusive power, the Comelec was given the right to avail and, in fact, availed of the assistance of other prosecuting arms of the government such as the prosecutors of the DOJ. By virtue of this continuing authority, the state prosecutors and the provincial or city prosecutors were authorized to receive the complaint for election offense and delegate the conduct of investigation to any of their assistants. The investigating prosecutor, in turn, would make a recommendation either to dismiss the complaint or to file the information. This recommendation is subject to the approval of the state, provincial or city prosecutor, who himself may file the information with the proper court if he finds sufficient cause to do so, subject, however, to the accused’s right to appeal to the Comelec.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Moreover, during the past national and local elections, the Comelec issued Resolutions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> requesting the Secretary of Justice to assign prosecutors as members of Special Task Forces to assist the Comelec in the investigation and prosecution of election offenses. These Special Task Forces were created because of the need for additional lawyers to handle the investigation and prosecution of election offenses.<br><br>Clearly, the Comelec recognizes the need to delegate to the prosecutors the power to conduct preliminary investigation. Otherwise, the prompt resolution of alleged election offenses will not be attained. This delegation of power, otherwise known as deputation, has long been recognized and, in fact, been utilized as an effective means of disposing of various election offense cases. Apparently, as mere deputies, the prosecutors played a vital role in the conduct of preliminary investigation, in the resolution of complaints filed before them, and in the filing of the informations with the proper court.<br><br>As pointed out by the Court in <i>Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency (BANAT) Party-List v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> the grant of exclusive power to investigate and prosecute cases of election offenses to the Comelec was not by virtue of the Constitution but by the Omnibus Election Code which was eventually amended by Section 43 of R.A. 9369. Thus, the DOJ now conducts preliminary investigation of election offenses concurrently with the Comelec and no longer as mere deputies. If the prosecutors had been allowed to conduct preliminary investigation and file the necessary information by virtue only of a delegated authority, they now have better grounds to perform such function by virtue of the statutory grant of authority. If deputation was justified because of lack of funds and legal officers to ensure prompt and fair investigation and prosecution of election offenses, the same justification should be cited to justify the grant to the other prosecuting arms of the government of such concurrent jurisdiction.<br><br>In view of the foregoing disquisition, we find no impediment for the creation of a Joint Committee. While the composition of the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team is dominated by DOJ officials, it does not necessarily follow that the Comelec is inferior. Under the Joint Order, resolutions of the Joint Committee finding probable cause for election offenses shall still be approved by the Comelec in accordance with the Comelec Rules of Procedure. This shows that the Comelec, though it acts jointly with the DOJ, remains in control of the proceedings. In no way can we say that the Comelec has thereby abdicated its independence to the executive department.<br><br>The text and intent of the constitutional provision granting the Comelec the authority to investigate and prosecute election offenses is to give the Comelec all the necessary and incidental powers for it to achieve the objective of holding free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> The Comelec should be allowed considerable latitude in devising means and methods that will insure the accomplishment of the great objective for which it was created.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> We may not agree fully with its choice of means, but unless these are clearly illegal or constitute gross abuse of discretion, this Court should not interfere.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Thus, Comelec Resolution No. 9266, approving the creation of the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team, should be viewed not as an abdication of the constitutional body’s independence but as a means to fulfill its duty of ensuring the prompt investigation and prosecution of election offenses as an adjunct of its mandate of ensuring a free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections.<br><br>Although it belongs to the executive department, as the agency tasked to investigate crimes, prosecute offenders, and administer the correctional system, the DOJ is likewise not barred from acting jointly with the Comelec. It must be emphasized that the DOJ and the Comelec exercise concurrent jurisdiction in conducting preliminary investigation of election offenses. The doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction means equal jurisdiction to deal with the same subject matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Contrary to the contention of the petitioners, there is no prohibition on simultaneous exercise of power between two coordinate bodies. What is prohibited is the situation where one files a complaint against a respondent initially with one office (such as the Comelec) for preliminary investigation which was immediately acted upon by said office and the re-filing of substantially the same complaint with another office (such as the DOJ). The subsequent assumption of jurisdiction by the second office over the cases filed will not be allowed. Indeed, it is a settled rule that the body or agency that first takes cognizance of the complaint shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of the others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> As cogently held by the Court in <i>Department of Justice v. Hon. Liwag</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br><blockquote>To allow the same complaint to be filed successively before two or more investigative bodies would promote multiplicity of proceedings. It would also cause undue difficulties to the respondent who would have to appear and defend his position before every agency or body where the same complaint was filed. This would lead hapless litigants at a loss as to where to appear and plead their cause or defense.<br><br>There is yet another undesirable consequence. There is the distinct possibility that the two bodies exercising jurisdiction at the same time would come up with conflicting resolutions regarding the guilt of the respondents.<br><br>Finally, the second investigation would entail an unnecessary expenditure of public funds, and the use of valuable and limited resources of Government, in a duplication of proceedings already started with the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></blockquote><br>None of these problems would likely arise in the present case. The Comelec and the DOJ themselves agreed that they would exercise their concurrent jurisdiction jointly. Although the preliminary investigation was conducted on the basis of two complaints – the initial report of the Fact-Finding Team and the complaint of Senator Pimentel – both complaints were filed with the Joint Committee. Consequently, the complaints were filed with and the preliminary investigation was conducted by only one investigative body. Thus, we find no reason to disallow the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction jointly by those given such authority. This is especially true in this case given the magnitude of the crimes allegedly committed by petitioners. The joint preliminary investigation also serves to maximize the resources and manpower of both the Comelec and the DOJ for the prompt disposition of the cases.<br><br>Citing the principle of concurrent jurisdiction, petitioners insist that the investigation conducted by the Comelec involving Radam and Martirizar bars the creation of the Joint Committee for purposes of conducting another preliminary investigation. In short, they claim that the exercise by the Comelec of its jurisdiction to investigate excludes other bodies such as the DOJ and the Joint Committee from taking cognizance of the case. Petitioners add that the investigation should have been conducted also by the Comelec as the 2007 cases of Radam and Martirizar include several John Does and Jane Does.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>While the Comelec conducted the preliminary investigation against Radam, Martirizar and other unidentified persons, it only pertains to election offenses allegedly committed in North and South Cotabato. On the other hand, the preliminary investigation conducted by the Joint Committee (involving GMA) pertains to election offenses supposedly committed in Maguindanao. More importantly, considering the broad power of the Comelec to choose the means of fulfilling its duty of ensuring the prompt investigation and prosecution of election offenses as discussed earlier, there is nothing wrong if the Comelec chooses to work jointly with the DOJ in the conduct of said investigation. To reiterate, in no way can we consider this as an act abdicating the independence of the Comelec.<br><br><i>Publication Requirement</i><br><br>In the conduct of preliminary investigation, the DOJ is governed by the Rules of Court, while the Comelec is governed by the 1993 Comelec Rules of Procedure. There is, therefore, no need to promulgate new Rules as may be complementary to the DOJ and Comelec Rules.<br><br>As earlier discussed, considering that Joint Order No. 001-2011 only enables the Comelec and the DOJ to exercise powers which are already vested in them by the Constitution and other existing laws, it need not be published for it to be valid and effective. A close examination of the Joint Committee’s Rules of Procedure, however, would show that its provisions affect the public. Specifically, the following provisions of the Rules either restrict the rights of or provide remedies to the affected parties, to wit: (1) Section 1 provides that “the Joint Committee will no longer entertain complaints from the public as soon as the Fact-Finding Team submits its final report, except for such complaints involving offenses mentioned in the Fact-Finding Team’s Final Report”; (2) Section 2 states that “the Joint Committee shall not entertain a Motion to Dismiss”; and (3) Section 5 provides that a Motion for Reconsideration may be availed of by the aggrieved parties against the Joint Committee’s Resolution. Consequently, publication of the Rules is necessary.<br><br>The publication requirement covers not only statutes but administrative regulations and issuances, as clearly outlined in <i>Tañada v. Tuvera:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br><blockquote>We hold therefore that all statutes, including those of local application and private laws, shall be published as a condition for their effectivity, which shall begin fifteen days after publication unless a different effectivity date is fixed by the legislature.<br><br>Covered by this rule are presidential decrees and executive orders promulgated by the President in the exercise of legislative powers whenever the same are validly delegated by the legislature or, at present, directly conferred by the Constitution.

With these supervening events, GMA further assails the validity of the proceedings that took place based on the following additional grounds: (1) the undue and unbelievable haste attending the Joint Committee’s conduct of the preliminary investigation, its resolution of the case, and its referral to and approval by the Comelec, taken in conjunction with the statements from the Office of the President, demonstrate a deliberate and reprehensible pattern of abuse of inalienable rights and a blatant disregard of the envisioned integrity and independence of the Comelec; (2) as it stands, the creation of the Joint Committee was for the singular purpose of railroading the proceedings in the prosecution of the petitioner and in flagrant violation of her right to due process and equal protection of the laws; (3) the proceedings of the Joint Committee cannot be considered impartial and fair, considering that respondents have acted as law enforcers, who conducted the criminal investigation, gathered evidence and thereafter ordered the filing of complaints, and at the same time authorized preliminary investigation based on the complaints they caused to be filed; (4) the Comelec became an instrument of oppression when it hastily approved the resolution of the Joint Committee even if two of its members were in no position to cast their votes as they admitted to not having yet read the voluminous records of the cases; and (5) flagrant and repeated violations of her right to due process at every stage of the proceedings demonstrate a deliberate attempt to single out petitioner through the creation of the Joint Committee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> <br><br>In their Supplement to the Consolidated Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> respondents accuse petitioners of violating the rule against forum shopping. They contend that in filing the Supplemental Petition before the Court, the Urgent Omnibus Motion <i>Ad Cautelam</i> with the RTC, and the Motion to Vacate<i> Ad Cautelam</i> with the Comelec, GMA raises the common issue of whether or not the proceedings before the Joint Committee and the Comelec are null and void for violating the Constitution. Respondents likewise claim that the issues raised in the supplemental petition are factual which is beyond the power of this Court to decide.<br><br>We cannot dismiss the cases before us on the ground of forum shopping.<br><br>Forum shopping is the act of a party against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum, of seeking another and possibly favorable opinion in another forum other than by appeal or the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> There can also be forum shopping when a party institutes two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same and related causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party’s chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>Indeed, petitioner GMA filed a Supplemental Petition before the Court, an Urgent Omnibus Motion <i>Ad Cautelam</i> before the RTC, and a Motion to Vacate <i>Ad Cautelam</i> before the Comelec, emphasizing the unbelievable haste committed by the Joint Committee and the Comelec in disposing of the cases before them. However, a plain reading of the allegations in GMA’s motion before the RTC would show that GMA raised the issue of undue haste in issuing the Joint Resolution only in support of her prayer for the trial court to hold in abeyance the issuance of the warrant of arrest, considering that her motion for reconsideration of the denial of her motion to be furnished copies of documents was not yet acted upon by the Joint Committee. If at all the constitutional issue of violation of due process was raised, it was merely incidental. More importantly, GMA raised in her motion with the RTC the finding of probable cause as she sought the judicial determination of probable cause which is not an issue in the petitions before us. GMA’s ultimate prayer is actually for the court to defer the issuance of the warrant of arrest. Clearly, the reliefs sought in the RTC are different from the reliefs sought in this case. Thus, there is no forum shopping.<br><br>With respect to the Motion to Vacate <i>Ad Cautelam</i> filed with the Comelec, while the issues raised therein are substantially similar to the issues in the supplemental petition which, therefore, strictly speaking, warrants outright dismissal on the ground of forum shopping, we cannot do so in this case in light of the due process issues raised by GMA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> It is worthy to note that the main issues in the present petitions are the constitutionality of the creation of the Joint Panel and the validity of the proceedings undertaken pursuant thereto for alleged violation of the constitutional right to due process. In questioning the propriety of the conduct of the preliminary investigation in her Supplemental Petition, GMA only raises her continuing objection to the exercise of jurisdiction of the Joint Committee and the Comelec. There is, therefore, no impediment for the Court to rule on the validity of the conduct of preliminary investigation.<br><br>In <i>Uy v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> the Court explained the nature of preliminary investigation, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>A preliminary investigation is held before an accused is placed on trial to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious, and oppressive prosecution; to protect him from an open and public accusation of a crime, as well as from the trouble, expenses, and anxiety of a public trial. It is also intended to protect the state from having to conduct useless and expensive trials. While the right is statutory rather than constitutional, it is a component of due process in administering criminal justice. The right to have a preliminary investigation conducted before being bound for trial and before being exposed to the risk of incarceration and penalty is not a mere formal or technical right; it is a substantive right. To deny the accused's claim to a preliminary investigation is to deprive him of the full measure of his right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup></blockquote><br>A preliminary investigation is the crucial sieve in the criminal justice system which spells for an individual the difference between months if not years of agonizing trial and possibly jail term, on the one hand, and peace of mind and liberty, on the other hand. Thus, we have characterized the right to a preliminary investigation as not a mere formal or technical right but a substantive one, forming part of due process in criminal justice. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>In a preliminary investigation, the Rules of Court guarantee the petitioners basic due process rights such as the right to be furnished a copy of the complaint, the affidavits, and other supporting documents, and the right to submit counter-affidavits, and other supporting documents in her defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> Admittedly, GMA received the notice requiring her to submit her counter-affidavit. Yet, she did not comply, allegedly because she could not prepare her counter-affidavit.

Consequently, the cases were submitted for resolution <i>sans</i> GMA’s and the other petitioners’ counter-affidavits. This, according to GMA, violates her right to due process of law.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>GMA’s insistence of her right to be furnished the above-enumerated documents is based on Section 3 (b), Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>(b) x x x<br><br>The respondent shall have the right to examine <b><i>the evidence submitted by the complainant which he may not have been furnished and to copy them at his expense</i></b>.

Otherwise, he shall issue a subpoena to the respondent, attaching thereto a copy of the complaint, affidavits and other supporting documents giving said respondent ten (10) days from receipt within which to submit counter-affidavits and other supporting documents. <b><i>The respondent shall have the right to examine all other evidence submitted by the complainant</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly from the above-quoted provisions, the subpoena issued against respondent [therein] should be accompanied by a copy of the complaint and the supporting affidavits and documents. GMA also has the right to examine documents but such right of examination is limited only to the documents or evidence submitted by the complainants (Senator Pimentel and the Fact-Finding Team) which she may not have been furnished and to copy them at her expense.<br><br>While it is true that Senator Pimentel referred to certain election documents which served as bases in the allegations of significant findings specific to the protested municipalities involved, there were no annexes or attachments to the complaint filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> As stated in the Joint Committee’s Order dated November 15, 2011 denying GMA’s Omnibus Motion <i>Ad Cautelam</i>, Senator Pimentel was ordered to furnish petitioners with all the supporting evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> However, Senator Pimentel manifested that he was adopting all the affidavits attached to the Fact-Finding Team’s Initial Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Therefore, when GMA was furnished with the documents attached to the Initial Report, she was already granted the right to examine as guaranteed by the Comelec Rules of Procedure and the Rules on Criminal Procedure. Those were the only documents submitted by the complainants to the Committee. If there are other documents that were referred to in Senator Pimentel’s complaint but were not submitted to the Joint Committee, the latter considered those documents unnecessary at that point (without foreclosing the relevance of other evidence that may later be presented during the trial)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> as the evidence submitted before it were considered adequate to find probable cause against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Anyway, the failure of the complainant to submit documents supporting his allegations in the complaint may only weaken his claims and eventually works for the benefit of the respondent as these merely are allegations unsupported by independent evidence.<br><br>We must, however, emphasize at this point that during the preliminary investigation, the complainants are not obliged to prove their cause beyond reasonable doubt. It would be unfair to expect them to present the entire evidence needed to secure the conviction of the accused prior to the filing of information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> A preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the parties’ respective evidence but the presentation only of such evidence as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> Precisely there is a trial to allow the reception of evidence for the prosecution in support of the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br>With the denial of GMA’s motion to be furnished with and examine the documents referred to in Senator Pimentel’s complaint, GMA’s motion to extend the filing of her counter-affidavit and countervailing evidence was consequently denied. Indeed, considering the nature of the crime for which GMA was subjected to preliminary investigation and the documents attached to the complaint, it is incumbent upon the Joint Committee to afford her ample time to examine the documents submitted to [the Joint Committee] in order that she would be able to prepare her counter-affidavit. She cannot, however, insist to examine documents not in the possession and custody of the Joint Committee nor submitted by the complainants. Otherwise, it might cause undue and unnecessary delay in the disposition of the cases. This undue delay might result in the violation of the right to a speedy disposition of cases as enshrined in Section 16, Article III of the Constitution which states that “all persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.” The constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases is not limited to the accused in criminal proceedings but extends to all parties in all cases, including civil and administrative cases, and in all proceedings, including judicial and quasi-judicial hearings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Any party to a case has the right to demand on all officials tasked with the administration of justice to expedite its disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Society has a particular interest in bringing swift prosecutions, and the society’s representatives are the ones who should protect that interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>Even assuming for the sake of argument that the denial of GMA’s motion to be furnished with and examine the documents referred to in Senator Pimentel’s complaint carried with it the denial to extend the filing of her counter-affidavit and other countervailing evidence rendering the preliminary investigation irregular, such irregularity would not divest the RTC of jurisdiction over the case and would not nullify the warrant of arrest issued in connection therewith, considering that Informations had already been filed against petitioners, except Mike Arroyo. This would only compel us to suspend the proceedings in the RTC and remand the case to the Joint Committee so that GMA could submit her counter-affidavit and other countervailing evidence if she still opts to. However, to do so would hold back the progress of the case which is anathema to the accused’s right to speedy disposition of cases.<br><br>It is well settled that the absence [or irregularity] of preliminary investigation does not affect the court’s jurisdiction over the case. Nor does it impair the validity of the criminal information or render it defective. Dismissal is not the remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Neither is it a ground to quash the information or nullify the order of arrest issued against the accused or justify the release of the accused from detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> The proper course of action that should be taken is to hold in abeyance the proceedings upon such information and to remand the case for the conduct of preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>In the landmark cases of <i>Cojuangco, Jr. v. Presidential Commission on Good Government [PCGG]</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> and<i> Allado v. Diokno</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> we dismissed the criminal cases and set aside the informations and warrants of arrest. In<i> Cojuangco</i>, we dismissed the criminal case because the information was filed by the PCGG which we declared to be unauthorized to conduct the preliminary investigation and, consequently, file the information as it did not possess the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. In <i>Allado</i>, we set aside the warrant of arrest issued against petitioners therein and enjoined the trial court from proceeding further for lack of probable cause. For one, there was serious doubt on the reported death of the victim in that case since the corpus delicti had not been established nor had his remains been recovered; and based on the evidence submitted, there was nothing to incriminate petitioners therein. In this case, we cannot reach the same conclusion because the Information filed before the RTC of Pasay City was filed by the Comelec <i>en banc</i> which had the authority to file the information for electoral sabotage and because the presence or absence of probable cause is not an issue herein. As can be gleaned from their assignment of errors/issues, petitioners did not question the finding of probable cause in any of their supplemental petitions. It was only in GMA’s memorandum where she belatedly included a discussion on the “insufficiency” of the evidence supporting the finding of probable cause for the filing of the Information for electoral sabotage against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> A closer look at her arguments, however, would show that they were included only to highlight the necessity of examining the election documents GMA requested to see before she could file her counter-affidavit. At any rate, since GMA failed to submit her counter-affidavit and other countervailing evidence within the period required by the Joint Committee, we cannot excuse her from noncompliance.<br><br>There might have been overzealousness on the part of the Joint Committee in terminating the investigation, endorsing the Joint Resolution to the Comelec for approval, and in filing the information in court. However, speed in the conduct of proceedings by a judicial or quasi-judicial officer cannot <i>per se</i> be instantly attributed to an injudicious performance of functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> The orderly administration of justice remains the paramount consideration with particular regard to the peculiar circumstances of each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> To be sure, petitioners were given the opportunity to present countervailing evidence. Instead of complying with the Joint Committee’s directive, several motions were filed but were denied by the Joint Committee. Consequently, petitioners’ right to submit counter-affidavit and countervailing evidence was forfeited. Taking into account the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases and following the procedures set forth in the Rules on Criminal Procedure and the Comelec Rules of Procedure, the Joint Committee finally reached its conclusion and referred the case to the Comelec. The latter, in turn, performed its task and filed the information in court. Indeed, petitioners were given the opportunity to be heard. They even actively participated in the proceedings and in fact filed several motions before the Joint Committee. Consistent with the constitutional mandate of speedy disposition of cases, unnecessary delays should be avoided.<br><br>Finally, we take judicial notice that on February 23, 2012, GMA was already arraigned and entered a plea of “not guilty” to the charge against her and thereafter filed a Motion for Bail which has been granted. Considering that the constitutionality of the creation of the Joint Panel is sustained, the actions of the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team are valid and effective. As the information was filed by the Commission authorized to do so, its validity is sustained. Thus, we consider said entry of plea and the Petition for Bail waiver on the part of GMA of her right to submit counter- affidavit and countervailing evidence before the Joint Committee, and recognition of the validity of the information against her. Her act indicates that she opts to avail of judicial remedies instead of the executive remedy of going back to the Joint Committee for the submission of the counter- affidavit and countervailing evidence. Besides, as discussed earlier, the absence [or irregularity] of preliminary investigation does not affect the court’s jurisdiction over the case nor does it impair the validity of the criminal information or render it defective.<br><br>It must be stressed, however, that this supervening event does not render the cases before the Court moot and academic as the main issues raised by petitioners are the constitutionality of the creation of the Joint Committee and the Fact-Finding Team and the validity of the proceedings undertaken pursuant to their respective mandates.<br><br>The Court notes that the Joint Committee and the Comelec have not disposed of the cases of the other respondents subjects of the preliminary investigation as some of them were subjected to further investigation. In order to remove the cloud of doubt that pervades that petitioners are being singled out, it is to the best interest of all the parties concerned that the Joint Committee and the Comelec terminate the proceedings as to the other respondents therein and not make a piecemeal disposition of the cases.<br><br>A peripheral issue which nonetheless deserves our attention is the question about the credibility of the Comelec brought about by the alleged professional relationship between Comelec Chairman Brillantes on one hand and the complainant Senator Pimentel and Fernando Poe, Jr. (FPJ), GMA’s rival in the 2004 elections, on the other hand; and by the other Commissioners’<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> reasons for their partial inhibition. To be sure, Chairman Brillantes’ relationship with FPJ and Senator Pimentel is not one of the grounds for the mandatory disqualification of a Commissioner. At its most expansive, it may be considered a ground for voluntary inhibition which is indeed discretionary as the same was primarily a matter of conscience and sound discretion on the part of the Commissioner judge based on his or her rational and logical assessment of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> Bare allegations of bias and prejudice are not enough in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption that a judge will undertake his noble role to dispense justice according to law and evidence without fear or favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> It being discretionary and since Commissioner Brillantes was in the best position to determine whether or not there was a need to inhibit from the case, his decision to participate in the proceedings, in view of higher interest of justice, equity and public interest, should be respected. While a party has the right to seek the inhibition or disqualification of a judge (or prosecutor or Commissioner) who does not appear to be wholly free, disinterested, impartial, and independent in handling the case, this right must be weighed with his duty to decide cases without fear of repression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>Indeed, in <i>Javier v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> the Court set aside the Comelec’s decision against Javier when it was disclosed that one of the Commissioners who had decided the case was a law partner of Javier’s opponent and who had refused to excuse himself from hearing the case. Javier, however, is not applicable in this case. <i>First</i>, the cited case involves the Comelec’s exercise of its adjudicatory function as it was called upon to resolve the propriety of the proclamation of the winner in the May 1984 elections for Batasang Pambansa of Antique. Clearly, the grounds for inhibition/disqualification were applicable. <i>Second</i>, the case arose at the time where the purity of suffrage has been defiled and the popular will scorned through the confabulation of those in authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> In other words, the controversy arose at the time when the public confidence in the Comelec was practically nil because of its transparent bias in favor of the administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> <i>Lastly</i>, in determining the propriety of the decision rendered by the Comelec, the Court took into consideration not only the relationship (being former partners in the law firm) between private respondents therein, Arturo F. Pacificador, and then Comelec Commissioner Jaime Opinion (Commissioner Opinion) but also the general attitude of the Comelec toward the party in power at that time. Moreover, the questioned Comelec decision was rendered only by a division of the Comelec. The Court thus concluded in <i>Javier </i>that Commissioner Opinion’s refusal to inhibit himself divested the Comelec’s Second Division of the necessary vote for the questioned decision and rendered the proceedings null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>On the contrary, the present case involves only the conduct of preliminary investigation and the questioned resolution is an act of the Comelec <i>En Banc</i> where all the Commissioners participated and more than a majority (even if Chairman Brillantes is excluded) voted in favor of the assailed Comelec resolution. Unlike in 1986, public confidence in the Comelec remains. The Commissioners have already taken their positions in light of the claim of “bias and partiality” and the causes of their partial inhibition. Their positions should be respected confident that in doing so, they had the end in view of ensuring that the credibility of the Commission is not seriously affected.<br><br>To recapitulate, we find and so hold that petitioners failed to establish any constitutional or legal impediment to the creation of the Joint DOJ- Comelec Preliminary Investigation Committee and Fact-Finding Team.<br><br><i>First,</i> while GMA and Mike Arroyo were among those subjected to preliminary investigation, not all respondents therein were linked to GMA; thus, Joint Order No. 001-2011 does not violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<br><br><i>Second,</i> the due process clause is likewise not infringed upon by the alleged prejudgment of the case as petitioners failed to prove that the Joint Panel itself showed such bias and partiality against them. Neither was it shown that the Justice Secretary herself actually intervened in the conduct of the preliminary investigation. More importantly, considering that the Comelec is a collegial body, the perceived prejudgment of Chairman Brillantes as head of the Comelec cannot be considered an act of the body itself.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the assailed Joint Order did not create new offices because the Joint Committee and Fact-Finding Team perform functions that they already perform by virtue of the Constitution, the statutes, and the Rules of Court.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, in acting jointly with the DOJ, the Comelec cannot be considered to have abdicated its independence in favor of the executive branch of government. Resolution No. 9266 was validly issued by the Comelec as a means to fulfill its duty of ensuring the prompt investigation and prosecution of election offenses as an adjunct of its mandate of ensuring a free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections. The role of the DOJ in the conduct of preliminary investigation of election offenses has long been recognized by the Comelec because of its lack of funds and legal officers to conduct investigations and to prosecute such cases on its own. This is especially true after R.A. No. 9369 vested in the Comelec and the DOJ the concurrent jurisdiction to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses. While we uphold the validity of Comelec Resolution No. 9266 and Joint Order No. 001-2011, we declare the Joint Committee’s Rules of Procedure infirm for failure to comply with the publication requirement. Consequently, Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and the 1993 Comelec Rules of Procedure govern.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>, petitioners were given the opportunity to be heard. They were furnished a copy of the complaint, the affidavits, and other supporting documents submitted to the Joint Committee and they were required to submit their counter-affidavit and countervailing evidence. As to petitioners Mike Arroyo and Abalos, the pendency of the cases before the Court does not automatically suspend the proceedings before the Joint Committee nor excuse them from their failure to file the required counter-affidavits.

No. 1991 J8 was not lknied oppotiunity to be heard in the course of the Committee's preliminary investigation proceedings; and (3) the preliminary investigation against petitioners, which followed Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, is valid.<br><br>Petitioners' attack against the impartiality of the Committee and the Fact-Finding Team because of their composition and source of tlmding is negated by (1) the express statutory authority fiJr the DO.J and the COMELEC to conduct <i>concurrently</i> preliminary investigations on electionrelated offenses, (2) the separate tlmding for the Committee and FactFinding Team's personnel, and (3) the failure of petitioners to rebut the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions. Similarly, the equal protection attack against Joint Order 001-2011 for its alleged underinclusivity fails as jurisprudence is clear that underinclusivity of classification, by itself, does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Nor is there merit in petitioner Macapagal-Arroyo’s claim that the Committee’s denial of her request for time to file her counter-affidavit and for copies of documents relating to the complaint of Aquilino Pimentel III (Pimentel) and the Fact-Finding’s partial investigation report robbed her of opportunity to be heard. Petitioner Macapagal-Arroyo was furnished with all the documents the Committee had in its possession. Further, the documents relating to Pimentel’s complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> all based on an election protest he filed with the Senate Electoral Tribunal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> are not indispensable for petitioner Macapagal-Arroyo to prepare her counter-affidavit to answer the charge that she acted as principal by conspiracy, not by direct participation, to commit electoral sabotage in Maguindanao in the 2007 elections.<br><br>I am, however, unable to join the <i>ponencia</i> in its conclusion that the rules of procedure adopted by the Committee (Committee Rules) must be published.<br><br>Section 7 of the Joint Order provides that the “Committee shall meet and craft its rules of procedure <b><i>as may be complementary to the respective rules of DOJ and COMELEC </i></b>x x x.” Section 2 of the Committee Rules provides that the “preliminary investigation shall be conducted in the following manner <b><i>as may be complementary</i></b> to Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.” This means that the Committee Rules will apply <b><i>only if they complement</i></b> Rule 112 or Rule 34. If the Committee Rules do not complement Rule 112 or Rule 34 because the Committee Rules conflict with Rule 112 or Rule 34, the Committee Rules will not apply and what will apply will either be Rule 112 or Rule 34. Clearly, the Committee Rules do not amend or revoke Rule 112 or Rule 34, but <b><i>only complement</i></b> Rule 112 or Rule 34 if possible. “Complementary” means an addition so as to complete or perfect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The Committee Rules apply only to the extent that they “may be complementary to” Rule 112 or Rule 34. In short, despite the adoption of the Committee Rules, Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure indisputably remain <b>in full force and effect.</b><br><br>Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Committee Rules amend Rule 112 and Rule 34, the lack of publication of the Committee Rules renders them void, as correctly claimed by petitioners. In such a case, Rule 112 and Rule 34 remain in full force and effect unaffected by the void Committee Rules. The preliminary investigation in the present case was conducted in accordance with Rule 112 and Rule 34. Petitioners do not claim that any of their rights under Rule 112 or Rule 34 was violated because of the adoption of the Committee Rules. In short, petitioners cannot impugn the validity of the preliminary investigation because of the adoption of the Committee Rules, <b><i>whether the adoption was void or not.</i></b><br><br>As shown in the matrix drawn by public respondents in their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the ten paragraphs in Section 2 (Procedure) of the Committee Rules, <b><i>only one</i></b> paragraph is not found in Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and this relates to <b>an internal procedure on the treatment of referrals by other government agencies or the Fact-Finding Team to the Committee.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In <i>Honasan II v. Panel of Prosecutors of the DOJ</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Court quoted and adopted the following argument of the Ombudsman:<br><br><blockquote>OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001 is <b>merely an internal circular</b> between the DOJ and the Office of the Ombudsman, outlining authority and responsibilities among prosecutors of the DOJ and of the Office of the Ombudsman in the conduct of preliminary investigation.&nbsp; <b>OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001 DOES NOT regulate the conduct of persons or the public, in general.</b><br><br>Accordingly, there is no merit to petitioner's submission that OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001 has to be published. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In addition, Section 3 of the Committee Rules (Resolution of the Committee) is a substantial reproduction of the first paragraph of Section 4 of Rule 112, save for language replacing “investigating prosecutor” with “Committee.” Section 4 of the Committee Rules (Approval of Resolution), while not appearing in Rule 112, is an <b>internal automatic review mechanism </b>(for the COMELEC en banc to review the Committee’s findings) not affecting petitioners’ rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <b>Thus, save for ancillary internal rules, the Committee Rules merely reiterate the procedure embodied in Rule 112.<br></b><br>Nevertheless, the <i>ponencia</i> finds publication (and filing of the Committee Rules with the U.P. Law Center9) “necessary” because three provisions of the Committee Rules “either restrict the rights or provide remedies to the affected parties,” namely:<br><br><blockquote>(1) Section 1 [which] provides that “the Joint Committee will no longer entertain complaints from the public as soon as the Fact-Finding Team submits its final Report, except for such complaints involving offenses mentioned in the Fact-Finding Team’s Final Report”; (2) Section 2 [which] states that the “Joint Committee shall not entertain a Motion to Dismiss”; and (3) Section 5 [which] provides that a Motion for Reconsideration may be availed of by the aggrieved parties against the Joint Committee’s Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br>None of these provisions justify placing the Committee Rules within the ambit of <i>Tañada v. Tuvera.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Section 1 of the Committee Rules allows the Committee, after the submission by the Fact-Finding Team of its Final Report, to entertain complaints mentioned in the Final Report and disallows the Committee to entertain complaints unrelated to the offenses mentioned in the Final Report. This is still part of the fact-finding stage and the Committee has the discretion to require the Fact-Finding Team to take into account new complaints relating to offenses mentioned in the Final Report. <b><i>At this stage, there is still no preliminary investigation</i></b>. Section 1 refers solely to the fact- finding stage, not the preliminary investigation. Thus, Section 1 cannot in any way amend, revoke or even clarify Rule 112 or Rule 34 which governs the preliminary investigation and not the fact-finding stage. Section 1 is merely an internal rule governing the fact-finding stage. To repeat, Section 1 does not have the force and effect of law that affects and binds the public in relation to the preliminary investigation. In short, there is no need to publish Section 1 because it deals solely with fact-finding, not with the preliminary investigation.<br><br>In barring acceptance of new complaints after the submission of the Fact-Finding Team’s Final Report to the Committee, save for complaints on offenses covered in the Final Report, Section 1 merely states a commonsensical rule founded on logic. If the Final Report is with the Committee, it makes no sense to re-open the investigation for the Fact- Finding Team to investigate offenses <b><i>wholly unrelated to the Final Report.</i></b> For such new offenses, the Fact-Finding Team will have to open a new investigation. On the other hand, it makes eminent sense for the Fact- Finding Team to re-open investigation (and thus revise its Final Report) if the new complaints “<b><i>involv[e]</i></b> offenses <b><i>mentioned</i></b> in the Fact-Finding Team’s Final Report,” allowing the Fact-Finding Team to submit as thorough and comprehensive a Report as possible on the offenses subject of the Final Report. Far from “restrict[ing] the rights” of the “affected parties,” Section 1 favors the petitioners by letting the Fact-Finding Team parse as much evidence available, some of which may be exculpatory, even after the Final Report has been submitted to the Committee, provided they relate to offenses subject of the Final Report.<br><br>On Section 2 and Section 5 of the Committee Rules, these provisions merely reiterate extant rules found in the Rules of Court and relevant administrative rules, duly published and filed with the U.P. Law Center. Thus, Section 2’s proscription against the filing of a motion to dismiss is already provided in Section 3(c) of Rule 112 which states that “[t]he respondent shall not be allowed to file a motion to dismiss in lieu of a counter-affidavit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Similarly, the right to seek reconsideration from an adverse Committee Resolution under Section 5, again favoring petitioners, has long been recognized and practiced in the preliminary investigations undertaken by the DOJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> DOJ Order No. 223, dated 1 August 1993, as amended by DOJ Department Circular No. 70, dated 1 September 2000, grants to the aggrieved party the right to file “one motion for reconsideration” and reckons the period for the filing of appeal to the DOJ Secretary from the receipt of the order denying reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><i>Tañada v. Tuvera</i> requires publication of administrative rules that have the force and effect of law and the Revised Administrative Code requires the filing of such rules with the U.P. Law Center as facets of the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process, to prevent surprise and prejudice to the public who are legally presumed to know the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> As the Committee Rules merely complement and even reiterate Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, I do not see how their non-publication and non-filing caused surprise or prejudice to petitioners. Petitioners’ claim of denial of due process would carry persuasive weight if the Committee Rules <b><i>amended, superseded or revoked</i></b> existing applicable procedural rules or contained original rules found nowhere in the corpus of procedural rules of the COMELEC or in the Rules of Court, rendering publication and filing imperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Significantly, petitioner Macapagal-Arroyo encountered no trouble in availing of Rule 112 to file a motion with the Committee praying for several reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the complementary nature of the Committee Rules necessarily means that the proceedings of the Committee would have continued and no prejudice would have been caused to petitioners even if the Committee Rules were non-existent. The procedure provided in Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and Rule 34 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure would have <i>ipso facto</i> applied since the Committee Rules merely reiterate Rule 112 and Rule 34. The <i>ponencia</i> concedes as much when it refused to invalidate the Committee's proceedings, observing that <b>"the prelimenary investigation was conducted by the Joint Committee pursuant to the procedures laid down in Rule 112 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure and the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, I vote to DISMISS the petitions.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See e.g. <i>Quinto v.

The proposal to amend the Constitution was subsequently embodied in Resolution No. 73, Article III of the Second National Assembly, adopted on April 11, 1940, and was later approved on December 2, 1940 as Article X of the 1935 Constitution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The administrative control of elections now exercised by the Secretary of Interior is what is sought to be transferred to the Commission on Elections by the proposed constitutional amendment now under discussion.

The Commission on Elections was really existing before 1940 as a creation of a statute passed by the National Assembly; <b>but it necessitated a constitutional amendment to place it outside the influence of political parties and the control of the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the government.

Bautista</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> where the Court dealt with the question of whether the designation, by then President Elpidio Quirino, of Solicitor General Felix Angelo Bautista as Acting Member of the COMELEC — pending the appointment of a permanent member to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Commissioner Francisco Enage — was unlawful and unconstitutional. The Court ruled that the designation was repugnant to the Constitution which guarantees the independence of the COMELEC, and said:<br><br><blockquote>Under the Constitution, the Commission on Elections is an independent body or institution (Article X of the Constitution), just as the General Auditing Office is an independent office (Article XI of the Constitution). Whatever may be the nature of the functions of the Commission on Elections, <b>the fact is that the framers of the Constitution wanted it to be independent from the other departments of the Government. xxx</b><br><br>By the very nature of their functions, the members of the Commission on Elections must be independent. They must be made to feel that they are secured in the tenure of their office and entitled to fixed emoluments during their incumbency (economic security), so as to make them impartial in the performance of their functions their powers and duties. They are not allowed to do certain things, such as to engage in the practice of a profession; to intervene, directly or indirectly, in the management or control of any private enterprise; or to be financially interested in any contract with the Government or any subdivision or instrumentality thereof (sec. 3, Article X, of the Constitution). These safeguards are all conducive or tend to create or bring about a condition or state of mind that will lead the members of the Commission to perform with impartiality their great and important task and functions. <b>That independence and impartiality may be shaken and destroyed by a designation of a person or officer to act temporarily in the Commission on Elections.</b> And, although Commonwealth Act No. 588 provides that such temporary designation "shall in no case continue beyond the date of the adjournment of the regular session of the National Assembly (Congress) following such designation,” still such limit to the designation does not remove the cause for the impairment of the independence of one designated in a temporary capacity to the Commission on Elections. <b>It would be more in keeping with the intent, purpose and aim of the framers of the Constitution to appoint a permanent Commissioner than to designate one to act temporarily. Moreover, the permanent office of the respondent may not, from the strict legal point of view, be incompatible with the temporary one to which he has been designated, tested by the nature and character of the functions he has to perform in both offices, but in a broad sense there is an incompatibility, because his duties and functions as Solicitor General require that all his time be devoted to their efficient performance</b>. Nothing short of that is required and expected of him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> [emphasis ours]</blockquote><br>Thus, as early as 1949, this Court has started to guard with zeal the COMELEC’s independence, never losing sight of the crucial reality that its <b><i>“independence [is] the principal justification for its creation.</i></b>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The people’s protectionist policy towards the COMELEC has likewise never since wavered and, in fact, has <b><i>prevailed even after two amendments of our Constitution in 1973 and 1987</i></b> – an enduring policy highlighted by then Associate Justice Reynato Puno in his concurring opinion in <i>Atty. Macalintal v. COMELEC</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) is a constitutional body <b>exclusively</b> charged with the enforcement and administration of “all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, and recall,” and is invested with the power to decide all questions affecting elections save those involving the right to vote.<br><br>Given its important role in preserving the sanctity of the right of suffrage, the COMELEC was <b>purposely constituted</b> as a body <b>separate</b> from the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. <b>Originally</b>, the power to enforce our election laws was vested with the President and exercised through the Department of the Interior. According to Dean Sinco, however, the view ultimately emerged that an <b>independent body</b> could better protect the right of suffrage of our people. Hence, the enforcement of our election laws, while an executive power, was transferred to the COMELEC.<br><br>The<b> shift to a modified parliamentary system</b> with the adoption of the 1973 Constitution <b>did not alter the character of COMELEC as an independent body</b>. Indeed, a “definite tendency to <b>enhance and invigorate </b>the role of the Commission on Elections as the independent constitutional body charged with the safeguarding of free, peaceful and honest elections” has been observed. The 1973 Constitution <b>broadened</b> the power of the COMELEC by making it the <b>sole judge</b> of all election contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of members of the national legislature and elective provincial and city officials. Thus, the COMELEC was given judicial power aside from its traditional administrative and executive functions.<br><br><b>The trend towards strengthening the COMELEC continued with the 1987 Constitution</b>. Today, the COMELEC enforces and administers all laws and <b>regulations</b> relative to the conduct of elections, plebiscites, initiatives, referenda and recalls. Election contests involving regional, provincial and city elective officials are under its exclusive original jurisdiction while all contests involving elective municipal and barangay officials are under its appellate jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (citations omitted)</blockquote><br>At present, the 1987 Constitution (as has been the case since the amendment of the 1935 Constitution) now provides that the COMELEC, like all other Constitutional Commissions, shall be independent. It provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. The Constitutional Commissions, which shall be<b> independent,</b> are the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Elections, and the Commission on Audit.

One such provision is Section 1 of Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution ordaining that constitutional commissions such as the COMELEC shall be “independent.”</b><br><br>Interpreting Section 1, Article X of the 1935 Constitution providing that there shall be an <i>independent</i> COMELEC, the Court has held that “[w]hatever may be the nature of the functions of the Commission on Elections, the fact is that the framers of the Constitution wanted it to be independent from the other departments of the Government.” In an earlier case, the Court elucidated:<br><br><blockquote>The Commission on Elections is a constitutional body. It is intended to play a distinct and important part in our scheme of government. In the discharge of its functions, it should not be hampered with restrictions that would be fully warranted in the case of a less responsible organization. The Commission may err, so may this court also. <i>It should be allowed considerable latitude in devising means and methods that will [e]nsure the accomplishment of the great objective for which it was created – free, orderly and honest elections. </i>We may not agree fully with its choice of means, but unless these are clearly illegal or constitute gross abuse of discretion, this court should not interfere. Politics is a practical matter, and political questions must be dealt with realistically – not from the standpoint of pure theory. The Commission on Elections, because of its fact-finding facilities, its contacts with political strategists, and its knowledge derived from actual experience in dealing with political controversies, is in a peculiarly advantageous position to decide complex political questions. (italics supplied)</blockquote><br>The Court has no general powers of supervision over COMELEC which is an independent body “except those specifically granted by the Constitution,” that is, to review its decisions, orders and rulings. In the same vein, it is not correct to hold that because of its recognized extensive legislative power to enact election laws, Congress may intrude into the independence of the COMELEC by exercising supervisory powers over its rule-making authority.<br><br>By virtue of Section 19 of R.A. No. 9189, Congress has empowered the COMELEC to “issue the necessary rules and regulations to effectively implement the provisions of this Act within sixty days from the effectivity of this Act.” This provision of law follows the usual procedure in drafting rules and regulations to implement a law – the legislature grants an administrative agency the authority to craft the rules and regulations implementing the law it has enacted, in recognition of the administrative expertise of that agency in its particular field of operation. Once a law is enacted and approved, the legislative function is deemed accomplished and complete. <b>The legislative function may spring back to Congress relative to the same law only if that body deems it proper to review, amend and revise the law, but certainly not to approve, review, revise and amend the IRR of the COMELEC.</b><br><br><b>By vesting itself with the powers to approve, review, amend, and revise the IRR for <i>The Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003,</i> Congress went beyond the scope of its constitutional authority. Congress trampled upon the constitutional mandate of independence of the COMELEC. Under such a situation, the Court is left with no option but to withdraw from its usual reticence in declaring a provision of law unconstitutional.</b><br><br>The second sentence of the first paragraph of Section 19 stating that “[t]he Implementing Rules and Regulations shall be submitted to the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee created by virtue of this Act for prior approval,” and the second sentence of the second paragraph of Section 25 stating that “[i]t shall review, revise, amend and approve the Implementing Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Commission,” whereby Congress, in both provisions, arrogates unto itself a function not specifically vested by the Constitution, should be stricken out of the subject statute for constitutional infirmity. Both provisions brazenly violate the mandate on the independence of the COMELEC.<br><br>Similarly, the phrase, “subject to the approval of the Congressional Oversight Committee” in the first sentence of Section 17.1 which empowers the Commission to authorize voting by mail in not more than three countries for the May, 2004 elections; and the phrase, “only upon review and approval of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee” found in the second paragraph of the same section are unconstitutional as they require review and approval of voting by mail in any country after the 2004 elections. Congress may not confer upon itself the authority to approve or disapprove the countries wherein voting by mail shall be allowed, as determined by the COMELEC pursuant to the conditions provided for in Section 17.1 of R.A. No. 9189. Otherwise, Congress would overstep the bounds of its constitutional mandate and intrude into the independence of the COMELEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> [citations omitted, emphases ours]</blockquote><br>Thus, from the perspective of history, any ruling from this Court – as the <i>ponencia</i> now makes — allowing the COMELEC to share its decisional independence with the Executive would be <b><i><u>a first as well as a major retrogressive jurisprudential development.</u></i> It is a turning back of the jurisprudential clock that started ticking in favor of the COMELEC’s independence in 1940 or 72 years ago.</b><br><br><blockquote><b><i>b. The COMELEC’s Power to Investigate and Prosecute Election Offenses</i></b></blockquote><br>At the core of the present controversy is the COMELEC’s exercise of its power to investigate and prosecute election offenses under Section 2, Article IX (C) of the 1987 Constitution. It states that the COMELEC shall exercise the following power and function:<br><br><blockquote>(6) File, upon a verified complaint, or on its own initiative, petitions in court for inclusion or exclusion of voters; <b>investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offences and malpractices</b>. [emphasis supplied] </blockquote><br>In <i>Barangay Association for National Advancement and Transparency (BANAT) Party-List v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court traced the legislative history of the COMELEC’s power to investigate and prosecute election offenses, and concluded that the grant of such power was not exclusive:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2(6), Article IX-C of the Constitution vests in the COMELEC the power to “investigate and, <b>where appropriate</b>, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices.” <b>This was an important innovation introduced by the Constitution because this provision was not in the 1935 or 1973 Constitutions. The phrase “[w]here appropriate” leaves to the legislature the power to determine the kind of election offenses that the COMELEC shall prosecute exclusively or concurrently with other prosecuting arms of the government.</b><br><br>The grant of the “exclusive power” to the COMELEC can be found in Section 265 of BP 881 [Omnibus Election Code], which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 265. <i>Prosecution</i>. - The Commission shall, through its duly authorized legal officers, have the exclusive power to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses punishable under this Code, and to prosecute the same.

So there is in that sense a diminution, Your Honor</b>, of the power and authority of the COMELEC which it should have in the first place exercised solely or singularly in the same way that the DOJ under its concurrent jurisdiction could have exercised separately, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Given that the membership of the composite Fact-Finding Team and Preliminary Investigation Committee is <b>numerically tilted in favor of the DOJ,</b> plus the fact that<b> a member of the DOJ exercises supervision over the representatives of the COMELEC</b>, it cannot be discounted that the latter runs the <b><u><i>risk</i></u></b> of being pressured into bending their analyses of the evidence to reach results (a finding of probable cause, in this case) more pleasing or tailor-fitted to the outcomes desired by their DOJ supervisors who belong to the majority. In this situation, the COMELEC’s independent consideration of the facts, evidence and applicable law with respect to the complaints for electoral sabotage filed against the respondents cannot but be severely compromised. The following exchanges during the oral arguments are also very instructive:<br><br><blockquote>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Now here, the Election Code grants the COMELEC and the other prosecution arms of the government concurrent authority to conduct preliminary investigation of election offenses, is that correct?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: But your theory is that, given their concurrent authority they can conduct preliminary investigation of election offenses.<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: That was COMELEC and DOJ decided in this particular matter, Your Honor.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: No, I’m asking you if you adopt that position or not, that they concurrently conduct a joint investigation, concurrent?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Alright. Now, the prosecution arm of the government are under the Secretary of Justice, do you agree?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: And the Secretary of Justice is the alter ego of the President, do you agree?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: I think that is true.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: The President is essentially a politician belonging to a political party, will you agree?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: He is the President of the people, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Oh yes.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: As a matter of fact, he is also the titular President of the Liberal Party, is that correct?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: Yes, but he is the President of a hundred million Filipinos.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Has the COMELEC which is an independent constitutional body any business doing work assigned to it by law hand-in-hand with an agency under the direct control of a politician?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: I think that’s a wrong premise, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Explain to me. Where is the error in my premise?<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: Thank you very much, Your Honor. Thank you very much, thank you, Your Honor. COMELEC and DOJ they decided to have a Fact-Finding Team and the Preliminary Investigating Committee. The Fact-Finding Team is composed of COMELEC personnel, DOJ personnel, and NBI personnel. The Preliminary Investigating Committee is composed to COMELEC people and DOJ personnel. Your Honor, they have, the Fact-Finding Team, made a report, submitted it both to COMELEC, to the Secretary of Justice, and to the Preliminary Investigating Committee. The Preliminary Investigating Committee had a unanimous finding and they made a report to the COMELEC <i>En Banc.</i> It is the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, Your Honor, which had the final say on the findings of Preliminary Investigating Committee. So, I think, Your Honor, the premise is wrong, that the independent of the COMELEC has been compromised in this particular matter because, in fact, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, Your Honor did not adopt in toto the findings of the Preliminary Investigating Committee. And You Honor, there is a dimension here that not only election offenses are being investigated but also common crimes under the Revised Penal Code. So, in the collaboration between DOJ and the COMELEC, what was sought to be made, or what was sought to be achieved was efficiency, and what was sought to be avoided was redundancy, Your Honor. And again, if I may reiterate, Your Honor please, to your question about compromising the independence of the COMELEC, I respectfully beg to disagree with that premise, Your Honor, because at the end of the day it was the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> who decided to file an Information or to have a Resolution asking the Law Department to file an information against the three (3) accused in this case Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Lintang Bedol, and former Governor Zaldy Ampatuan, Sr.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: <b>Acting on the findings of a Committee dominated by representatives of the DOJ, is that correct?</b><br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: <b>There was a unanimity, Your Honor.<br></b><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Yes, yes. <b>Well, the Committee dominated ….<br></b><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ:<b> I think the numbers are…..</b><br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: 3-2.<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: 3-2?<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Yes.<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: There was no dissention, there was a unanimity in finding and at the end of the day there were only recommendatory to the COMELEC <i>En Banc.</i><br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: <b>Well, that is true but the COMELEC did not make an investigation. It was not the one that denied the respondents the right to ask for time to file counter- affidavit. These rulings were made by that Committee dominated by representatives of the DOJ</b>. Anyway, you just answered it, although not exactly to my satisfaction but you answered it. Do you know if under the Election Code, tell me if I’m exceeded my time already, do you know if under the Election Code, the COMELEC must directly conduct the preliminary investigation of election offenses? Does it have to conduct directly by itself preliminary investigation of election offenses, the COMELEC?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: The Law Department can do that, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: Well, so I will read to you Section 43 of Republic Act 9369, it says that, and I quote, “<b>That the COMELEC shall, through it’s duly authorized legal officers, have the power concurrent with the other prosecuting arms of the government, to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses</b>.” Now, since the law specifically provides that the COMELEC is to exercise its power to conduct preliminary investigation through its legal officers, by what authority did the COMELEC delegate that power to a joint committee dominated by strangers to its organization?<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: Your Honor, the power of the COMELEC to investigate and prosecute election related offenses is not exclusive. It is concurrent with prosecuting arms of the government, that is the Department of Justice. In other words, Your Honor, the Department of Justice under the amended law has the power to investigate and prosecute election related offenses likewise, so there was no undue delegation as premises in your question, Your Honor, but this is a concurrent jurisdiction with the DOJ.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: So, that’s what made the COMELEC disregard what the law says, “shall’” which is, as you say, you know in law “shall” means a command, “Shall, through its duly authorized legal officers, have the power to conduct preliminary investigation of all election offenses.” At any rate, I think, you’ve have answered.<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: It is not exclusive, Your Honor.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: You’ve given your answer.<br><br>SOLICITOR GENERAL CADIZ: It is not exclusive, Your Honor, the law states its power.<br><br>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ABAD: No, <b>the method is exclusive</b>. The power to investigate is not exclusive, if the law expressly says “through its fully authorized legal officers” precisely because this is in <b>consonance with the policy laid down by the Constitution that the COMELEC shall enjoy autonomy, independent of any branch of government. It should not be working with the political branch of the government to conduct its investigation. It should try to maintain its independence</b>. At any rate, I understand that…Can I continue Chief? <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>[emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>Considering the terms of the COMELEC-DOJ resolutions and exchanges and admissions from no less than the Solicitor General, <b><i>the resulting arrangement – involving as it does a joint or shared responsibility between the DOJ and the COMELEC – cannot but <u>be an arrangement that the Constitution and the law cannot allow, however practical the arrangement may be from the standpoint of efficiency</u></i></b>. To put it bluntly, the joint or shared arrangement directly goes against the rationale that justifies the grant of independence to the COMELEC – to insulate it, particularly its role in the country’s electoral exercise, from political pressures and partisan politics.<br><br>As a qualification to the above views, I acknowledge — as the Court did in <i>People v. Hon. Basilla</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> — that “the prompt and fair investigation and prosecution of election offenses committed before or in the course of nationwide elections would simply not be possible without the assistance of provincial and city fiscals and their assistants and staff members, and of the state prosecutors of the [DOJ].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> That the practice of <b><i>delegation of authority by the COMELEC</i></b>, otherwise known as <b><i>deputation</i></b>, has long been upheld by this Court is not without significance, as<b> <i>it is the only means by which its constitutionally guaranteed independence can remain unfettered.</i></b><br><br>In other words, the only arrangement constitutionally possible, given the independence of the COMELEC and despite Section 42 of RA 9369, is f<b><i><u>or the DOJ to be a mere deputy or delegate of the COMELEC and not a co-equal partner in the investigation and prosecution of election offenses WHENEVER THE COMELEC ITSELF DIRECTLY ACTS</u></i></b>. While the COMELEC and the DOJ have equal jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute election offenses (subject to the rule that the body or agency that first takes cognizance of the complaint shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of the others),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the COMELEC — whenever it directly acts in the fact-finding and preliminary investigation of elections offences — can still work with the DOJ and seek its assistance without violating its constitutionally guaranteed independence, <b><i>but it can only do so as the principal in a principal-delegate relationship with the DOJ where the latter acts as the delegate.</i></b><br><br>This arrangement preserves the COMELEC’s independence as “being mere deputies or agents of the COMELEC, provincial or city prosecutors deputized . . . are expected to act in accord with and not contrary to or in derogation of its resolutions, directives or orders xxx in relation to election cases that such prosecutors are deputized to investigate and prosecute.&nbsp; Being mere deputies, provincial and city prosecutors, acting on behalf of the COMELEC, [shall also] proceed within the lawful scope of their delegated authority.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br><b>III. The Consequences of Unconstitutionality </b><br><br>In the usual course, the unconstitutionality of the process undertaken in conducting the preliminary investigation would result in its nullity and the absence of the necessary preliminary investigation that a criminal information requires. Three important considerations taken together, however, frustrate the petitioners’ bid to achieve this result so that the petitions ultimately have to be dismissed.<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, separate from the COMELEC’s decisional independence, it also has the attribute of <b><i>institutional independence</i></b>, rendered necessary by its key role in safeguarding our electoral processes; the Constitution’s general grant of independence entitles it not only to the discretion to act as its own wisdom may dictate, but <b>the independence to act on its own separately and without interference from the other branches of the government.</b><br><br>Thus, these other branches of government, including the Judiciary, cannot interfere with COMELEC decisions made in the performance of its duties, save only if the COMELEC abuses the exercise of its discretion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> — a very high threshold of review from the Court’s point of view. <b>Any such review must start from the premise that the COMELEC is an independent body whose official actions carry the presumption of legality, and any doubt on whether the COMELEC acted within its constitutionally allowable sphere should be resolved in its favor.</b><br><br>In the context of the present case, the petitioners’ allegations and evidence on the infirmity of the COMELEC’s determination of probable cause should clearly be established; where the petitioners’ case does not rise above the level of doubt – as in this case – the petition should fail.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b> and taking off from where the first above consideration ended, Section 2 of Joint Order No. 001-2011 grants the COMELEC <b><i>the final say</i></b> in determining whether probable cause exists. Section 2 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. Mandate. – The Committee shall conduct the necessary preliminary investigation on the basis of the evidence gathered and the charges recommended by the Fact-Finding Team create and referred to in Section 4 hereof. Resolutions finding probable cause for election offenses, defined and penalized under the Omnibus Election Code and other election laws shall be approved by the COMELEC in accordance with the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. For other offenses, or those not covered by the Omnibus Election Code and other election laws, the corresponding criminal information may be filed directly with the appropriate courts.<br></blockquote><br>While the fact-finding and the preliminary investigation stages, as envisioned in the various COMELEC-DOJ instruments, may have resulted in a constitutionally impermissible arrangement between the COMELEC and the DOJ, Section 2 of Joint Order No. 001-2011 shows that it is the COMELEC that must still solely act and its actions can be constitutionally valid <i>if made in a process that is free from any attendant participation by the Executive.</i><br><br>From the petitioners’ perspective, while the disputed resolutions involved a fact-finding and a preliminary investigation phases that are constitutionally objectionable, <b><i>the petitioners still have to show that indeed the COMELEC had left the matter of determining probable cause ultimately to the Fact-Finding Team and the Joint Committee</i></b>. It is on this point that the petitioners’ case is sadly deficient. In contrast with this deficiency, the records show that the COMELEC did indeed meet, on its own, to determine probable cause based on the evidence presented by its own representatives.<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, since the corresponding informations have already been filed in court, <i>claims of absence of, or irregularity in, the preliminary investigation are matters which appropriately pertain to the lower court in the exercise of its jurisdiction.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> After the lower court has effectively assumed jurisdiction, what is left for this Court to act upon is solely the issue of the constitutionality of the creation and operation of the Fact-Finding Team and the Joint Committee for being violative of the COMELEC’s independence. Other constitutional issues (equal protection, due process, and separation of powers) simply arose as incidents of the shared COMELEC-DOJ efforts, and need not be discussed after the determination of the unconstitutionality of the shared COMELEC-DOJ arrangements for violation of the COMELEC’s independence.<br><br>In sum, while the DOJ-COMELEC arrangements compromised the COMELEC’s independence, the filing of the informations in court, upon the<b><i> COMELEC’s own determination of probable </i></b>cause, effectively <b>limited</b> not only the prosecution’s discretion (for example, on whether to proceed or not), but also <b>the Court’s jurisdiction</b> to pass upon the <i>entire</i> plaint of the petitioners. <i>Crespo v. Judge Mogul</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> teaches us that –<br><br><blockquote><b>The filing of a complaint or information</b> in Court initiates a criminal action. <b>The Court thereby acquires jurisdiction over the case</b>, which is the authority to hear and determine the case. x x x.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. <b>The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction</b> and competence. [emphases ours, citations omitted]</blockquote><br>To reiterate, except for the resolution of the issue of the constitutionality of creating a Joint Committee and a Fact-Finding Team and of the incidental issues bearing on this constitutional interpretation – <i>matters which only this Court may authoritatively determine</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> – this Court should now refrain from making any pronouncement relative to the disposition of the criminal cases now before the lower court.<br><br>Based on these considerations — particularly, on the lack of a factual showing that the COMELEC did not determine the existence of probable cause by itself and relied solely on its unconstitutional arrangements with the DOJ —<b><i> I support the dismissal of the petitions save for the ruling that the shared COMELEC-DOJ investigatory and prosecutory arrangements, as envisioned in the disputed resolutions, are unconstitutional.</i></b><br><br>Lest this opinion be misconstrued and for greater emphasis, while I ultimately sustain the COMELEC’s finding of probable cause based on the collective considerations stated above, the constitutionally objectionable arrangement of a shared responsibility between the COMELEC and the DOJ was not necessarily saved by the existence of Section 2 of Joint Order No. 001-2011. I sustain the COMELEC’s finding of probable cause under the unique facts and developments in this case, based on the institutional independence the COMELEC is entitled to; the lack of proof that the COMELEC did not act independently; and the adduced fact that the COMELEC did indeed meet to consider the findings presented to it by its representatives. I make this conclusion without prejudice to proof of other facts that, although bearing on the COMELEC’s independence but are not here decided, may yet be submitted by the petitioners before the trial court if they are appropriate for that court’s consideration on the issues properly raised.<br><br>For greater certainty for the COMELEC in its future actions in enforcing and administering election-related laws, let me advise that what I highlighted regarding the nature and breadth of the constitutionally guaranteed independence of lhe COMELEC should ahvays be seriously considered as guiding lights.<br><br>For the Court <i>en banc's</i> consideration.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See Euegene Volokh, The MEchanism of the Slippery Slope, Harvard Law Review, Vol. 116, Feburary 2003, available online at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=343640 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.343640 (last visited September 17, 2012). <br>&nbsp;Volokh notes: "Libertarians often tell of the parable ofthe frog.&nbsp; If a frog is dropped into hot water, it supposedly jumps out.&nbsp; If a frog is put into cold water that is then heated, the frog doesn't notice the gradual temperature change, and dies.&nbsp; Likewise, the theory goes, with liberty: People resists attempts to take rights away outright, but not if the rights are eroded slowly."<br>&nbsp;<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> See Steven Yates,<i> The Boiling Frog Syndrome, </i>August 11, 2001, available online at http://www.lewrockwell.com/yates/yates38.html (last visited September 17, 2012). <br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The cited article further explains: But there are other ways of changing one kind of socioeconomic system to a fundamentally different kind of system that minimize or localize abrupt, destabilizing change. Gramscian "revolutionaries" have learned this lesson well – although they do not speak the vocabulary of systems theory, of course. They have learned to get what they want <b><i>by pursuing their goals gradually, one step at a time, through infiltrating and modifying existing institutions and other systems rather than overthrowing them and trying to create new ones from scratch</i></b>. Clearly, a central-government initiative calling for abolishing the U.S. Constitution would have provoked an armed upheaval at any time in U.S. history, and it is at least possible that anything this abrupt still would. U.S. citizens, that is, would jump out immediately if thrown into that pot of boiling water. But if the haters of Constitutional government proceed in small increments, they eventually gut the Constitution almost unnoticed – particularly if they carry out their initiatives in multiple components of U.S. society (so-called public schools, the banking system, the major news media, the legal system, etc.). Moreover, Gramscians have found that the road to centralization is much easier if "paved with good intentions," expressed in pseudo-moral language and portrayed as a source of stability to come. Myriad small disruptions in the lives of individuals and local communities can be rationalized as the price to be paid for the utopia just over the horizon. "You can’t make an omelet," so the saying goes, "without breaking a few eggs." <b><i>So systems accommodate and incorporate these small steps, absorbing the disruptions as best they can and not allowing them to threaten the system’s overall stability.
