She clarified that the list of claims will only be referred to the bank after DAR’s classification and identification of the land to be transferred to the farmer-beneficiaries.&nbsp; After the transmittal and processing of claims, the bank pays the landowner and collects the amortization payments of the farmer-beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>She added that the bank paid Rokaya the sum of P668,680.12 and an increment of P647,107.83 as evidenced by a certified photocopy of the acknowledgment receipt.<br><br><center><b><i>The Trial Court’s Ruling</i></b></center><br>On 11 October 2004, the trial court rejected the prayer for higher valuation in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering fixing the just compensation due for the 76.2380 hectares property subject of this case in the amount of<i> Fifty Six Thousand Two Hundred Fifty pesos (P56,250.00) per hectare or a total amount of Four Million Two Hundred Eighty Eight Thousand Three Hundred Eighty Seven Pesos and 5/100 (4,288, 387.05) </i>for the whole property.<br><br>The sum of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) as Attorney’s fees is hereby awarded in favor of the plaintiffs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>It ruled that the 76.2380 hectare-portion was completely acquired through the OLT in 1989.&nbsp; Pursuant to the governing law, P.D.

No. 27 and E.O. 228, and settled jurisprudence when the trial court valued the annual gross production of the subject land at seventy five (75) cavans per hectare and the government support price at P300.00. It also averred error in awarding attorney’s fees in favor of Rokaya.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Court of Appeals’ Ruling</i></b></center><br>The appellate court reversed and set aside the decision of the trial court.&nbsp; It overturned the finding that the subject lands are under the coverage of P.D. No. 27 and E.O. 228.&nbsp; It even cast doubts on the authenticity of the Orders of Placement.&nbsp; The materiality of the Notice of Acquisition sent to Rokaya dated 12 December 1989 was stressed and was relied upon by the CA as evidence that the lands were not acquired under P.D. No. 27, reasoning that there was no need to file such a Notice if indeed the lands were acquired under the old law and not under compulsory acquisition via R.A. 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In its petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> before this Court, LBP insists that the lands were covered by the OLT Program under P.D. No. 27 and not by compulsory acquisition under R.A. 6657.<br><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> LBP added the argument that the DAWU embodies the assent of Rokaya that the land was placed under the OLT Program and its genuineness and due execution had already been judicially admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Court’s Ruling</i></b></center><br>LBP is steadfast in its contention that the applicable laws are P.D. No. 27 and E.O. 228.&nbsp; To establish its position, LBP presented the different Orders of Placement of DAR to prove that the lands were under the OLT. It also pointed that the DAWU signed by Rokaya is an acknowledgement&nbsp; that the lands were under OLT.&nbsp; It is further posited that applying R.A. 6657 to the P.D. No. 27-acquired properties will result in the retroactive application of R.A. 6657.<br><br>We agree with LBP that the land was acquired under the OLT; however, we do not agree that the computation of the just compensation is still based on the old formula and that the application of R.A. 6657 will result in the retroactivity of the law.<br><br>We explain.<br><br>Upon review of the complaint of Rokaya before the agrarian court, we find an apparent contradiction in the prayers:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That the <u>JUST COMPENSATION</u> for the above-described property [76.2380 hectare-portion] <u>should be fixed in the amount not less than the value of the land subject of CACF No. RAC98-169</u> [121.52 hectare-portion], per Memorandum dated December 7, 1998, xxx.<br><br>x x x x</li></ol><br><ol start="5"><li> To Order the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Register of Deeds <u>to cancel the Emancipation Patent/OLT issued</u> and listed/encumbered in the memorandum of encumbrances xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Underlining supplied)</li></ol></blockquote><br>Evidently, her prayer for fixing the just compensation vis–à–vis her request for cancellation of patents, shows that if the valuation of the 121.5212 hectare-portion of her property is not applied to the 76.2380 hectare property already covered by Emancipation Patents, such patents should be cancelled.&nbsp; Rokaya thus admitted the acquisition of the 76.2380 hectare-portion under P.D. No. 27.<br><br>Further, the different Orders of Placement all dated 16 June 1984 issued by the DAR and signed by its Regional Director Benjamin R. Estrellado, prove that the portion comprising the 76.238 hectares was acquired during the effectivity of P.D. No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The Court takes judicial notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of these orders as issued by DAR pursuant to the Memorandum Circular No. 2, Series of 1978<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> involving the inclusion of landholding tenanted after 21 October 1972 within the coverage of P.D. No. 27.<br><br>Finally, the DAWU itself signed by Rokaya showed her acknowledgment of the acquisition under P.D. No. 27 of the portion of her land in question.&nbsp; Her signature<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> signifying her assent indicates her acceptance of the fact.&nbsp; To restate the pertinent provision:<br><br><blockquote><u>WHEREAS, the area of SEVENTY SIX AND 2380/10000 (76.2380) hectares appearing in the said title has been actually transferred to the tenant farmer/s therein, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27</u> as shown in the list of beneficiaries who were awarded Certificates of land Transfer, copy of which is hereto attached as Annex A and forming an integral part hereof, the said area transferred is subject of Land Transfer Claim No. EO-92-039 Amd. for settlement/compensation in the Land Bank of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Underlining supplied)</blockquote><br>However, acquisition of the property under OLT or P.D. No. 27 does not necessarily mean that the determination of just compensation therefor must be under the same decree.<br><br>To determine the applicable formula, it is important to determine whether on 15 June 1988, which is the effectivity date of R.A. 6657, there has already been payment of just compensation, which payment completes the agrarian reform process.&nbsp; If on such date just compensation remains unpaid, the agrarian reform process remains incomplete even if started under P.D. No. 27.&nbsp; Under R.A. 6657, just compensation will have to be computed in accordance with Section 17<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or Determination of Just Compensation in relation to the formula under Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998.<br><br>The Court in <i>Paris v. Alfeche</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> ruled that the passage of R.A. 6657 before the completion of agrarian reform process over the lands acquired under P.D. No. 27 should, for compensation purposes now be completed under the said law, with P.D. No. 27 and E.O. 228 having suppletory effect, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 75. <i>Suppletory Application of Existing Legislation</i></b>. — <u>The provisions of</u> Republic Act No. 3844 as amended, <u>Presidential Decree Nos. 27</u> and 266 as amended, <u>Executive Order Nos. 228</u> and 229, both Series of 1987; and other laws not inconsistent with this Act <u>shall have suppletory effect</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Hon. Natividad</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> this Court ruled that seizure of landholdings or properties covered by P.D. No. 27 did not take place on 21 October 1972, but upon the payment of just compensation.&nbsp; Taking into account the passage in 1988 of R.A. 6657 pending the settlement of just compensation, this Court concluded that it is R.A. 6657 which is the applicable law, with P.D. No. 27 and E.O. 228 having only suppletory effect.<br><br>The same interpretation was arrived at in the subsequent decisions in<i> Land Bank of the Philippines v. Estanislao</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Eleuterio Cruz</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> LBP v. J. L. Jocson and Sons<i></i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Ferrer</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and more recently in the <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Araneta.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>We here reiterate our consolidated ruling in <i>DAR v. Manuel Goduco and Land Bank v. Goduco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that when the reform process is still incomplete because the payment has not been settled yet and considering the passage of R.A. 6657, just compensation should be determined and the process concluded under the said law.&nbsp; As we so rule, we also repeat what was there said:<br><br><blockquote>One final but important point:&nbsp; As we at the outset clarified, the repeated rulings that the land reform process is completed only upon payment of just compensation relate to the issue of the applicable law on just compensation. The disposition that the seizure of the landholding would take effect on the payment of just compensation since it is only at that point that the land reform process is completely refers to property acquired under P.D. No. 27 but which remained unpaid until the passage of R.A. 6657.&nbsp; We said that in such a situation R.A. 6657 is the applicable law.&nbsp; But if the seizure is during the effectivity of R.A. 6657, the time of taking should follow the general rule in expropriation cases where the “time of taking” is the time when the State took possession of the same and deprived the landowner of the use and enjoyment of his property xxx. We here repeat <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Livioco.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Finally, we rule on the applicable formula.<br><br>The provision on the determination of just compensation is provided under Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> We quote:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation.</i> — In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of the like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</blockquote><br>Pursuant to this provision and the rule-making power of DAR under Section 49 of R.A. 6657, a formula was outlined in DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 in computing just compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> for lands subject of acquisition whether under voluntary offer to sell (VOS) or compulsory acquisition (CA),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br><br>Where: LV = Land Value<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br>CS&nbsp; = Comparable Sales<br>MV&nbsp; = Market Value per Tax Declaration<br></div><br>The above formula shall be used if all three factors are present, relevant and applicable.<br><br>A1.
