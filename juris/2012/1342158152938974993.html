The creditor cannot appropriate the things given by way of pledge or mortgage, or dispose of them.&nbsp; Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void.</blockquote><br>The power of attorney provision in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage reads:<br><br><blockquote>5. <b>Power of Attorney of MORTGAGEE.&nbsp; </b>– Effective upon the breach of any condition of this Mortgage, and in addition to the remedies herein stipulated, the MORTGAGEE is likewise appointed attorney-in-fact of the MORTGAGOR with full power and authority to take actual possession of the mortgaged properties, to sell, lease any of the mortgaged properties, to collect rents, to execute deeds of sale, lease, or agreement that may be deemed convenient, to make repairs or improvements on the mortgaged properties and to pay the same, and perform any other act which the MORTGAGEE may deem convenient for the proper administration of the mortgaged properties.&nbsp; The payment of any expenses advanced by the MORTGAGEE in connection with the purpose indicated herein is also secured by this Mortgage.&nbsp; Any amount received from the sale, disposal or administration abovementioned maybe applied by assessments and other incidental expenses and obligations and to the payment of original indebtedness including interest and penalties thereon.&nbsp; The power herein granted shall not be revoked during the life of this Mortgage and all acts which may be executed by the MORTGAGEE by virtue of said power are hereby ratified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The following are the elements of <i>pactum commissorium</i>:<br><br>(1) There should be a property mortgaged by way of security for the payment of the principal obligation; and<br><br>(2) There should be a stipulation for automatic appropriation by the creditor of the thing mortgaged in case of non-payment of the principal obligation within the stipulated period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Villar’s purchase of the subject property did not violate the prohibition on <i>pactum commissorium.&nbsp; </i>The power of attorney provision above did not provide that the ownership over the subject property would automatically pass to Villar upon Galas’s failure to pay the loan on time.&nbsp; What it granted was the mere appointment of Villar as attorney-in-fact, with authority to sell or otherwise dispose of the subject property, and to apply the proceeds to the payment of the loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; This provision is customary in mortgage contracts, and is in conformity with Article 2087 of the Civil Code, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 2087</b>.&nbsp; It is also of the essence of these contracts that when the principal obligation becomes due, the things in which the pledge or mortgage consists may be alienated for the payment to the creditor.</blockquote><br>Galas’s decision to eventually sell the subject property to Villar for an additional P1,500,000.00 was well within the scope of her rights as the owner of the subject property.&nbsp; The subject property was transferred to Villar by virtue of another and separate contract, which is the Deed of Sale.&nbsp; Garcia never alleged that the transfer of the subject property to Villar was automatic upon Galas’s failure to discharge her debt, or that the sale was simulated to cover up such automatic transfer.<br><br><b><i>Propriety of Garcia’s action<br>for foreclosure of mortgage</i></b><br><br>The real nature of a mortgage is described in Article 2126 of the Civil Code, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 2126</b>.&nbsp; The mortgage directly and immediately subjects the property upon which it is imposed, whoever the possessor may be, to the fulfillment of the obligation for whose security it was constituted.<br></blockquote><br>Simply put, a mortgage is a real right, which follows the property, even after subsequent transfers by the mortgagor.&nbsp; “A registered mortgage lien is considered inseparable from the property inasmuch as it is a right in <i>rem</i>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The sale or transfer of the mortgaged property cannot affect or release the mortgage; thus the purchaser or transferee is necessarily bound to acknowledge and respect the encumbrance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, under Article 2129 of the Civil Code, the mortgage on the property may still be foreclosed despite the transfer, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 2129</b>.&nbsp; The creditor may claim from a third person in possession of the mortgaged property, the payment of the part of the credit secured by the property which said third person possesses, in terms and with the formalities which the law establishes.</blockquote><br>While we agree with Garcia that since the second mortgage, of which he is the mortgagee, has not yet been discharged, we find that said mortgage subsists and is still enforceable.&nbsp; However, Villar, in buying the subject property with notice that it was mortgaged, only undertook to pay such mortgage or allow the subject property to be sold upon failure of the mortgage creditor to obtain payment from the principal debtor once the debt matures.&nbsp; Villar did not obligate herself to replace the debtor in the principal obligation, and could not do so in law without the creditor’s consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Article 1293 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Art. 1293.</b> Novation which consists in substituting a new debtor in the place of the original one, may be made even without the knowledge or against the will of the latter, but not without the consent of the creditor.&nbsp; Payment by the new debtor gives him the rights mentioned in articles 1236 and 1237.<br></blockquote><br>Therefore, the obligation to pay the mortgage indebtedness remains with the original debtors Galas and Pingol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; The case of <i>E.C. McCullough &amp; Co. v. Veloso and Serna</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> is square on this point:<br><br><blockquote>The effects of a transfer of a mortgaged property to a third person are well determined by the Civil Code.&nbsp; According to article 1879<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of this Code, the creditor may demand of the third person in possession of the property mortgaged payment of such part of the debt, as is secured by the property in his possession, in the manner and form established by the law.&nbsp; The Mortgage Law in force at the promulgation of the Civil Code and referred to in the latter, provided, among other things, that the debtor should not pay the debt upon its maturity after judicial or notarial demand, for payment has been made by the creditor upon him.&nbsp; (Art. 135 of the Mortgage Law of the Philippines of 1889.)&nbsp; According to this, the obligation of the new possessor to pay the debt originated only from the right of the creditor to demand payment of him, it being necessary that a demand for payment should have previously been made upon the debtor and the latter should have failed to pay.&nbsp; And even if these requirements were complied with, still the third possessor might abandon the property mortgaged, and in that case it is considered to be in the possession of the debtor.&nbsp; (Art. 136 of the same law.)&nbsp; This clearly shows that the spirit of the Civil Code is to let the obligation of the debtor to pay the debt stand although the property mortgaged to secure the payment of said debt may have been transferred to a third person.&nbsp; While the Mortgage Law of 1893 eliminated these provisions, it contained nothing indicating any change in the spirit of the law in this respect. Article 129 of this law, which provides the substitution of the debtor by the third person in possession of the property, for the purposes of the giving of notice, does not show this change and has reference to a case where the action is directed only against the property burdened with the mortgage.&nbsp; (Art. 168 of the Regulation.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br>This pronouncement was reiterated in <i>Rodriguez v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> wherein this Court, even before quoting the same above portion in <i>E.C. McCullough &amp; Co. v. Veloso and Serna,</i> held:<br><br><blockquote>We find the stand of petitioners-appellants to be unmeritorious and untenable.&nbsp; The maxim “<i>caveat emptor</i>” applies only to execution sales, and this was not one such.&nbsp; The mere fact that the purchaser of an immovable has notice that the acquired realty is encumbered with a mortgage does not render him liable for the payment of the debt guaranteed by the mortgage, in the absence of stipulation or condition that he is to assume payment of the mortgage debt. The reason is plain: the mortgage is merely an encumbrance on the property, entitling the mortgagee to have the property foreclosed, i.e., sold, in case the principal obligor does not pay the mortgage debt, and apply the proceeds of the sale to the satisfaction of his credit. Mortgage is merely an accessory undertaking for the convenience and security of the mortgage creditor, and exists independently of the obligation to pay the debt secured by it. The mortgagee, if he is so minded, can waive the mortgage security and proceed to collect the principal debt by personal action against the original mortgagor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing, Garcia has no cause of action against Villar in the absence of evidence to show that the second mortgage executed in favor of Garcia has been violated by his debtors, Galas and Pingol, i.e., specifically that Garcia has made a demand on said debtors for the payment of the obligation secured by the second mortgage and they have failed to pay.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court hereby <b>AFFIRMS</b> the February 27, 2003 Decision and March 8, 2003 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in <b>CA-G.R.
