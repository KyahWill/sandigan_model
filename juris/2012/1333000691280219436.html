Avenue, Manila received information from a confidential informant that one Emily Mendoza, a pregnant woman, was selling shabu in Gagalangin, Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; Acting on this information, Mangilit immediately formed a buy-bust operation team, with Ching as the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; Mangilit gave Ching a five-hundred-peso (P500.00) bill, the serial number of which was noted, to be used as the buy-bust money.&nbsp; The team, composed of Mangilit, Ching, and Talusan, together with the informant, first coordinated with the <i>Barangay</i> Chairman of Gagalangin, Tondo, before proceeding to Benita St., where Mendoza was to be found.&nbsp; Mangilit and Talusan placed themselves at a viewing distance, while Ching and the informant approached Mendoza.&nbsp; The informant introduced Ching to Mendoza as a buyer, and in return, Mendoza asked how much he would buy.&nbsp; After Ching told her that he would be buying P500.00 worth of <i>shabu</i>, Mendoza handed him one plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance.&nbsp; Ching then gave her the P500.00 bill, and executed the pre-arranged signal to inform his team of the completed transaction.&nbsp; Thereafter, the team read Mendoza her constitutional rights and the nature of the accusation against her before arresting her.&nbsp; In the meantime, Ching marked the plastic sachet he bought from Mendoza with “SOG-1,” while Talusan recovered the P500.00 bill from Mendoza’s coin purse.&nbsp; Afterwards, Ching brought the Request for Laboratory Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and the specimen to the chief of the WPD Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; The results of the laboratory examination, as stated in Chemistry Report No. D-1058-03, and as testified to by Macapagal, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">TIME AND DATE RECEIVED:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;

Mendoza denied that she sold <i>shabu</i> to Ching.&nbsp; She alleged that she was in front of her house, waiting for her aunt, when a man, whom she had never seen before, and whom she had not seen during the trial, asked her about the owner of a video game.&nbsp; She told the man that it was her neighbor.&nbsp; The man inquired further about the pusher of <i>shabu</i>, to which she claimed lack of knowledge.&nbsp; The man then asked if she could be invited to the precinct.&nbsp; Mendoza said she asked the man why she was being invited, but the man allegedly told her to just explain at the precinct.&nbsp; She tried to resist but the man reportedly forced her to go with him to the SOG, Manila City Hall, via a sidecar.&nbsp; Upon reaching the police station, she was subjected to an inquest when she refused to give the man fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On March 20, 2007, the RTC rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the court hereby finds the accused, <b>GUILTY</b>, of the crime charged against her, beyond reasonable doubt, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00).<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>, subject of this case, is hereby forfeited in favor of the State and ordered destroyed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pursuant to existing Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>In convicting Mendoza of violating Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165, the RTC held that the prosecution was able to establish and prove the elements in the sale of illegal drugs.&nbsp; The RTC said that the prosecution’s version of the events was “positive, probable, and in accord with human experience.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC also applied the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, as Mendoza failed to show that Mangilit and Ching, in testifying against her, “were motivated by reasons other than the duty to curb the sale of dangerous drugs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, the RTC averred that Mendoza’s denial and cry of frame-up deserve no merit as not only was she unable to present any sufficient evidence to support them, but they are also weak defenses disfavored by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On March 29, 2007, Mendoza filed her Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> with the RTC.&nbsp; Mendoza anchored her appeal on the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE ON THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION AND DISREGARDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT’S DEFENSE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>On July 21, 2009, the Court of Appeals promulgated its Decision,&nbsp; affirming the RTC’s judgment of conviction, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision dated March 20, 2007 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, Manila in Crim. Case No. 03-214163 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals found Mendoza’s appeal bereft of merit as the prosecution was able to establish the elements of the charge against her.&nbsp; It deemed as waived Mendoza’s argument that the police officers failed to establish the identity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> as it was raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals further agreed with the RTC that absent a showing of ill motive on the part of the police officers, their testimonies deserve full faith and credit and the presumption that they regularly performed their duties must be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Undeterred, Mendoza elevated her case to this Court, with the same issues she raised before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Discussion</i></b><br></center><br>Mendoza was charged and convicted for selling methylamphetamine hydrochloride, more popularly known as <i>shabu</i>, in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 or the Dangerous Drugs Law, which provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 5.</b> <i>Sale, Trading, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals. </i>- The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.<br><br>The penalty of imprisonment ranging from twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years and a fine ranging from One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) to Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any controlled precursor and essential chemical, or shall act as a broker in such transactions.<br><br>If the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution or transportation of any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical transpires within one hundred (100) meters from the school, the maximum penalty shall be imposed in every case.<br><br>For drug pushers who use minors or mentally incapacitated individuals as runners, couriers and messengers, or in any other capacity directly connected to the dangerous drugs and/or controlled precursors and essential chemicals trade, the maximum penalty shall be imposed in every case.<br><br>If the victim of the offense is a minor or a mentally incapacitated individual, or should a dangerous drug and/or a controlled precursor and essential chemical involved in any offense herein provided be the proximate cause of death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty provided for under this Section shall be imposed.<br><br>The maximum penalty provided for under this Section shall be imposed upon any person who organizes, manages or acts as a "financier" of any of the illegal activities prescribed in this Section.<br><br>The penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years of imprisonment and a fine ranging from One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) to Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who acts as a "protector/coddler" of any violator of the provisions under this Section.</blockquote><br>Mendoza posits that her guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt as the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the dangerous drug with certainty.&nbsp; She claims that “[t]he arresting officers [did not] comply with the proper custody and disposition of the seized and confiscated plastic sachet” under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165.&nbsp; Mendoza further argues that the prosecution failed to prove how the seized drug reached the forensic chemist for examination.&nbsp; She also avers that the police officers did not conduct any inventory or take pictures of the plastic sachet. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, Mendoza avers, no barangay official or representative from the media was present during the buy-bust operation, and no coordination with the PDEA, within the time specified in the rules, was done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><i><b>Proof of corpus delicti</b></i><br><br>Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 21.</b> <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> – The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.]</blockquote><br>Its Implementing Rules and Regulations state:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a)&nbsp;</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; <b>Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items</b>[.] (Emphasis supplied.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>This Court has, in many cases, held that while the chain of custody should ideally be perfect, in reality it is not, “as it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The most important factor is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items as they will be used to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, the prosecution’s failure to submit in evidence the physical inventory and photograph of the seized drugs as required under Article 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, will not render Mendoza’s arrest illegal or the items seized from her inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it was shown that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs had been preserved.&nbsp; The prosecution had submitted enough evidence to account for the crucial links in the chain of custody of the seized <i>shabu</i>, starting from its confiscation from Mendoza up to its presentation as evidence in the RTC.<br><br>The records would indicate that the plastic sachet containing shabu was marked, kept, and delivered to the forensic chemist by the same officer who received it from Mendoza.&nbsp; Ching, the poseur-buyer, marked the plastic sachet he bought from Mendoza with “SOG-1” after the buy-bust team arrested her.&nbsp; Thereafter, the marked plastic sachet, together with the laboratory request, was delivered by Ching himself to Macapagal for examination.&nbsp; Macapagal’s Chemistry Report showed that she received a plastic sachet marked “SOG-1” for examination at around 3:20 p.m.&nbsp; After she completed her examination at 5:20 p.m., she placed the same marked plastic sachet in a small brown envelope, which she in turn dated, signed, and sealed with a staple wire.<br><br>It is therefore clear, that the prosecution was able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the <i>shabu</i>, from the moment it was seized from Mendoza, up to the time it was presented during the trial as proof of the <i>corpus delicti.</i><br><br>In any case, unless Mendoza can show that there was bad faith, ill will, or tampering with the evidence, the presumption that the integrity of the evidence has been preserved will be upheld.&nbsp; It is upon Mendoza to show the foregoing to overcome the presumption that the police officers handled the seized drugs with regularity, and that they properly performed their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; This burden, she failed to discharge.<br><br>Moreover, as the Court of Appeals said, Mendoza only questioned the chain of custody when she appealed her conviction.&nbsp; This issue was neither raised nor mentioned during the trial before the RTC.&nbsp; Whatever justifiable ground may excuse the prosecution from complying with the statutory requirements on chain of custody will remain in obscurity but will not adversely affect the prosecution’s case if not timely questioned during the trial.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Sta. Maria</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>The law excuses non-compliance under justifiable grounds.&nbsp; However, whatever justifiable grounds may excuse the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation in this case from complying with Section 21 will remain unknown, because appellant did not question during trial the safekeeping of the items seized from him.&nbsp; Indeed, the police officers’ alleged violations of Sections 21 and 86 of Republic Act No. 9165 were not raised before the trial court but were instead raised for the first time on appeal.&nbsp; In no instance did appellant least intimate at the trial court that there were lapses in the safekeeping of seized items that affected their integrity and evidentiary value. Objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; when a party desires the court to reject the evidence offered, he must so state in the form of objection.&nbsp; Without such objection he cannot raise the question for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote><br>It is also worthy to note the fact that Mendoza has not ascribed any improper motive on the part of the police officers as to why they would choose to implicate her in a very serious crime.&nbsp; Mendoza herself admitted that she had not seen any of the police officers who testified against her prior to the trial.&nbsp; As the RTC pronounced, she has not shown that Ching and Mangilit were motivated by reasons other than their duty to curb the sale of prohibited drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it is only right that until Mendoza can show clear and convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust operation team were motivated illicitly, or had failed to properly perform their duties, their testimonies deserve full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b><i>Coordination with PDEA</i></b><br><br>Mendoza likewise assails the legality of her arrest as no coordination with PDEA was done.&nbsp; Section 86 of the Dangerous Drugs Law states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 86</b>. <i>Transfer, Absorption, and Integration of All Operating Units on Illegal Drugs into the PDEA and Transitory Provisions. </i>– The Narcotics Group of the PNP, the Narcotics Division of the NBI and the Customs Narcotics Interdiction Unit are hereby abolished; however they shall continue with the performance of their task as detail service with the PDEA, subject to screening, until such time that the organizational structure of the Agency is fully operational and the number of graduates of the PDEA Academy is sufficient to do the task themselves: Provided, That such personnel who are affected shall have the option of either being integrated into the PDEA or remain with their original mother agencies and shall, thereafter, be immediately reassigned to other units therein by the head of such agencies.

This Court has declared that coordination with the PDEA is not an indispensable requirement in buy-bust operations.&nbsp; Neither Section 86 of Republic Act No. 9165 nor its Implementing Rules and Regulations make PDEA’s participation a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for the conduct of a buy-bust operation, especially since a buy-bust operation is merely a form of an <i>in flagrante </i>arrest, which is sanctioned by Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><i><b>Elements of Illegal Sale of<br>Dangerous Drugs<br></b></i><br>This Court has repeatedly held that the prosecution of the sale of dangerous drugs case is dependent on the satisfaction of the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>(1) [T]he identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration;

This was seconded by Mangilit, who also positively identified Mendoza as the subject of their buy-bust operation on May 12, 2003.&nbsp; Mendoza’s weak defenses of denial and frame-up cannot prevail over such positive identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This Court has invariably viewed the common and standard defenses of denial and frame-up in drugs cases with disfavor for being easily concocted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>For a police officer to frame her up, he must have known her prior to the incident.&nbsp;
