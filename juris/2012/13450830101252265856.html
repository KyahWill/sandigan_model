In fact, Peradilla requested that the monetary equivalent of her earned vacation and sick leave for her 16 years of service in the Judiciary be used to restitute the shortages she incurred.&nbsp; Peradilla stated in her letter:<br><br><blockquote>This has reference to A.M.

For these, and with all humility, I am respectfully requesting your good Office that my earned leaves for my 16 years in the Judiciary be computed and be credited to restitute the above-mentioned amounts. My records from the Leave Division show that I have earned 46 vacation leave and 162 sick leave as of May 31, 2009.<br><br>Likewise, I humbly pray that if the amount equivalent to my earned leave is not sufficient to cover these shortages, may I request that my salaries withheld since March 2008 be released and be credited to said shortages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>In another signed letter dated 8 April 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Peradilla again admitted misappropriating the court funds. Peradilla alleged that she only intended to “borrow” the funds but unfortunately, she failed to replace the “borrowed” funds. Peradilla explained:<br><br><blockquote>Before 2005, the users of the Postal Money Order (PMO) forms are the Court and the Jehova’s witnesses only. When the Philippine Ports Authority started its operation in El Nido, it also purchases PMO to facilitate its remittances. Hence, many times, there was non-availability of PMO forms to facilitate my remittances to the Supreme Court. At that time, I have three children studying in college. The school fees and the students’ allowances increased, more projects and contributions were needed, and the costly educational tours became part of college life. Besides, there were electric bills, loans to be paid, budget for food, clothing and other expenses. My salary can no longer meet these needs. My husband works as a butcher only in the nearby slaughterhouse, and there were many competitors. There were younger, faster, and stronger butchers than him. Since I kept the court’s funds, and since there was no available PMO yet, and instead of borrowing money from loan sharks, I started granting loan to myself with a promise in mind that I will replace the same whenever my salary comes [sic].<br><br>Our very limited income, the non-availability of PMO forms, aggravated by my children’s financial needs for their schooling resulted to my JDF accountabilities of Php 62,847.55; from SAJ, my accountabilities reached Php 213,268.10; my Mediation amounts to Php 18,500.00; and my Fiduciary amounts to Php 163,000.00. My total accountabilities amounted to Php 457,615.65. Likewise, I have an unliquidated amount of Php 22,000 in Election Protest No. 2007-01.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>In its Memorandum dated 13 October 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the OCA recommended that:<br><br><blockquote>1) The Fiscal Management Office, OCA be DIRECTED to PROCESS the money value of the terminal leave pay of Ms. Peradilla and DEDUCT therefrom the total shortages of P603,628.85:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="75%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) </div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="RIGHT">P 62,847.55 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF) </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">213,268.10</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">General Fund (GF) </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">13.20 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Mediation Fund (MF) </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">18,500.00 </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Fiduciary Fund (FF) </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="RIGHT">309,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">Total </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">P 603,628.85</span> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>2) The Cash Division, FMO, OCA be DIRECTED to:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a.

In her letter dated 19 April 2010, Peradilla requested that the monetary value of her earned leave credits be used to restitute the shortage of P62,847.55 for Judiciary Fund; P213,263.00 for Special Allowance for Judiciary; P13.20 for General Fund; and P18,500.00 for Mediation Fund.<br><br>Although Peradilla inadvertently omitted the shortage of P309,000.00 for Fiduciary Fund, she never denied or refuted such finding by the Financial Audit Team.
