Meanwhile, Romines was getting their <i>pulutan </i>ready.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He was in the kitchen, which was about less than two (2) meters away from the sala,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> with an unobstructed view of the sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The drinking session had not yet begun when appellant arrived.

[Y]ou take care of it,” after which, he stepped back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Dollendo, in turn, immediately stabbed Ruiz on the left chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Del Valle ran to seek police assistance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> while Romines was left behind.&nbsp; Romines recounted that after the first blow, three (3) successive stab blows were further delivered hitting Ruiz in his chest near the heart and in his arm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thereafter, appellant and Dollendo fled towards the direction of P.

He further alleged that he was then in the house of spouses Dafia Pusio and Dondon Morino, also in <i>Barangay</i> West, from 12:00 noon to 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> He learned of the death of Ruiz only on 2 March 2001 when he was apprehended by the policemen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, the following facts were elicited from the appellant: that Dollendo is his brother-in-law; that he had known victim Ruiz, and prosecution witnesses Romines and del Valle for a long time;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that Dafia’s house, where he allegedly stayed to watch betamax from 12:00 noon to 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon of 13 February 2001 and Romines’ house, where Ruiz was killed, are only forty (40) meters apart ? one is, in fact, just across the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On 30 April 2003, the trial court convicted the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>From the foregoing, the Court finds NESTOR MEDIC[E] guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal by induction of the crime of Murder and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify the heirs of the victim P50,000.00 and another P50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated 16 May 2003 with the trial court.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the submission of their respective briefs, this Court ordered the transfer of the records of the case to the Court of Appeals, for appropriate action and disposition, in order to allow an intermediate review of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On 28 November 2006, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00243 denying the appeal.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the appeal is DENIED and the <i>Decision </i>dated 30 April 2003 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar, finding NESTOR MEDICE guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, and imposing on him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), and another Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages and to pay the costs, is <b>AFFIRMED </b>subject to the modification that he shall indemnify the victim in the amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Appealed to this Court, we required the parties to simultaneously file their respective supplemental briefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Both manifested that they will no longer file supplemental pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><i><b>Our Ruling</b></i><br></center><br>We affirm the appellant’s conviction.<br><br>To be convicted of murder, the following must concur: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him; (3) the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances enumerated in Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code; and (4) the killing does not constitute parricide or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><i><b>Treachery qualified the killing to murder</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </center><br>The law provides that an offender acts with treachery when he “commits any of the crimes against a person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> There is, thus, treachery when the attack against an unarmed victim is so sudden that he had clearly no inkling of what the assailant was about to do.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>It is clear in the records that the circumstance of treachery is attendant in this case.&nbsp; The aggressors ensured that the victim had no opportunity to resist or defend himself through the sudden and unexpected attack.&nbsp; As testified to by Romines:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Did the victim notice the two accused when they entered your house for the second time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No, sir, because they came from his left side.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">How long thereafter after both accused entered your house when the first stabbing blow was delivered by Edgardo Dollendo to the victim?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">It did not take long before the stabbing.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">[Q]</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Do you mean to say that it was sudden when Edgardo Dollendo stabbed the victim?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup></blockquote><br>Del Valle was likewise positive that Ruiz was not aware that he was about to be attacked.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">When the accused Eduardo Dollendo delivered the first blow to the victim did the victim notice that he was to be attacked by the accused Eduardo?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">No, sir, he was beside [Ruiz].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>As to whether the circumstance of treachery can qualify the killing to murder, the fact being that it was not expressly stated as such in the information, this Court has long clarified that “qualifying circumstances need not be preceded by descriptive words such as ‘qualifying’ or ‘qualified by’ to properly qualify an offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><center><div style="text-align: left;"><i><b>Evident premeditation was not established </b></i><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i><b>as an aggravating circumstance</b></i></div></center></div><br>The aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation may only be considered if the following are established:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to his determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between determination and execution to allow himself time to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote><br>None of the requisites, however, is present in this case.&nbsp; First, the testimony of Mylene Ruiz that appellant and Dollendo looked for her husband Ruiz on 10 February 2011 and that they told her that they have a problem to settle, is insufficient to conclude that the assailants have then decided to commit the crime.&nbsp; Second, evidence is wanting to show when the offenders actually resolved to kill the victim.&nbsp; Even assuming that they clung to their determination to commit the crime after it was ascertained that Ruiz was in the house of Romines, the lapse of two (2) minutes or so from the time appellant checked on the whereabouts of Ruiz to the time Ruiz was attacked is not sufficient to afford them time to reflect on the consequences of their actions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the essence of premeditation being “that the execution of the act was preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><center><div style="text-align: left;"><i><b>There was conspiracy to commit murder;</b></i> <i><b><br>Appellant is, therefore, liable notwithstanding </b></i><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i><b>the evidence showing that it was only Dollendo </b></i><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><i><b>who stabbed the victim</b></i><br></div></center></div><br>The prosecution clearly established that it was only Dollendo who stabbed Ruiz<i>.</i> That appellant did not actually stab the victim does not, however, release him from criminal liability.<br><br>Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code provides that “[a] conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.” The “evidence of a chain of circumstances,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> to wit: that appellant went inside the house of Romines to ascertain that the victim was there; that he fetched Dollendo to bring him to Ruiz; that he gave the <i>dipang </i>to Dollendo to commit the crime; and that they both fled after the stabbing, taken collectively, shows a community of criminal design to kill the victim.&nbsp; Evidently, there was conspiracy in the commission of the crime.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>To be a conspirator, one need not participate in every detail of the execution; he need not even take part in every act xxx.&nbsp; Each conspirator may be assigned separate and different tasks which may appear unrelated to one another but, in fact, constitute a whole collective effort to achieve their common criminal objective.&nbsp; Once conspiracy is shown, the act of one is the act of all the conspirators. The precise extent or modality of participation of each of them becomes secondary, since all the conspirators are principals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i><b>Defense of alibi cannot prosper; </b></i><br><i><b>There was failure to establish physical impossibility </b></i><br><i><b>to be at the locus criminis; </b></i><br><i><b>Witnesses positively identified the assailants</b></i><br><br>It has been held time and again that alibi may prosper only when the accused establishes that not only was he somewhere else when the crime was committed but that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the <i>locus criminis</i> at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, appellant admitted that the house of his friend where he said he was at the time of the commission of the crime is only forty (40) meters away from the <i>locus criminis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Hence, it was not physically impossible for him to be at Romines’ place during the killing incident.<br><br>Furthermore, positive identification destroys the defense of alibi, more so when such is credible and categorical,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> as it is in this case.&nbsp; Positive identification by witnesses, absent any ill motive on their part, likewise prevails over the defense of denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>All considered, we are convinced that the guilt of appellant has been sufficiently established with moral certainty.<br><br><i><b>Reclusion perpetua is the imposable penalty </b></i><br><br>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for murder is <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.&nbsp; The proper imposable penalty on the appellant is <i>reclusion perpetua </i>inasmuch as neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances attended the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><i><b>Appellant is liable for civil indemnity,</b></i> <i><b>moral damages,<br> temperate damages</b></i> <i><b>exemplary damages and 6% interest</b></i> <br><i><b>per annum on all damages</b></i> <i><b>until fully paid</b></i><br><br>The damages awarded by the Court of Appeals in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages, and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> are in order.<br><br>We note, however, that both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals did not award damages to cover the unreceipted funeral expenses incurred by the surviving spouse.&nbsp; While actual damages are not recoverable absent any receipt or supporting document pertaining to the expenses, temperate damages may be awarded in its stead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This is in accordance with Article 2224 of the Civil Code, which provides that temperate damages may be recovered “when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Undeniably, the heirs of Ruiz suffered pecuniary loss representing funeral and burial expenses, although the exact amount is not proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Accordingly, the heirs of Ruiz shall be entitled to temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Finally, consistent with recent jurisprudence on damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> interest on all damages at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of judgment until fully paid is likewise hereby imposed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 28 November 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
