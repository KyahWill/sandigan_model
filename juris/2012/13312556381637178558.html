Of the PhP 0.55 levy of which the copra seller was, or ought to be, issued <b>COCOFUND</b> receipts, PhP 0.02 was placed at the disposition of COCOFED, the national association of coconut producers declared by the Philippine Coconut Administration (PHILCOA, now PCA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>) as having the largest membership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The declaration of martial law in September 1972 saw the issuance of several presidential decrees ("P.Ds.") purportedly designed to improve the coconut industry through the collection and use of the coconut levy fund.&nbsp; While coming generally from impositions on the first sale of copra, the coconut levy fund came under various names, the different establishing laws and the stated ostensible purpose for the exaction explaining the differing denominations. Charged with the duty of collecting and administering the Fund was PCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Like COCOFED with which it had a legal linkage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the PCA, by statutory provisions scattered in different coco levy decrees, had its share of the coco levy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The following were some of the issuances on the coco levy, its collection and utilization, how the proceeds of the levy will be managed and by whom, and the purpose it was supposed to serve:<br><br>1.<b> P.D.

No. 755, under its <b>Section 2,</b> authorized PCA to utilize the CCSF and the CIDF collections to acquire a commercial bank and <b>deposit the CCSF levy collections in said bank, interest free, </b>the deposit withdrawable only when the bank<b> </b>has attained a certain level of sufficiency in its equity capital. The same section also decreed that all levies PCA is authorized to collect shall not be considered as special and/or fiduciary funds or form part of the general funds of the government within the contemplation of P.D.

(Words in bracket added.)</blockquote><br>Through the years, a part of the coconut levy funds went directly or indirectly to various projects and/or was converted into different assets or investments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Of particular relevance to this case was their use to acquire the <b>First United Bank </b>(FUB), later renamed <b>UCPB</b>, and the acquisition by UCPB, through the CIIF companies, of a large block of SMC shares. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Apropos the intended acquisition of a commercial bank for the purpose stated earlier, it would appear that FUB was the bank of choice&nbsp;&nbsp; which the Pedro Cojuangco group (collectively, "Pedro Cojuangco") had control of. The plan, then, was for PCA to buy all of Pedro Cojuangco's shares in FUB. However, as later events unfolded, a simple direct sale from the seller (Pedro) to PCA did not ensue as it was made to appear that Cojuangco, Jr. had the exclusive option to acquire the former's FUB controlling interests. Emerging from this elaborate, circuitous arrangement were two deeds; the first, simply denominated as <i>Agreement</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated May 1975,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> entered into by and between Cojuangco, Jr., for and in his behalf and in behalf of "<i>certain other buyers</i>," and Pedro Cojuangco, purportedly accorded Cojuangco, Jr. the option to buy <b>72.2%</b> of FUB's outstanding capital stock, or 137,866 shares (the "option shares," for brevity), at PhP 200 per share.<br><br>The second but related contract, dated May 25, 1975, was denominated as <i>Agreement for the Acquisition of a Commercial Bank for the Benefit of the Coconut Farmers of the Philippines.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; It had PCA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> for itself and for the benefit of the coconut farmers, purchase from Cojuangco, Jr. the shares of stock subject of the First Agreement for PhP 200 per share. As additional consideration for PCA's buy-out of what Cojuangco, Jr. would later claim to be his exclusive and personal option,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it was stipulated that, from PCA, Cojuangco, Jr. shall receive equity in FUB amounting to 10%, or <b>7.22%,</b> of the 72.2%, or fully paid shares.<br><br>Apart from the aforementioned 72.2%, PCA purchased from other FUB shareholders 6,534 shares.<br><br>While the 64.98% portion of the option shares (72.2% - 7.22% = 64.98%) ostensibly pertained to the farmers, the corresponding stock certificates supposedly representing the farmers' equity were in the name of and delivered to PCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> There were, however, shares forming part of the aforesaid 64.98% portion, which ended up in the hands of non-farmers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The remaining 27.8% of the FUB capital stock were not covered by any of the agreements.<br><br>Under paragraph 8 of the second agreement, PCA agreed to expeditiously distribute the FUB shares purchased to such "<i>coconut farmers holding registered COCOFUND receipts</i>" on equitable basis.<br><br>As found by the Sandiganbayan, the PCA appropriated, out of its own fund, an amount for the purchase of the said 72.2% equity, <b>albeit it would later reimburse itself from the coconut levy fund</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>As of June 30, 1975, the list of FUB stockholders shows PCA with 129,955 shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Shortly after the execution of the PCA - Cojuangco, Jr. Agreement, President Marcos issued, on July 29, 1975, P.D. No. 755 directing, as earlier narrated, PCA to use the CCSF and CIDF to acquire a commercial bank to provide coco farmers with "<i>readily available credit facilities at preferential rate</i>," and PCA "<i>to distribute, for free</i>," the bank shares to coconut farmers.<br><br>Then came the 1986 EDSA event. One of the priorities of then President Corazon C. Aquino's revolutionary government was the recovery of ill-gotten wealth reportedly amassed by the Marcos family and close relatives, their nominees and associates. Apropos thereto, she issued Executive Order Nos. (E.Os.) 1, 2 and 14, as amended by E.O. 14-A, all Series of 1986.&nbsp; E.O. 1 created the PCGG and provided it with the tools and processes it may avail of in the recovery efforts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> E.O. No. 2 asserted that the ill-gotten assets and properties come in the form of shares of stocks, etc.; while E.O. No. 14 conferred on the Sandiganbayan exclusive and original jurisdiction over ill-gotten wealth cases, with the proviso that "<i>technical rules of procedure and evidence shall not be applied strictly</i>" to the civil cases filed under the E.O. Pursuant to these issuances, the PCGG issued numerous orders of sequestration, among which were those handed out, as earlier mentioned, against shares of stock in UCPB purportedly owned by or registered in the names of (a) more than a million coconut farmers and (b) the CIIF companies,&nbsp; including the SMC shares held by the CIIF companies. On July 31, 1987, the PCGG instituted before the Sandiganbayan a recovery suit docketed thereat as CC No. 0033.<br><br>After the filing and subsequent amendments of the complaint in CC 0033, Lobregat, COCOFED et al., and Ballares et al., purportedly representing over a million coconut farmers, sought and were allowed to intervene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Meanwhile, the following incidents/events transpired:<br><br><blockquote>1. On the postulate, <i>inter alia</i>, that its coco-farmer members own at least 51% of the outstanding capital stock of UCPB, the CIIF companies, etc., COCOFED et al., on November 29, 1989, filed <i>Class Action Omnibus Motion</i> praying for the lifting of the orders of sequestration referred to above and for a chance to present evidence to prove the coconut farmers' ownership of the UCPB and CIIF shares. The plea to present evidence was denied;<br><br>2. Later, the Republic moved for and secured approval of a motion for separate trial which paved the way for the subdivision of the causes of action in CC 0033, each detailing how the assets subject thereof were acquired and the key roles the principal played;<br><br>3. Civil Case 0033, pursuant to an order of the Sandiganbayan would be subdivided into eight complaints, docketed as CC 0033-A to CC 0033-H.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Lobregat, Ballares <i>et al</i>., COCOFED, <i>et al</i>., on the strength of their authority to intervene in CC 0033, continued to participate in CC 0033-A where one of the issues raised was the misuse of the names/identities of the over a million coconut farmers;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>4. On February 23, 2001, Lobregat, COCOFED, Ballares <i>et al.,</i> filed a <i>Class Action Omnibus Motion</i> to enjoin the PCGG from voting the sequestered UCPB shares and the SMC shares registered in the names of the CIIF companies. The Sandiganbayan, by Order of February 28, 2001, granted the motion, sending the <b>Republic to come to this Court on certiorari, docketed as G.R. Nos. 147062-64, to annul said order; and</b><br><br>5. By Decision of <b>December 14, 2001</b>, in <b>G.R. Nos. 147062-64</b> (<i>Republic v. COCOFED</i>), <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court declared the coco levy funds as <i>prima facie</i> public funds. And purchased as the sequestered UCPB shares were by such funds, beneficial ownership thereon and the corollary voting rights <i>prima facie</i> pertain, according to the Court, to the government.</blockquote><br>The instant proceedings revolve around CC 0033-A (<i>Re: Anomalous Purchase and Use of [FUB] now [UCPB]</i>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and CC 0033-F (<i>Re: Acquisition of San Miguel Corporation Shares of Stock</i>), the first case pivoting mainly on the series of transactions culminating in the alleged anomalous purchase of 72.2% of FUB's outstanding capital stock and the transfer by PCA of a portion thereof to private individuals. COCOFED, et al. and Ballares, et al. participated in CC No. 0033-A as class action movants.<br><br>Petitioners COCOFED et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and Ursua<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> narrate in their petitions how the farmers' UCPB shares in question ended up in the possession of those as hereunder indicated:<br><br><blockquote>1) The farmers' UCPB shares were originally registered in the name of PCA for the eventual free distribution thereof to and registration in the individual names of the coconut farmers in accordance with PD 755 and the IRR that PCA shall issue;<br><br>2) Pursuant to the stock distribution procedures set out in PCA Administrative Order No. 1, s. of 1975, (PCA AO 1),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> farmers who had paid to the CIF under RA 6260 and registered their COCOFUND (CIF) receipts with PCA were given their corresponding UCPB stock certificates. As of June 1976, the cut-off date for the extended registration, only 16 million worth of COCOFUND receipts were registered, leaving over 50 million shares undistributed;<br><br>3) PCA would later pass Res. 074-78, s. of 1978, to allocate the 50 million undistributed shares to (a) farmers who were already recipients thereof and (b) qualified farmers to be identified by COCOFED after a national census.<br><br>4) As of May 1981, some 15.6 million shares were still held by and registered in the name of COCOFED "<i>in behalf of coconut farmers</i>" for distribution immediately after the completion of the national census, to all those determined by the PCA to be <i>bonafide</i> coconut farmers, but who have not received the bank shares;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and<br><br>5) Prior to June 1986, a large number of coconut farmers opted to sell all/part of their UCPB shares below their par value. This prompted the UCPB Board to authorize the CIIF companies to buy these shares. <b>Some 40.34 million common voting shares of UCPB ended up with these CIIF compa</b><b>nies</b> albeit initially registered in the name of UCPB.</blockquote><br>On the other hand, the subject of CC 0033-F are two (2) blocks of&nbsp; SMC shares of stock, the first referring to shares purchased through&nbsp; and registered in the name of the CIIF holding companies. The purported ownership of the second block of SMC shares is for the nonce irrelevant to the disposition of this case.&nbsp; During the time material, the CIIF block of SMC shares represented 27% of the outstanding capital stock of SMC.<br><br><b><u>Civil Case No. 0033-A</u></b><br><br>After the pre-trial, but before the Republic, as plaintiff <i>a quo</i>, could present, as it committed to, a list of UCPB stockholders as of February 25, 1986,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> among other evidence, COCOFED, <i>et al.</i>, on the premise that the sequestered farmers' UCPB shares are not unlawfully acquired assets, filed in April 2001 their<i> Class Action Motion for a Separate Summary Judgment.</i> In it, they prayed for a judgment dismissing the complaint in CC 0033-A, for the reason that the over than a million unimpleaded coconut farmers own the UCPB shares. In March 2002, they filed <i>Class Action Motion for Partial Separate Trial</i> on the issue of whether said UCPB shares have legitimately become the private property of the million coconut farmers.<br><br>Correlatively, the Republic, on the strength of the December 14, 2001 ruling in <i>Republic v.

Cojuangco, Jr. (on his own behalf and in behalf of the other buyers).&nbsp; Defendant Cojuangco insists he was the "only buyer" under the aforesaid Agreement.<br><br>8.&nbsp; .....<br><br>9.&nbsp; Defendants Lobregat, <i>et al.,</i> and COCOFED, <i>et al.,</i> and Ballares, <i>et al</i>. admit that in addition to the 137,866 FUB shares of Pedro Cojuangco, et al. covered by the Agreement, other FUB stockholders sold their shares to PCA such that the total number of FUB shares purchased by PCA ... increased from 137,866 shares to 144,400 shares, the OPTION SHARES referred to in the Agreement of May 25, 1975.&nbsp; Defendant Cojuangco did not make said admission as to the said 6,534 shares in excess of the 137,866 shares covered by the Agreement with Pedro Cojuangco.<br><br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants Lobregat, <i>et al</i>. and COCOFED, <i>et al</i>. and Ballares, <i>et al. </i>admit that the Agreement, described in Section 1 of&nbsp; Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 755 dated July 29, 1975 as the "Agreement for the Acquisition of a Commercial Bank for the Benefit of Coconut Farmers" executed by the Philippine Coconut Authority" and incorporated in Section 1 of P.D. No. 755 by reference, refers to the "AGREEMENT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF A COMMERCIAL BANK FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COCONUT FARMERS OF THE PHILIPPINES" dated May 25, 1975 between defendant Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. and the [PCA] (Annex "B" for defendant Cojuangco's OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [RE:&nbsp; EDUARDO M.

No. 755.<br><br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants Lobregat, <i>et al. </i>and COCOFED, <i>et al.</i> and Ballares, <i>et al.</i> admit that the PCA used public funds, ... in the total amount of P150 million, to purchase the FUB shares amounting to 72.2% of the authorized capital stock of the FUB, although the <b>PCA was later reimbursed from the coconut levy funds</b> and that the PCA subscription in the increased capitalization of the FUB, which was later renamed the ... (UCPB), came from the said coconut levy funds....<br><br>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the May 25, 1975 Agreement, out of the 72.2% shares of the authorized and the increased capital stock of the FUB (later UCPB), entirely paid for by PCA, 64.98% of the shares were placed in the name of the "PCA for the benefit of the coconut farmers" and 7,22% were given to defendant Cojuangco. The remaining 27.8% shares of stock in the FUB which later became the UCPB were not covered by the two (2) agreements referred to in item no. 6, par. (a) and (b) above.<br><br>"There were shares forming part of the aforementioned 64.98% which were later sold or transferred to non-coconut farmers.<br><br>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the May 27, 1975 Agreement, defendant Cojuangco's equity in the FUB (now UCPB) was ten percent (10%) of the shares of stock acquired by the PCA for the benefit of the coconut farmers.<br><br>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the fully paid 95.304 shares of the FUB, later the UCPB, acquired by defendant ... Cojuangco, Jr. pursuant to the May 25, 1975 Agreement were paid for by the PCA in accordance with the terms and conditions provided in the said Agreement.<br><br>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants Lobregat, <i>et al.</i> and COCOFED, <i>et al.</i> and Ballares, <i>et al.</i> admit that the affidavits of the coconut farmers (specifically, Exhibit "1-Farmer" to "70-Farmer") uniformly state that:<br><ol type="a"><li>they are coconut farmers who sold coconut products;<br></li><li>in the sale thereof, they received COCOFUND receipts pursuant to R.A.

"298-Farmer"); PCA Resolution No. 033-78 dated February 16, 1978....</li></ol><br>The plaintiff did not make any admission as to the foregoing qualifications.<br><br>17. Defendants Lobregat, <i>et al</i>. and COCOFED, <i>et al</i>. and Ballares, <i>et al.</i> claim that the UCPB shares in question have legitimately become the private properties of the 1,405,366 coconut farmers solely on the basis of their having acquired said shares in compliance with R.A.

Nos. 755, 961 and 1468 and the administrative issuances of the PCA cited above.<br><br>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; .....<br></blockquote><br>On July 11, 2003, the Sandiganbayan issued the assailed PSJ-A finding for the Republic, the judgment accentuated by (a) the observation that COCOFED has all along manifested&nbsp; as representing over a million coconut farmers and (b) a declaration on the issue of ownership of UCPB shares and the unconstitutionality of certain provisions of P.D. No. 755 and its implementing regulations. On the matter of ownership in particular, the anti-graft court declared that the 64.98% sequestered "Farmers' UCPB shares," plus other shares paid by PCA are "<b><i>conclusively</i></b>" owned by the Republic. In its pertinent parts, PSJ-A, resolving the separate motions for summary judgment in <i>seriatim</i> with separate dispositive portions for each, reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, we rule as follows:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...<br></div><br>A.

No. 755 to accelerate the growth and development of the coconut industry and achieve its vertical integration; and (ii) for having unduly delegated legislative power to the PCA.<br><br>b. The implementing regulations issued by PCA, namely, Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1975 and Resolution No. 074-78 are likewise invalid for their failure to see to it that the distribution of shares serve exclusively or at least primarily or directly the aforementioned public purpose or national policy declared by P.D.

Insofar as the ill-gotten wealth cases are concerned, the Sandiganbayan's subject matter jurisdiction is limited to the recovery of "ill-gotten wealth" as defined in Eos 1, 2, 14 and 14-A.&nbsp; Consistent with that jurisdiction, the subdivided complaints in the ill-gotten wealth cases expressly alleged that the sequestered assets constitutes "ill-gotten wealth" of former President Marcos and Cojuangco, having been filed pursuant to, and in connection with, Eos 1, 2, 14 and 14-A, the Sandiganbayan gravely erred, if not exceeded its jurisdiction, when it refused to require the respondent Republic to prove the aforesaid jurisdictional fact.<br><br>B. ....&nbsp; Having no evidence on record to prove the said jurisdictional fact, the Sandiganbayan gravely erred, if not grossly exceeded its statutory jurisdiction, when it rendered the assailed PSJs instead of dismissing the ill-gotten wealth cases....<br><br>C.

Petitioners maintain that the jurisdictional facts necessary to acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter in CC No. 0033-A have yet to be established. In fine, the Republic, so petitioners claim, has failed to prove the ill-gotten nature of the sequestered coconut farmers' UCPB shares.&nbsp; Accordingly, the controversy is removed from the subject matter jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and necessarily any decision rendered on the merits, such as PSJ-A and PSJ-F, is void.<br><br>To petitioners, it behooves the Republic to prove the jurisdictional facts warranting the Sandiganbayan's continued exercise of jurisdiction over ill-gotten wealth cases. Citing <i>Manila Electric Company [Meralco] v. Ortañez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> petitioners argue that the jurisdiction of an adjudicatory tribunal exercising limited jurisdiction, like the Sandiganbayan, "depends upon the facts of the case as proved at the trial and not merely upon the allegation in the complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; Cited too is <i>PCGG</i><i> v.

The PCGG has the burden of proving before the Sandiganbayan that the assets it has sequestered or business entity it has provisionally taken-over constitutes "ill-gotten wealth" within the meaning of [E.O.] No. 1 and Article No. XVIII (26) of the 1987 Constitution.</blockquote><br>Petitioners' above posture is without merit.<br><br>Justice Florenz D. Regalado explicates subject matter jurisdiction:<br><br><blockquote>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic ... is the doctrine that the jurisdiction of a court over the subject-matter of an action is conferred only by the Constitution or the law and that the Rules of Court yield to substantive law, in this case, the Judiciary Act and B.P. Blg. 129, both as amended, and of which jurisdiction is only a part. Jurisdiction ... cannot be acquired through, or waived, enlarged or diminished by, any act or omission of the parties; neither can it be conferred by the acquiescence of the court.... Jurisdiction must exist as a matter of law.... Consequently, questions of jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal even if such issue was not raised in the lower court....<br><br>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, in some case, the principle of estoppel by laches has been availed ... to bar attacks on jurisdiction....<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></blockquote><br>It is, therefore, clear that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law. In turn, the question on whether a given suit comes within the pale of a statutory conferment is determined by the allegations in the complaint, regardless of whether or not the plaintiff will be entitled at the end to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; We said as much in <i>Magay v.

Villon</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Jurisdiction over the subject matter is the power to hear and determine the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and not by the consent or acquiescence of any or all of the parties or by erroneous belief of the court that it exists. Basic is the rule that jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the cause or causes of action as alleged in the complaint.</blockquote><br>The material averments in subdivided CC No. 0033-A and CC No. 0033-F included the following:<br><br><blockquote>12.

Both deal with the recovery of sequestered shares, property or business enterprises claimed, as alleged in the corresponding basic complaints, to be ill-gotten assets of President Marcos, his cronies and nominees and acquired by taking undue advantage of relationships or influence and/or through or as a result of improper use, conversion or <b>diversion</b> of government funds or property. Recovery of these assets--determined as shall hereinafter be discussed as <i>prima facie</i> ill-gotten--falls within the unquestionable jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>P.D. No. 1606, as amended by R.A. 7975 and E.O. No. 14, Series of 1986, vests the Sandiganbayan with, among others, original jurisdiction over civil and criminal cases instituted pursuant to and in connection with E.O. Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A. Correlatively, the PCGG Rules and Regulations defines the term "<i>Ill-Gotten Wealth</i>" as "<i>any asset, property, business enterprise or material possession of persons within the purview of [E.O.] Nos. 1 and 2, acquired by them directly, or indirectly thru <b>dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates and/or business associates</b> by any of the following means or similar scheme</i>s":<br><br><blockquote>(1) Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;<br><br>(2) ....;<br><br>(3) By the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities or government-owned or controlled corporations;<br><br>(4) By obtaining, receiving or accepting directly or indirectly any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest or participation in any business enterprise or undertaking;<br><br>(5) Through the establishment of agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combination and/or by the issuance, promulgation and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to benefit particular persons or special interests; and<br><br>(6) By taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship or influence for personal gain or benefit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Section 2(a) of E.O.

[President] Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates ... including the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by them, during his administration, directly or through <b>nominees</b>, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationship.</i>" Complementing the aforesaid Section 2(a) is Section 1 of E.O. No. 2 decreeing the freezing of all assets <i>"in which the [Marcoses] their close relatives, subordinates, business associates, dummies, agents or nominees have any interest or participation</i>."<br><br>The Republic's averments in the amended complaints, particularly those detailing the alleged wrongful acts of the defendants, sufficiently reveal that the subject matter thereof comprises the recovery by the Government of ill-gotten wealth acquired by then President Marcos, his cronies or their associates and dummies through the unlawful, improper utilization or diversion of coconut levy funds aided by P.D. No. 755 and other sister decrees. President Marcos himself issued these decrees in a brazen bid to legalize what amounts to private taking of the said public funds.<br><br>Petitioners COCOFED et al. and Ursua, however, would insist that the Republic has failed to prove the jurisdiction facts: that the sequestered assets indeed constitute ill-gotten wealth as averred in the amended subdivided complaints.<br><br>This contention is incorrect.<br><br>There was no actual need for Republic, as plaintiff <i>a quo</i>,<i> </i>to adduce evidence to show that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaints as it leaned on the averments in the initiatory pleadings to make visible the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan over the ill-gotten wealth complaints.&nbsp; As previously discussed, a perusal of the allegations easily reveals the sufficiency of the statement of matters disclosing the claim of the government against the coco levy funds and the assets acquired directly or indirectly through said funds as ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; Moreover, the Court finds no rule that directs the plaintiff to first prove the subject matter jurisdiction of the court before which the complaint is filed.&nbsp; Rather, such burden falls on the shoulders of defendant in the hearing of a motion to dismiss anchored on said ground or a preliminary hearing thereon when such ground is alleged in the answer.<br><br>COCOFED et al. and Ursua's reliance on <i>Manila Electric Company [Meralco] v. Ortanez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> is misplaced, there being a total factual dissimilarity between that and the case at bar.&nbsp; <i>Meralco</i> involved a labor dispute before the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) requiring the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement to determine which between a regular court and CIR has jurisdiction. There, it was held that in case of doubt, the case may not be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action as jurisdiction of CIR is not merely based on the allegations of the complaint but must be proved during the trial of the case.&nbsp; The factual milieu of <i>Meralco</i> shows that the said procedural holding is peculiar to the CIR.&nbsp; Thus, it is not and could not be a precedent to the cases at bar.<br><br>Even <i>PCGG v. Nepomuceno</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><i> </i>is not on all fours with the cases at bench, the issue therein being whether the regional trial court has jurisdiction over the PCGG and sequestered properties, vis-à-vis the present cases, which involve an issue concerning the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction.&nbsp; Like in <i>Meralco</i>, the holding in <i>Nepomuceno </i>is not determinative of the outcome of the cases at bar.<br><br>While the 1964 <i>Meralco </i>and the <i>Nepomuceno</i> cases are inapplicable, the Court's ruling in <i>Tijam v. Sibonhonoy</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> is the leading case on estoppel relating to jurisdiction.&nbsp; In <i>Tijam</i>, the Court expressed displeasure on "the undesirable practice of a party submitting his case for decision and then accepting judgment, only if favorable, and then attacking it for lack of jurisdiction, when adverse."<br><br>Considering the antecedents of CC Nos. 0033-A and 0033-F, COCOFED, Lobregat, Ballares, et al. and Ursua are already precluded from assailing the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; Remember that the COCOFED and the Lobregat group were not originally impleaded as defendants in CC No. 0033.&nbsp; They later asked and were allowed by the Sandiganbayan to intervene. If they really believe then that the Sandiganbayan is without jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint in question, then why intervene in the first place? They could have sat idly by and let the proceedings continue and would not have been affected by the outcome of the case as they can challenge the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan when the time for implementation of the flawed decision comes.&nbsp; More importantly, the decision in the case will have no effect on them since they were not impleaded as indispensable parties. After all, the joinder of all indispensable parties to a suit is not only mandatory, but jurisdictional as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; By their intervention, which the Sandiganbayan allowed per its resolution dated September 30, 1991, COCOFED and Ursua have clearly manifested their desire to submit to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and seek relief from said court. Thereafter, they filed numerous pleadings in the subdivided complaints seeking relief and actively participated in numerous proceedings.&nbsp; Among the pleadings thus filed are the <i>Oppositions to the Motion for Intervention</i> interposed by the Pambansang Koalisyon ng mga Samahang Magsasaka at Manggagawa sa Niyogan and Gabay ng Mundo sa Kaunlaran Foundation, Inc., a <i>Class Action Omnibus Motion</i> to enjoin the PCGG from voting the SMC shares dated February 23, 2001 (granted by Sandiganbayan) and the <i>Class Action Motion for a Separate Summary Judgment</i> dated April 11, 2001.&nbsp; By these acts, COCOFED et al. are now legally estopped from asserting the Sandiganbayn's want of jurisdiction, if that be the case, over the subject matter of the complaint as they have voluntarily yielded to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Estoppel has now barred the challenge on Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction.<br><br>The ensuing excerpts from <i>Macahilig v. Heirs of Magalit</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> are instructive:<br><br><blockquote>We cannot allow her to attack its jurisdiction simply because it rendered a Decision prejudicial to her position.&nbsp; Participation in all stages of a case before a trial court effectively estops a party from challenging its jurisdiction.&nbsp; One cannot belatedly reject or repudiate its decision after voluntarily submitting to its jurisdiction, just to secure affirmative relief against one's opponent or after failing to obtain such relief.&nbsp; If, by deed or conduct, a party has induced another to act in a particular manner, estoppel effectively bars the former from adopting an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct that thereby causes loss or injury to the latter.</blockquote><br>Lest it be overlooked, this Court has already decided that the sequestered shares are <i>prima facie</i> ill-gotten wealth rendering the issue of the validity of their sequestration and of the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan over the case beyond doubt. In the case of <i>COCOFED v. PCGG</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> We stated that:<br><br><blockquote>It is of course not for this Court to pass upon the factual issues thus raised. That function pertains to the Sandiganbayan in the first instance. For purposes of this proceeding, all that the Court needs to determine is whether or not there is <i>prima facie</i> justification for the sequestration ordered by the PCGG. The Court is satisfied that there is. <b>The cited incidents, given the public character of the coconut levy funds, place petitioners COCOFED and its leaders and officials, at least prima facie, squarely within the purview of Executive Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 14, </b>as construed and applied in<b> BASECO, </b>to wit:<br><br>"1. that ill-gotten properties (were) amassed by the leaders and supporters of the previous regime;<br><br>"a. more particularly, that `(i)ll-gotten wealth was accumulated by ... Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates, .... (and) business enterprises and entities (came to be) owned or controlled by them, during ... (the Marcos) administration, directly or through nominees, <i>by taking undue advantage of their public office and using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationships</i>';<br><br>"b. otherwise stated, that <i>`there are assets and properties purportedly pertaining to [the Marcoses], their close relatives, subordinates, business associates, dummies, agents or nominees which had been or were acquired by them directly or indirectly, through or as a result of the improper or illegal use of funds or properties owned by the Government ...or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of their office, authority, influence, connections or relationship, resulting in their unjust enrichment ....;</i><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...<br></div><br>2. The petitioners' claim that the assets acquired with the coconut levy funds are privately owned by the coconut farmers is founded on certain provisions of law, to wit [Sec. 7, RA 6260 and Sec. 5, Art. III, PD 1468]... (Words in bracket added; italics in the original).</blockquote><br>In their attempt to dismiss the amended complaints in question, petitioners asseverate that (1) the coconut farmers cannot be considered as "subordinates, close and/or business associates, dummies, agents and nominees" of Cojuangco, Jr. or the Marcoses, and (2) the sequestered shares were not illegally acquired nor acquired "through or as result of improper or illegal use or conversion of funds belonging to the Government." While not saying so explicitly, petitioners are doubtless conveying the idea that wealth, however acquired, would not be considered "ill-gotten" in the context of EO 1, 2 and 14, s. of 1986, absent proof that the recipient or end possessor thereof is outside&nbsp; the Marcos' circle of friends, associates, cronies or nominees.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>As may be noted, E.O. 1 and 2 advert to President Marcos, or his associates' nominees.&nbsp; In its most common signification, the term "<i>nominee</i>" refers to one who is designated to act for another usually in a limited way; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> a person in whose name a stock or bond certificate is registered but who is not the actual owner thereof is considered a nominee."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Corpus Juris Secundum</i> describes a nominee as one:<br><br><blockquote>... designated to act for another as his representative in a rather limited sense. It has no connotation, however, other than that of acting for another, in representation of another or as the grantee of another. In its commonly accepted meaning the term connoted the delegation of authority to the nominee in a representative or nominal capacity only, and does not connote the transfer or assignment to the nominee of any property in, or ownership of, the rights of the person nominating him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></blockquote><br>So, the next question that comes to the fore is: would the term "nominee" include the more than one million coconut farmers alleged to be the recipients of the UCPB shares?<br><br>Guided by the foregoing definitions, the query must be answered in the affirmative if only to give life to those executive issuances aimed at ensuring the recovery of ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; It is basic, almost elementary, that:<br><br><blockquote>Laws must receive a sensible interpretation to promote the ends for which they are enacted. They should be so given reasonable and practical construction as will give life to them, if it can be done without doing violence to reason. Conversely, a law should not be so construed as to allow the doing of an act which is prohibited by law, not so interpreted as to afford an opportunity to defeat compliance with its terms, create an inconsistency, or contravene the plain words of the law. <i>Interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat</i> or that interpretation as will give the thing efficacy is to be adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></blockquote><br>E.O. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A, it bears to stress, were issued precisely to effect the recovery of ill-gotten assets amassed by the Marcoses, their associates, subordinates and cronies, or through their nominees. Be that as it may, it stands to reason that persons listed as associated with the Marcoses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> refer to those in possession of such ill-gotten wealth but holding the same in behalf of the actual, albeit undisclosed owner, to prevent discovery and consequently recovery. Certainly, it is well-nigh inconceivable that ill-gotten assets would be distributed to and left in the hands of individuals or entities with obvious traceable connections to Mr. Marcos and his cronies. The Court can take, as it has in fact taken, judicial notice of schemes and machinations that have been put in place to keep ill-gotten assets under wraps. These would include the setting up of layers after layers of shell or dummy, but controlled, corporations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> or manipulated instruments calculated to confuse if not altogether mislead would-be investigators from recovering wealth deceitfully amassed at the expense of the people or simply the fruits thereof. Transferring the illegal assets to third parties not readily perceived as Marcos cronies would be another. So it was that in <i>PCGG v. Pena</i>, the Court, describing the rule of Marcos as a "<i>well entrenched plundering regime of twenty years,</i>" noted the magnitude of the past regime's organized pillage and the ingenuity of the plunderers and pillagers with the assistance of experts and the best legal minds in the market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Hence, to give full effect to E.O. 1, 2 and 14, s. of 1986, the term "nominee," as used in the above issuances, must be taken to mean to include any person or group of persons, natural or juridical, in whose name government funds or assets were transferred to by Pres. Marcos, his cronies or his associates. To this characterization must include what the Sandiganbayan considered the "<i>unidentified</i>" coconut farmers, more than a million of faceless and <b>nameless coconut farmers, the alleged beneficiaries of the distributed UCPB shares, who, under the terms of Sec. 10 of PCA A.O. No. 1, s. of 1975, were required, upon the delivery of their respective stock certificates, to execute an irrevocable proxy in favor of the Bank's manager. </b>There is thus ample truth to the observations - <i>"[That] the PCA provided this condition only indicates that the PCA had no intention to constitute the coconut farmer UCPB stockholder as a bona fide stockholder;" that the 1</i>.5 million <i>registered farmer-stockholders were</i> "<b><i>mere nominal stockholders</i></b><i>."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, the challenge on the Sandiganbayan's subject matter jurisdiction at bar must fail.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br><br><b>Petitioners COCOFED et al. were not</b><br><b>deprived of their right to be heard.</b><br></center><br>As a procedural issue, COCOFED, et al. and Ursua next contend that in the course of almost 20 years that the cases have been with the anti-graft court, they have repeatedly sought leave to adduce evidence (prior to respondent's complete presentation of evidence) to prove the coco farmers'&nbsp; actual and beneficial ownership of the sequestered shares.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan, however, had repeatedly and continuously disallowed such requests, thus depriving them of their constitutional right to be heard.<br><br>This contention is untenable, their demand to adduce evidence being disallowable on the ground of prematurity.<br><br>The records reveal that the Republic, after adducing its evidence in CC No. 0033-A, subsequently filed <i>a Motion Ad Cautelam for Leave to Present Additional Evidence</i> dated March 28, 2001. This motion remained unresolved at the time the Republic interposed its <i>Motion for Partial Summary Judgment</i>.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan granted the later motion and accordingly rendered the Partial Summary Judgment, effectively preempting the presentation of evidence by the defendants in said case (herein petitioners COCOFED and Ursua).<br><br>Section 5, Rule 30 the Rules of Court clearly sets out the order of presenting evidence:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Order of trial</i>.--Subject to the provisions of section 2 of Rule 31, and unless the court for special reasons otherwise directs, the trial shall be limited to the issues stated in the pre-trial order and shall proceed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(a) The plaintiff shall adduce evidence in support of his complaint;<br><br><b>(b) The defendant shall then adduce evidence in support of his defense, counterclaim, cross-claim and third-party complaint;</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">...&nbsp;&nbsp; ... ...<br></div><br>(g) Upon admission of the evidence, the case shall be deemed submitted for decision, unless the court directs the parties to argue or to submit their respective memoranda or any further pleadings.</blockquote><br>If several defendants or third-party defendants, and so forth. having separate defenses appear by different counsel, the court shall determine the relative order of presentation of their evidence. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Evidently, for the orderly administration of justice, the plaintiff shall first adduce evidence in support of his complaint and after the formal offer of evidence and the ruling thereon, then comes the turn of defendant under Section 3 (b) to adduce evidence in support of his defense, counterclaim, cross-claim and third party complaint, if any.&nbsp; Deviation from such order of trial is purely discretionary upon the trial court, in this case, the Sandiganbayan, which cannot be questioned by the parties unless the vitiating element of grave abuse of discretion supervenes.&nbsp; Thus, the right of COCOFED to present evidence on the main case had not yet ripened. And the rendition of the partial summary judgments overtook their right to present evidence on their defenses.<br><br>It cannot be stressed enough that the Republic as well as herein petitioners were well within their rights to move, as they in fact separately did, for a partial summary judgment. Summary judgment may be allowed where, save for the amount of damages, there is, as shown by affidavits and like evidentiary documents, no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. A "genuine issue", as distinguished from one that is fictitious, contrived and set up in bad faith, means an issue of fact that calls for the presentation of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>&nbsp; Summary or accelerated judgment, therefore, is a procedural technique aimed at weeding out sham claims or defenses at an early stage of the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>&nbsp; Sections 1, 2 and 4 of Rule 35 of the Rules of Court on Summary Judgment, respectively provide:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Summary judgment for claimant</i>.--A party seeking to recover upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim ... may, at any time after the pleading in answer thereto has been served, move with supporting affidavits, depositions or admissions for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any part thereof.<br><br><i>SEC. 2.

It shall thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the action as are just. The facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted on the controverted facts accordingly.</blockquote><br>Clearly, petitioner COCOFED's right to be heard had not been violated by the mere issuance of PSJ-A and PSJ-F before they can adduce their evidence.<br><br>As it were, petitioners COCOFED et al. were able to present documentary evidence in conjunction with its "Class Action Omnibus Motion" dated February 23, 2001 where they appended around four hundred (400) documents including affidavits of alleged farmers. These petitioners manifested that said documents comprise their evidence to prove the farmers' ownership of the UCPB shares, which were distributed in accordance with valid and existing laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Lastly, COCOFED et al. even filed their own <i>Motion for Separate Summary Judgment</i>, an event reflective of their admission that there are no more factual issues left to be determined at the level of the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; This act of filing a motion for summary judgment is a judicial admission against COCOFED under Section 26, Rule 130 which declares that the "act, declaration or omission of a party as to a relevant fact may be given in evidence against him."<br><br>Viewed in this light, the Court has to reject petitioners' self-serving allegations about being deprived the right to adduce evidence.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br><b>The right to speedy trial was not violated.</b></center><br>This brings to the fore the alleged violation of petitioners' right to a speedy trial and speedy disposition of the case. In support of their contention, petitioners cite <i>Licaros v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> where the Court dismissed the case pending before the Sandiganbayan for violation of the accused's right to a speedy trial.<br><br>It must be clarified right off that the right to a speedy disposition of case and the accused's right to a speedy trial are distinct, albeit kindred, guarantees, the most obvious difference being that a speedy disposition of cases, as provided in Article III, Section 16 of the Constitution, obtains regardless of the nature of the case:<br><br><blockquote>Section 16. All persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.</blockquote><br>In fine, the right to a speedy trial is available only to an accused and is a peculiarly criminal law concept, while the broader right to a speedy disposition of cases may be tapped in any proceedings conducted by state agencies. Thus, in <i>Licaros </i>the Court dismissed the criminal case against the accused due to the palpable transgression of his right to a speedy trial.<br><br>In the instant case, the appropriate right involved is the right to a speedy disposition of cases, the recovery of ill-gotten wealth being a civil suit.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court has had the occasion to dismiss several cases owing to the infringement of a party's right to a speedy disposition of cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Dismissal of the case for violation of this right is the general rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Bernat v. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (5<sup>th</sup> Division)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> expounds on the extent of the right to a speedy disposition of cases as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 16 of Article III of the Constitution guarantees the right of all persons to a "speedy disposition of their cases." Nevertheless, this right is deemed violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays.&nbsp; Moreover, the determination of whether the delays are of said nature is relative and cannot be based on a mere mathematical reckoning of time. Particular regard must be taken of the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case. As a guideline, the Court in Dela Peña v. Sandiganbayan mentioned certain factors that should be considered and balanced, namely: 1) length of delay; 2) reasons for the delay; 3) assertion or failure to assert such right by the accused; and 4) prejudice caused by the delay.<br><br><center>... ... ...</center><br>While this Court recognizes the right to speedy disposition quite distinctly from the right to a speedy trial, and although this Court has always zealously espoused protection from oppressive and vexatious delays not attributable to the party involved, at the same time, we hold that a party's individual rights should not work against and preclude the people's equally important right to public justice. In the instant case, three people died as a result of the crash of the airplane that the accused was flying. It appears to us that the delay in the disposition of the case prejudiced not just the accused but the people as well. Since the accused has completely failed to assert his right seasonably and inasmuch as the respondent judge was not in a position to dispose of the case on the merits... we hold it proper and equitable to give the parties fair opportunity to obtain ... substantial justice in the premises.<br></blockquote><br>The more recent case of <i>Tello v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> laid stress to the restrictive dimension to the right to speedy disposition of cases, <i>i.e</i>., it is lost unless seasonably invoked:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Bernat ...</i>, the Court denied petitioner's claim of denial of his right to a speedy disposition of cases considering that [he] ... chose to remain silent for eight years before complaining of the delay in the disposition of his case. The Court ruled that petitioner failed to seasonably assert his right and he merely sat and waited from the time his case was submitted for resolution. In this case, petitioner similarly failed to assert his right to a speedy disposition of his case.... He only invoked his right to a speedy disposition of cases after [his conviction]....

Indeed, as aptly observed by the Solicitor General, this case is for the recovery of shares grounded on the invalidity of certain enactments, which in turn is rooted in the shares being public in character, purchased as they were by funds raised by the taxing and/or a mix of taxing and police powers of the state.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> As may be recalled, P.D. No. 755, under the policy-declaring provision, authorized the distribution of UCPB shares of stock free to coconut farmers. On the other hand, Section 2 of P.D. No. 755, hereunder quoted below, effectively authorized the PCA to utilize portions of the CCSF to pay the financial commitment of the farmers to acquire UCPB and to deposit portions of the CCSF levies with UCPB interest free. And as there also provided, the CCSF, CIDF and like levies that PCA is authorized to collect shall be considered as non-special or fiduciary funds to be transferred to the general fund of the Government, meaning they shall be deemed private funds.<br><br>Section 2 of P.D. No. 755 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Financial Assistance</i>. -- To enable the coconut farmers to comply with their contractual obligations under the aforesaid Agreement, <b>the [PCA] is hereby directed to draw and utilize the collections under the [CCSF] authorized to be levied by [PD] No. 232, as amended, to pay for the financial commitments of the coconut farmers under the said agreement</b> and, except for [PCA's]&nbsp; budgetary requirements&nbsp; ..., all collections under the [CCSF] Levy and (50%) of the collections under the [CIDF] shall be deposited, interest free, with the said bank of the coconut farmers and such deposits shall not be withdrawn until the ... the bank has sufficient equity capital ...; and since the operations, and activities of the [PCA] are all in accord with the present social economic plans and programs of the Government, <b>all collections and levies which the [PCA] is authorized to levy and collect such as but not limited to the [CCS Levy] and the [CIDF] ... shall not be considered or construed, under any law or regulation, special and/or fiduciary funds and do not form part of the general funds of the national government within the contemplation of [P.D.] No. 711. </b>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>A similar provision can also be found in Article III, Section 5 of P.D.

Nos. 755, as well as those of P.D. Nos. 961 and 1468, could have been the only plausible means by which close to a purported million and a half coconut farmers could have acquired the said shares of stock. It has, therefore, become necessary to determine the validity of the authorizing law, which made the stock transfer and acquisitions possible.<br><br>To reiterate, it is of crucial importance to determine the validity of P.D. Nos. 755, 961 and 1468 in light of the constitutional proscription against the use of special funds save for the purpose it was established. Otherwise, petitioners' claim of <b>legitimate</b> <b>private ownership</b> over UCPB shares and indirectly over SMC shares held by UCPB's subsidiaries will have no leg to stand on, P.D. No. 755 being the only law authorizing the distribution of the SMC and UCPB shares of stock to coconut farmers, and with the aforementioned provisions actually stating and holding that the coco levy fund shall not be considered as a special - not even general - fund, but shall be owned by the farmers in their private capacities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan's ensuing ratiocination on the need to pass upon constitutional issues the Republic raised below commends itself for concurrence:<br><br><blockquote>This Court is convinced of the imperative need to pass upon the issues of constitutionality raised by Plaintiff.&nbsp; <b>The issue of constitutionality of the provisions of P.D.

Cojuangco, Jr. caused the issuance ... of PD 755 (a) declaring that the coconut levy funds shall not be considered special and fiduciary and trusts funds and do not form part of the general funds of the National Government, conveniently repealing for that purpose a series of coconut levy funds as special, fiduciary, trust and government funds....<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...<br></div><br>`(iv) To perpetuate his opportunity to deal with and make use the coconut levy funds to build his economic empire, Cojuangco, Jr. caused the issuance by Defendant Ferdinand E.

Nos. 755 and 1468.&nbsp; The provision of Sec. 5, Art. III of P.D. 961 is substantially similar to the provisions of the aforesaid two [PDs].&nbsp; P.D. No. 755 allegedly legitimized the "highly anomalous and irregular use and diversion of government funds to advance his [defendant Cojuangco's] own private and commercial interest."&nbsp; The issuance of the said [PD] which has the force and effect of a law can only be assailed on constitutional grounds.&nbsp; The merits of the grounds adverted to in the allegations of the Third Amended Complaint (Subdivided) can only be resolved by this Court by testing the questioned [PDs], which are considered part of the laws of the land....<br><br>As early as June 20, 1989, this Court in its Resolution expressed this Court's understanding of the import of the allegations of the complaint, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"It is likewise alleged in the Complaint that in order to legitimize the diversion of funds, defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos issued the Presidential Decrees referred to by the movants.&nbsp; <b>This is then the core of Plaintiff's complaint:&nbsp; that, insofar as the coconut levy is concerned, these decrees had been enacted as tools for the acquisition of ill-gotten wealth for specific favored individuals.</b><br><br>"Even if Plaintiff may not have said so effectively, the complaint in fact disputes the legitimacy, and, if one pleases, the constitutionality of such enactments....<br><br>"The issue is validly raised on the face of the complaint and defendants must respond to it."</blockquote><br>Since ... the question of constitutionality ... may be raised even on appeal if the determination of such a question is essential to the decision of the case, we find more reason to resolve this constitutional question at this stage of the proceedings, where <b>the defense is grounded solely on the very laws the constitutionality of which are being questioned</b> and where the evidence of the defendants would seek mainly to prove their faithful and good faith compliance with the said laws and their implementing rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br><b><u>The Court's rulings in COCOFED v.

Nos. 755, 961 and 1468, petitioners would sneak in the argument that the Court has, in three separate instances, upheld the validity, and thumbed down the Republic's challenge to the constitutionality, of said laws imposing the different coconut levies and prescribing the uses of the fund collected. The separate actions of the Court, petitioners add, would conclude the Sandiganbayan on the issue of constitutionality of said issuances, following the law-of-the-case principle. Petitioners allege:<br><br><blockquote>Otherwise stated, the decision of this Honorable Court in the COCOFED Case overruling the strict public fund theory espoused by the Respondent Republic, upholding the propriety of the laws imposing the collections of the different Coconut Levies and expressly allowing COCOFED, <i>et al.</i>, to prove that the Sequestered Assets have legitimately become their private properties had become final and immutable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners are mistaken.<br><br><i>Yu v.

It is a term applied to an established rule that when an appellate court passes on a question and remands the case to the lower court for further proceedings, the question there settled becomes the law of the case upon subsequent appeal. It means that whatever is once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case, ... so long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court.</blockquote><br>Otherwise put, the principle means that questions of law that have been previously raised and disposed of in the proceedings shall be controlling in succeeding instances where the same legal question is raised, provided that the facts on which the legal issue was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court.&nbsp; Guided by this definition, the law of the case principle cannot provide petitioners any comfort. We shall explain why.<br><br>In the first instance, petitioners cite <i>COCOFED v. PCGG.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>&nbsp; There, respondent PCGG questioned the validity of the coconut levy laws based on the limits of the state's taxing and police power, as may be deduced from the ensuing observations of the Court:<br><br><blockquote>.... Indeed, the Solicitor General suggests quite strongly that the laws operating or purporting to convert the coconut levy funds into private funds, are a transgression of the basic limitations for the licit exercise of the state's taxing and police powers, and that certain provisions of said laws are merely clever stratagems to keep away government audit in order to facilitate misappropriation of the funds in question.<br><br>The utilization and proper management of the coconut levy funds, [to acquire shares of stocks for coconut farmers and workers] raised as they were by the State's police and taxing power are certainly the concern of the Government.... The coconut levy funds are clearly affected with public interest. Until it is demonstrated satisfactorily that they have legitimately become private funds, they must <i>prima facie</i> be accounted subject to measures prescribed in EO Nos. 1, 2, and 14 to prevent their concealment, dissipation, etc....<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> [Words in bracket added.]</blockquote><br>The issue, therefore, in <i>COCOFED v. PCGG</i> turns on the legality of the transfer of the shares of stock bought with the coconut levy funds to coconut farmers. This must be distinguished with the issues in the instant case of whether P.D. No. 755 violated Section 29, paragraph 3 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution as well as to whether P.D. No. 755 constitutes undue delegation of legislative power. Clearly, the issues in both sets of cases are so different as to preclude the application of the law of the case rule.<br><br>The second and third instances that petitioners draw attention to refer to the rulings in <i>Republic&nbsp; v. Sandiganbayan</i>, where the Court by Resolution of December 13, 1994, as reiterated in another resolution dated March 26, 1996, resolved to deny the separate motions of the Republic to resolve legal questions on the character of the coconut levy funds, more particularly to declare as unconstitutional (a) coconut levies collected pursuant to various issuances as public funds and (b)&nbsp; Article III, Section 5 of P.D. No. 1468.<br><br>Prescinding from the foregoing considerations, petitioners would state: "Having filed at least three (3) motions ... seeking, among others, to declare certain provisions of the Coconut Levy Laws unconstitutional and having been rebuffed all three times by this Court," the Republic - and necessarily Sandiganbayan - "should have followed as [they were] legally bound by this ... Court's prior determination" on that above issue of constitutionality under the doctrine of Law of the Case.<br><br>Petitioners are wrong.&nbsp; The Court merely declined to pass upon the constitutionality of the coconut levy laws or some of their provisions. It did not declare that the UCPB shares acquired with the use of coconut levy funds have legitimately become private.<br><br><b><u>The coconut levy funds are in the nature <br>of taxes and can only be used for public <br>purpose.&nbsp; Consequently, they cannot be <br>used to purchase shares of stocks to be <br>given for free to private individuals.</u></b><br><br>Indeed, We have hitherto discussed, the coconut levy was imposed in the exercise of the State's inherent power of taxation.&nbsp; As We wrote in <i>Republic v. COCOFED</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Indeed, <b><u>coconut levy funds partake of the nature of taxes</u></b>, which, in general, are enforced proportional contributions from persons and properties, exacted by the State by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for all public needs.<br><br>Based on its definition, a tax has three elements, namely: a) it is an enforced proportional contribution from persons and properties; b) it is imposed by the State by virtue of its sovereignty; and c) it is levied for the support of the government.&nbsp; The coconut levy funds fall squarely into these elements for the following reasons:<br><br>(a) They were generated by virtue of statutory enactments imposed on the coconut farmers requiring the payment of prescribed amounts.&nbsp; Thus, PD No. 276, which created the Coconut Consumer[s] Stabilization Fund (CCSF), mandated the following:<br><br><blockquote>"a. A levy, initially, of P15.00 per 100 kilograms of copra resecada or its equivalent in other coconut products, shall be imposed on every first sale, in accordance with the mechanics established under RA 6260, effective at the start of business hours on August 10, 1973.<br><br>"The proceeds from the levy shall be deposited with the Philippine National Bank or any other government bank to the account of the Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund, as a separate trust fund which shall not form part of the general fund of the government."</blockquote><br>The coco levies were further clarified in amendatory laws, specifically PD No. 961 and PD No. 1468 - in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>"The Authority (PCA) is hereby empowered to impose and collect a levy, to be known as the Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund Levy, on every one hundred kilos of copra resecada, or its equivalent ... delivered to, and/or purchased by, copra exporters, oil millers, desiccators and other end-users of copra or its equivalent in other coconut products.&nbsp; <b>The levy shall be paid by such copra exporters, oil millers, desiccators and other end-users of copra or its equivalent in other coconut products </b>under such rules and regulations as the Authority may prescribe.&nbsp; Until otherwise prescribed by the Authority, the current levy being collected shall be continued."</blockquote><br>Like other tax measures, they were not voluntary payments or donations by the people.&nbsp; They were enforced contributions exacted on pain of penal sanctions, as provided under PD No. 276:<br><br><blockquote>"3. Any person or firm who violates any provision of this Decree or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, shall, in addition to penalties already prescribed under existing administrative and special law, pay a fine of not less than P2,500 or more than P10,000, or suffer cancellation of licenses to operate, or both, at the discretion of the Court."</blockquote><br>Such penalties were later amended thus: ....<br><br>(b) The coconut levies were imposed pursuant to the laws enacted by the proper legislative authorities of the State.&nbsp; Indeed, the CCSF was collected under PD No. 276...."<br><br>(c) They were clearly imposed for a <b><u>public purpose</u></b>.&nbsp; <b>There is absolutely no question that they were collected to advance the government's avowed policy of protecting the <u>coconut industry</u>.</b>&nbsp; This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that the <b><u>coconut industry</u></b> is one of the great economic pillars of our nation, and coconuts and their byproducts occupy a leading position among the country's export products....<br><br>Taxation is done not merely to raise revenues to support the government, but also to provide means for the <b>rehabilitation and the stabilization of a threatened industry</b>, which is so affected with <b>public interest</b> as to be within the police power of the State....<br><br>Even if the money is allocated for a <b>special purpose</b> and raised by special means, <b>it is still public in character</b>....&nbsp; In <i>Cocofed v. PCGG, </i>the Court observed that certain agencies or enterprises "were organized and financed with revenues derived from coconut levies imposed under a succession of law of the late dictatorship ... with deposed Ferdinand Marcos and his cronies as the suspected authors and chief beneficiaries of the resulting coconut industry monopoly."&nbsp; The Court continued: "....&nbsp; <b>It cannot be denied that the coconut industry is one of the major industries supporting the national economy.</b>&nbsp; It is, therefore, the State's concern to make it a strong and secure source <b>not only</b> of the livelihood of a significant segment of the population, <b>but also of export earnings the sustained growth of which is one of the imperatives of economic stability</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis Ours)<br></blockquote>We have ruled time and again that taxes are imposed only for a public purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111] </sup> "They cannot be used for purely private purposes or for the exclusive benefit of private persons."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>&nbsp; When a law imposes taxes or levies from the public, with the intent to give undue benefit or advantage to private persons, or the promotion of private enterprises, that law cannot be said to satisfy the requirement of public purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Gaston v.

Nos. 755, 961 and 1468 complied with Article VI, Section 29 (3) of the 1987 Constitution, a look at the public policy or the purpose for which the CCSF levy was imposed is necessary.<br><br>The CCSF was established by virtue of P.D. No. 276 wherein it is stated that:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, an escalating crisis brought about by an abnormal situation in the world market for fats and oils has resulted in supply and price dislocations <b>in the domestic market </b>for coconut-based goods, and has <b>created hardships for consumers </b>thereof;<br><br>WHEREAS, the <b>representatives of the coconut industry</b> ... have proposed the implementation of an industry-financed stabilization scheme which will permit socialized pricing of coconut-based commodities;<br><br>WHEREAS, it is the policy of the State to promote the welfare and economic well-being <b>of the consuming public</b>;<br><center>....<br></center><br>1.

No. 276 created and exacted the CCSF "to advance the government's avowed policy of protecting the coconut industry."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup>&nbsp; Evidently, the CCSF was originally set up as a special fund to support consumer purchases of coconut products. To put it a bit differently, the protection of the entire coconut industry, and even more importantly, for the consuming public provides the rationale for the creation of the coconut levy fund.&nbsp; There can be no quibbling then that the&nbsp; foregoing provisions of P.D. No. 276 intended the fund created and set up therein&nbsp; not especially for the coconut farmers but for the entire coconut industry, albeit the improvement of the industry would doubtless&nbsp; redound to the benefit of the farmers.&nbsp; Upon the foregoing perspective, the following provisions of P.D. Nos. 755, 961 and 1468 insofar as they declared, as the case may be, that: "[the coconut levy] fund and the disbursements thereof [shall be] authorized for the benefit of the coconut farmers and shall be owned by them in their private capacities;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> or the coconut levy fund shall not be construed by any law to be a special and/or fiduciary fund, and do not therefore form part of the general fund of the national government later on;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> or the UCPB shares acquired using the coconut levy fund shall be distributed to the coconut farmers for free,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> violated the special public&nbsp; purpose for which the CCSF was established.<br><br>In sum, not only were the challenged presidential issuances&nbsp;&nbsp; unconstitutional for decreeing the&nbsp; distribution of the shares of stock for free to the coconut farmers and, therefore, negating the public purpose declared by P.D. No. 276, <i>i.e., </i>to stabilize the price of edible oil[136] and to protect the coconut industry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup>&nbsp; They likewise reclassified, nay treated, the coconut levy fund as <i>private fund </i>to be disbursed and/or invested for the benefit of <i>private individuals </i>in their <i>private capacities</i>, contrary to the original purpose for which the fund was created.&nbsp; To compound the situation, the offending provisions effectively removed the coconut levy fund away from the cavil of public funds which normally can be paid out only pursuant to an appropriation made by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup>&nbsp; The conversion of public funds into private assets was illegally allowed, in fact mandated, by these provisions.&nbsp; Clearly therefore, the pertinent provisions of P.D. Nos. 755, 961 and 1468 are unconstitutional for violating Article VI, Section 29 (3) of the Constitution.&nbsp; In this context, the distribution by PCA of the UCPB shares purchased by means of the coconut levy fund - a special fund of the government - to the coconut farmers, is therefore void.<br><br>We quote with approval the Sandiganbayan's reasons for declaring the provisions of P.D. Nos. 755, 961 and 1468 as unconstitutional:<br><br><blockquote>It is now settled, in view of the ruling in <i>Republic v. COCOFED</i>, <i>et al</i>., <i>supra</i>, that "Coconut levy funds are raised with the use of the police and taxing powers of the State;" that "they are levies imposed by the State for the benefit of the coconut industry and its farmers" and that "they were clearly imposed for a public purpose." This public purpose is explained in the said case, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>.... c) They were clearly imposed for a public purpose.&nbsp; There is absolutely no question that they were colleted to advance the government's avowed policy of protecting the coconut industry....<br><br>"Taxation is done not merely to raise revenues to support the government, but also to provide means for the rehabilitation and the stabilization of a threatened industry, which is so affected with public interest as to be within the police power of the State, as held in Caltex Philippines v.

Orbos.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...</div></blockquote><br>The avowed public purpose for the disbursement of the CCSF is contained in the perambulatory clauses and Section 1 of P.D. No. 755.&nbsp; The imperativeness of enunciating the public purpose of the expenditure of funds raised through taxation is underscored in the case of Pascual v. The Secretary of Public Works and Communications, <i>et al</i>, supra, which held:<br><br><blockquote>"As regards the legal feasibility of appropriating public funds for a private purpose the principle according to Ruling Case Law, is this:<br><br>`It is a general rule that the legislature is without power to appropriate public revenue for anything but a public purpose ... it is the essential character of the direct object of the expenditure which must determine its validity as justifying a tax, and not the magnitude of the interests to be affected nor the degree to which the general advantage of the community, and thus the public welfare may be ultimately benefited by their promotion.&nbsp; Incidental advantage to the public or to the state, which results from the promotion of private interests and the prosperity of private enterprises or business, does not justify their aid by the use of public money.' 25 R.L.C. pp. 398-400)<br><br>"The rule is set forth in Corpus Juris Secundum in the following language:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...<br></div><br>`The test of the constitutionality of a statute requiring the use of public funds is whether the statute is designed to promote the public interests, as opposed to the furtherance of the advantage of individuals, although each advantage to individuals might incidentally serve the public....'

Additionally, they explain that said court erred in concluding that Section 1 of PD No. 755 constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power insofar as it authorizes the PCA to promulgate rules and regulations governing the distribution of the UCPB shares to the farmers.<br><br>These propositions are meritless.<br><br>The assailed PSJ-A noted the operational distribution nightmare faced by PCA and the mode of distribution of UCPB shares set in motion by that agency left much room for diversion.&nbsp; Wrote the Sandiganbayan:<br><br><blockquote>The actual distribution of the bank shares was admittedly an enormous operational problem which resulted in the failure of the intended beneficiaries to receive their shares of stocks in the bank, as shown by the rules and regulations, issued by the PCA, without adequate guidelines being provided to it by P.D. No. 755.&nbsp; PCA Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1975 (August 20, 1975), "Rules and Regulations Governing the Distribution of Shares of Stock of the Bank Authorized to be Acquired Pursuant to PCA Board Resolution No. 246-75", quoted hereunder discloses how the undistributed shares of stocks due to anonymous coconut farmers or payors of the coconut levy fees were authorized to be distributed to existing shareholders of the Bank:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 9. Fractional and Undistributed Shares - Fractional shares and shares which remain undistributed ... shall be distributed to all the coconut farmers who have qualified and received equity in the Bank and shall be apportioned among them, as far as practicable, in proportion to their equity in relation to the number of undistributed equity and such further rules and regulations as may hereafter be promulgated.'</blockquote><br>The foregoing PCA issuance was further amended by Resolution No. 074-78, still citing the same problem of distribution of the bank shares....:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...<br></div><br>Thus, when 51,200,806 shares in the bank remained undistributed, the PCA deemed it proper to give a "bonanza" to coconut farmers who already got their bank shares, by giving them an additional share for each share owned by them and by converting their fractional shares into full shares.&nbsp; The rest of the shares were then transferred to a private organization, the COCOFED, for distribution to those determined to be "bona fide coconut farmers" who had "not received shares of stock of the Bank."&nbsp; ....<br><br><b>The PCA</b> <b>thus assumed</b>, due to lack of adequate guidelines set by P.D. No. 755, <b>that it had complete authority to define who are the coconut farmers and to decide as to who among the coconut farmers shall be given the gift of bank shares;</b> how many shares shall be given to them, and what basis it shall use to determine the amount of shares to be distributed for free to the coconut farmers.&nbsp; In other words, P.D. No. 755 fails the completeness test which renders it constitutionally infirm.<br><br>Regarding the second requisite of standard, it is settled that legislative standard need not be expressed....<br><br>We observed, however, that the PCA [AO] No. 1, Series of 1975 and PCA Rules and Regulations 074-78, did not take into consideration the accomplishment of the public purpose or the national standard/policy of P.D. No. 755 which is directly to accelerate the development and growth of the coconut industry and as a consequence thereof, to make the coconut farmers "participants in and beneficiaries" of such growth and development. The said PCA issuances did nothing more than provide guidelines as to whom the UCPB shares were to be distributed and how many bank shares shall be allotted to the beneficiaries. There was no mention of how the distributed shares shall be used to achieve exclusively or at least directly or primarily the aim or public purpose enunciated by P.D. No. 755.&nbsp; The numerical or quantitative distribution of shares contemplated by the PCA regulations which is a condition for the validly of said administrative issuances.&nbsp; <b>There was a reversal of priorities.&nbsp; The narrow private interests prevailed over the laudable objectives of the law...</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, under the May 25, 1975 agreement implemented by the PCA issuances, the PCA acquired only 64.98% of the shares of the bank and even the shares covering the said 64.98% were later on transferred to non-coconut farmers."<br><br>The distribution for free of the shares of stock of the CIIF Companies is tainted with the above-mentioned constitutional infirmities of the PCA administrative issuances.&nbsp; In view of the foregoing, we cannot consider the provision of P.D. No. 961 and P.D. No. 1468 and the implementing regulations issued by the PCA as valid legal basis to hold that assets acquired with public funds have legitimately become private properties." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>P.D. No. 755 involves an invalid delegation of legislative power, a concept discussed in <i>Soriano v. Laguardia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> citing the following excerpts from <i>Edu v. Ericta</i>:<br><br><blockquote>It is a fundamental ... that Congress may not delegate its legislative power....&nbsp; What cannot be delegated is the authority ... to make laws and to alter and repeal them; the test is the completeness of the statute in all its term and provisions when it leaves the hands of the legislature. To determine whether or not there is an undue delegation of legislative power, the inquiry must be directed to the scope and definiteness of the measure enacted. <b>The legislature does not abdicate its functions when it describes what job must be done, who is to do it, and what is the scope of his authority....</b><br><br>To avoid the taint of unlawful delegation, there must be a standard, which implies at the very least that the legislature itself determines matters of principle and lays down fundamental policy. Otherwise, the charge of complete abdication may be hard to repel. <b>A standard thus defines legislative policy, marks its limits, maps out its boundaries and specifies the public agency to apply it. It indicates the circumstances under which the legislative command is to be effected. </b>It is the criterion by which legislative purpose may be carried out. Thereafter, the executive or administrative office designated may in pursuance of the above guidelines promulgate supplemental rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Jurisprudence is consistent as regards the two tests, which must be complied with to determine the existence of a valid delegation of legislative power. In <i>Abakada Guro Party List, et al. v. Purisima</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> We reiterated the discussion, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Two tests determine the validity of delegation of legislative power: (1) the completeness test and (2) the sufficient standard test. A law is complete when it <b>sets forth therein the policy to be executed, carried out or implemented </b>by the delegate. It lays down a sufficient standard when it provides <b>adequate guidelines or limitations in the law to map out the boundaries of the delegate's authority and prevent the delegation from running riot.</b> <b>To be sufficient, the standard must specify the limits of the delegate's authority, announce the legislative policy and identify the conditions under which it is to be implemented</b>.</blockquote><br>In the instant case, the requisite standards or criteria are absent in P.D. No. 755. As may be noted, the decree authorizes the PCA to distribute to coconut farmers, for free, the shares of stocks of UCPB and to pay from the CCSF levy the financial commitments of the coconut farmers under the Agreement for the acquisition of such bank. Yet, the decree does not even state who are to be considered as coconut farmers. Would, say, one who plants a single coconut tree be already considered a coconut farmer and, therefore, entitled to own UCPB shares?&nbsp; If so, how many shares shall be given to him?&nbsp; The definition of a coconut farmer and the basis as to the number of shares a farmer is entitled to receive for free&nbsp; are&nbsp; important variables to be determined by law and cannot be left to the discretion of the implementing agency.<br><br>Moreover, P.D. No. 755 did not identify or delineate any clear condition as to how the disposition of the UCPB shares or their conversion into private ownership will redound to the advancement of the national policy declared under it.&nbsp; To recall, P.D. No. 755 seeks to "accelerate the growth and development of the coconut industry and achieve a vertical integration thereof so that coconut farmers will become participants in, and beneficiaries of, such growth and development."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup>&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan is correct in its observation and ruling that the said law gratuitously gave away public funds to private individuals, and converted them exclusively into private property without any restriction as to its use that would reflect the avowed national policy or public purpose.&nbsp; Conversely, the private individuals to whom the UCPB shares were transferred are free to dispose of them by sale or any other mode from the moment of their acquisition.&nbsp; In fact and true enough, the Sandiganbayan categorically stated in its Order dated March 11, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> that out of the 72.2% shares and increased capital stock of the FUB (later UCPB) allegedly covered by the May 25, 1975 Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> entirely paid for by PCA, 7.22% were given to Cojuangco and the remaining 64.98%, which were originally held by PCA for the benefit of the coconut farmers, were later sold or transferred to non-coconut farmers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup>&nbsp; Even the proposed rewording of the factual allegations of Lobregat, COCOFED, <i>et al.</i> and Ballares, <i>et al</i>., reveals that indeed, P.D. No. 755 did not provide for any guideline, standard, condition or restriction by which the said shares shall be distributed to the coconut farmers that would ensure that the same will be undertaken to accelerate the growth and development of the coconut industry pursuant to its national policy.&nbsp; The proposed rewording of admissions reads:<br><br><blockquote>There were shares forming part of the aforementioned 64.98% which were, <u>after their distribution, for free, to the coconut farmers as required by P.D. No. 755</u>, sold or transferred <u>respectively by individual coconut farmers who were then the registered stockholders of those UCPB shares</u> to non-coconut farmers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, P.D. No. 755, insofar as it grants PCA a veritable <i>carte blanche</i> to distribute to coconut farmers UCPB shares at the level it may determine, as well as the full disposition of such shares to private individuals in their private capacity without any conditions or restrictions that would advance the law's national policy or public purpose, present a case of undue delegation of legislative power. As such, there is even no need to discuss the validity of the administrative orders and resolutions of PCA implementing P.D. No. 755. Water cannot rise higher than its source.<br><br>Even so, PCA AO 1 and PCA Resolution No. 078-74, are in themselves, infirm under the undue delegation of legislative powers.&nbsp; Particularly, Section 9 of PCA AO I provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 9.&nbsp; Fractional and Undistributed Shares - Fractional shares and shares which remain undistributed as a consequence of the failure of the coconut farmers to register their COCOFUND receipts or the destruction of the COCOFUND receipts or the registration of COCOFUND receipts in the name of an unqualified individual, after the final distribution is made on the basis of the consolidated IBM registration Report as of March 31, 1976 shall be distributed to all the coconut farmers who have qualified and received equity in the Bank and shall be appointed among them, as far as practicable, in proportion to their equity in relation to the number of undistributed equity and such further rules and regulations as may hereafter be promulgated.</blockquote><br>The foregoing provision directs and authorizes the distribution of fractional and undistributed shares as a consequence of the failure of the coconut farmers with Coco Fund receipts to register them, even without a clear mandate or instruction on the same in any pertinent existing law.&nbsp; PCA Resolution No. 078-74 had a similar provision, albeit providing more detailed information.&nbsp; The said Resolution identified 51,200,806 shares of the bank that remained undistributed and PCA devised its own rules as to how these undistributed and fractional shares shall be disposed of, notwithstanding the dearth as to the standards or parameters in the laws which it sought to implement.<br><br>Eventually, what happened was that, as correctly pointed out by the Sandiganbayan, the PCA gave a "bonanza" to supposed coconut farmers who already got their bank shares, by giving them extra shares according to the rules established - on its own - by the PCA under PCA AO 1 and Resolution No. 078-74.&nbsp; Because of the lack of adequate guidelines under P.D. No. 755 as to how the shares were supposed to be distributed to the coconut farmers, the PCA thus assumed that it could decide for itself how these shares will be distributed.&nbsp; This obviously paved the way to playing favorites, if not allowing outright shenanigans.&nbsp; In this regard, this poser raised in the Court's February 16, 1993 Resolution in G.R. No. 96073 is as relevant then as it is now: "<i>How is it that shares of stocks in such entities which was organized and financed by revenues derived from coconut levy funds which were imbued with public interest ended up in private hands who are not farmers or beneficiaries; and whether or not the holders of said stock, who in one way or another had had some part in the collection, administration, disbursement or other disposition of the coconut levy funds were qualified to acquire stock in the corporations formed and operated from these funds</i>." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the said PCA issuances did not take note of the national policy or public purpose for which the coconut levy funds were imposed under P.D. No. 755, <i>i.e. </i>the acceleration of the growth and development of the entire coconut industry, and the achievement of a vertical integration thereof that could make the coconut farmers participants in, and beneficiaries of, such growth and development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup>&nbsp; Instead, the PCA prioritized the coconut farmers themselves by fully disposing of the bank shares, totally disregarding the national policy for which the funds were created.&nbsp; This is clearly an undue delegation of legislative powers.<br><br>With this pronouncement, there is hardly any need to establish that the sequestered assets are ill-gotten wealth. The documentary evidence, the P.D.s and Agreements, prove that the transfer of the shares to the more than one million of supposed coconut farmers was tainted with illegality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="45%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><u>Article III, Section 5 of P.D.

Nos. 961 and 1468 must be struck down for being unconstitutional, be they assayed against Section 2(1), Article XII (D) of the 1973 Constitution or its counterpart provision in the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>The Court, however, takes note of the dispositive portion of PSJ-A, which states that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br></div><br>2.&nbsp; Section 2 of P.D.

But there can be no gainsaying that the same advances and UCPB loans are public in character, constituting as they do assets of the 14 holding companies, which in turn are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the 6 CIIF Oil Mills. And these oil mills were organized, capitalized and/or financed using coconut levy funds.&nbsp; In net effect, the CIIF block of SMC shares are simply the fruits of the coconut levy funds acquired at the expense of the coconut industry.

COCOFED, </i>the State's avowed policy or purpose in creating the coconut levy fund is for the development of the entire coconut industry, which is one of the major industries that promotes sustained economic stability, and not merely the livelihood of a significant segment of the population.[166]&nbsp; Accordingly, We sustain the ruling of the Sandiganbayan in CC No. 0033-F that the CIIF companies and the CIIF block of SMC shares are public funds necessary owned by the Government.&nbsp; We, however, modify the same in the following wise: These shares shall belong to the Government, which shall be used only for the benefit of the coconut farmers and for the development of the coconut industry.<br><br><u><b>Sandiganbayan did not err in ruling that</b><br><b>PCA&nbsp; (AO)&nbsp; No. 1,&nbsp;&nbsp; Series&nbsp; of 1975&nbsp; and</b><br><b>PCA&nbsp; rules&nbsp; and regulations&nbsp; 074-78&nbsp; did</b><br><b>not comply with the&nbsp; national&nbsp; standard</b><br><b>or policy of P.D.

No. 755. Yet, so petitioners argue, that court, with grave abuse of discretion, disregarded such policy and thereafter, ruled that Section 1 in relation to Section 2 of P.D. No. 755 is unconstitutional as the decree failed to promote the purpose for which it was enacted in the first place.<br><br>We are not persuaded. The relevant assailed portion of PSJ-A states:<br><br><blockquote>We observe, however, that the PCA [AO] No. 1, Series of 1975 and PCA Rules and Regulations 074-78, did not take into consideration the accomplishment of the public purpose or the national standard/policy of P.D. No. 755 which is directly to accelerate the development and growth of the coconut industry and as a consequence thereof, to make the coconut farmers "participants in and beneficiaries" of such growth and development....</blockquote><br>It is a basic legal precept that courts do not look into the wisdom of the laws passed. The principle of separation of powers demands this hands-off attitude from the judiciary.&nbsp; <i>Saguiguit v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> teaches why:<br><br><blockquote>... [W]hat the petitioner asks is for the Court to delve into the policy behind or wisdom of a statute, ... which, under the doctrine of separation of powers, it cannot do,.... Even with the best of motives, the Court can only interpret and apply the law and cannot, despite doubts about its wisdom, amend or repeal it. Courts of justice have no right to encroach on the prerogatives of lawmakers, as long as it has not been shown that they have acted with grave abuse of discretion. And while the judiciary may interpret laws and evaluate them for constitutional soundness and to strike them down if they are proven to be infirm, this solemn power and duty do not include the discretion to correct by reading into the law what is not written therein.</blockquote><br>We reproduce the policy-declaring provision of P.D. No. 755, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>Declaration of National Policy</i>. -- It is hereby declared that the policy of the State is to provide readily available credit facilities to the coconut farmers at preferential rates; that this policy can be ... efficiently realized by the implementation of the "<b>Agreement for the Acquisition of a Commercial Bank for the benefit of the Coconut Farmers"</b> executed by the [PCA], <b>the terms of which "Agreement" are hereby incorporated by reference</b>; and that the [PCA] is hereby authorized to distribute, for free, the shares of stock of the bank it acquired to the coconut farmers under such rules and regulations it may promulgate.</blockquote><br>P.D. No. 755 having stated in no uncertain terms that the national policy of providing cheap credit facilities to coconut farmers shall be achieved with the acquisition of a commercial bank, the Court is without discretion to rule on the wisdom of such an undertaking. It is abundantly clear, however, that the Sandiganbayan did not look into the policy behind, or the wisdom of, P.D. No. 755. In context, it did no more than to inquire whether the purpose defined in P.D. No. 755 and for which the coco levy fund was established would be carried out, obviously having in mind the (a) dictum that the power to tax should only be exercised for a public purpose and (b) command of Section 29, paragraph 3 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution that:<br><br><blockquote>(3) All money collected on any tax levied for a special purpose shall be treated as a special fund and <b>paid out for such purpose only</b>. If the purpose for which a special fund was created has been fulfilled or abandoned, the balance, if any, shall be transferred to the general funds of the Government. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>For the above reason, the above-assailed action of the Sandiganbayan was well within the scope of its sound discretion and mandate.<br><br>Moreover, petitioners impute on the anti-graft court the commission of grave abuse of discretion for going into the validity of and in declaring the coco levy laws as unconstitutional, when there were still factual issues to be resolved in a full blown trial as directed by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup><br><br>Petitioners COCOFED and the farmer representatives miss the point. They acknowledged that their alleged ownership of the sequestered shares in UCPB and SMC is predicated on the coco levy decrees. Thus, the legality and propriety of their ownership of these valuable assets are directly related to and must be assayed against the constitutionality of those presidential decrees. This is a primordial issue, which must be determined to address the validity of the rest of petitioners' claims of ownership. Verily, the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion, a phrase which, in the abstract, denotes the idea of capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment or the exercise of power in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility as to be equivalent to having acted without jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup><br><br><b><u>The Operative Fact Doctrine does not apply</u></b><br><br>Petitioners assert that the Sandiganbayan's refusal to recognize the vested rights purportedly created under the coconut levy laws constitutes taking of private property without due process of law.&nbsp; They reason out that to accord retroactive application to a declaration of unconstitutionality would be unfair inasmuch as such approach would penalize the farmers who merely obeyed then valid laws.<br><br>This contention is specious.<br><br>In <i>Yap v. Thenamaris Ship's Management</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> the Operative Fact Doctrine was discussed in that:<br><br><blockquote>As a general rule, an unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is inoperative as if it has not been passed at all. The general rule is supported by Article 7 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 7. Laws are repealed only by subsequent ones, and their violation or non-observance shall not be excused by disuse or custom or practice to the contrary.</blockquote><br>The doctrine of operative fact serves as an exception to the aforementioned general rule. In Planters Products, Inc. v. Fertiphil Corporation, we held:<br><br><blockquote><b><i><u>The doctrine of operative fact, as an exception to the general rule, only applies as a matter of equity and fair play.</u> </i></b>It nullifies the effects of an unconstitutional law by recognizing that the existence of a statute prior to a determination of unconstitutionality is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot always be ignored. The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.<br><br>The doctrine is applicable when a declaration of unconstitutionality will impose an undue burden on those who have relied on the invalid law.

Court of Appeals</i>, wherein it is stated that a legislative or executive act, prior to its being declared as unconstitutional by the courts, is valid and must be complied with, thus:<br><br><blockquote>As the new Civil Code puts it: "When the courts declare a law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the former shall be void and the latter shall govern. Administrative or executive acts, orders and regulations shall be valid only when they are not contrary to the laws of the Constitution."&nbsp; It is understandable why it should be so, the Constitution being supreme and paramount. Any legislative or executive act contrary to its terms cannot survive.<br><br>Such a view has support in logic and possesses the merit of simplicity.&nbsp; It may not however be sufficiently realistic.&nbsp; It does not admit of doubt that prior to the declaration of nullity such challenged legislative or executive act must have been in force and had to be complied with.&nbsp; This is so as until after the judiciary, in an appropriate case, declares its invalidity, it is entitled to obedience and respect.&nbsp; Parties may have acted under it and may have changed their positions.&nbsp; What could be more fitting than that in a subsequent litigation regard be had to what has been done while such legislative or executive act was in operation and presumed to be valid in all respects.&nbsp; It is now accepted as a doctrine that prior to its being nullified, its existence as a fact must be reckoned with.&nbsp; This is merely to reflect awareness that precisely because the judiciary is the governmental organ which has the final say on whether or not a legislative or executive measure is valid, a period of time may have elapsed before it can exercise the power of judicial review that may lead to a declaration of nullity.&nbsp; It would be to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and justice then, if there be no recognition of what had transpired prior to such adjudication.<br><br>In the language of an American Supreme Court decision: "The actual existence of a statute, prior to such a determination [of unconstitutionality], is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.&nbsp; The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.&nbsp; The effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects, with respect to particular relations, individual and corporate, and particular conduct, private and official." This language has been quoted with approval in a resolution in Araneta v. Hill and the decision in Manila Motor Co., Inc. v. Flores.&nbsp; An even more recent instance is the opinion of Justice Zaldivar speaking for the Court in Fernandez v. Cuerva and Co. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The principle was further explicated in the case of <i>Rieta v. People of the Philippines</i>, thus:<br><br><blockquote>In similar situations in the past this Court had taken the pragmatic and realistic course set forth in <i>Chicot County Drainage District vs. Baxter Bank</i> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The courts below have proceeded on the theory that the Act of Congress, having been found to be unconstitutional, was not a law; that it was inoperative, conferring no rights and imposing no duties, and hence affording no basis for the challenged decree.... It is quite clear, however, that such broad statements as to the effect of a determination of unconstitutionality must be taken with qualifications.&nbsp; The actual existence of a statute, prior to [the determination of its invalidity], is an operative fact and may have consequences which cannot justly be ignored.&nbsp; The past cannot always be erased by a new judicial declaration.&nbsp; The effect of the subsequent ruling as to invalidity may have to be considered in various aspects -with respect to particular conduct, private and official.&nbsp; Questions of rights claimed to have become vested, of status, of prior determinations deemed to have finality and acted upon accordingly, of public policy in the light of the nature both of the statute and of its previous application, demand examination.&nbsp; These questions are among the most difficult of those which have engaged the attention of courts, state and federal, and it is manifest from numerous decisions that an all-inclusive statement of a principle of absolute retroactive invalidity cannot be justified.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><br>Moreover, the Court ruled in <i>Chavez</i> that:<br><br><blockquote>Furthermore, when petitioner filed the instant case against respondents on August 5, 2004, the JVAs were already terminated by virtue of the MOA between the NHA and RBI. The respondents had no reason to think that their agreements were unconstitutional or even questionable, as in fact, the concurrent acts of the executive department lent validity to the implementation of the Project. The SMDRP agreements have produced vested rights in favor of the slum dwellers, the buyers of reclaimed land who were issued titles over said land, and the agencies and investors who made investments in the project or who bought SMPPCs. These properties and rights cannot be disturbed or questioned after the passage of around ten (10) years from the start of the SMDRP implementation. Evidently, the "operative fact" principle has set in. The titles to the lands in the hands of the buyers can no longer be invalidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, the Court rules that the dictates of justice, fairness and equity do not support the claim of the alleged farmer-owners that their ownership of the UCPB shares should be respected. Our&nbsp; reasons:<br><br>1. Said farmers or alleged claimants do not have any legal right to own the UCPB shares distributed to them.&nbsp; It was not successfully refuted that said claimants were issued receipts under R.A. 6260 for the payment of the levy that went into the Coconut Investment Fund (CIF) upon which shares in the "Coconut Investment Company" will be issued.&nbsp; The Court upholds the finding of the Sandiganbayan that said investment company is a different corporate entity from the United Coconut Planters Bank.

No. 6260 were to be registered in exchange for shares of stock in the Coconut Investment Company (CIC), which obviously is a different corporate entity from UCPB.&nbsp; This fact was admitted by petitioners during the April 17, 2001 oral arguments in G.R. Nos. 147062-64.<br><br>In fact, while the CIF levy payments claimed to have been paid by petitioners were meant for the CIC, the distribution of UCPB stock certificates to the coconut farmers, if at all, were meant for the payors of the CCSF in proportion to the coconut farmer's CCSF contributions pursuant to PCA Resolution No. 045-75 dated May 21, 1975:<br><br><blockquote>RESOLVED, FURTHER, That the amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION (P150,000,000.00) PESOS be appropriated and set aside from available funds of the PCA to be utilized in payment for the shares of stock of such existing commercial bank and that the Treasurer be instructed to disburse the said amount accordingly.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">... ... ...<br></div><br>RESOLVED, FINALLY, That ... be directed to organize a team which shall prepare a list of coconut farmers who have paid the levy and contributed to the [CCSF] and to prepare a stock distribution plan to the end that the aforesaid coconut farmers shall receive certificates of stock of such commercial bank in proportion to their contributions to the Fund.<br><br>Unfortunately, the said resolution was never complied with in the distribution of the so-called "farmers" UCPB shares.</blockquote></blockquote><br>The payments therefore under R.A. 6260 are not the same as those under P.D. No. 276. The amounts of CIF contributions under R.A. 6260 which were collected starting 1971 are undeniably different from the CCSF levy under P.D. No. 276, which were collected starting 1973.&nbsp; The two (2) groups of claimants differ not only in identity but also in the levy paid, the amount of produce and the time the government started the collection.<br><br>Thus, petitioners and the alleged farmers claiming them pursuant to R.A. 6260 do not have any legal basis to own the UCPB shares distributed to them, <b>assuming for a moment</b> the legal feasibility of transferring these shares paid from the R.A. 6260 levy to private individuals.<br><br>2. To grant all the UCPB shares to petitioners and its alleged members would be iniquitous and prejudicial to the remaining 4.6 million farmers who have not received any UCPB shares when in fact they also made payments to either the CIF or the CCSF but did not receive any receipt or who was not able to register their receipts or misplaced them.<br><br>Section 1 of P.D. No. 755 which was declared unconstitutional cannot be considered to be the legal basis for the transfer of the supposed private ownership of the UCPB shares to petitioners who allegedly paid the same under R.A. 6260. The Solicitor General is correct in concluding that such unauthorized grant to petitioners constitutes illegal deprivation of property without due process of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due process of law would mean that the distribution of the UCPB shares should be made only to farmers who have paid the contribution to the CCSF pursuant to P.D. No. 276, and not to those who paid pursuant to R.A. 6260. What would have been the appropriate distribution scheme&nbsp; was violated by Section 1 of P.D. No. 755 when it required that the UCPB shares should be distributed to coconut farmers without distinction - in fact, giving the PCA limitless power and free hand, to determine who these farmers are, or would be.<br><br>We cannot sanction the award of the UCPB shares to petitioners who appear to represent only 1.4 million members without any legal basis to the extreme prejudice of the other 4.6 million coconut farmers (Executive Order No. 747 fixed the number of coconut farmers at 6 million in 1981).&nbsp; Indeed, petitioners constitute only a small percentage of the coconut farmers in the Philippines.&nbsp; Thus, the Sandiganbayan correctly declared that the UCPB shares are government assets in trust for the coconut farmers, which would be more beneficial to all the coconut farmers instead of a very few dubious claimants;<br><br>3. The Sandiganbayan made the finding that due to enormous operational problems and administrative complications, the intended beneficiaries of the UCPB shares were not able to receive the shares due to them.&nbsp; To reiterate what the anti-graft court said:<br><br><blockquote>The actual distribution of the bank shares was admittedly an enormous operational problem which resulted in the failure of the intended beneficiaries to receive their shares of stocks in the bank, as shown by the rules and regulations, issued by the PCA, without adequate guidelines being provided to it by P.D. No. 755.&nbsp; PCA Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1975 (August 20, 1975), "Rules and Regulations Governing the Distribution of Shares of Stock of the Bank Authorized to be Acquired Pursuant to PCA Board Resolution No. 246-75", quoted hereunder discloses how the undistributed shares of stocks due to anonymous coconut farmers or payors of the coconut levy fees were authorized to be distributed to existing shareholders of the Bank:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 9.&nbsp; Fractional and Undistributed Shares - Fractional shares and shares which remain undistributed as a consequence of the failure of the coconut farmers to register their COCOFUND receipts or the destruction of the COCOFUND receipts or the registration of the COCOFUND receipts in the name of an unqualified individual, after the final distribution is made on the basis of the consolidated IBM registration Report as of March 31, 1976 shall be distributed to all the coconut farmers who have qualified and received equity in the Bank and shall be apportioned among them, as far as practicable, in proportion to their equity in relation to the number of undistributed equity and such further rules and regulations as may hereafter be promulgated.'</blockquote><br><br>The foregoing PCA issuance was further amended by Resolution No. 074-78, still citing the same problem of distribution of the bank shares.&nbsp; This latter Resolution is quoted as follows:<br><br><center>RESOLUTION NO. 074-78<br><br>AMENDMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER<br>NO. 1, SERIES OF 1975, GOVERNING THE<br>DISTRIBUTION OF SHARES</center><br><br>WHEREAS, pursuant to PCA Board Resolution No. 246-75, the total par value of the shares of stock of the Bank purchased by the PCA for the benefit of the coconut farmers is P85,773,600.00 with a par value of P1.00 per share or equivalent to 85,773.600 shares;<br><br>WHEREAS, out of the 85,773,600 shares, a total of 34,572,794 shares have already been distributed in accordance with Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1975, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>First Distribution&nbsp;

The rest of the shares were then transferred to a private organization, the COCOFED, for distribution to those determined to be "bona fide coconut farmers" who had "not received shares of stock of the Bank."&nbsp; The distribution to the latter was made on the basis of "per capita", meaning without regard to the COCOFUND receipts. The PCA considered itself free to disregard the said receipts in the distribution of the shares although they were considered by the May 25, 1975 Agreement between the PCA and defendant Cojuangco (par. [8] of said Agreement) and by Sections 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9, PCA Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1975 as the basis for the distribution of shares.<br><br>The PCA thus assumed, due to lack of adequate guidelines set by P.D. No. 755, that it had complete authority to define who are the coconut farmers and to decide as to who among the coconut farmers shall be given the gift of bank shares; how many shares shall be given to them, and what basis it shall use to determine the amount of shares to be distributed for free to the coconut farmers.&nbsp; In other words, P.D. No. 755 fails the completeness test which renders it constitutionally infirm.</blockquote><br>Due to numerous flaws in the distribution of the UCPB shares by PCA, it would be best for the interest of all coconut farmers to revert the ownership of the UCBP shares to the government for the entire coconut industry, which includes the farmers;<br><br>4. The Court also takes judicial cognizance of the fact that a number, if not all, of the coconut farmers who sold copra did not get the receipts for the payment of the coconut levy for the reason that the copra they produced were bought by traders or middlemen who in turn sold the same to the coconut mills.&nbsp; The reality on the ground is that it was these traders who got the receipts and the corresponding UCPB shares.&nbsp; In addition, some uninformed coconut farmers who actually got the COCOFUND receipts, not appreciating the importance and value of said receipts, have already sold said receipts to non-coconut farmers, thereby depriving them of the benefits under the coconut levy laws. Ergo, the coconut farmers are the ones who will not be benefited by the distribution of the UCPB shares contrary to the policy behind the coconut levy laws.&nbsp; The nullification of the distribution of the UCPB shares and their transfer to the government for the coconut industry will, therefore, ensure that the benefits to be deprived from the UCPB shares will actually accrue to the intended beneficiaries - the genuine coconut farmers.<br><br>From the foregoing, it is highly inappropriate to apply the operative fact doctrine to the UCPB shares.&nbsp; Public funds, which were supposedly given utmost safeguard, were haphazardly distributed to private individuals based on statutory provisions that are found to be constitutionally infirm on not only one but on a variety of grounds.&nbsp; Worse still, the recipients of the UCPB shares may not actually be the intended beneficiaries of said benefit.&nbsp; Clearly, applying the Operative Fact Doctrine would not only be iniquitous but would also serve injustice to the Government, to the coconut industry, and to the people, who, whether willingly or unwillingly, contributed to the public funds, and therefore expect that their Government would take utmost care of them and that they would be used no less, than for public purpose.<br><br>We clarify that PSJ-A is subject of another petition for review interposed by Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr., in G.R.

The said identified coconut farmers and the UCPB for the benefit of the coconut farmers are the registered controlling stockholders of the outstanding capital stock of the defendants CIIF Oil Mills listed in paragraph 2 above.<br><br>9.&nbsp; <b>In 1983, the UCPB, as administrator of the CIIF, authorized SOLCOM, CAGOIL, ILICOCO, GRANEX and LEGOIL to acquire 33,133,266 shares of stock of San Miguel Corporation (SMC).</b><br><br>10.&nbsp; To hold the SMC Shares, defendants 14 Holding Companies were incorporated under the Corporation Code as follows: ....<br><br>11.&nbsp; <b>All the outstanding capital stock of defendants 14 Holding Companies are owned by defendants CIIF Oil Mills in the following proportion</b>: ....<br><br>12.&nbsp; The terms and conditions for the purchase of the CIIF Block of SMC Shares were contained in a written agreement entered into between defendant Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. and late Don Andres Soriano, Jr.&nbsp; To finance the acquisition of the CIIF Block of SMC shares, the parent CIIF Companies extended cash advances to the 14 Holding Companies.&nbsp; The 14 CIIF Holding Companies also used its incorporating equity and borrowed funds from UCPB.<br><br>13.&nbsp; The purported farmer-affidavits submitted by defendants COCOFED, et al. in Civil Cases No. 0033-A, B and F uniformly allege<i>, mutatis mutandis</i>, as basis of their claim for the CIIF Block of SMC Shares, that:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. they are allegedly coconut farmers who supposedly sold coconut products;<br><br>b. in the supposed sale thereof, they allegedly received COCOFUND receipts pursuant to RA No. 6260;<br><br>c. they allegedly registered the said COCOFUND receipts; and<br><br>d. by virtue thereof, and under RA No. 6260, PD Nos. 961 and 1468, they are allegedly entitled to ownership of the CIIF Companies, and ultimately the CIIF Block of SMC Shares.<br></div><br>However, defendants COCOFED, et al. claim in their opposition to the subject motion that the payors of the CIF under R.A. No. 6260 were the same payors of the CCSF and CIDF, that shares of stock of the UCPB were also distributed to those who did not register any COCOFUND Receipt; and that their claim over the CIIF Block of SMC Shares is based on the express mandate of laws and their implementing rules and regulations.<br><br>14.&nbsp; In particular, the COCOFED, et al. claim that the COCOFED members are the registered owners and/or beneficial owner of all, or at least not less than ... (51%) of the capital stock of the CIIF companies, which have wholly owned subsidiaries described as the 14 holding companies.&nbsp; These 14 holding companies are the registered owners of the CIIF Block of SMC Shares. Accordingly, COCOFED, et al. claim that they and the COCOFED members are the ultimate beneficial owners of the said share.&nbsp; (Record, Vol. III, pp. 526-527 and pp. 138-539).<br><br>15.&nbsp; The ... COCOFED, is a private non-stock, non-profit corporation which was recognized ... as the national association of coconut producers with the largest number of membership.<br><br>16.&nbsp; The identification of the coconut farmers and distribution of the shares of stock of the CIIF companies for free to the so identified coconut farmers followed the same procedure laid down by PCA Administration Order No. 1, series of 1975 and PCA Resolution No. 074-78 dated June 7, 1978.<br><br>17. Defendant Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. disclaims any interest in the 27% CIIF Block of SMC Shares.<br><br>The plaintiff and the defendants are hereby directed to submit their comment on the foregoing list of admitted facts or facts that appear without substantial controversy within ten (10) days from receipt hereof.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
