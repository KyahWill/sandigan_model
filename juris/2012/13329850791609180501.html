Ruiz of Branch 61, to which the case was re-raffled, in turn, granted respondent’s Motion for Reconsideration and dismissed the petition on the ground that the petitioner lacked legal capacity to sue in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner TPI now seeks to nullify, in this instant <i>Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, the order of the trial court dismissing its Petition for Confirmation, Recognition, and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Award.<br></i><br><center><b><i>Issue</i></b><br></center><br>The core issue in this case is whether or not the court a quo was correct in so dismissing the petition on the ground of petitioner’s lack of legal capacity to sue.<br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>The <i>Corporation Code of the Philippines </i>expressly provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 133. <i>Doing business without a license</i></b>. - No foreign corporation transacting business in the Philippines without a license, or its successors or assigns, shall be permitted to maintain or intervene in any action, suit or proceeding in any court or administrative agency of the Philippines; but such corporation may be sued or proceeded against before Philippine courts or administrative tribunals on any valid cause of action recognized under Philippine laws.</blockquote><br>It is pursuant to the aforequoted provision that the court <i>a quo </i>dismissed the petition.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Herein plaintiff TPI’s “Petition, etc.” acknowledges that it “is a foreign corporation established in the State of California” and “was given the exclusive right to license or sublicense the Yamaoka Patent”&nbsp; and “was assigned the exclusive right to enforce the said patent and collect corresponding royalties” in the Philippines.&nbsp; TPI likewise admits that it does not have a license to do business in the Philippines.<br><br>There is no doubt, therefore, in the mind of this Court that TPI has been doing business in the Philippines, but sans a license to do so issued by the concerned government agency of the Republic of the Philippines, when it collected royalties from “five (5) Philippine tuna processors[,] namely[,] Angel Seafood Corporation, East Asia Fish Co., Inc., Mommy Gina Tuna Resources, Santa Cruz Seafoods, Inc. and respondent Philippine Kingford, Inc.”&nbsp; This being the real situation, TPI cannot be permitted to maintain or intervene in any action, suit or proceedings in any court or administrative agency of the Philippines.”&nbsp; A priori, the “Petition, etc.” extant of the plaintiff TPI should be dismissed for it does not have the legal personality to sue in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>The petitioner counters, however, that it is entitled to seek for the recognition and enforcement of the subject foreign arbitral award in accordance with Republic Act No. 9285 (<i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards drafted during the United Nations Conference on International Commercial Arbitration in 1958 (<i>New York Convention</i>), and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (<i>Model Law</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> as none of these specifically requires that the party seeking for the enforcement should have legal capacity to sue.&nbsp; It anchors its argument on the following:<br><br><blockquote>In the present case, enforcement has been effectively refused on a ground not found in the [<i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004</i>], New York Convention, or Model Law.&nbsp; It is for this reason that TPI has brought this matter before this most Honorable Court, as it [i]s imperative to clarify whether the Philippines’ international obligations and State policy to strengthen arbitration as a means of dispute resolution may be defeated by misplaced technical considerations not found in the relevant laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Simply put, how do we reconcile the provisions of the <i>Corporation Code of the Philippines</i> on one hand, and the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004</i>, the New York Convention and the <i>Model Law</i> on the other?</blockquote><br>In several cases, this Court had the occasion to discuss the nature and applicability of the <i>Corporation Code of the Philippines,</i> a general law, viz-a-viz other special laws.&nbsp; Thus, in<i> Koruga v. Arcenas, </i>Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> this Court rejected the application of the Corporation Code and applied the New Central Bank Act.&nbsp; It ratiocinated:<br><br><blockquote>Koruga’s invocation of the provisions of the Corporation Code is misplaced.&nbsp; In an earlier case with similar antecedents, we ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>“The Corporation Code, however, is a general law applying to all types of corporations, while the New Central Bank Act regulates specifically banks and other financial institutions, including the dissolution and liquidation thereof.&nbsp; As between a general and special law, the latter shall prevail – <b><i>generalia specialibus non derogant</i></b>.” (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Further, in the recent case of <i>Hacienda Luisita, Incorporated v. Presidential Agrarian Reform Council,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>Without doubt, the Corporation Code is the general law providing for the formation, organization and regulation of private corporations. On the other hand, RA 6657 is the special law on agrarian reform. As between a general and special law, the latter shall prevail—<i>generalia specialibus non derogant.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>Following the same principle, the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004 shall apply in this case as the Act, as its title </i>- An <i>Actto Institutionalize the Use of an Alternative Dispute Resolution System in the Philippines and to Establish the Office for Alternative Dispute Resolution, and for Other Purposes</i>&nbsp; - would suggest, is a law especially enacted “to actively promote party autonomy in the resolution of disputes or the freedom of the party to make their own arrangements to resolve their disputes.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; It specifically provides exclusive grounds available to the party opposing an application for recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004,</i> a municipal law, applies in the instant petition, we do not see the need to discuss compliance with international obligations under the <i>New York Convention</i> and the <i>Model Law.</i>&nbsp; After all, both already form part of the law.<br><br>In particular, the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004 </i>incorporated the <i>New York Convention</i> in the Act by specifically providing:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 42.&nbsp; <i>Application of the New York Convention</i>.&nbsp; -&nbsp; The New York Convention shall govern the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards covered by the said Convention.<br><br>xxx<br><br>SEC. 45.&nbsp; <i>Rejection of a Foreign Arbitral Award. </i> -&nbsp; A party to a foreign arbitration proceeding may oppose an application for recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award in accordance with the procedural rules to be promulgated by the Supreme Court only on those grounds enumerated under Article V of the New York Convention.&nbsp; Any other ground raised shall be disregarded by the regional trial court.</blockquote><br>It also expressly adopted the <i>Model Law,</i> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 19.&nbsp; <i>Adoption of the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</i>. International commercial arbitration shall be governed by the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (the “Model Law”) adopted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on June 21, 1985 xxx.”</blockquote><br>Now, does a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in the Philippines have legal capacity to sue under the provisions of the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004</i>?&nbsp; We answer in the affirmative.<br><br>Sec. 45 of the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 200</i>4 provides that the opposing party in an application for recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award may raise only those grounds that were enumerated under Article V of the <i>New York Convention,</i> to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article V<br></center><br>1.&nbsp; Recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused, at the request of the party against whom it is invoked, only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought, proof that:<br><br>(a) The parties to the agreement referred to in article II were, under the law applicable to them, under some incapacity, or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made; or<br><br>(b) The party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or<br><br>(c) The award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted, that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced; or<br><br>(d) The composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place; or<br><br>(e) The award has not yet become binding on the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which, or under the law of which, that award was made.<br><br>2.&nbsp; Recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; The subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country; or<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.<br></blockquote><br>Clearly, not one of these exclusive grounds touched on the capacity to sue of the party seeking the recognition and enforcement of the award.<br><br>Pertinent provisions of the<i> Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which was promulgated by the Supreme Court, likewise support this position.<br><br>Rule 13.1 of the Special Rules provides that “[a]ny party to a foreign arbitration may petition the court to recognize and enforce a foreign arbitral award.”&nbsp; The contents of such petition are enumerated in Rule 13.5.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Capacity to sue is not included.&nbsp; Oppositely, in the Rule on local arbitral awards or arbitrations in instances where “the place of arbitration is in the Philippines,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it is specifically required that a petition “to determine any question concerning the existence, validity and enforceability of such arbitration agreement”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> available to the parties before the commencement of arbitration and/or a petition for “judicial relief from the ruling of the arbitral tribunal on a preliminary question upholding or declining its jurisdiction”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> after arbitration has already commenced should state “[t]he facts showing that the persons named as petitioner or respondent have legal capacity to sue or be sued.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Indeed,&nbsp; it is in the best&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of justice that in the enforecement of&nbsp; a foreign&nbsp; arbitral&nbsp; award, we deny&nbsp; availment by&nbsp; the&nbsp; losing&nbsp; party&nbsp; of&nbsp; the rule that bars foreign corporations not licensed to do business in the Philippines&nbsp; from&nbsp; maintaining&nbsp; a&nbsp; suit in our courts.&nbsp; When a party enters into&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract&nbsp; containing&nbsp; a&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; arbitration&nbsp; clause and, as in this case,&nbsp; in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; submits itself to arbitration, it becomes bound by the contract, by&nbsp; the arbitration and by the result of arbitration, conceding thereby&nbsp; the&nbsp; capacity of the&nbsp; other&nbsp; party to enter into the contract, participate in the arbitration and cause the implementation of the result.&nbsp; Although not on all fours with the instant case, also worthy to consider is the wisdom of then Associate Justice Flerida Ruth P. Romero in her Dissenting Opinion in <i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>xxx Arbitration, as an alternative mode of settlement, is gaining adherents in legal and judicial circles here and abroad.&nbsp; If its tested mechanism can simply be ignored by an aggrieved party, one who, it must be stressed, voluntarily and actively participated in the arbitration proceedings from the very beginning, it will destroy the very essence of mutuality inherent in consensual contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, on the matter of capacity to sue, a foreign arbitral award should be respected not because it is favored over domestic laws and procedures, but because Republic Act No. 9285 has certainly erased any conflict of law question.<br><br>Finally, even assuming, only for the sake of argument, that the court <i>a quo</i> correctly observed that the <i>Model Law</i>, not the <i>New York Convention,</i> governs the subject arbitral award,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> petitioner may still seek recognition and enforcement of the award in Philippine court, since the <i>Model Law</i> prescribes substantially identical exclusive grounds for refusing recognition or enforcement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Premises considered, petitioner TPI, although not licensed to do business in the Philippines, may seek recognition and enforcement of the foreign arbitral award in accordance with the provisions of the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004.</i><br><br><center>II<br></center><br>The remaining arguments of respondent Kingford are likewise unmeritorious.<br><br><i>First</i>. There is no need to consider respondent’s contention that petitioner TPI improperly raised a question of fact when it posited that its act of entering into a MOA should not be considered “doing business” in the Philippines for the purpose of determining capacity to sue.&nbsp; We reiterate that the foreign corporation’s capacity to sue in the Philippines is not material insofar as the recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award is concerned.<br><br><i>Second</i>. Respondent cannot fault petitioner for not filing a motion for reconsideration of the assailed Resolution dated 21 November 2008 dismissing the case.&nbsp; We have, time and again, ruled that the prior filing of a motion for reconsideration is not required in <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>.&nbsp; While we agree that petitioner failed to observe the principle of hierarchy of courts, which, under ordinary circumstances, warrants the outright dismissal of the case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> we opt to relax the rules following the pronouncement in <i>Chua v. Ang</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>[I]t must be remembered that [the principle of hierarchy of courts] generally applies to cases involving conflicting factual allegations.&nbsp; Cases which depend on disputed facts for decision cannot be brought immediately before us as we are not triers of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; A <i>strict application</i> of this rule may be excused when the reason behind the rule is not present in a case, as in the present case, where the issues are not factual but purely legal.&nbsp; In these types of questions, this Court has the ultimate say so that we merely abbreviate the review process if we, because of the unique circumstances of a case, choose to hear and decide the legal issues outright.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>Moreover, the novelty and the paramount importance of the issue herein raised should be seriously considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; Surely, there is a need to take cognizance of the case not only to guide the bench and the bar, but if only to strengthen arbitration as a means of dispute resolution, and uphold the policy of the State embodied in the <i>Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004</i>, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2.&nbsp; <i>Declaration of Policy</i>.&nbsp; -&nbsp; It is hereby declared the policy of the State to actively promote party autonomy in the resolution of disputes or the freedom of the party to make their own arrangements to resolve their disputes.&nbsp; Towards this end, the State shall encourage and actively promote the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an important means to achieve speedy and impartial justice and declog court dockets. xxx</blockquote><br><i>Fourth</i>.&nbsp; As regards the issue on the validity and enforceability of the foreign arbitral award, we leave its determination to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> where its recognition and enforcement is being sought.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>.&nbsp; Respondent claims that petitioner failed to furnish the court of origin a copy of the motion for time to file petition for review on certiorari before the petition was filed with this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We, however, find petitioner’s reply in order.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>26.&nbsp; Admittedly, reference to “Branch 67” in petitioner TPI’s “Motion for Time to File a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45” is a typographical error.&nbsp; As correctly pointed out by respondent Kingford, the order sought to be assailed originated from Regional Trial Court, Makati City, Branch 61.<br><br>27.&nbsp; xxx&nbsp; Upon confirmation with the Regional Trial Court, Makati City, Branch 61, a copy of petitioner TPI’s motion was received by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Makati City, Branch 67.&nbsp; On 8 January 2009, the motion was forwarded to the Regional Trial Court, Makati City, Branch 61.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>All considered, petitioner TPI, although a foreign corporation not licensed to do business in the Philippines, is not, for that reason alone, precluded from filing the <i>Petition for Confirmation, Recognition, and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Award</i>&nbsp; before a Philippine court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Resolution dated 21 November 2008 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 61, Makati City in Special Proceedings No. M-6533 is hereby<b> REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp; The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to Branch 61 for further proceedings.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, (Chairperson), Brion, Sereno</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 36-59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 65-75.&nbsp; Penned by Judge Cedrick O.
