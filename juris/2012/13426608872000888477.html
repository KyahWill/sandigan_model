Merceditas N. Gutierrez. The assailed resolutions dismissed the petitioners’ petition for review, denied the petitioners’ motion for reconsideration and ultimately ruled that no probable cause for falsification and use of falsified document existed against Atty. Crispin Reyes and Reiner Jacobi (<i>respondents</i>).<br><br><center><b><u>ANTECEDENTS</u></b></center><br>The records show that on two occasions - evidenced by the December 22, 1988 and May 6, 1991 letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> - then PCGG Commissioner, and later Chairman, David M. Castro, purportedly acting for the PCGG, agreed to pay Jacobi a fee of ten percent (10%) of any amount actually recovered and legally turned over to the Republic of the Philippines from the ill-gotten wealth of Ferdinand E. Marcos and/or his family, associates, subordinates and cronies, based on the information and evidence that Jacobi would furnish the PCGG. Chairman Castro sent another letter dated December 19, 1991 to Jacobi confirming “that actual recovery [of] the Kloten gold account managed by Union Bank of Switzerland (<i>UBS</i>) subject of [Jacobi’s] information and other efforts done will be properly compensated as previously committed.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> We shall collectively refer to these letters as “PCGG letters.”<br><br>A few years later, a similar letter dated August 27, 1998 (<i>De Guzman letter</i>) was sent by the new PCGG Chairman, Felix M. de Guzman, to Jacobi, confirming the PCGG’s promise (as contained in the PCGG letters) to pay Jacobi and his intelligence group a 10% fee for the US$13.2 billion ill-gotten wealth of Former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his family, trustee or fronts in UBS still/now being claimed and recovered by the Philippine Government.

The Sandiganbayan petition</i></b><br><br>On March 8, 1999, the respondents filed with the Sandiganbayan a verified Petition for <i>Mandamus</i>, Prohibition and <i>Certiorari </i>(with Prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory and Prohibitory Injunction)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (<i>Sandiganbayan petition</i>) against the petitioners (docketed as Civil Case No. 006).<b> Atty. Reyes acted as Jacobi’s counsel. Jacobi did not sign or verify the petition.</b><br><br>The contents of the PCGG letters and the De Guzman letter, among others, were substantially reproduced in the Sandiganbayan petition and were attached as annexes. (<b>The De Guzman letter was attached as Annex E</b>). Likewise attached (as Annex G), was a June 24, 1998 letter from PCGG Chairman Magtanggol Gunigundo (<i>Gunigundo letter</i>), seeking judicial assistance from the Swiss Ministry of Justice and the Police of Switzerland regarding Marcos-related accounts in UBS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan petition began with the alleged commitment of the PCGG to Jacobi (and his group, including Atty. Reyes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>) - as contained in the PCGG letters and the De Guzman letter. It also cited the reports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> submitted by Jacobi’s group to the PCGG detailing their ill-gotten- wealth-recovery efforts and services, as well as their follow-up letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to the government to press for the UBS account. They alleged that due to their persistence, the PCGG (through Chairman Gunigundo and Chairman De Guzman) made an official request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to the Swiss Ministry of Justice to freeze the US$13.2 billion UBS account (as of August 25, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>) in the name of Irene Marcos Araneta, alias “I. Araneta” (<i>UBS account</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> They claimed that the UBS itself admitted the existence of this account, and only denied that the account is owned in any way by the Marcoses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan petition also strongly questioned<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Chairman Elma’s appointment and reappointment of two Swiss “Trojan Horses” lawyers (Peter Cosandey and Martin Kurer) who had been allegedly blocking the government’s efforts to recover the UBS account by secretly working for the UBS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It alleged that Chairman Elma was working with these Swiss lawyers to frustrate the PCGG and its recovery efforts. Specifically, it alleged that:<br><br><blockquote>In not revoking the re-appointment of Martin Kurer as PCGG lawyer despite the honest and sincere suggestions, pleadings and demands by [Atty. Reyes]; in not pursuing the great efforts of the Philippine government through Ambassador Tomas T. Syquia to have the account frozen; in appointing, allowing and in fact abetting Martin Kurer who is associated (sic) and conspiring with Peter Cosandey in blocking the recovery of said account; [Chairman Elma] has shown beyond reasonable doubt that he has a personal agenda and is unusually interested in protecting [the UBS account] for another person or persons, other than the Filipino people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>The Sandiganbayan petition prayed:<br><br><blockquote>AFTER NOTICE AND HEARING, to declare the re-appointment of Swiss lawyer Martin Kurer and Peter Cosandey as having been issued in grave abuse of discretion and highly prejudicial to the interests of the Philippine Government and the Filipino people and therefore null and void; to order [Chairman Elma and PCGG] to perform their mandated duty to recover [the UBS account] for the Filipino people; and to sentence [Chairman Elma] to pay [Atty. Reyes and Jacobi] actual damages that may be proved during the trial; xxx</blockquote><br>On March 15, 1999, Atty. Reyes, through the Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc. (<i>AGLP</i>), filed a complaint with a similar thrust against Chairman Elma with the Office of the Ombudsman (<i>Ombudsman complaint</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <u>Atty. Reyes attached the Sandiganbayan petition (<span style="font-weight: bold;">together with its annexes</span>) to this complaint</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Atty. Reyes alleged that Chairman Elma’s (i) reappointment of Martin Kurer, despite official information that he had been secretly working for UBS, and (ii) failure to follow-up the PCGG’s previous official requests to the Swiss authorities were obvious violations of the provisions of Republic Act No. 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Later, Atty. Reyes filed an Urgent Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> with the Sandiganbayan, w<b>ithdrawing the De Guzman letter and the Gunigundo letter as annexes of the Sandiganbayan petition.</b> A similar manifestation was filed with the Office of the Ombudsman regarding the Ombudsman complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Atty. Reyes explained that he had been prompted to withdraw these letters after he learned of reports questioning the authenticity of these documents. <b>Atty. Reyes asserted that Jacobi had nothing to do with the preparation nor with the attachment of these letters</b> to the Sandiganbayan petition and to the Ombudsman complaint; thus -<br><br><blockquote>Annex “E” of the [Sandiganbayan Petition] is [the De Guzman letter] which was previously shown to [Chairman de Guzman] by [Atty. Reyes] before it was used as an annex and he stated that the statements therein appear to be in the document he has signed. xxx<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">[<i>Jacobi</i>]<span style="font-style: italic;"> had absolutely nothing to do about this Annex “E”</span><br></div><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>At any rate, this questionable document is merely a restatement of PCGG Chairman Castro’s commitment to Mr. Jacobi which is still perfectly binding and enforceable xxx and, further, it is absolutely immaterial to the main issue in this case.<br><br>Hence, this document marked Annex “E” of the [Sandiganbayan Petition] should be withdrawn, as it is now hereby withdrawn xxx, from the records of this case.<br><br>Further, [Atty.] Reyes has also carefully examined… Annex “G” of the [Sandiganbayan] Petition. He asked first for a copy of this document sent to Ambassador Syquia in Switzerland but he was informed that there is no copy in PCGG records. Afterwards, a copy of the document was provided by a PCGG insider and this is now marked as Annex “G”… <i>Again,</i> [<i>Jacobi</i>]<i> had nothing to do with this document marked as Annex “G”.</i><br><br>[Atty.] Reyes has also carefully examined this document and found that while the statements therein appear authentic, however, upon closer examination, it seems that the signature thereunder is not the signature in the original signed by [Chairman Gunigundo] xxx.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">Hence, this Annex “G” should be likewise withdrawn…<br></div><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>If [respondents], particularly counsel Reyes, had known from the very beginning that these documents are questionable and not trustworthy, of course, they will never use them in this case for purposes of recovering Marcos UBS account of $13.2 Billions (sic) by PCGG for the people of the Philippines.<br><br>And whenever there is anything wrong or questionable, [respondents] will not hesitate to and will immediately inform the [Sandiganbayan] accordingly, as, in fact, they are doing now, and it is their desire to deal with all candor, fairly and honestly, with [the Sandiganbayan] and all courts of the land. [italics in the original]</blockquote><br><b><i>b. The PCGG’s reaction</i></b><br><br>The attachment, as annexes, of the De Guzman letter to the Sandiganbayan petition and to the Ombudsman complaint elicited a legal response from the PCGG. Based on the affidavits executed by Chairman De Guzman, Director Danilo Daniel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Finance and Administration Department of the PCGG,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and Lilia Yanga,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> what appears as their signatures and initials at the bottom of the De Guzman letter actually pertain to their signatures and initials affixed to <i>another</i> letter (dated <i>August 25, 1998</i>) sent by Chairman De Guzman to the Philippine Ambassador to Switzerland, Tomas Syquia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This August 25, 1998 letter, however, had nothing to do with any contingency agreement with Jacobi and/or Atty. Reyes. Lourdes Magno,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> a Records Officer, and Sisa Lopez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> also executed affidavits stating that the PCGG has no record of the De Guzman letter. All of these affiants were then PCGG employees.<br><br>In a March 17, 1999 resolution (PCGG resolution),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the PCGG stated that the De Guzman letter does not exist in its records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Chairman De Guzman himself denied any participation in the preparation of this letter, and said:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In connection with Civil Case No. 006 xxx the declaration of Director Danilo R.B. Daniel that<b> the contents [of the De Guzman letter] is not authentic is hereby confirmed it appearing that the records of the PCGG</b> bearing on the alleged letter indicates that the signature of the undersigned and the initials of Dir. Daniel written thereof refers to a letter addressed to Ambassador Tomas Syquia dated August 25, 1998 and not to the [De Guzman letter addressed] to Mr. Jacobi. [emphasis added]</blockquote><br>The PCGG resolution also stated that a Swiss official<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> already denied the existence of the US$13.2 billion UBS account claimed by Jacobi. Ultimately, the PCGG resolved to (i) declare Jacobi’s arrangement with then Chairman Castro as non-binding and inexistent, and (ii) authorize Chairman Elma to file appropriate civil and criminal charges against the respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In a March 16, 1999 report of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the latter confirmed that the De Guzman letter was a falsified document as the questioned signatures and entries therein “were lifted/extracted probably from the original and/or xerox copy”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the August 25, 1998 letter addressed to Ambassador Syquia.<br><br><i><b>c. Criminal Complaint</b></i><br><br>On March 22, 1999, Chairman Elma filed an affidavit-complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> with the Department of Justice (<span style="font-style: italic;">DOJ</span>), charging the respondents with falsification and with use of falsified document (under Article 171, paragraph 2 and Article 172, paragraphs. 1 and 3 of the Revised Penal Code). The petitioners attached to the complaint the NBI report and the affidavits of the PCGG employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On April 5, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Atty. Reyes and the AGLP filed a criminal complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman against Director Daniel (<span style="font-style: italic;">Daniel Complaint</span>) for his alleged “traitorous mission for [UBS] and [the] Marcoses against the interest of the Philippine government.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The complaint stated the following particulars surrounding the Gunigundo letter and the De Guzman letter:<br><br><blockquote>Atty. Reyes also informed [Dir. Daniel] that [Atty. Reyes] requested [the] PCGG record section for a copy of [the Gunigundo letter]… but he was told they had no copy in their records.<br><br>And regarding the missing [De Guzman] letter, the statement in the affidavits of [the PCGG employees] that there is neither a copy of Chairman de Guzman’s letter… is not surprising and confirms [that] important documents are usually missing.<br><br>xxx<br><br>Further, about middle of September, 1998, Atty. Reyes again visited [Dir. Daniel] xxx and xxx inquired about [the] Gunigundo letter… and the [De Guzman] letter… to Reiner Jacobi [which] merely restated what former PCGG Chairman David Castro committed to Reiner Jacobi. The PCGG record section said it has no copy. And xxx [Dir. Daniel] said that he will check his records and give copies if available in his file.<br><br>Some days thereafter, again [Atty. Reyes] visited [Dir.] Daniel and he gave me xerox copy of [the] Gunigundo letter… (marked Annex “G” [of the Sandiganbayan] Petition…) xxx and [Chairman] De Guzman’s letter… (marked Annex “E” [of the Sandiganbayan] Petition...<br><br>I never knew then that xxx [Dir.] Daniel has been working for the Marcoses and UBS in conspiracy with Swiss “Trojan Horse” Martin Kurer against the Philippine government. And I learned about it only recently. Hence, before I did not bother to check the trustworthiness of these documents which he gave me and which I believed all along to be authentic until my attention was called by negative press reports on this [De Guzman letter].<br><br>But, on the very day I read negative press reports on the authenticity of [Chairman] De Guzman’s letter xxx, I realized that the two documents (Gunigundo’s letter of June 24th and De Guzman’s letter of Aug. 27th) given to me by [Dir.] Daniel must have been falsified. xxx<br></blockquote><br>Accordingly, on the same day, Atty. Reyes formally withdrew these two documents marked Annexes “E” and “G” of the PETITION in Sandiganbayan Case No. 006 xxx from the record of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Atty. Reyes imputed the falsification to Director Daniel and claimed good faith in annexing the De Guzman letter to the Sandiganbayan petition; thus -<br><br><blockquote>[Dir. Daniel] had the means and opportunity to create the [De Guzman letter] which confirmed PCGG’s contingency fee agreement with Jacobi. [Dir.] Daniel had initialed the letter dated August 25, 1998. It has subsequently been discovered by the NBI that the signatures and initialing of the genuine letter dated 25 August 1998 have been transposed onto the forged [De Guzman] letter.<br><br><u>Because [Dir.] Daniel had access to the letter dated 25 August 1998, he was in the best position to forge the [De Guzman] letter.</u> The NBI has stated that the [De Guzman] letter… was a very crude forgery. Indeed, it is now clear that this was such a crude forgery that it was designed to be discovered. Likewise, [Dir.] Daniel had access to Gunigundo’s letter of June 19, 1996, hence, he was also in the best position to forge said [Gunigundo] letter of June 24, 1998 which is also a crude forgery.<br><br><center>xxxx<br></center><br>In contrast, Jacobi and Reyes have no motive in creating a forged contingency fee agreement because Jacobi already has a binding agreement with the Philippine government. Indeed, their subsequent conduct contradicts any suggestion of guilty knowledge. In good faith, they attached the [De Guzman letter] in their Petition filed against Chairman Elma and the PCGG with the Sandiganbayan wherein recovery of $13.2 Billion from UBS is the main issue. It is ludicrous to suggest that Jacobi and Reyes would create a crude forgery and then produce it in contentious court proceedings when such a forgery is unnecessary to their case and is easily discoverable. Verily, the obvious forger is [Dir.] Daniel of the PCGG.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>Atty. Reyes filed his counter-affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> adopting the explanation and allegations contained in his Urgent Manifestation and in the Daniel Complaint in pleading for the dismissal of the criminal case.<br><br>For his part, Jacobi, through Atty. Cynthia Peñalosa, denied any participation in the falsification of the De Guzman letter. He explained:<br><br><blockquote>8. I was informed by [Atty. Reyes] at the time that I received a copy of [the De Guzman letter] that that letter had been given to [him] by [Dir.] Daniel. The obvious forger is no other than PCGG insider [Dir.] Daniel xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br>Jacobi added that he and Atty. Reyes have no reason or motive to forge the letter since he already had an existing contingency fee agreement with the PCGG/Philippine government. Jacobi attached an affidavit of Chairman Castro confirming the veracity of the PCGG letters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Jacobi stated that the petitioners’ complaint ignored his work history with the PCGG and the consistency of his conduct with the agreement he entered into with the Philippine government.<br><br>Chairman Elma and the PCGG countered that the respondents’ withdrawal of the falsified letter cannot extinguish the offenses already committed. The petitioners refuted the respondents’ allegation that Director Daniel was the source of the De Guzman letter per Director Daniel’s affidavit, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>I am not in a position to give [Atty. Reyes] the falsified [De Guzman] letter xxx to Reiner Jacobi as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I do not have a copy of said letter.</span><br><br>I strongly dispute Jacobi’s statement that “the obvious forger is no other that (sic) the PCGG insider Danilo Daniel who furnished Attorney Crispin T. Reyes the letter in question.” This is absolutely false and baseless. As I have stated above, I had no participation at all in this spurious letter. If I participated in this proceeding, why do I need to falsify it. Why not just give them a genuine copy of the letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (underlining added)</blockquote><br><b><i>d. The DOJ’s initial finding: existence of probable cause </i></b><br><br>In a June 25, 1999 resolution (<i>first resolution</i>), Senior State Prosecutor Jude Romano found probable cause against the respondents on the basis of two legal presumptions - that (i) the possessor and user of a falsified document is the forger; and (ii) whoever stands to benefit from the forgery is the author thereof - which the respondents failed to overthrow. Thus, he recommended the filing of the corresponding information whose dispositive portion stated;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> thus -<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended that informations for Falsification and Use of Falsified Documents under Article 172 (1) in relation to Article 171(2) and Article 172 par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code, respectively, be filed against respondents xxx and another information for Use of Falsified Document under Article 172 par. 3 xxx be filed against [Atty. Reyes].</blockquote><br>Prosecutor Romano rejected Jacobi’s claim (that he had nothing to do with the forged letter or with its attachment as annex to the Sandiganbayan petition), on the ground that the act of Atty.

Consequently, the dismissal of Jacobi’s unverified petition for review - albeit on a technical ground - rendered the first resolution as the final determination of the existence of probable cause against the respondents.<br><br>The mere filing of a notice of appearance of a new counsel does not automatically give rise to the presumption that the present counsel of record has already been substituted or that his authority has been withdrawn. Therefore, absent a formal withdrawal of appearance filed by Atty. Peñalosa, the Padilla law firm is considered merely as a collaborating counsel and its entry of appearance does remove from Atty. Peñalosa the authority to file, when she did, the petition for review with the DOJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Even Jacobi impliedly admitted that Atty. Peñalosa was still his counsel at the time she filed the petition for review by not addressing the issue of her authority to file it and by conveniently choosing to keep silent (thus impliedly agreeing with) regarding her account of the filing of the petition.<br><br>Contrary to the petitioners’ claim, records bear out that the Padilla law firm had attached the Peñalosa letter to its <u>July 19, 1999</u> manifestation, showing that Jacobi already terminated Atty. Peñalosa’s services as of June 29, 1999 (or before the unverified petition for review was filed). However, since this Manifestation was filed with the DOJ <u>only on July 20, 1999</u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Atty. Peñalosa’s earlier filing of the petition for review cannot be considered unauthorized. While the filing of this July 19, 1999 manifestation would have the effect of discharging Atty.

Logically, the filing of a petition for review is deemed a waiver of the more expedient remedy of asking for reconsideration from the investigating prosecutor.<br><br>Notwithstanding the irregularity that would result in availing two remedies in succession, Prosecutor Romano granted Jacobi’s request (through the Padilla law firm) for an additional period within which to file an appropriate pleading, glossing over the petition for review filed on the same date (July 15, 1999) with the Secretary of Justice. Accordingly, Jacobi filed his first MR on July 29, 1999, through the Padilla law firm.<br><br>Upon discovery of Jacobi’s previously filed petition for review, Prosecutor Romano refused to entertain Jacobi’s first MR “in deference to the Secretary of Justice.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Unfortunately, the then Secretary of Justice subsequently denied Jacobi’s petition for review based solely on a procedural defect, i.e., Jacobi failed to verify the petition).<br><br>A significant point that should be appreciated at this juncture is that Atty. Reyes himself had a validly filed motion for reconsideration since he had been alleged to be not only a lawyer, but a co-conspirator of Jacobi in the offenses sought to be charged. It must be considered, too, that the petitioners’ accusations against the respondents arose from the same set of disputed (and undisputed) facts whose resolution, for purposes of determination of probable cause, could not be considered independently of one another. The prosecutors apparently forgot about Atty. Reyes’ motion for reconsideration when they recognized the petition for review Jacobi earlier filed and in ruling on Jacobi’s first MR.<br><br>From this perspective, Prosecutor Zuño’s March 6, 2001 ruling on Jacobi’s second MR and on Atty. Reyes’ first MR cannot be appreciated as grave abuse of discretion. While it seemingly violated established rules of procedure, it provided ample justification therefor – the avoidance of possibility of two conflicting rulings on two motions treating of the same inseparable subject matter.<br><br>We remind the petitioners that when the technical rules of procedure desert its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes a great hindrance to the attainment of justice, its invocation deserves the least consideration from this Court. Rules of procedure must yield, when proper and under justifiable causes and/or circumstances (as what has been done in the present case), in the interest of substantial justice.<br><br>In these lights, we cannot likewise agree with the petitioners’ remonstrations that Usec.

Castillo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> the Court laid down the rule that the utterance or use of a forged instrument, when unexplained, is strong evidence tending to establish that the user himself (or herself) either forged the instrument or caused it to be forged. In this case, the accused merely denied ever presenting the forged check to the complainant or receiving the amount it represented; the Court found no merit in these denials. In <i>People v. De Lara</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (a 1924 case), the Court again applied the presumption after finding the explanation of the accused – on how he came into possession of checks that were subsequently encashed – to be “unusual and unreasonable as to carry conviction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Domingo</i> (1926),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> the Court applied the presumption because a few days after the certificate of title (over a property) was loaned to the accused, a forged deed of sale covering the property was executed by two alleged vendors. The Court ruled that the failure of the accused to explain what she did with the certificate of title loaned to her could only lead to the inference that she placed the certificate of title in the hands of her confederates as without the certificate, the forgery could not have been accomplished.<br><br>In <i>People v. Astudillo </i>(1934),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> the Court clarified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> that for the presumption to apply, the use of the forged document must be accompanied by these circumstances: the use is so closely connected in time with the forgery,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> or the user may be proved to have the capacity to undertake the forgery, or such close connection with the forgers to create a reasonable link. These additional circumstances have been loosely applied in subsequent cases.<br><br>In <i>Alarcon v. Court of Appeals</i> (1967),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> the Court applied the presumption after considering the “patent irregularity in the transaction”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> and the “extraordinary interest” of the accused in the property covered by the forged document/s in holding that “no reasonable and fair[-]minded man” would say that the accused had no knowledge of the falsification. Sarep v. Sandiganbayan (1989 case),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> gave occasion for the ruling that since the accused was the only person who stood to benefit by the falsification of the document found in his possession, the presumption of authorship of the falsification applies in the absence of contrary convincing proof by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br>In the more recent (1992) <i>Caubang v.

The accused claimed the he did not carry the forged document when he arrived in Manila and that third persons (including a “fixer”) actually transacted with the government. Allegedly, these claims disproved that he had any knowledge or inference in the making of the submitted forged document.

The legal presumption does not apply <br>to Jacobi</b><br><br>Jacobi argues that the presumption of authorship does not apply to him because he never became a possessor or holder of the De Guzman letter.<br><br>The De Guzman letter shows that Jacobi was its intended addressee although it was sent in “care” of Jacobi’s then counsel, Atty. Reyes. Unlike the PCGG letters, whose authenticity the petitioners do not dispute, the De Guzman letter recognized Atty. Reyes as Jacobi’s counsel in his dealing with the PCGG. The petitioners do not dispute, too, Atty. Reyes’ representation to the PCGG as Jacobi’s counsel in several correspondences he had sent, confirming that he had been acting in such capacity.<br><br>The relation of an attorney and a client is in many respects one of agency and the general rules of ordinary agency apply. The extent of authority of a lawyer, when acting on behalf of his client outside of court, is measured by the same test applied to an ordinary agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> Accordingly, even if we go by Atty. Reyes’ account of how the De Guzman letter surfaced, Jacobi, at least, had constructive possession of the De Guzman letter. Being a mere extension of the personality of the principal (client), the agent’s (lawyer’s) possession is considered that of the principal’s.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>However, possession of the falsified letter is not enough to trigger the application of the presumption of authorship; the use of the document<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> and the existence of any of the circumstances previously discussed is still necessary.<br><br>In the present case, Jacobi’s use of the De Guzman letter is placed in doubt considering (i) that he was not in the country when the Sandiganbayan petition - containing the De Guzman letter - was filed, and (ii) the absence of his signature in the Sandiganbayan petition and in its verification. There is also a seven-month interval between the date of the De Guzman letter and the filing of the Sandiganbayan petition. Cognizant of these facts, the petitioners theorized that Jacobi and Atty. Reyes acted in conspiracy in coming up with a falsified De Guzman letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> The petitioners claim that the attachment of the De Guzman letter to the respondents’ Sandiganbayan petition was precisely aimed at compelling the PCGG to recognize Jacobi’s (and his group’s) 10% contingent fee arrangement with the PCGG and, ultimately, recovering it in the same action.<br><br>The petitioners’ claim fails to persuade us. The petitioners ignore the professional relationship existing between Jacobi and Atty. Reyes at the time the Sandiganbayan petition was filed. The existence of this relationship necessarily calls for a different appreciation of the facts established during the preliminary investigation than it would if no such relationship existed. Under Rule 138<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> of the Rules of Court, matters of ordinary judicial procedure are within the exclusive authority of the attorney. These include such questions as what action or pleading to file, what should be the theory of the case, and how the claim (or defense) may be proved and those affecting the sufficiency, relevancy and materiality of certain pieces of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> The annexation of the De Guzman letter in the Sandiganbayan petition and the Ombudsman complaint falls within these matters. Even Atty. Reyes himself explained that Jacobi had no participation in the preparation of the Sandiganbayan petition, much less in the attachment as annex of the De Guzman letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup><br><br>Without determining the <i>validity</i> of Jacobi’s supposed arrangement with the PCGG, a reading of the Sandiganbayan petition does not support the petitioner’s theory of conspiracy. In filing the Sandiganbayan petition, the respondents seek to compel the petitioners to perform their duty to recover the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses. With or without the agreement, the performance of this duty is a tasked imposed by law on the PCGG; the performance of this duty is what the Sandiganbayan petition speaks of in plain terms.<br><br>Then, too, the DOJ found nothing to support the petitioners’ allegation of conspiracy or of inducement on Jacobi’s part. Likewise, the Court cannot find any reason why the respondents should file the Sandiganbayan petition to compel the petitioners to recognize their alleged contingent fee arrangement. To begin with, the records do not show that the petitioners ever disputed the validity of this arrangement - as evidenced likewise by the PCGG letters, which<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> are of similar import as the De Guzman letter and whose <i>authenticity</i> the petitioners impliedly admitted <i>at the time</i> the respondents filed the Sandiganbayan petition.<br><br>Yet again, the existence of several letters and reports made by the respondents to the PCGG, regarding the UBS account and the respondents’ activities in connection therewith, shows that the PCGG was at least aware of the respondents’ efforts to assist in the recovery efforts of the government, in general, and of the PCGG, in particular. Therefore, forging a letter that would simply be evidence of an implied agreement for those services hardly makes any sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br><br>Considering the inapplicability of the presumption of authorship and the dearth of evidence to support the allegation of conspiracy, much less of evidence directly imputing the forgery of the De Guzman letter to Jacobi, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DOJ in absolving him.<br><br><b><i>iii. The presumption in forgery was<br> sufficiently explained by Atty. Reyes<br></i></b><br>Atty. Reyes does not seriously dispute the application of the presumption of authorship<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> as to him since he was in possession, and made use, of the forged De Guzman letter, but offers an explanation on the circumstances of such possession and use. On the other hand, the petitioners dispute the adequacy of his explanation and impute grave abuse of discretion on the part of Usec. Gutierrez for surmising that the De Guzman letter “must have been ‘doctored’ in the PCGG.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup><br><br>What constitutes satisfactory explanation from the possessor and user of a forged document must be adjudged on a case to case basis, consistent with the twin-purposes of a preliminary investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> - <i>viz: first</i>, to protect the State from having to conduct useless and expensive trials; and second, to protect the respondent from the inconvenience, expense and burden of defending himself in a formal trial, unless a competent officer shall have first ascertained the probability of his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> Since the determination of probable cause lies within the prosecutor’s discretion, the soundness of the explanation (to rebut the<i> prima facie </i>case created by the presumption of authorship) is likewise left to the prosecutor’s discretion. Unless his determination amounted to a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment evidencing a clear case of grave abuse of discretion, courts must defer to the prosecutor’s finding.<br><br>We do not find grave abuse of discretion in the present case. By capitalizing on Usec. Gutierrez’s assumption that the questioned letter must have been “doctored” in the PCGG, the petitioners turned a blind eye to the assumption’s factual premise. We quote Usec. Gutierrez’s discussion on this point, thus -<br><br><blockquote>We have perused the NBI report; and our attention is caught by the statement therein that the “typewritten name and signature of FELIX M. DE GUZMAN, the typewritten entries ‘Chairman’, ‘FMG/lai’, ‘dol’, and the handwritten entries ‘5c Records’, ‘8/27’ were lifted/extracted probably from the original and/or xerox copy from the original of a typewritten letter addressed to the Hon. Tomas L. Syquia, Philippine Ambassador to Switzerland dated 25 August 1998.”<br><br><b><u>Since it is the PCGG that has the only copy of Chairman De Guzman’s letter to Ambassador Syquia (except of course the Ambassador) in its files bearing the same distinguishing entries from where the [De Guzman] letter was “lifted/extracted”, we cannot see our way clear how the falsification can be attributed to respondent Reyes</u></b>. It is more credible that the questioned letter must have been “doctored” in the PCGG, which is the repository of all official communications of former Chairman De Guzman, and passed to [Atty. Reyes] who accepted the same not knowing its falsity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote><br>In short, Usec. Gutierrez simply found Atty. Reyes’ explanation – that the De Guzman letter was handed to him by Director Daniel – consistent with the premise of her assumption and sufficient to disregard the DOJ’s previous finding of probable cause.<br><br>Additionally, we observe that along with the De Guzman letter, Atty. Reyes also withdrew the Gunigundo letter from the Sandiganbayan petition because of the questionable authenticity of the signature it carried. When Atty. Reyes tried to obtain a copy of this letter from the PCGG, he was informed that the PCGG had no copy of this letter. Interestingly, the absence of a copy of the De Guzman letter in the PCGG’s records was the core of the statements in the affidavits of the PCGG employees, attached to support the petitioners’ complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup><br><br>The petitioners place too much reliance on the findings contained in the first resolution, blurring their view of the function of a motion for reconsideration. It is precisely the office of a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> to give an agency making a quasi-judicial determination an opportunity to correct any error it may have committed through a misapprehension of facts or misappreciation of the evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> leading to a reversible conclusion at the administrative level. The petitioners have not shown that in arriving at the assailed resolutions (which sustained the prosecutor’s reversal of the first and second resolutions), Usec. Gutierrez gravely abused her discretion which would warrant a corrective action from the Court.<br><br><b><i>c. Lack of probable cause for knowingly<br> introducing a falsified document </i></b><br><br>Neither does probable cause exist against the respondents for the crime of introducing a falsified document in a judicial proceeding, punished under the last paragraph of Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code. The accused’s knowledge of the falsity of the document, which he introduced in a judicial proceeding, is one of the elements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> of this crime. In the present case, not an iota of evidence was presented to show the respondents’ knowledge of the falsity of the De Guzman letter at the time it was annexed to the Sandiganbayan petition. On this point <i>alone, </i>the petitioners’ reliance on <i>Choa v. Judge Chiongson</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> is misplaced.<br><br>Given all the extant circumstances of the case, coupled with the immediate withdrawal of the De Guzman letter, the resulting credit given by Usec. Gutierrez to the respondents’ defense-explanations must be respected.<br><br><b><i>d. The PCGG’s role in the governmental <br>scheme vis-à-vis the Court’s general policy <br>of non-interference<br></i></b><br>As a final observation, we draw attention to the fact that the PCGG is a unique legal creature with a unique mandate. It was created by President Corazon Aquino pursuant to her extraordinary legislative powers after she declared a revolutionary government. The PCGG’s charter, Executive Order (<i>E.O.</i>) No. 1, was the very first executive order she issued. E.O. No.1 created the PCGG and charged it with the task of assisting the President in the “recovery of all ill-gotten wealth” accumulated by former President Marcos, his relatives and cronies. To accomplish its “gigantic task of recovering the plundered wealth of the nation,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> E.O. No. 1 granted the PCGG ample powers and authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br><br>In no time, the President issued E.O. No. 2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> authorizing the PCGG “to request and appeal to foreign governments” where the ill-gotten wealth might be found “to freeze them and otherwise prevent their transfer, conveyance, encumbrance, concealment or liquidation” in the meantime that the legality of their acquisition was determined. Indeed, the recovery of this “ill-gotten wealth” of former President Marcos, his relatives and cronies is not only a matter of right but the paramount duty of the government.<br><br>Viewed from the uniqueness of the PCGG’s creation and role, on one hand, and the general policy of the Courts not to interfere with the prosecutor’s evaluation of the sufficiency of evidence that would establish probable cause, on the other hand, we find it unfortunate, if not disturbing, how the respondents’ documented efforts to assist the PCGG in the recovery of the ill-gotten wealth (given the staggering amount involved particularly in the UBS account) and how the concerns they raised that allegedly hamper the government’s efforts, would end up as a legal warfare between two camps supposedly on the same side.<br><br>The seriousness of Atty. Reyes’ allegations of irregularities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> should have served as a warning signal to the PCGG which carries a critical role in our people’s remedial efforts in addressing the causes that gave rise to the EDSA revolution. The PCGG’s success, if any and if at all, cannot be downplayed. To be sure, the PCGG’s silence in the face of these accusations (except to characterize the respondents’ defensive assaults as an “undeserved gibe”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup>) raises a lot of unanswered questions and appears to justify the allegations of political motivation behind the criminal charges against the respondents.<br><br>In sum, under the circumstances and the other observations made, the Court cannot but rule that the petitioners failed to establish the existence of grave abuse of discretion justifying judicial interference.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we hereby <b>DISMISS </b> the petition.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson), Perez, Sereno,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Chairman Elma files the present petition in his capacity as former Chairman of the PCGG.

In the terminology of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, what is required for bringing a criminal action is only such evidence as is sufficient to “engender a well founded belief as to the facts of the commission of a crime and the respondent’s probable guilt thereof.”</blockquote><br><br>Accordingly, the inapplicability of the presumption of authorship (and, consequently, the lack of a prima facie case) in the preliminary investigation does not completely foreclose a finding of probable cause for falsification. However, it may be too difficult to establish even probable cause because of the secrecy in which the crime is generally done.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> <i>Uytengsu III v.
