SP No. 85735, assailing the RTC’s order dated 31 May 2004 on the ground that grave abuse of discretion attended the denial of the expropriation of the subject lots after the right to expropriate the same was earlier upheld in the likewise assailed order dated 17 November 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; On 26 April 2007, the CA’s then Eighteenth Division rendered the herein assailed decision denying the petition on the ground that, under Rule 67 of the <i>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, the proper remedy from said assailed orders was an ordinary appeal which, once lost, cannot be substituted by a Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>.&nbsp; Even if petitioner’s choice of remedy were, moreover, to be considered proper under the circumstances, the CA ruled that the RTC’s issuance of said assailed orders was well within its power and duty to review, amend or reverse its findings and conclusions if it deems it necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Without moving for a reconsideration of the foregoing decision, petitioner filed the petition at bench on 25 June 2007.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issue</i></b></center><br>Petitioner urges the nullification of the CA’s assailed 26 April 2007 Decision on the following ground:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR CERTIORARI AND AFFIRMING THE ORDER DATED MAY 31, 2004 OF BRANCH 38 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF ILOILO CITY WHICH DID NOT STATE THE FACTS AND THE LAW ON WHICH IT IS BASED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b><i>The Court’s Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>We find the petition impressed with merit.<br><br>Expropriation or the exercise of the power of eminent domain is the inherent right of the state and of those entities to which the power has been lawfully delegated to condemn private property to public use upon payment of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Governed by Rule 67 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, the proceedings therefor consist of two (2) stages: (a) the condemnation of the property after it is determined that its acquisition will be for a public purpose or public use; and, (b) the determination of just compensation to be paid for the taking of private property to be made by the court with the assistance of not more than three commissioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; The nature of these two stages was discussed in the following wise in the case of <i>Municipality of Biñan vs. Judge Garcia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; There are two (2) stages in every action for expropriation. The first is concerned with the determination of the authority of the plaintiff to exercise the power of eminent domain and the propriety of its exercise in the context of the facts involved in the suit. It ends with an order, if not of dismissal of the action, "of condemnation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be condemned, for the public use or purpose described in the complaint, upon the payment of just compensation to be determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint." An order of dismissal, if this be ordained, would be a final one, of course, since it finally disposes of the action and leaves nothing more to be done by the Court on the merits. So, too, would an order of condemnation be a final one, for thereafter, as the Rules expressly state, in the proceedings before the Trial Court, "no objection to the exercise of the right of condemnation (or the propriety thereof) shall be filed or heard.<br><br>The second phase of the eminent domain action is concerned with the determination by the Court of "the just compensation for the property sought to be taken." This is done by the Court with the assistance of not more than three (3) commissioners. The order fixing the just compensation on the basis of the evidence before, and findings of, the commissioners would be final, too. It would finally dispose of the second stage of the suit, and leave nothing more to be done by the Court regarding the issue. Obviously, one or another of the parties may believe the order to be erroneous in its appreciation of the evidence or findings of fact or otherwise. Obviously, too, such a dissatisfied party may seek a reversal of the order by taking an appeal therefrom.</blockquote><br>It cannot, therefore, be gainsaid that the outcome of the first phase of expropriation proceedings – be it an order of expropriation or an order of dismissal – finally disposes of the case and is, for said reason, final.&nbsp; The same is true of the second phase that ends with an order determining the amount of just compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which, while essential for the transfer of ownership in favor of the plaintiff, is but the last stage of the expropriation proceedings and the outcome of the initial finding by the court that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be expropriated, for the public use or purpose described in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; In the same manner that the order of expropriation may be appealed by any party by filing a record on appeal, a second and separate appeal may likewise be taken from the order fixing the just compensation.&nbsp; Indeed, jurisprudence recognizes the existence of multiple appeals in a complaint for expropriation because of said two stages in every action for expropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the RTC split the determination of UPV’s right of expropriation over the ten lots into which Lot No. 1 of Psu-193912 Amd.&nbsp; had been subdivided.&nbsp; Considering the lack of opposition on the part of respondents, the RTC issued the order dated 1 April 1996, upholding UPV’s right to expropriate the three (3) lots denominated as Lot Nos. 21609-B, 21609-C and 21609-E, with an aggregate area of 8,516 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Without any appeal having been perfected therefrom, the RTC’s 1 April 1996 order attained finality and left no more question as to the propriety of the acquisition of said lots for the public purpose alleged in the complaint from which the instant suit originated.&nbsp; Accordingly, the RTC correctly went on to issue the order dated 16 June 2000, fixing the just compensation for Lot Nos. 21609-B, 21609-D and 21609-E at P51,096.00, less the P50,070.00 UPV appears to have already deposited with the Provincial Treasurer of Iloilo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, with respect to Lot Nos. 21609-A, 21609-D, 21609-F, 21609-G, 21609-H, 21609-I and 21609-J, the record shows that the RTC issued the herein assailed 17 November 2003 order which, while likewise upholding UPV’s right of expropriation over said lots, ordered the exclusion of the portion occupied by Villa Marina Beach Resort from the 31,617 square meters comprising said lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Acting on the motions for reconsideration of said order filed by petitioner, UPV and respondents, however, the RTC issued the second assailed 31 May 2004 order, altogether denying said right of expropriation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> upon the following succinct findings and conclusions:<br><br><blockquote>It bears stressing that even before the filing of the original complaint, [respondent] Rodolfo Legaspi, Sr. was already operating as his business establishment the Villa Marina Resort and this must be the reason why [petitioner] had expressly excluded this area from the area it intended to expropriate, the amended complaint notwithstanding, and must also be the reason why former UP President Angara wrote a letter (Exh. 10) to defendant Legaspi, Sr. conveying a ‘happy compromise acceptable to all’.<br><br>It likewise bears stressing the fact that insofar as Lot No. 21609-A, a portion thereof has been utilized by defendant Rodolfo Legaspi, Sr.’s “Omp’s Corner” and the rest of the said lot has been utilized by the Municipality&nbsp; of Miag-ao, Iloilo as a public cemetery.<br><br>The total area covered by Lots Nos. 21609-A, 21609-D, 21609-F, 21609-G, 21609-H, 21609-I and 21609-J is only 31,617 sq. meters.&nbsp; Based on the locations of these lots, acquisition by [UPV] would not impair or defeat the purpose of its campus site.&nbsp; In other words, without including in the expropriation&nbsp; the Villa Marina Resort, the “Omp’s Corner” and the public cemetery and the residential land where [respondent] Vicente Legaspi’s family is residing, [UPV’s] operation as a university would not be adversely affected.<br><br>As to the Villa Marina Resort and the “Omp’s Corner” these places have been utilized by defendant Rodolfo Legaspi, Sr. for his business even before the filing of the instant complaint.&nbsp; As to [respondent] Vicente Legaspi’s lot, including this in the expropriation would force his family to go astray as they have no place where to live.<br><br>As to the portion being utilized as public cemetery, this Court believes and so holds that allowing the plaintiff to expropriate the same would be bordering to the long cherished and revered customs and tradition of respecting the dead. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>The order of denial of UPV’s right to expropriate Lot Nos. 21609-A, 21609-D, 21609-F, 21609-G, 21609-H, 21609-I and 21609-J, is final in nature and not merely interlocutory.&nbsp; However, instead of perfecting an appeal from said order which it received on 16 June 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> petitioner filed on 16 August 2004 the Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari</i> docketed before the CA as CA-G.R.

Republic of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court significantly upheld the CA’s grant of the Rule 65 petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> filed in lieu of an ordinary appeal which was not considered a speedy and adequate remedy that can sufficiently address the urgent need of the <i>National Children’s Hospital</i> to expand and extend quality medical and other health services to indigent patients.&nbsp; Indeed, <i>certiorari</i> and appeal are not mutually exclusive remedies in certain exceptional cases, such as when there is grave abuse of discretion or when public welfare so requires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Petitioner has more than amply demonstrated that the RTC’s issuance of the assailed orders dated 17 November 2003 and 31 May 2004 was attended with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; In the context of a Rule 65 petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, grave abuse of discretion is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; It has been ruled that the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; To our mind, the grave abuse of discretion imputable against the RTC was manifest as early in the assailed 17 November 2003 order where, without giving any rationale therefor, and while it upheld petitioner’s right of expropriation over Lot Nos. 21609-A, 21609-D, 21609-F, 21609-G, 21609-H, 21609-I and 21609-J, it excluded the area occupied by the Villa Marina Beach Resort owned and operated by respondent Rodolfo Legaspi, Sr.&nbsp; No less than the Constitution mandates that “(n)o decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Since it is a requirement of due process that the parties to a litigation be informed of how it was decided, with an explanation of the factual and legal reasons that led to the conclusions of the court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the rule is settled that a decision that does not conform to the form and substance required by the Constitution and the law is void and deemed legally inexistent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Yao v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> this Court ruled as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Faithful adherence to the requirements of Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution is indisputably a paramount component of due process and fair play. It is likewise demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution. The parties to a litigation should be informed of how it was decided, with an explanation of the factual and legal reasons that led to the conclusions of the court. The court cannot simply say that judgment is rendered in favor of X and against Y and just leave it at that without any justification whatsoever for its action. The losing party is entitled to know why he lost, so he may appeal to the higher court, if permitted, should he believe that the decision should be reversed. A decision that does not clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based leaves the parties in the dark as to how it was reached and is precisely prejudicial to the losing party, who is unable to pinpoint the possible errors of the court for review by a higher tribunal. More than that, the requirement is an assurance to the parties that, in reaching judgment, the judge did so through the processes of legal reasoning. It is, thus, a safeguard against the impetuosity of the judge, preventing him from deciding <span style="font-style: italic;">ipse dixit.</span> Vouchsafed neither the sword nor the purse by the Constitution but nonetheless vested with the sovereign prerogative of passing judgment on the life, liberty or property of his fellowmen, the judge must ultimately depend on the power of reason for sustained public confidence in the justness of his decision.<br><br>Thus the Court has struck down as void, decisions of lower courts and even of the Court of Appeals whose careless disregard of the constitutional behest exposed their sometimes cavalier attitude not only to their magisterial responsibilities but likewise to their avowed fealty to the Constitution.</blockquote><br>The RTC compounded its error when, acting on the motions for reconsideration filed by the parties, it issued the assailed 31 May 2004 Order, denying petitioner’s right of expropriation over Lot Nos. 21609-A, 21609-D, 21609-F, 21609-G, 21609-H, 21609-I and 21609-J, on the ground that the same were already used by respondents for their businesses and/or residences.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the direct constitutional qualification that “private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the power of eminent domain is, after all, the ultimate right of the sovereign power to appropriate any property within its territorial sovereignty for a public purpose<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> thru a method that partakes the nature of a compulsory sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The fact that said lots are being utilized by respondents Legaspis for their own private purposes is, consequently, not a valid reason to deny exercise of the right of expropriation, for as long as the taking is for a public purpose and just compensation is paid.<br><br>Our review of the documents attached to the pleadings filed in connection with the petition before the CA and this Court also failed to yield any basis for the RTC’s pronouncement that UPV excluded the area occupied by the Villa Marina Resort from its exercise of the right of expropriation.&nbsp; This is belied by petitioner’s motion for continuation of the condemnation proceedings for the seven remaining lots into which Lot No. 1 of Psu-193912 Amd. had been subdivided,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> UPV’s 13 April 1998 letter-protest against respondent Rodolfo Legaspi, Sr.’s occupation of the property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> its motion for the grant of a writ of possession of the entire lot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and the motions for reconsideration of petitioner and UPV filed from the condemnation order dated 17 November 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Considering that the site of the Villa Marina Resort appears to have already been earmarked for UPV’s proposed National Institute of Marine Biotechnology,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the RTC clearly abused its discretion when it ruled that the exclusion of 31,617 square meters from the original 40,133 sought to be expropriated would not adversely affect UPV’s operations.
