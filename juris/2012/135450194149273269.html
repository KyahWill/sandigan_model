SP No. 84041.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The petition stems from an amended complaint for illegal suspension, illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice and other monetary claims filed with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) by herein respondents Joaquin Buenavista (Buenavista), Henry Fabroa (Fabroa), Ricardo Cape (Cape), Bertuldo Tulod (Tulod), Willy Dondoyano (Dondoyano) and Glen Villariasa (Villariasa) against Norkis Trading and Panaghiusa sa Kauswagan Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PASAKA).&nbsp; The complaint was docketed as NLRC-RAB-VII Case No. 09-1402-99.<br><br>During the proceedings <i>a quo</i>, herein respondents submitted the following averments:<br><br>The respondents were hired by Norkis Trading, a domestic corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing of Yamaha motorcycles and multi-purpose vehicles, on separate dates and for various positions, particularly:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-style: italic;" width="33%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Name</div></td> <td style="font-style: italic;" width="33%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Date of Hiring</div></td> <td style="font-style: italic;" width="34%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Position</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Joaquin Buenavista</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">March 14, 1994</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Operator</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Henry Fabroa</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">January 5, 1993</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Welder</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Ricardo Cape</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">January 1993</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Welder/Operator</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Bertuldo Tulod</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">November 13, 1994</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Welder/Assistant Operator</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Willy Dondoyano</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">January 1993</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Welder</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Glen Villariasa</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">February 1993</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Welder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>Although they worked for Norkis Trading as skilled workers assigned in the operation of industrial and welding machines owned and used by Norkis Trading for its business, they were not treated as regular employees by Norkis Trading.&nbsp; Instead, they were regarded by Norkis Trading as members of PASAKA, a cooperative organized under the Cooperative Code of the Philippines, and which was deemed an independent contractor that merely deployed the respondents to render services for Norkis Trading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; The respondents nonetheless believed that they were regular employees of Norkis Trading, citing in their Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the following circumstances that allegedly characterized their employment with the company:<br><br><blockquote>The work of the operators involves operating industrial machines, such as, press machine, hydraulic machine, and spotweld machine.&nbsp; On the other hand, the welders used the welding machines.&nbsp; The machines used by complainants [herein respondents] in their work are all owned by respondent Norkis [Trading] [herein petitioner] and these are installed and located in the working area of the complainants inside the company’s premises.<br><br>The complainants produced steel crates which are exported directly by respondent Norkis [Trading] to Japan.&nbsp; These crates are used as containers of motorcycle machines and are shipped from Japan back to respondent Norkis [Trading].<br><br>The materials and supplies used by complainants in their work are supplied by respondent Norkis [Trading] through Benjamin Gulbin, the company’s Stockman, upon the request of Tirso Maslog, a Leadman also employed by respondent Norkis [Trading].<br><br>Respondent Norkis [Trading] gave instructions and supervised the work of complainants through Edwin Ponce and Kiven Alilin, who are both Leadmen, and Rico Cabanas, who is the Production Supervisor, of the former.<br><br>The salaries of complainants are paid inside the premises of respondent Norkis [Trading] by Dalia Rojo and Belen Rubio, who are also employees of the said company assigned at the accounting office.<br><br>Despite having served respondent Norkis [Trading] for many years and performing the same functions as regular employees, complainants were not accorded regular status.&nbsp; It was made to appear that complainants are not employees of said company but that of respondent PASAKA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>Against the foregoing scenario, the respondents, together with several other complainants,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> filed on June 9, 1999 with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) a complaint against Norkis Trading and PASAKA for labor-only contracting and non-payment of minimum wage and overtime pay.&nbsp; The complaint was docketed as LSED Case No. RO700-9906-CI-CS-168.<br><br>The filing of the complaint for labor-only contracting allegedly led to the suspension of the respondents’ membership with PASAKA.&nbsp; On July 22, 1999, they were served by PASAKA with memoranda charging them with a violation of the rule against commission of acts injurious or prejudicial to the interest or welfare of the cooperative.&nbsp; The memoranda cited that the respondents’ filing of a case against Norkis Trading had greatly prejudiced the interest and welfare of the cooperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; In their answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to the memoranda, the respondents explained that they merely wanted to be recognized as regular employees of Norkis Trading.&nbsp; The case records include copies of the memoranda sent to respondents Buenavista, Fabroa and Dondoyano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On August 16, 1999, the respondents received another set of memoranda from PASAKA, now charging them with the following violations of the cooperative’s rules and regulations: (1) serious misconduct or willful disobedience of superior’s instructions or orders; (2) gross and habitual neglect of duties by abandoning work without permission; (3) absences without filing leave of absence; and (4) wasting time or loitering on company’s time or leaving their post temporarily without permission during office hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Copies of the memoranda<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> sent to Fabroa and Cape form part of the records.<br><br>On August 26, 1999, PASAKA informed the respondents of the cooperative’s decision to suspend them for fifteen (15) working days, to be effective from September 1 to 21, 1999, for violation of PASAKA rules.&nbsp; The records include copies of the memoranda<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> sent to Fabroa and Cape.&nbsp; The suspension prompted the respondents to file with the NLRC the complaint for illegal suspension against Norkis Trading and PASAKA.<br><br>The 15-day suspension of the respondents was extended for another period of 15 days, from September 22, 1999 to October 12, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; Copies of PASAKA’s separate letters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to Buenavista, Fabroa, Cape and Dondoyano on the cooperative’s decision to extend the suspension form part of the records.<br><br>On October 13, 1999, the respondents were to report back to work but during the hearing in their NLRC case, they were informed by PASAKA that they would be transferred to Norkis Tradings’ sister company, Porta Coeli Industrial Corporation (Porta Coeli), as washers of Multicab vehicles.&nbsp; The respondents opposed the transfer as it would allegedly result in a change of employers, from Norkis Trading to Porta Coeli.&nbsp; The respondents also believed that the transfer would result in a demotion since from being skilled workers in Norkis Trading, they would be reduced to being utility workers.&nbsp; These circumstances made the respondents amend their complaint for illegal suspension, to include the charges of unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, damages and attorney’s fees.<br><br>For their part, both Norkis Trading and PASAKA claimed that the respondents were not employees of Norkis Trading.&nbsp; They insisted that the respondents were members of PASAKA, which served as an independent contractor that merely supplied services to Norkis International Co., Inc. (Norkis International) pursuant to a job contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which PASAKA and Norkis International executed on January 14, 1999 for 121,500 pieces of F/GF-Series Reinforcement Production.&nbsp; After PASAKA received reports from its coordinator at Norkis International of the respondents’ low efficiency and violation of the cooperative’s rules, and after giving said respondents the chance to present their side, a penalty of suspension was imposed upon them by the cooperative.&nbsp; The illegal suspension being complained of was then not linked to the respondents’ employment, but to their membership with PASAKA.<br><br>Norkis Trading stressed that the respondents were deployed by PASAKA to Norkis International, a company that is entirely separate and distinct from Norkis Trading.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Labor Arbiter</b></center><br>On June 1, 2000, Labor Arbiter Jose G. Gutierrez (LA Gutierrez) dismissed the complaint <i>via</i> a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> with decretal portion that reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING this case for lack of merit.&nbsp; Complainants [herein respondents] are however directed to report back to respondent PASAKA for work assignment [within] ten (10) days from receipt of this decision.&nbsp; Likewise, respondent PASAKA is directed to accept the complainants back for work.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>LA Gutierrez sustained the suspension imposed by PASAKA upon the respondents, taking into account the offenses that the said respondents were found to have committed.&nbsp; He likewise rejected the respondents’ claim of illegal dismissal.&nbsp; He ruled that to begin with, the respondents had failed to prove with convincing evidence that they were dismissed from employment.&nbsp; The Decision reads in part:<br><br><blockquote>Before the legality or illegality of a dismissal can be put in issue, the fact of dismissal itself must, first, be clearly established.&nbsp; In the instant case, We find that complainant[s] [herein respondents] failed to prove with convincing evidence the fact that they were dismissed from employment.&nbsp; This observation is derived from their very own allegation in their position paper.&nbsp; The first paragraph of page 5 of the complainants’ position paper clearly show[s] that they were not yet dismissed from their employment.&nbsp; The said paragraph states:<br><br><blockquote>“Convinced that the company is bent on terminating their services, complainants amended their complaint to include the charges of unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, damages and attorney’s fees.”</blockquote><br>The truth, as the record would show is that, complainants were only offered another post in order to save the contractual relations between their cooperative and Norkis [Trading] as the latter finds the complainants’ performance not satisfactory.&nbsp; The [complainants] took this offer as a demotion amounting to dismissal.&nbsp; We do not however, agree as their transfer to another post was only the best option available in order to save the contractual relations between their cooperative (PASAKA) and Norkis [Trading].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>The allegation of unfair labor practice and claim for monetary awards were likewise rejected by the LA.&nbsp; Feeling aggrieved, the respondents appealed from the decision of the LA to the NLRC.<br><br>In the meantime, DOLE Regional Director Melencio Q. Balanag (Regional Director Balanag) issued on August 22, 2000 his Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> in LSED Case No. RO700-9906-CI-CS-168.&nbsp; Regional Director Balanag ruled that PASAKA was engaged in labor-only contracting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The other findings in his Order that are significant to this case are as follows: (1) PASAKA had failed to prove that it had substantial capital;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; (2) the machineries, equipment and supplies used by the respondents in the performance of their duties were all owned by Norkis Trading and not by PASAKA;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (3) the respondents’ membership with PASAKA as a cooperative was inconsequential to their employment with Norkis Trading;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (4) Norkis Trading and PASAKA failed to prove that their sub-contracting arrangements were covered by any of the conditions set forth in Section 6 of Department Order No. 10, Series of 1997;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (5) Norkis Trading and PASAKA failed to dispute the respondents’ claim that their work was supervised by leadmen and production supervisors of Norkis Trading;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and (6) Norkis Trading and PASAKA failed to dispute the respondents’ allegation that their salaries were paid by employees of Norkis Trading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Norkis Trading and PASAKA were then declared solidarily liable for the monetary claims of therein complainants, as provided in the dispositive portion of Regional Director Balanag’s Order, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent PANAGHIUSA SA KAUSWAGAN MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE and/or NORKIS TRADING CORPORATION are hereby <b>ORDERED</b> to pay solidarily the amount of <b>THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY[-]FOUR AND 50/100 ([P]313,354.50) PESOS</b>, Philippine Currency, within&nbsp; ten&nbsp; (10)&nbsp; calendar&nbsp; days&nbsp; from&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; hereof&nbsp; to&nbsp; herein complainants x x x:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br>The respondents informed the NLRC of Regional Director Balanag’s Order by filing a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated September 11, 2000, attaching thereto a copy of the Order dated August 22, 2000.<br><br>It bears mentioning that Regional Director Balanag’s Order was later affirmed by then DOLE Secretary Patricia Sto. Tomas (Sec. Sto. Tomas) in her Orders dated February 7, 2002 and October 14, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; When the rulings of the DOLE Secretary were appealed before the CA <i>via</i> the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> docketed as CA-G.R.

Nos. 180078-79, which were brought before this Court to question the CA’s rulings, were later denied with finality by this Court in the Resolutions dated December 5, 2007<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and April 14, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the NLRC</b></center><br>On April 18, 2002, the NLRC rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> affirming with modification the decision of LA Gutierrez.&nbsp; It held that the respondents were not illegally suspended from work, as it was their membership in the cooperative that was suspended after they were found to have violated the cooperative’s rules and regulations.&nbsp; It also declared that the respondents’ dismissal was not established by substantial evidence.&nbsp; The NLRC however declared that the LA had no jurisdiction over the dispute because the respondents were not employees, but members of PASAKA.&nbsp; The suspension of the respondents as members of PASAKA for alleged violation of the cooperative’s rules and regulations was not a labor dispute, but an intra-corporate dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The complaint was also declared to have been filed against the wrong party because the respondents were found by the NLRC to have been deployed by PASAKA to Norkis International pursuant to a job contract.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the NLRC’s Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision dated June 1, 2000 of the Labor Arbiter is AFFIRMED, with respect to the DISMISSAL of the complainants [herein respondents] for lack of merit [sic], but deleting the portion directing the complainants to report back to respondent PASAKA for work assignment and to accept them back to work being an internal concern of PASAKA.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>The respondents’ motion for reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated December 18, 2003.&nbsp; Undaunted, the respondents questioned the NLRC’s rulings before the CA <i>via</i> a petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>Finding merit in the petition for <i>certiorari, </i>the CA rendered its decision reversing and setting aside the decision and resolution of the NLRC.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its Decision dated May 7, 2007 reads:<br><br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, the petition is <i><b>GRANTED</b></i>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision and Resolution of the NLRC, are hereby <b><i>REVERSED</i></b> and <b><i>SET ASIDE</i></b>, and a new judgment is hereby rendered ordering the private respondents to:<br><br>(1) Reinstate petitioners to their former positions without loss of seniority rights, and to pay full backwages inclusive of allowances and their other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time of illegal dismissal to the time of actual reinstatement; and<br><br>(2) Alternatively, if reinstatement is not possible, to pay full backwages inclusive of other benefits or their monetary equivalent from the time of illegal dismissal until the same is paid in full, and pay petitioners’ separation pay equivalent to one month’s salary for every year of service.<br><br><b><i>SO ORDERED.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The CA rejected the argument of PASAKA and Norkis Trading that by virtue of a job contract executed on January 14, 1999, the respondents were deployed to Norkis International and not to Norkis Trading.&nbsp; The CA held:<br><br><blockquote>We are not convinced.&nbsp; Private respondents’ [among them, herein petitioner] own evidence belie their claim.<br><br>In its Comment, NORKIS TRADING attached the Payroll Registers for <b><i>PANAGHIUSA SA KAUSWAGAN (PASAKA) MULTIPURPOSE COOPERATIVE-NICI Tin Plate </i></b>covering the payroll periods <b><i>“12/28/98-01/07/99” and “01/08/99-01/14/99”.</i></b>&nbsp; Included among the payees therein were the petitioners [herein respondents].&nbsp; x x x <i>Why were petitioners included in said payrolls for said payroll periods when the supposed Contract with NORKIS INTERNATIONAL was not yet executed</i>?&nbsp; Apparently, private respondents slipped.&nbsp; Thus, we hold that the much ballyhooed January 14, 1999 Contract between PASAKA and NORKIS INTERNATIONAL, is but a mere afterthought, a concoction designed by private respondents to evade their obligations to petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The CA also considered Regional Director Balanag’s finding in LSED Case No. RO700-9906-CI-CS-168 that PASAKA was engaged in labor-only contracting.&nbsp; In ruling that the respondents were illegally dismissed, the CA held that Norkis Trading’s refusal to accept the respondents back to their former positions, offering them instead to accept a new assignment as washers of vehicles in its sister company, was a demotion that amounted to a constructive dismissal.<br><br>Norkis Trading’s motion for reconsideration was denied by the CA in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated March 4, 2008.&nbsp;

Nos. 180078-79, which stems from the CA’s and the DOLE Secretary’s review of the DOLE Regional Director’s Order dated August 22, 2000 in LSED Case No. RO700-9906-CI-CS-168.<br><br>To recapitulate, Regional Director Balanag issued on August 22, 2000 its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> in LSED Case No. RO700-9906-CI-CS-168 and declared PASAKA as a mere labor-only contractor, and Norkis Trading as the true employer of herein respondents.&nbsp; He explained that PASAKA failed to prove during the conduct of a summary investigation that the cooperative had substantial capital or investment sufficient to enable it to perform the functions of an independent contractor.&nbsp; The respondents’ claim that the machinery, equipment and supplies they used to perform their duties were owned by Norkis Trading, and not by PASAKA, was undisputed.&nbsp; While PASAKA reflected in its Statement of Financial Condition for the year 1996 property and equipment net of accumulated depreciation at P344,273.02, there was no showing that the properties covered thereby were actually and directly used in the conduct of PASAKA’s business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; The DOLE Regional Director explained:<br><br><blockquote>[H]erein respondents [among them, herein petitioner] failed to prove that their sub-contracting arrangements fall under any of the conditions set forth in Sec. 6 of D.O. # 10 S. 1997 to qualify as permissible contracting or subcontracting as provided for as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 6.&nbsp; <u>Permissible contracting or subcontracting</u>.&nbsp; Subject to conditions set forth in Sec. 4 (d) and (e) and Section 5 hereof, the principal may engage the services of a contractor or subcontractor for the performance of any of the following:<br><br>a.)

Sto. Tomas affirmed the rulings of Regional Director Balanag.&nbsp; Both Norkis Trading and PASAKA filed their separate appeals from the orders of the DOLE Secretary to the CA via the petitions for<i> certiorari</i> docketed as CA-G.R. SP Nos. 73880 and 74619, but said petitions were dismissed for lack of merit by the CA in its Decision dated May 7, 2007 and Resolution dated October 9, 2007.&nbsp; The CA held:<br><br><blockquote>[T]his Court agrees with the finding of the DOLE Regional Director, as affirmed by the Secretary of Labor in her assailed Order, that petitioners [among them, herein petitioner] [were] engaged in labor-only contracting.<br><br><i>First.</i>&nbsp; PASAKA failed to prove that it has substantial capitalization or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, to qualify as an independent contractor.&nbsp; PASAKA’s claim that it has machineries and equipment worth P344,273.02 as reflected in its Financial Statements and Supplementary Schedules is belied by private respondents’ [among them, herein respondents] evidence which consisted of pictures showing machineries and [equipment] which were owned [by] and located [at] the premises of petitioner NORKIS TRADING (as earlier noted, some of the pictures showed some of the private respondents operating said machines).&nbsp; Indeed it makes one wonder why, if PASAKA indeed had such machineries and equipment worth&nbsp; P344,273.02, private respondents were using machineries and [equipment] owned [by] and located at the premises of NORKIS TRADING.<br><br>Even granting that indeed PASAKA had machineries and equipment worth P344,273.02, it was not shown that said machineries and equipment were <b><i>actually used</i></b> in the performance or completion of the job, work, or service that it was contracted to render under its supposed job contract.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><i>Second</i>.&nbsp; PASAKA likewise did not carry out an independent business from NORKIS TRADING.&nbsp; While PASAKA was issued its Certificate of Registration on July 18[,] 1991, all it could show to prove that it carried out an independent business as a job contractor were the Project Contract dated January 2, 1998 with NORKIS TRADING, and the Project Contract dated December 18, 1998 with NORKIS INTERNATIONAL.&nbsp; However, as earlier discussed, the Project Contract dated December 18, 1998 with NORKIS INTERNATIONAL is nothing more than an afterthought by the petitioners to confuse its workers and defeat their rightful claims.&nbsp; The same can be said of the Project Contract with WICKER and VINE, INC., considering that it was executed <i>only on</i> <b><i>February 1, 2000.</i></b>&nbsp; Verily, said contract was submitted only to strengthen PASAKA’s claim that it is a legitimate job contractor.<br><br><i>Third</i>.&nbsp; Private respondents performed activities directly related to the principal business of NORKIS TRADING.&nbsp; They worked as welders and machine operators engaged in the production of steel crates which were sent to Japan for use as containers of motorcycles that are then sent back to NORKIS TRADING.&nbsp; Private respondents[‘] functions therefore are directly related and vital to NORKIS TRADING’s business of manufacturing of Yamaha motorcycles.<br><br>All the foregoing considerations affirm by more than substantial evidence that NORKIS TRADING and PASAKA engaged in labor-only contracting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>When the case was brought before this Court <i>via </i>the petitions for review on <i>certiorari </i>docketed as G.R. Nos. 180078-79, we resolved to issue on December 5, 2007 our Resolution dismissing the appeal for, among other grounds, the failure of Norkis Trading to sufficiently show any reversible error in the the CA decision.&nbsp; In our Resolution dated April 14, 2008, we denied with finality Norkis Tradings’ motion for reconsideration on the ground that no substantial argument and compelling reason was adduced to warrant a reconsideration of our dismissal of the petition.&nbsp; This Court’s resolutions, affirming the findings of the CA, had then become final and executory.<br><br>Applying the doctrine of <i>res judicata,</i> all matters that have been fully resolved with finality by this Court’s dismissal of the appeal that stemmed from Regional Director Balanag’s Order dated August 22, 2000 in LSED Case No. RO700-9906-CI-CS-168 are already conclusive between the parties.&nbsp; <i>Res judicata</i> is defined as a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment.&nbsp; Under this doctrine, an existing final judgment or decree rendered on the merits, and without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon any matter within its jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all other actions or suits in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction on the points and matters in issue in the first suit.&nbsp; To state simply, a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on all points and matters determined in the former suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><i>Res judicata</i> has two aspects: bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment as provided under Section 47(b) and (c), Rule 39, respectively, of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Under the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, facts and issues actually and directly resolved in a former suit cannot be raised in any future case between the same parties, even if the latter suit may involve a different cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Clearly, <i>res judicata</i> in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment has set in.&nbsp; In the proceedings before the Regional Director and the LA, there were identity of parties and identity of issues, although the causes of action in the two actions were different.&nbsp; First, herein respondents on the one hand, and Norkis Trading on the other hand, were all parties in the two cases, being therein complainants and respondent, respectively.&nbsp; As to the second requisite, the issue of whether PASAKA was a labor-only contractor which would make Norkis Trading the true employer of the respondents was the main issue in the two cases, especially since Norkis Trading had been arguing in both proceedings that it could not be regarded as the herein respondents’ employer, harping on the defense that PASAKA was a legitimate job contractor.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>Dole Philippines, Inc. v. Esteva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we held that the finding of the DOLE Regional Director, which had been affirmed by the Undersecretary of Labor, by authority of the Secretary of Labor, in an Order that has reached finality and which provided that the cooperative Cannery Multi-Purpose Cooperative (CAMPCO) was engaged in labor-only contracting should bind the NLRC in a case for illegal dismissal.&nbsp; We ruled:<br><br><blockquote>While the causes of action in the proceedings before the DOLE and the NLRC differ, they are, in fact, very closely related.&nbsp; The DOLE Regional Office conducted an investigation to determine whether CAMPCO was violating labor laws, particularly, those on labor-only contracting.&nbsp; Subsequently, it ruled that CAMPCO was indeed engaging in labor-only contracting activities, and thereafter ordered to cease and desist from doing so.&nbsp; x x x The matter of whether CAMPCO was a labor-only contractor was already settled and determined in the DOLE proceedings, which should be conclusive and binding upon the NLRC.&nbsp; What were left for the determination of the NLRC were the issues on whether there was illegal dismissal and whether respondents should be regularized.<br><br>x x x For the NLRC to ignore the findings of DOLE Regional Director Parel and DOLE Undersecretary Trajano is an unmistakable and serious undermining of the DOLE officials’ authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>The rule on conclusiveness of judgment then now precludes this Court from re-opening the issues that were already settled with finality in G.R. Nos. 180078-79, which effectively affirmed the CA’s findings that PASAKA was engaged in labor-only contracting, and that Norkis Trading shall be treated as the employer of the respondents.<br><br>In the present petition, Norkis Trading still argues that the NLRC committed no grave abuse of discretion in ignoring the findings of Regional Director Balanag considering that his Order had not yet reached finality at the time the NLRC resolved the appeal from the decision of the LA.&nbsp; This notwithstanding, this Court holds that the CA still committed no error in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC by the latter’s utter disregard of the findings of the Regional Director that Norkis Trading should be considered the employer of herein respondents.&nbsp; As correctly observed by the CA in the assailed Decision dated May 7, 2007:<br><br><blockquote>Surprisingly, the NLRC failed to consider or even make reference to the said August 22, 2000 Order of the DOLE Regional Director.&nbsp; <b>Considering the significance of the DOLE Regional Director’s findings, the same cannot just be perfunctorily rejected.</b>&nbsp; For the NLRC to ignore the findings of DOLE Regional Director is to undermine or disregard of [sic] the visitorial and enforcement power of the DOLE Secretary and his authorized representatives under Article 128 of the Labor Code, as amended.&nbsp; <b>It was grave abuse of discretion then on the part of the NLRC to ignore or simply sweep under the rug the findings of the DOLE Regional Director</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; (Citation omitted and emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>A reading of the NLRC’s Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> dated December 18, 2003 indicates that while it was confronted with opposing findings of the Regional Director and the LA on the material issue of labor-only contracting, it failed to even attempt to review thoroughly the matter, look into the records, reconcile the differing judgments and make its own appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties.&nbsp; Instead, it simply brushed aside the rulings of the Regional Director, without due consideration of the circumstance that said labor official had the jurisdiction to rule on the issue pursuant to the visitorial and enforcement powers of the DOLE Secretary and his duly authorized representatives under Article 128<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the Labor Code.<br><br>The rule in appeals in labor cases provides that the CA can grant a petition for <i>certiorari</i> if it finds that the NLRC, in its assailed decision or resolution, committed grave abuse of discretion by capriciously, whimsically or arbitrarily disregarding evidence which is material or decisive of the controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Significantly, the Secretary of Labor had already affirmed Regional Director Balanag’s Order when the appeal from the LA’s rulings was resolved.&nbsp; In the NLRC Resolution dated December 18, 2003, the Commission nonetheless merely held:<br><br><blockquote>The photocopies of the Order of the Honorable Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment dated February 7, 2002 and the Order of the Regional Director of the Regional Office of the Department of Labor and Employment finding the existence of labor-only contracting between respondent NORKIS [Trading] and respondent PASAKA do not provide sufficient basis to disturb Our Decision.&nbsp; We are not convinced that the facts and evidence, which are totally distinct from this case and which were presented in a separate proceedings and before another Office, would be a sufficient and valid basis to divest the Labor Arbiter a quo of his authority which undoubtedly the law vests upon him as his exclusive jurisdiction.&nbsp; The jurisdiction conferred by Article 217 of the Labor Code upon the Labor Arbiter is “original and exclusive”, and his authority to hear and decide case[s] vested upon him is to the exclusion of any other court or quasi-judicial body.&nbsp; By reason of their training, experience, and expertise, Labor Arbiters are in a better position to resolve controversies, for which they are conferred original and exclusive jurisdiction by law.&nbsp; Even Article 218 of the Labor Code does not empower the Regional Director of the Department of Labor and Employment to share original and exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Labor Arbiter by Article 217 x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>Such utter disregard by the NLRC of the findings of the Regional Director and DOLE Secretary amounts to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; As this Court’s review of the records would confirm, a judicious study of the evidence presented by the parties would have supported the finding that Norkis Trading should be treated as the respondents’ true employer, with PASAKA being merely an agent of said employer.&nbsp; PASAKA failed to sufficiently show that it had substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries and work premises required from legitimate job contractors.&nbsp; The work required from the respondents, being welders and/or operators of industrial machines, were also directly related to Norkis Trading’s principal business of manufacturing.&nbsp; The job contract supposedly executed by and between PASAKA and Norkis International in 1999 deserved nil consideration given that the respondents had claimed early on that they began working for Norkis Trading on various dates from 1993 to 1994.&nbsp; Moreover, the records confirm that Norkis Trading was still among the clients of PASAKA as of July 1999, as clearly indicated in the memoranda it sent to respondents Buenavista, Fabroa and Dondoyano on July 22, 1999, which provide:<br><br><blockquote>Please take note that the recent action you have done in filing a case <b>against one of our client[s,] Norkis Trading Co., Inc.[,]</b> has greatly prejudiced the interest and welfare of the Cooperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>This categorical statement of PASAKA that Norkis Trading was among its clients at the time the memoranda were issued only further bolsters the respondents’ claim, and Regional Director Balanag’s finding, that said respondents were deployed by PASAKA to Norkis Trading.&nbsp; This also contradicts petitioner’s argument that its contract with PASAKA had ended in 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Finally, contrary to the insinuations of Norkis Trading, the fact that PASAKA was a duly-registered cooperative did not preclude the possibility that it was engaged in labor-only contracting, as confirmed by the findings of the Regional Director.&nbsp; An entity is characterized as a labor-only contractor based on the elements and guidelines established by law and jurisprudence, judging primarily on the relationship that the said entity has with the company to which the workers are deployed, and not on any special arrangement that the entity has with said workers.<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="font-weight: bold;" width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Termination of an employment for no just or authorized cause amounts to an illegal dismissal.</div></td> <td width="60%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>As to the issue of whether the respondents were illegally dismissed by Norkis Trading, we answer in the affirmative, although not by constructive dismissal as declared by the CA, but by actual dismissal.<br><br>Where an entity is declared to be a labor-only contractor, the employees supplied by said contractor to the principal employer become regular employees of the latter.&nbsp; Having gained regular status, the employees are entitled to security of tenure and can only be dismissed for just or authorized causes and after they had been afforded due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; Termination of employment without just or authorized cause and without observing procedural due process is illegal.<br><br>In claiming that they were illegally dismissed from their employment, the respondents alleged having been informed by PASAKA that they would be transferred, upon the behest of Norkis Trading, as Multicab washers or utility workers to Porta Coeli, a sister company of Norkis Trading.&nbsp; Norkis Trading does not dispute that such job transfer was relayed by PASAKA unto the respondents, although the company contends that the transfer was merely an “offer” that did not constitute a dismissal.&nbsp; It bears mentioning, however, that the respondents were not given any other option by PASAKA and Norkis Trading but to accede to said transfer.&nbsp; In fact, there is no showing that Norkis Trading would still willingly accept the respondents to work for the company.&nbsp; Worse, it still vehemently denies that the respondents had ever worked for it.&nbsp; Again, all defenses of Norkis Trading that anchor on the alleged lack of employer-employee relationship between it and the respondents no longer merit any consideration, given that this Court’s findings in G.R. Nos. 180078-79 have become conclusive.&nbsp; Thus, the respondents’ transfer to Porta Coeli, although relayed to the respondents by PASAKA was effectively an act of Norkis Trading.&nbsp; Where labor-only contracting exists, the Labor Code itself establishes an employer-employee relationship between the employer and the employees of the labor-only contractor.&nbsp; The statute establishes this relationship for a comprehensive purpose: to prevent a circumvention of labor laws.&nbsp; The contractor is considered merely an agent of the principal employer and the latter is responsible to the employees of the labor-only contractor as if such employees had been directly employed by the principal employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>No further evidence or document should then be required from the respondents to prove such fact of dismissal, especially since Norkis Trading maintains that it has no duty to admit and treat said respondents as its employees.&nbsp; Considering that Porta Coeli is an entity separate and distinct from Norkis Trading, the respondents’ employment with Norkis Trading was necessarily severed by the change in work assignment.&nbsp; It then did not even matter whether or not the transfer involved a demotion in the respondents’ rank and work functions; the intention to dismiss, and the actual dismissal of the respondents were sufficiently established.<br><br>In the absence of a clear showing that the respondents’ dismissal was for just or authorized causes, the termination of the respondents’ employment was illegal.&nbsp; What may be reasonably deduced from the records was that Norkis Trading decided on the transfer, after the respondents had earlier filed their complaint for labor-only contracting against the company.&nbsp; Even Norkis Trading’s contention that the transfer may be deemed a valid exercise of management prerogative is misplaced.&nbsp; First, the exercise of management prerogative presupposes that the transfer is only for positions within the business establishment.&nbsp; Second, the exercise of management prerogative by employers is not absolute, as it is limited by law and the general principles of fair play and justice.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>DENIED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.J., (Chairperson), Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villarama, Jr., JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Francisco P.
