				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is the administrative matter that originated from the letters dated September 13, 16, 20, and 22, 2011 of Atty. Estelito P. Mendoza regarding G.R. No. 178083 – <i>Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., et al.</i><br><br>For a full background of the matter, the antecedent developments are outlined below.<br><br><b>1. <u>The July 22, 2008 Decision</u></b><br><br>On July 22, 2008, the Court’s Third Division ruled to grant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed by the Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines <i>(FASAP)</i>, finding Philippine Airlines, Inc. <i>(PAL)</i> guilty of illegal dismissal.&nbsp; The July 22, 2008 Decision was penned by <b>Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago</b> who was joined by the other four Members of the <b>Third Division</b>.&nbsp; The Third Division was then composed of:<br><br><blockquote>1. Justice Ynares-Santiago,<br>2. Justice Alicia Austria-Martinez,<br>3. Justice Minita Chico-Nazario,<br>4. Justice Antonio Eduardo Nachura, and<br>5. Justice Teresita Leonardo-De Castro (replacing Justice Ruben Reyes who inhibited himself from the case).</blockquote><br>Justice Leonardo-De Castro was included to replace Justice Ruben Reyes who had inhibited himself from the case because he concurred in the Court of Appeals (CA) decision assailed by FASAP before the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; Then Associate Justice Renato Corona was originally designated to replace Justice Ruben Reyes, but he likewise inhibited himself from participation on June July 14, 2008 due to his previous efforts in settling the controversy when he was still in Malacañan.&nbsp; Under Administrative Circular (AC) No. 84-2007, one additional Member needed be drawn from the rest of the Court to replace the inhibiting Member.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; In this manner, Justice Leonardo-De Castro came to participate in the July 22, 2008 Decision.<br><br>PAL subsequently filed its motion for reconsideration (<i>MR</i>) of the July 22, 2008 Decision.&nbsp; The motion was handled by the <b>Special Third Division</b> composed of:<br><br><ol><li>Justice Ynares-Santiago,<br></li><li>Justice Chico-Nazario,<br></li><li>Justice Nachura,<br></li><li>Justice Diosdado Peralta (replacing Justice Austria-Martinez who retired on April 30, 2009), and<br></li><li>Justice Lucas Bersamin (replacing Justice Leonardo-De Castro who inhibited at the MR stage for personal reasons on July 28, 2009).</li></ol><br><b>2. <u>The October 2, 2009 Resolution</u></b><br><br>Justice Ynares-Santiago, as the <i>ponente</i> of the July 22, 2008 Decision, continued to act as the <i>ponente</i> of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The Special Third Division<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <b><u>denied the MR</u></b> with finality on October 2, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Court further declared that “[n]o further pleadings will be entertained.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; The other Members of the Special Third Division unanimously concurred with the denial of the motion.<br><br>To fully explain the movements in the membership of the division, the Special Third Division missed Justice Austria-Martinez (who was among those who signed the July 22, 2008 Decision) due to her intervening retirement on April 30, 2009.&nbsp; Justice Leonardo-De Castro also did not participate in resolving the 1st MR, despite having voted on the July 22, 2008 Decision, because of her own subsequent inhibition on July 28, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">3. PAL’s 2</b><b><sup>nd</sup></b><b style="text-decoration: underline;"> MR</b><br><br>On November 3, 2009, PAL asked for leave of court to file (a) an MR of the October 2, 2009 Resolution, and (b) a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR of the July 22, 2008 Decision.&nbsp; Both rulings were anchored on the validity of PAL’s retrenchment program.<br><br>In view of the retirement of the <i>ponente</i>, Justice Ynares-Santiago (who retired on October 5, 2009), the Court’s Raffle Committee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> had to resolve the question of who would be the new <i>ponente</i> of the case.<br><br>Under <b>A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC</b> (<i>Rules on Who Shall Resolve Motions for Reconsideration in Cases Assigned to the Divisions of the Court</i>, effective April 1, 2000), <b>if the <i>ponente</i> has retired, he/she shall be replaced by another Justice who shall be chosen by raffle from among the remaining Members of the Division</b>:<br><br><blockquote>2. <b>If the <i>ponente</i> is no longer a member of the Court</b> or is disqualified or has inhibited himself from acting on the motion, <b>he shall be replaced by another Justice who shall be chosen by raffle from among the remaining members of the Division who participated and concurred in the rendition of the decision or resolution and who concurred therein.</b>&nbsp; If only one member of the Court who participated and concurred in the rendition of the decision or resolution remains, he shall be designated as the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponente</span>.</blockquote><br>However, on November 11, 2009, the case was raffled, not to a Member of the Third Division that issued the July 22, 2008 Decision or to a Member of the Special Third Division that rendered the October 2, 2009 Resolution, but to <b>Justice Presbitero Velasco, Jr. </b>who was then a Member of the newly-constituted regular Third Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In raffling the case to Justice Velasco, the Raffle Committee considered the above-quoted rule inapplicable because of the express excepting qualification provided under A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC that states:<br><br><blockquote>[t]hese rules shall <b><u>not apply</u> to motions for reconsideration of decisions or resolutions already denied with finality</b>. [underscoring ours]</blockquote><br>Stated otherwise, when the original <i>ponente</i> of a case retires, motions filed after the case has been denied with finality may be resolved by any Member of the Court to whom the case shall be raffled, not necessarily by a Member of the same Division that decided or resolved the case.&nbsp; <i>Presumably, the logic behind the rule is that no further change can be made involving the merits of the case, as judgment has reached finality and is thus irreversible, based on the Rules of Court provision that “[n]o second MR of a judgment or final resolution by the same party shall be entertained.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; (The October 2, 2009 Resolution denying PAL’s 1<sup>st</sup> MR further stated that “[n]o further pleadings will be entertained.”)&nbsp; Thus, the resolution of post-decisional matters in a case already declared final may be resolved by other Members of the Court to whom the case may be raffled after the retirement of the original <i>ponente.</i><br><br>Given the denial of PAL’s 1<sup>st</sup> MR and the declaration of finality of the Court’s July 22, 2008 Decision through the October 2, 2009 Resolution, <b>the Raffle Committee found it unnecessary to create a special Third Division</b>.&nbsp; Thus, it found nothing irregular in raffling the case to <b>Justice Velasco</b> (who did not take part in the deliberation of the Decision and the Resolution) of the <b>reorganized Third Division</b> for handling by a new regular division.<br><br><b>4. <u>The acceptance of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR</u></b><br><br>On January 20, 2010 (or <b>while A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC was still in effect</b>), the new regular Third Division, through Justice Velasco, granted PAL’s <i>Motion for Leave to File and Admit Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated 2 October 2009 and 2nd Motion for Reconsideration of Decision dated 22 July 2008</i>.&nbsp; The Court’s Third Division further required the respective parties to comment on PAL’s motion and FASAP’s Urgent Appeal dated November 23, 2009.&nbsp; This grant, which opened both the Decision and the Resolution penned by Justice Ynares-Santiago for review, effectively opened the whole case for review on the merits.<br><br>The following were the Members of the Third Division that issued the January 20, 2010 Resolution:<br><br><ol><li>Justice Antonio Carpio (<i>vice</i> Justice Corona who inhibited himself as of July 14, 2008),<br></li><li>Justice Velasco (<i>ponente</i>),<br></li><li>Justice Nachura,<br></li><li>Justice Peralta, and<br></li><li>Justice Bersamin.</li></ol><br>Significantly, at the time leave of court was granted (which was effectively an acceptance for review of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR), the prohibition against entertaining a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR under Section 2, Rule 52<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (in relation with Section 4, Rule 56<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>) of the Rules of Court applied.&nbsp; This prohibition, however, had been subject to various existing Court decisions that entertained 2<sup>nd</sup> MRs <b>in the higher interest of justice</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; This liberalized policy was not formalized by the Court until the effectivity of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court (IRSC) on May 4, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>With the acceptance of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, <b>the question that could have arisen (<i>but was not asked then</i>)</b> was whether the general rule under A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC (which was then still in effect) should have applied so that the case should have been transferred to the remaining Members of the Division that ruled <i><b>on the merits</b></i> of the case.&nbsp; In other words, with the re-opening of the case for review on the merits, the application of the excepting qualification under A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC that the Raffle Committee cited lost its efficacy, as the rulings of the Court were no longer final for having been opened for further review.<br><br>A <b>necessary implication</b> is that either the Clerk of Court or the Raffle Committee should have advised Justice Velasco that his Division should refer the case back to raffle for referral of the case to the original Justices who participated in the assailed Decision and Resolution under the terms of the general rule under A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC; the Justices who participated in the assailed Decision and Resolution were the best ones to consider the motion and to review their own rulings.&nbsp; <b>This was the first major error that transpired in the case and one that the Clerk of Court failed to see.</b><br><br>Parenthetically, when PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR was filed and when it was subsequently accepted, Justices Nachura, Peralta, and Bersamin were the only remaining Members of the Special Third Division that rendered the October 2, 2009 Resolution. Of these three Justices, only Justice Nachura was a Member of the original Third Division that issued the main decision on July 22, 2008.&nbsp; The case should have gone to Justice Nachura or, at the very least, to the two other remaining Justices. The re-raffle of the FASAP case to Justice Nachura (or to Justices Peralta and Bersamin) would have been consistent with the constitutional rule that <b><i>“[c]ases or matters heard by a division shall be decided or resolved with the concurrence of a majority of the Members who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and voted thereon[.]”</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><b>5. <u>The Reorganization of the Court</u></b><br><br>In May 2010, <b>three developments</b> critical to the FASAP case transpired.<br><br>The <i>first</i> was the approval of the IRSC by the Court on May 4, 2010.&nbsp; The IRSC codified the procedural rules of the Court, heretofore existing under various separate and scattered resolutions.&nbsp; Its relevant terms took the place of A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC.<br><br>The <i>second</i> was the retirement of then Chief Justice Reynato Puno and the appointment as Chief Justice of then Associate Justice Corona.<br><br>The <i>third</i> was the reorganization of the divisions of the Court under Special Order No. 838 dated <b>May 17, 2010</b>. Justice Velasco was transferred from the Third Division to the First Division.&nbsp; Pursuant to the new IRSC, Justice Velasco brought with him the FASAP case so that the case went from the Third Division to the First Division:<br><br><blockquote><center>RULE 2. THE OPERATING STRUCTURES</center><br>Section 9. <i>Effect of reorganization of Divisions on assigned cases</i>. – In the reorganization of the membership of Divisions, <b>cases already assigned to a Member-in-Charge shall be transferred to the Division to which the Member-in-Charge moves</b>, subject to the rule on the resolution of motions for reconsideration under Section 7 of this Rule. The Member-in-Charge is the Member given the responsibility of overseeing the progress and disposition of a case assigned by raffle.</blockquote><br><b>Another significant development </b>in the case came on January 17, 2011 (<b>or under the new regime of the IRSC</b>) when Justice Velasco, after acting on the FASAP case for almost one whole year, inhibited himself from participation “due to a close relationship to a party,” despite his previous action on the case.&nbsp; The pertinent provisions of the IRSC on the matter of <b>inhibition</b> state:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>RULE 2.<br>THE OPERATING STRUCTURES</b><br></center><br>Section 7. <i>Resolutions of motions for reconsideration or clarification of decisions or signed resolutions and all other motions and incidents subsequently filed; creation of a Special Division.</i> – Motions for reconsideration or clarification of a decision or of a signed resolution and all other motions and incidents subsequently filed in the case shall be acted upon by the <i>ponente</i> and the other Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution.<br><br><b>If the <i>ponente</i></b> has retired, is no longer a Member of the Court, is disqualified, or <b>has inhibited himself</b> or herself from acting on the motion for reconsideration or clarification, <b>he or she shall be replaced through <u>raffle by a new <i>ponente</i> who shall be chosen [from] among the new Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution remains</u></b>, he or she shall be designated as the new <i>ponente.</i><br><br>If a Member (not the <i>ponente</i>) of the Division which rendered the decision or signed resolution has retired, is no longer a Member of the Court, is disqualified, or has inhibited himself or herself from acting on the motion for reconsideration or clarification, he or she shall be replaced through raffle by a replacement Member who shall be chosen from the other Divisions until a new Justice is appointed as replacement for the retired Justice.&nbsp; Upon the appointment of a new Justice, he or she shall replace the designated Justice as replacement Member of the Special Division.<br><br>Any vacancy or vacancies in the Special Division shall be filled by raffle from among the other Members of the Court to constitute a Special Division of five (5) Members.<br><br>If the <i>ponente</i> and all the Members of the Division that rendered the Decision or signed Resolution are no longer members of the Court, the case shall be raffled to any Member of the Court and the motion shall be acted upon by him or her with the participation of the other Members of the Division to which he or she belongs.<br><br>If there are pleadings, motions or incidents subsequent to the denial of the motion for reconsideration [or] clarification, the case shall be acted upon by the ponente on record with the participation of the other Members of the Division to which he or she belongs at the time said pleading, motion or incident is to be taken up by the Court.<br><br><center>x x x<br><br><b>RULE 8.<br><br>INHIBITION AND SUBSTITUTION OF MEMBERS OF THE COURT</b></center><br>SEC. 3. <i>Effects of Inhibition</i>.&nbsp; – <b>The consequences of an inhibition of a Member of the Court</b> shall be governed by these rules:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; <b>Whenever a Member-in-Charge of a case in a Division inhibits himself for a just and valid reason</b>, the case shall be returned to the Raffle Committee for <b><u>re-raffling among the Members of the other two Divisions of the Court</u></b>. (IRSC, as amended by A.M. No. 10-4-20-SC dated August 3, 2010) [All emphasis supplied.]</blockquote><br>The case was then referred to the Raffle Committee pursuant to Administrative Circular (<i>AC</i>) No. 84-2007, as stated in the Division Raffle Sheet.&nbsp; The pertinent provision of AC No. 84-2007 states:<br><br><blockquote>2. <b>Whenever the <i>ponente</i></b>, in the exercise of sound discretion, <b>inhibits herself or himself from the case for just and valid reasons</b> other than those mentioned in paragraph 1, a to f above, <b>the case shall be returned to the Raffle Committee <u>for re-raffling among the other Members of the <i>same</i> Division</u> with one additional Member from the other two Divisions</b>.&nbsp; [underscoring and italics ours]</blockquote><br>Reference to AC No. 84-2007, however, was erroneous.&nbsp; For one, the IRSC was already in effect when Justice Velasco inhibited himself from participation, and the IRSC had already superseded AC No. 84-2007.&nbsp; The prevailing IRSC, though, has an almost similar rule, with the difference that the IRSC speaks of the inhibition of a Member-in-Charge or of a Member of the Division other than the Member-in-Charge in its rule on inhibition, and did not use the <i>ponente</i> as its reference point.&nbsp; This seemingly trivial point carries a lot of significance, particularly in the context of the FASAP case.<br><br>Under the rule on inhibition found in Section 3, Rule 8 of the governing IRSC (as Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno found in her dissenting opinion), the inhibition called for the raffle to a Member of the two other divisions of the Court.&nbsp; Thus, Justice Sereno found the subsequent January 26, 2011 raffle of the case to Justice Brion to be legally correct.&nbsp; As discussed by the Division that issued the September 7, 2011 Resolution (<i>the ruling Division</i>), however, the application of the IRSC is not as simple as Justice Sereno views it to be.&nbsp; This matter is discussed at length below.<br><br>On June 21, 2011 (after the retirement of Justice Nachura on June 13, 2011), Chief Justice Corona issued Special Order No. 1025, again reorganizing the divisions of the Court.&nbsp; Justice Brion was transferred from the Third Division to the Second Division.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Third Division – composed of Justice Velasco, Justice Peralta, Justice Bersamin, Justice Jose Mendoza, and Justice Sereno (who was included as additional Member) – referred the FASAP case to the Second Division where Justice Brion belonged, pursuant to Section 9, Rule 2 of the IRSC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Justice Carpio (the Chair of the Second Division), after voting for the January 20, 2010 Resolution granting leave to PAL to file its 2nd MR, inhibited himself from the case on August 15, 2011.&nbsp; As stated in the Division Raffle Sheet of August 15, 2011, Justice Carpio “recused himself from the case per advice of the office of the Member-in-Charge.”&nbsp; Justice Peralta became the replacement for Justice Carpio, pursuant to Rule 8, Section 3 of the IRSC.<br><br><b>6. <u>The September 7, 2011 Resolution and Atty. Estelito Mendoza’s letters</u><br></b><br><b>On September 7, 2011, the Court – through its Second Division as then constituted – resolved to deny with finality PAL’s 2nd MR through an unsigned resolution</b>.&nbsp; The Second Division, as then constituted, was composed of:<br><br><ol><li>Justice Brion (as Member-in-Charge and as Acting Chair, being the most senior Member),<br></li><li>Justice Peralta (replacing Justice Carpio who inhibited),<br></li><li>Justice Jose Perez,<br></li><li>Justice Bersamin (replacing Justice Sereno who was on leave<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>), and<br></li><li>Justice Mendoza (replacing Justice Bienvenido Reyes who was on leave<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>).<br></li></ol><br>On September 13, 2011, the counsel for PAL, Atty. Mendoza, sent the <b>first of a series of letters</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> addressed to the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court.&nbsp; This letter noted that, of the Members of the Court who acted on the MR dated August 20, 2008 and who issued the Resolution of October 2, 2009, Justices Ynares-Santiago (<i>ponente</i>), Chico-Nazario, and Nachura had already retired from the Court, and the Third Division had issued a Resolution on the case dated January 20, 2010, acted upon by Justices Carpio, Velasco, Nachura, Peralta, and Bersamin.&nbsp; The letter then asked whether the Court had acted on the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and, if so, which division – whether regular or special – acted and who were the chairperson and members.&nbsp; It asked, too, for the identity of the current <i>ponente</i> or justice-in-charge, and when and for what reason he or she was designated as <i>ponente</i>.&nbsp; It further asked for a copy of the Resolution rendered on the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, if an action had already been taken thereon.<br><br>On September 16, 2011, Atty. Mendoza sent his <b>second letter</b>, again addressed to the Clerk of Court requesting that “copies of any Special Orders or similar issuances transferring the case to another division, and/or designating Members of the division which resolved” its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, in case a resolution had already been rendered by the Court and in the event that “such resolution was issued by a different division.”<br><br>The Court received Atty. Mendoza’s <b>third letter</b>, again addressed to the Clerk of Court, on September 20, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Atty. Mendoza stated that he received a copy of the September 7, 2011 Resolution issued by the Second Division, notwithstanding that all prior Court Resolutions he received regarding the case had been issued by the Third Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; He reiterated his request in his two earlier letters to the Court, asking for the date and time when the Resolution was deliberated upon and a vote taken thereon, as well as the names of the Members of the Court who had participated in the deliberation and voted on the September 7, 2011 Resolution.<br><br>Atty. Mendoza sent his <b>fourth and last letter</b> dated September 22, 2011, also addressed to the Clerk of Court, suggesting that “if some facts subject of my inquiries are not evident from the records of the case or are not within your knowledge, that you refer the inquiries to the Members of the Court who appear to have participated in the issuance of the Resolution of September 7, 2011, namely: Hon. Arturo D. Brion, Hon. Jose P. Perez, Hon. Diosdado M. Peralta, Hon. Lucas P. Bersamin, and Hon. Jose C. Mendoza.”<br><br>On September 26, 2011, the Clerk of Court issued the Vidal-Anama<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Memorandum to the Members of the Second Division in relation to the inquiries contained in the first and second letters of Atty. Mendoza dated September 13 and 20, 2011.&nbsp; Justice Brion also furnished the Members of the ruling Division a copy of the Vidal-Anama Memorandum.<br><br>The Vidal-Anama Memorandum explained the events that transpired and the actions taken, which resulted in the transfer of the case from its original <i>ponente</i>, Justice Ynares-Santiago, to Justice Velasco, and eventually to Justice Brion.&nbsp; Attached to the Memorandum were the legal and documentary bases for all the actions of the various raffle committees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; These included the decisions of the two raffle committees on the transfer of the <i>ponencia</i> from Justice Ynares-Santiago to Justice Velasco and finally to Justice Brion as a regular Second Division case.<br><br>On September 28, 2011, the Letters dated September 13 and 20, 2011 of Atty. Mendoza to Atty. Vidal (asking that his inquiry be referred to the relevant Division Members who took part on the September 7, 2011 Resolution) were “NOTED” by the regular Second Division.&nbsp; The Members of the ruling Division also met to consider the queries posed by Atty. Mendoza.&nbsp; Justice Brion met with the Members of the <b>ruling Division</b> (composed of Justices Brion, Peralta, Perez, Bersamin, and Mendoza), rather than with the <b>regular Second Division</b> (composed of Justices Carpio, Brion, Perez, and Sereno<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>), as the former were the active participants in the September 7, 2011 Resolution.<br><br>In these meetings, some of the Members of the ruling Division saw the problems pointed out above, some of which indicated that the ruling Division might have had <b>no authority to rule on the case</b>.&nbsp; Specifically, their discussions centered on the application of A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC for the incidents that transpired prior to the effectivity of the IRSC, and on the conflicting rules under the IRSC – Section 3, Rule 8 on the effects of inhibition and Section 7, Rule 2 on the resolution of MRs.<br><br>A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC indicated the general rule that the re-raffle shall be made among the other Members of the same Division who participated in rendering the decision or resolution and who concurred therein, which should now apply because the ruling on the case is no longer final after the case had been opened for review on the merits.&nbsp; In other words, after acceptance by the Third Division, through Justice Velasco, of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, there should have been a referral to raffle because the excepting qualification that the Clerk of Court cited no longer applied; what was being reviewed were the merits of the case and the review should be by the same Justices who had originally issued the original Decision and the subsequent Resolution, or by whoever of these Justices are still left in the Court, pursuant to the same A.M.

Even the use of this IRSC provision, however, would not solve the problem, as its use still raised the question of the provision that should really apply in the resolution of the MR: should it be Section 3, Rule 8 on the inhibition of a Member-in-Charge, or Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC on the inhibition of the <i>ponente</i> when an MR of a decision and a signed resolution was filed.&nbsp; These two provisions are placed side-by-side in the table below for easier and clearer comparison, with emphasis on the more important words:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>RULE 2 <br> THE OPERATING STRUCTURES</strong></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><strong>RULE 8 <br> INHIBITION AND SUBSTITUTION <br> OF MEMBERS OF THE COURT</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">SEC. 7.<em> Resolutions of motions for reconsideration or clarification of decisions or signed resolutions and all other motions and incidents subsequently filed; creation of a Special Division.</em> - <strong>Motions for reconsideration or clarification of a decision or of a signed resolution and all other motions and incidents subsequently filed in the case</strong> shall be acted upon by the ponente and the other Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution.</p> <p align="JUSTIFY"><strong>If the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ponente</span></strong> has retired, is no longer a Member of the Court, is disqualified, or <strong>has inhibited himself or herself from acting on the motion for reconsideration or clarification, he or she shall be replaced through raffle by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a new ponente who shall be chosen among the new Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution and who concurred therein</span></strong>.

As previously mentioned, Justice Nachura participated in both the original Decision and the subsequent Resolution, and all three Justices were the remaining Members who voted on the October 2, 2009 Resolution.&nbsp; On the other hand, if Section 3, Rule 8 were to be solely applied after Justice Velasco’s inhibition, the Clerk of Court would be correct in her assessment and the raffle to Justice Brion, as a Member outside of Justice Velasco’s Division, was correct.<br><br>These were the legal considerations that largely confronted the ruling Division in late September 2011 when it deliberated on what to do with Atty. Mendoza’s letters.<br><br><i><b>The propriety of and grounds for the recall<br> of the September 7, 2011 Resolution</b></i><br><br>Most unfortunately, the above unresolved questions were even further <b>compounded</b> in the course of the deliberations of the Members of the ruling Division when they were informed that <b>the parties received the ruling on September 19, 2011, and this ruling would lapse to finality after the 15th day, or after October 4, 2011.</b><br><br>Thus, on September 30, 2011 (a Friday), the Members went to Chief Justice Corona and recommended, as a prudent move, that the September 7, 2011 Resolution be recalled at the very latest on October 4, 2011, and that the case be referred to the Court <i>en banc</i> for a ruling on the questions Atty. Mendoza asked.&nbsp; <b>The consequence, of course, of a failure to recall their ruling was for that Resolution to lapse to finality.&nbsp; After finality, any recall for lack of jurisdiction of the ruling Division might not be understood by the parties and could lead to a charge of flip-flopping against the Court. </b> The basis for the referral is Section 3(n), Rule 2 of the IRSC, which provides:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 2.<br>OPERATING STRUCTURES<br></center><br>Section 3. <i>Court en banc matters and cases. </i>– The Court <i>en banc</i> shall act on the following matters and cases:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br><br>(n) cases that the Court <i>en banc</i> deems of sufficient importance to merit its attention[.]<br></div></blockquote><br>Ruling positively, the Court <i>en banc</i> duly issued its disputed October 4, 2011 Resolution recalling the September 7, 2011 Resolution and ordering the re-raffle of the case to a new Member-in-Charge.&nbsp; <i>Later in the day</i>, the Court received PAL’s Motion to Vacate (the September 7, 2011 ruling) dated October 3, 2011.&nbsp; This was followed by FASAP’s MR dated October 17, 2011 addressing the Court Resolution of October 4, 2011.&nbsp; The FASAP MR mainly invoked the violation of its right to due process as the recall arose from the Court’s <i>ex parte</i> consideration of mere letters from one of the counsels of the parties.<br><br>As the narration in this Resolution shows, the Court acted on its own pursuant to its power to recall its own orders and resolutions before their finality.&nbsp; <b>The October 4, 2011 Resolution was issued to determine the propriety of the September 7, 2011 Resolution given the facts that came to light after the ruling Division’s examination of the records. To point out the obvious, <u>the recall was not a ruling on the merits and did not constitute the reversal of the substantive issues already decided upon by the Court in the FASAP case in its previously issued Decision (of July 22, 2008) and Resolution (of October 2, 2009)</u></b>.&nbsp; In short, the October 4, 2011 Resolution was not meant and was never intended to favor either party, but to simply remove any doubt about the validity of the ruling Division’s action on the case.&nbsp; The case, in the ruling Division’s view, could be brought to the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> since it is one of “sufficient importance”; at the very least, it involves the interpretation of conflicting provisions of the IRSC with potential jurisdictional implications.<br><br>At the time the Members of the ruling Division went to the Chief Justice to recommend a recall, there was no clear indication of how they would definitively settle the unresolved legal questions among themselves.&nbsp; The only matter legally certain was the looming finality of the September 7, 2011 Resolution if it would not be immediately recalled by the Court <i>en banc</i> by October 4, 2011.&nbsp; No unanimity among the Members of the ruling Division could be gathered on the unresolved legal questions; thus, they concluded that <b>the matter is best determined by the Court <i>en banc</i></b> as it potentially involved questions of jurisdiction and interpretation of conflicting provisions of the IRSC.&nbsp; To the extent of the recommended recall, the ruling Division was unanimous and the Members communicated this intent to the Chief Justice in clear and unequivocal terms.<br><br>Given this background, the Clerk of Court cannot and should not be faulted for her recommended position, as indeed there was a ruling in the 1<sup>st</sup> MR that declared the original ruling on the case final.&nbsp; Perhaps, she did not fully realize that the ruling on the 1<sup>st</sup> MR varied the terms of the original Decision of July 22, 2008; she could not have considered, too, that a subsequent 2<sup>nd</sup> MR would be accepted for the Court’s further consideration of the case on the merits.<br><br>Upon acceptance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR by the Third Division through Justice Velasco, the Clerk of Court and the Raffle Committee, however, should have realized that Justice Velasco was not the proper Member-in-Charge of the case and another raffle should have been held to assign the case to a Justice who participated in the original Decision of July 22, 2008 or in the Resolution of October 2, 2009.&nbsp; This realization, unfortunately, did not dawn on the Clerk of Court.<br><br>For practically the same reasons, the Third (or Velasco) Division, with Justice Velasco as Member-in-Charge, cannot and should not be faulted for accepting the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp; MR; the variance introduced by the ruling on the 1<sup>st </sup>MR and the higher interest of justice (in light alone of the gigantic amount involved) appeared to justify further consideration of the case.&nbsp; Recall that at that time, the IRSC was not yet in existence and a specific rule under the IRSC on the handling of 2<sup>nd</sup> MRs was yet to be formulated, separately from the existing jurisprudential rulings.&nbsp; Justice Velasco, though, could not have held on to the case after its merits were opened for new consideration, as he was not the writer of the assailed Decision and Resolution, nor was he a Member of the Division that acted on the case.&nbsp; Under A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC, the rightful <span style="font-style: italic;">ponente</span> should be a remaining Member of the Division that rendered the decision or resolution.<br><br>With Justice Velasco’s subsequent inhibition, a legal reason that the involved officials and Justices should have again recognized is the rationale of the rule on replacements when an inhibition or retirement intervenes.&nbsp; Since the inhibiting Justice was only the Member-in-Charge and was technically merely a <b><i>nominal ponente</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in so far as the case is concerned (because he was not the writer of the Decision and Resolution under consideration), the raffle should have been confined among the Members who actually participated in <b><i>ruling on the merits</i></b> of the original Decision or of the subsequent Resolution.&nbsp; At that point, only Justices Peralta and Bersamin were left because all the other Members of the original ruling groups had retired.&nbsp; Since under the IRSC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and Section 4(3), Article VIII of the Constitution, the case should have been decided by the Members who actually took part in the deliberations, the ruling on the merits made by the ruling Division on September 7, 2011 was effectively void and should appropriately be recalled.<br><br><b>To summarize all the developments that brought about the present dispute – expressed in a format that can more readily be appreciated in terms of the Court <i>en banc’s</i> ruling to recall the September 7, 2011 ruling – the FASAP case, as it developed, was attended by special and unusual circumstances that saw:<br><br><table style="font-weight: bold;"  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(a) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">the confluence of the <u>successive retirement of three Justices (in a Division of five Justices</u>) who actually participated in the assailed Decision and Resolution;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">the <u>change in the governing rules</u> – from the A.M.s to the IRSC regime – which transpired during the pendency of the case;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">the occurrence of a <u>series of inhibitions</u> in the course of the case (Justices Ruben Reyes, Leonardo-De Castro, Corona, Velasco, and Carpio), and the absences of Justices Sereno and Reyes at the critical time, requiring their replacement; notably, Justices Corona, Carpio, Velasco and Leonardo-De Castro are the four most senior Members of the Court;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(d) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">the <u>three re-organizations of the divisions</u>, which all took place during the pendency of the case, necessitating the transfer of the case from the Third Division, to the First, then to the Second Division;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(e)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">the <u>unusual timing of Atty.

The underlying constitutional reason, of course, is the requirement of Section 4(3), Article VIII of the Constitution already referred to above.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The general rule on statutory interpretation is that apparently conflicting provisions should be reconciled and harmonized,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as a statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Only after the failure at this attempt at reconciliation should one provision be considered the applicable provision as against the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Applying these rules by reconciling the two provisions under consideration, <b>Section 3, Rule 8 of the IRSC should be read as the general rule applicable to the inhibition of a Member-in-Charge.&nbsp; This general rule should, however, yield where the inhibition occurs at the late stage of the case when a decision or signed resolution is assailed through an MR</b>.&nbsp; At that point, when the situation calls for the <b><i>review of the merits</i></b> of the decision or the signed resolution made by a <span style="font-style: italic;">ponente</span> (or writer of the assailed ruling), Section 3, Rule 8 no longer applies and must yield to <b>Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC which contemplates a situation when the <i>ponente</i> is no longer available, and calls for the referral of the case for raffle among the remaining Members of the Division who acted on the decision or on the signed resolution</b>.&nbsp; This latter provision should rightly apply as it gives those who intimately know the facts and merits of the case, through their previous participation and deliberations, the chance to take a look at the decision or resolution produced with their participation.<br><br>To reiterate, Section 3, Rule 8 of the IRSC is the general rule on inhibition, but it must yield to the more specific Section 7, Rule 2 of the IRSC where the obtaining situation is for the review <i>on the merits</i> of an already issued decision or resolution and the <i>ponente</i> or writer is no longer available to act on the matter.&nbsp; On this basis, the <i>ponente</i>, on the merits of the case on review, should be chosen from the remaining participating Justices, namely, Justices Peralta and Bersamin.<br><br>A final point that needs to be fully clarified at this juncture, in light of the allegations of the Dissent is <b>the role of the Chief Justice</b> in the recall of the September 7, 2011 Resolution.&nbsp; As can be seen from the above narration, the Chief Justice acted only on the recommendation of the ruling Division, since he had inhibited himself from participation in the case long before.&nbsp; The confusion on this matter could have been brought about by the Chief Justice’s role as the Presiding Officer of the Court <i>en banc</i> (particularly in its meeting of October 4, 2011), and the fact that the four most senior Justices of the Court (namely, Justices Corona, Carpio, Velasco and Leonardo-De Castro) inhibited from participating in the case.&nbsp; In the absence of any clear personal malicious participation, it is neither correct nor proper to hold the Chief Justice personally accountable for the collegial ruling of the Court <i>en banc</i>.<br><br>Another disturbing allegation in the Dissent is the implication of the <b>alleged silence of, or lack of objection from, the Members of the ruling Division</b> during the October 4, 2011 deliberations, citing for this purpose the internal <i>en banc</i> deliberations.&nbsp; The lack of a very active role in the arguments can only be attributable to the Members of the ruling Division’s unanimous agreement to recall their ruling immediately; to their desire to have the intricate issues ventilated before the Court <i>en banc</i>; to the looming finality of their Division’s ruling if this ruling would not be recalled; and to their firm resolve to avoid any occasion for future flip-flopping by the Court. To be sure, it was not due to any conspiracy to reverse their ruling to affirm the previous Court rulings already made in favor of FASAP; the Division’s response was simply dictated by the legal uncertainties that existed and the deep division among them on the proper reaction to Atty. Mendoza’s letters.<br><br>Of the above-cited reasons, a <b>major influencing factor</b>, of course, was the time constraint – the Members of the ruling Division met with the Chief Justice <b>on September 30, 2011</b>, the Friday before October 4, 2011 (the date of the closest Court <i>en banc</i> meeting, as well as the <b>deadline for the finality of the September 7, 2011 Resolution)</b>.&nbsp; They impressed upon the Chief Justice the urgent need to recall their September 7, 2011 Resolution under the risk of being accused of a flip-flop if the Court <i>en banc</i> would later decide to override its ruling.<br><br>As a final word, if no detailed reference to internal Court deliberations is made in this Resolution, <b><i>the omission is intentional</i></b> in view of the prohibition against the public disclosure of the internal proceedings of the Court during its deliberations.&nbsp; The present administrative matter, despite its pendency, is being ventilated in the impeachment of Chief Justice Corona before the Senate acting as an Impeachment Court, and any disclosure in this Resolution could mean the disclosure of the Court’s internal deliberations to outside parties, contrary to the clear terms of the Court <i>en banc</i> Resolution of February 14, 2012 on the attendance of witnesses from this Court and the production of Court records.<br><br><center><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b><br></center><br><b>In sum, the recall of the September 7, 2011 Resolution of the ruling Division was a proper and legal move to make under the applicable laws and rules, and the indisputably unusual developments and circumstances of the case.<br><br>Between Section 3, Article 8 and Section 7, Rule 2, both of the IRSC, the former is the general provision on a Member-in-Charge’s inhibition, but it should yield to the more specific Section 7, Rule 2 in a situation where the review of an issued decision or signed resolution is called for and the <i>ponente</i> or writer of these rulings is no longer available to act.&nbsp; Section 7, Rule 2 exactly contemplates this situation.<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, we hereby confirm that the Court <i>en banc</i> has assumed jurisdiction over the resolution of the merits of the motions for reconsideration of Philippine Airlines, Inc., addressing our July 22, 2008 Decision and October 2, 2009 Resolution; and that the September 7, 2011 ruling of the Second Division has been effectively recalled.&nbsp; This case should now be raffled either to Justice Lucas P.

R. No. 178083&nbsp; (the “Mendoza letters”) for the inclusion thereof in the Court En Banc’s Agenda; and as items (b) to (e) of the Agenda the aforesaid Mendoza letters, which were briefly described in chronological order.<br><br>The Mendoza letters are all in connection with G. R. No. 178083 (the main FASAP case),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> a case now lodged with the Second Division of this Court. On 07 September 2011, the Second Division issued an unsigned extended Resolution (07 September 2011 Resolution) on the said case denying the Second Motion for Reconsideration (2<sup>nd</sup> MR) of Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL), the respondent therein.<br><br>The first two letters of Atty. Mendoza, counsel of PAL, inquired about any Court action on the 2nd MR; which Division of the Court (whether regular or special) had been acting on the case; who was the Justice in charge; and the reason for such Division and ponencia assignments; also requested were copies of the documents regarding those assignments. The first letter of Atty. Mendoza recalled for the Clerk of Court the participants in the original Decision on the case, as well as in the denial of the First Motion for Reconsideration (1<sup>st</sup> MR) of PAL. The letter further proferred the observation that the last communication received from the Court was the Third Division’s admission of its 2<sup>nd </sup>MR.<br><br>The third letter of Atty. Mendoza acknowledged receipt by PAL of the Second Division’s 07 September 2011 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>We resolve the second motion for reconsideration (2<sup>nd</sup> <i>MR</i>) filed by respondent Philippine Airlines (<i>PAL</i>) of the Court’s July 22, 2008 Decision.<br><br>PAL submits in its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR that the October 2, 2009 Resolution of the Court did not rule on the issues it raised in its first motion for reconsideration, in the oral arguments and in the memorandum. According to PAL, the resolution “left unresolved the issues raised in PAL’s xxx Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision dated July 22, 2008.” Since the Court did not rule on all the issues, according to PAL, the present motion must be considered as the FIRST motion for reconsideration of the Resolution of October 2, 2009.<br><br><b>PAL’s arguments fail to convince us of their merits.</b><br><br>We remind PAL that the Court is only bound to discuss those issues that are relevant and are necessary to the full disposition of the case, it is not “incumbent upon the court” to discuss each and every issue in the pleadings and memoranda of the parties.<br><br>PAL likewise incorrectly asserts that the resolution “did not rule on the issues raised and argued by the respondents,” and that Mme. Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago “modified” the Court’s July 22, 2008 Decision.<br><br>First, <b>the issues raised by PAL in its 2nd MR have already been discussed and settled by the Court in its July 22, 2008 Decision</b>. The Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Phils. (FASAP) is correct in its position that the resolution “<b>sustained the challenged decision dated 22 July 2008.</b>” To reiterate, the Court is not required to re-state its factual and legal findings in its Resolution. The Court’s supposed silence cannot be construed as a repudiation of the original decision; it only implies that the Court sustained the decision in its entirety.<br><br>Second, although the subsequent Resolution did not discuss all the issues raised by the petitioner, it does not mean that the Court did not take these issues into consideration.<br><br>Finally, the Resolution did not “modify” the July 22, 2008 Decision of the Court. The Resolution clearly upheld its original ruling and unequivocally stated so when we said:<br><br><blockquote>Therefore, this Court finds no reason to disturb its finding that the retrenchment of the flight attendants was illegally executed. <b>As held in the Decision sought to be reconsidered, PAL failed to observe the procedure and requirements for a valid retrenchment. Assuming that PAL was indeed suffering financial losses, the requisite proof therefor was not presented before the NLRC which was the proper forum. More importantly, the manner of the retrenchment was not in accordance with the procedure required by law.</b> Hence, the retrenchment of the flight attendants amounted to illegal dismissal.</blockquote><br>Significantly, PAL appeared to have deliberately omitted the above highlighted portions of the Court’s Resolution in its 2nd MR. The omission appears to us to be deliberate as we not only referred to our original finding that PAL failed to observe the proper procedures and requirements of a valid retrenchment; <b>we also reaffirmed these findings.</b> Thus, PAL appears to be less than honest in its claim.<br><br>To conclude, the rights and privileges that PAL unlawfully withheld from its employees have been in dispute for a decade and a half. Many of these employees have since then moved on, but the arbitrariness and illegality of PAL’s actions have yet to be rectified.<b> This case has dragged on for so long and we are now more than duty-bound to finally put an end to the illegality that took place; otherwise, the illegally retrenched employees can rightfully claim that the Court has denied them justice.</b><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court resolves to deny with finality respondent PAL’s second motion for reconsideration. No further pleadings shall be entertained. Costs against the respondents. Let entry of judgment be made in due course.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.

As a result, the following Resolution (the 04 October 2011 Resolution) was issued by the Court En Banc, which recalled the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division: <br><br><blockquote><center>RESOLUTION<br></center><br>Pursuant to Section 3(m) and (n), Rule II of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court, the Court <i>En Banc</i> resolves to accept G.R. No. 178083 (Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines [FASAP] v. Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL), Patricia Chiong, Et Al.)<br><br>The Court <i>En Banc</i> further resolves <b>to recall the Resolution dated September 7, 2011 issued by the Second Division</b> in this case.<br><br>The Court furthermore resolves to re-raffle this case to a new Member-in-Charge. (Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-de Castro and Del Castillo, JJ., no part. Brion, J., no part insofar as the re-raffle is concerned.) [Footnotes omitted; emphasis supplied].</blockquote><br>By virtue of this 04 October 2011 Resolution, the main FASAP case was re-raffled and initially assigned to Justice Maria Lourdes P.A. Sereno on 10 October 2011. That assignment intended to have the new Member-in-Charge recommend a course of action for the Court En Banc on the main FASAP case, particularly on PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. Such recommendation would have necessitated this Member-in-Charge to evaluate all the records of the main FASAP case in G. R. No. 178083. The evaluation of the record would have been the fourth evaluation of the case by the Court and effectively an action on a third motion for reconsideration of the original Decision dated 22 July 2008 (the 22 July 2008 Decision). Instead, what was discovered by the assigned Member-in-Charge from a review of the records is that the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division should not even have been recalled; thus, a fourth evaluation of the record, or a resolution of what is effectively a third motion for reconsideration, is completely unwarranted. I thus circulated a draft resolution to the Court for the recall of the 04 October 2011 Resolution, which has now become this Dissenting Opinion. Sadly, the majority of this Court chose to ignore judicial precedents and compel another review of the main FASAP case, specifically by the two remaining members of the Division, who themselves twice earlier denied PAL’s motions for reconsideration.<br><br><center><b>I<br>Assignment of Cases to the Court En Banc or in Division</b></center><br>As designed by the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court acts either En Banc or through three (3) Divisions of five (5) Members each.

Since Justice Corona, a regular member of the Third Division, had inhibited himself from the main FASAP case, Justice Carpio was designated to replace him as an additional member during the same day’s raffle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> According to the Report dated 14 July 2008 of the Division Raffle Committee, Justice Corona inhibited “due to his previous efforts in settling the controversy when he was still in Malacañang.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC, which was the justification for the decision of the Raffle Committee, provided for the rules on who among the Members of this Court shall be assigned to resolve motions for reconsiderations in cases assigned to the Divisions. It took effect by its express provision on 01 April 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and was the prevailing rule at the time of the raffle on 11 November 2009. Its relevant provision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>RULES ON WHO SHALL RESOLVE MOTIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION IN CASES ASSIGNED TO THE DIVISIONS OF THE COURT</b><br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the <i>ponente</i> is no longer a Member of the Court or is disqualified or has inhibited himself from acting on the motion, he shall be replaced by another Justice who shall be chosen by raffle from among the remaining members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or resolution and who concurred therein.

(Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>This interpretation by the Raffle Committee makes perfect sense, since a contrary interpretation would prevent a decision from ever being considered as having been “denied with finality” by the mere filing of a motion to admit a second motion for reconsideration. The Raffle Committee has the right to presume that a final decision is indeed final, since a second motion for reconsideration is expressly prohibited by the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The admission of a second motion for reconsideration is highly contingent on the demonstration of an exceptional circumstance that would warrant the allowance of a second motion for reconsideration.<br><br>It is important to note that a contrary opinion – that the case should have been raffled to a Member of the Division who participated in the deliberation on the Decision or the Resolution denying the first Motion for Reconsideration – did not seem to be held by Justice Chico-Nazario, a member of the Raffle Committee. Having concurred in both the original 22 July 2008 Decision as well as in the 02 October 2009 Resolution that denied the 1st MR, Justice Chico-Nazario, as concurring Member of the Third Division in both Decisions, could have opined that the case was not really denied with finality as that is understood in A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC. Thus, she could have asserted that the case be raffled among Justices Nachura, Peralta, Bersamin, and herself, but she did not. Instead, she appeared to have held the view that the raffling of the case falls under the exception that “[these] rules shall not apply to motions for reconsideration of decisions or resolutions already denied with finality.”<br><br>The only conclusion from Justice Chico-Nazario’s action as a Member of the Raffle Committee is that she interpreted the denial with finality as a genuine “denial with finality,” which would not require the case to be raffled among the remaining Members of the Division that decided and resolved the case. Rather, the alternative rule requiring that the case be raffled among the regular Members of the Third Division – whether or not they took part in the Decision – would apply.<br><br>The Clerk of Court, Atty. Enriqueta E. Vidal, through Atty. Felipa B. Anama, the Deputy Clerk of Court, explained in a Memorandum dated 26 September 2011 (the Vidal-Anama Memorandum) the actions of the Raffle Committee for Division Cases with respect to the main FASAP case in this way:<br><br><blockquote>The case was referred to the Raffle Committee in November 2009 in view of the filing of the <i>Motion for Leave to File and Admit Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated October 2, 2009 and Second Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision dated July 22, 2008</i> mentioned on page 3 of the Letter dated September 13, 2011 of Atty.

However, it specifically stated that it <b>did not apply to cases where the motion for reconsideration was already denied with finality.</b><br><br>Thus, on November 11, 2009, the Raffle Committee resolved that a <b>special division need not be created</b> to act on the aforecited pending second motion for reconsideration and <b>proceeded to raffle the case among the regular Members of the Third Division</b>.

The names of Justices Carpio, Velasco (chairperson), Nachura, Peralta, and Bersamin appeared in the Resolution.<br><br>Notably, in taking part in the 20 January 2010 Resolution, Justices Nachura, Peralta, and Bersamin – all of whom took part in the denial of the 1st MR in the 02 October 2009 Resolution – could have objected to either: (a) the assignment of the case to Justice Velasco, a member of the regular Third Division who did not participate in either action; or (b) the non-constitution of a Special Third Division. However, none of them did. Justice Nachura, it must be additionally noted, had concurred in both the original 22 July 2008 Decision and the 02 October 2009 Resolution.<br><br>On 17 May 2010, Chief Justice Renato Corona, who had then been appointed Chief Justice, issued Special Order No. 838 reorganizing the three Divisions of the Court in view of his vacating his former position as Associate Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> As a result, <b>Justice Velasco, Jr. was transferred to the First Division</b>. Under the applicable rule on the effect of reorganization, the main FASAP case, which was assigned to Justice Velasco, was correspondingly transferred to the First Division. Parenthetically, Justice Arturo D. Brion was assigned to the Third Division under the same Special Order.<br><br>On 17 January 2011, Justice Velasco inhibited himself “due to a close relationship to a party.” The First Division, to which he was transferred, thus referred the matter to the Raffle Committee “for designation of additional members,” the intention being to seek a replacement <i>ponente</i> for Justice Velasco.<br><br>On 26 January 2011, the Raffle Committee for Division Cases (composed of Justices Conchita Carpio Morales, Nachura and Arturo D. Brion) resolved, in its Minutes, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The case is presently assigned to Justice Velasco, Jr. who inhibited from the case due to close relation to one of the parties.<br><br>Following the pertinent provision of Administrative Circular No. 84-2007, <b>the case must be raffled among the Members of the Second and Third Division.</b><br><br><center>*Justice De Castro also recused from the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></center><br>(NB: The handwritten note in the minutes designated the new <i>ponente</i> as a result of the raffle by his acronym - “AB” - referring to Justice Brion).</blockquote><br>As a result of the 26 January 2011 raffle, the case fell on the lap of Justice Brion, who was then a member of the Third Division.<br><br>Administrative Circular No. 84-2007, cited in the Report of the Raffle Committee, provided the various rules on the inhibition, leaves and vacancies of the <i>ponente</i> or other members of the Division in pending cases and their proper substitution. The old rule was that when the <i>ponente</i> inhibits from the case, the case shall be returned to the Raffle Committee <b>for re-raffling among the other Members of the same Division</b> with one additional Member from the other two Divisions:<br><br><blockquote>2.&nbsp; <b>Whenever the <i>ponente</i></b>, in the exercise of sound discretion, <b>inhibits herself or himself from the case for just and valid reasons</b> other than those mentioned in paragraph 1, a to f above, <b>the case shall be returned to the Raffle Committee for re-raffling among the other Members of the same Division with one additional Member from the other two Divisions</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>These Rules have been twice amended; first, on 04 May 2010; second, on 03 August 2010. At the time that the case was assigned to Justice Brion as the new <i>ponente</i> by the 26 January 2011 raffle, the pertinent rule was that provided in the 03 August 2010 amendment. The <b>Resolution dated 03 August 2010 in A.M. No. 10-4-20-SC amended Rule 8, Sections 2 and 3(a) of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court.</b> The amended rule reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><i>Motion to inhibit a Division or a Member of the Court</i>. – A motion for inhibition must be in writing and under oath and shall state the grounds therefor.<br><br>No motion for inhibition of a Division or a Member of the Court shall be granted after a decision on the merits or substance of the case has been rendered or issued by any Division, except for a valid or just reason such as an allegation of a graft and corrupt practice or a ground not earlier apparent. (Rule 8, Sec. 2, Internal Rules of the Supreme Court)<br><br><i>Effects of Inhibition.</i> — The consequences of an inhibition of a Member of the Court shall be governed by these rules:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; Whenever a <b>Member-in-Charge of a case in a Division inhibits himself for a just and valid reason, the case shall be returned to the Raffle Committee for re-raffling among the Members of the other two Divisions of the Court</b>. … (Rule 8, Sec. 3 [a] of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Unlike in the old rule where the case remains with the Division of the inhibiting Justice, the amended rule now uniformly provides for the effect of inhibition of the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponente</span> on the assignment of a case – the case <b>will be taken out of the Division </b>to which the inhibiting Member of this Court belongs and raffled among the members of the two other Divisions.<br><br>Following the new rule, the inhibition from the main FASAP case by Justice Velasco – a member of the First Division – resulted in the need to re-raffle the case to members of the Second and the Third Divisions. When the case was re-raffled, <b>Justice Brion to whom the case was assigned, was then a member of the Third Division. The case was thus properly assigned to him as a regular member of that Division</b>.<br><br>On 21 June 2011, the Chief Justice issued Special Order No. 1025 reorganizing the Divisions of the Court, in view of the retirement of Justices Carpio-Morales and Nachura. <b>Justice Brion was then transferred from the Third Division to the Second Division</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On 27 June 2011, as required by the new reorganization, the new Third Division had to order the transfer of all of Justice Brion’s cases in the former Third Division to the new Second Division. The new Third Division, composed of its regular members – Justices Velasco, Peralta, Bersamin and Jose C. Mendoza, together with Justice Sereno as additional member – issued an internal Resolution “<b>to transfer the case to the Second Division, the same being assigned to a member thereof</b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>This procedure follows the aforecited Rule 2, Section 9 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court stating that if a case is a regular Division case, it follows the <i>ponente</i> to his or her new Division under the reorganization. It is also consistent with Rule 2, Section 7, paragraph 6 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court stating that “(i)f there are pleadings, motions or incidents subsequent to the denial of the motion for reconsideration or clarification, the case shall be acted upon by the <i>ponente</i> on record <b>with the participation of the other Members of the Division to which he or she belongs at the time said pleading, motion or incident is to be taken up by the Court.</b>” The main FASAP case was thus appropriately transferred from the Third Division to the Second Division when Justice Brion was reassigned to the latter.<br><br>On 24 August 2011, the Court issued a Resolution that would give notice to the parties that the main FASAP case had been transferred to the Second Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In the said Resolution, the Second Division “NOTED” the pleadings filed by FASAP and PAL, parties to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The parties received the notice under the document heading of the Second Division and under the name of the Clerk of Court of the same Division.

(Rule 13, Sec. 2, of the Rules of Court; emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>It is also important to emphasize that parties cannot complain about lack of receipt of formal notices that their cases are being transferred from one Division to another, since that is a matter of reorganization entirely internal to the Court.<br><br>On 07 September 2011, a Second Division session was held. The Agenda, Supplemental Agenda and Minutes of the Second Division session for that day reveal the dispositions of the agenda items as discussed by the Members of the Division. One hundred forty-eight (148) agenda items were calendared that day, broken down as follows: 96 judicial matters, 21 administrative matters and 31 administrative cases. This is not an unusual volume for a Division case load for a day. The main FASAP case in G. R. No. 178083 was one of the judicial matters tackled during the said Session of the Second Division.<br><br>Two non-regular Members of the Division had earlier been designated by raffle as replacements for the two regular Members who were on leave: (1) Justice Bersamin (<i>vice</i> Justice Sereno), and (2) Justice Mendoza (<span style="font-style: italic;">vice </span>Justice Bienvenido L. Reyes). Most of the cases for the day were acted upon by unsigned Resolutions, but five signed Decisions/dispositive Resolutions were also promulgated. Among the unsigned Resolutions that were promulgated was the denial of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR in the main FASAP case in G. R. No. 178083.<br><br>Justice Carpio (who had earlier inhibited, the reason given being “per advice of the office of the Member-in-Charge”) was replaced by Justice Peralta.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Note that Justices Peralta and Bersamin became Members of the Second Division for the purpose of resolving the main FASAP case – not because they took part in the denial of the 1<sup>st</sup> MR, but because they were replacements for a regular Member of the Second Division who had inhibited from the case and for another who was on leave.<br><br>Justice Brion, as the next most senior Justice in the Second Division, was acting chairperson and, at the same time, the Member-in-Charge. Thus, the Members of the Second Division during the 07 September 2011 Session for the main FASAP case were composed of Justices (1) Brion (Chairperson), (2) Peralta, (3) Bersamin, (4) Jose P. Perez,&nbsp; and (5) Mendoza. This Second Division promulgated the <b>unsigned 07 September 2011 Resolution</b> penned by Justice Brion, denying with finality respondent PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Of these five, two – Justices Peralta and Bersamin – had earlier concurred in the 02 October 2009 Resolution that denied PAL’s 1st MR. The Notice of this 07 September 2011 Resolution was sent not only to the SyCip law firm, but also to Atty. Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On 13 September 2011, Atty. Estelito P. Mendoza, counsel for PAL in the main FASAP case, addressed his <b>first letter</b> to the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court, which contained the following matters:<br><br><blockquote>1.

Requesting a copy of the Resolution rendered on the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, if an action had already been taken thereon.<br></blockquote><br>On 16 September 2011, Atty. Mendoza sent a <span style="font-weight: bold;">second letter</span> addressed to the Clerk of Court requesting “copies of any Special Orders or similar issuances transferring the case to another division, and/or designating members of the division which resolved” its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, in case a resolution had already been rendered by the Court and in the event that “such resolution was issued by a different division.”<br><br>A <b>third letter</b> from Atty. Mendoza addressed to the Clerk of Court was received by the Court on 20 September 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Atty. Mendoza stated that he received a copy of the 07 September 2011 Resolution issued by the Second Division, notwithstanding that all prior Court Resolutions he received regarding the case had been issued by the Third Division. He reiterated his request in two earlier letters to the Court, asking for the date and time when the said Resolution was deliberated upon and a vote taken thereon, as well as the names of the Members of the Court who had participated in the deliberation and voted on the 07 September 2011 Resolution.<br><br>Atty. Mendoza sent a <b>fourth letter</b> dated 22 September 2011 addressed to the Clerk of Court, suggesting that “if some facts subject of my inquiries are not evident from the records of the case or are not within your knowledge, that you refer the inquiries to the members of the Court who appear to have participated in the issuance of the Resolution of September 7, 2011, namely: Hon. Arturo D. Brion, Hon. Jose P. Perez, Hon. Diosdado M. Peralta, Hon. Lucas P. Bersamin, and Hon. Jose C. Mendoza.”<br><br>On 26 September 2011, upon request by Justice Brion, the&nbsp; Clerk of Court issued the Vidal-Anama Memorandum for the members of the Second Division regarding the inquiries contained in Atty. Mendoza’s first and second letters dated 13 and 20 September 2011, respectively. According to Justice Brion, as the acting Chairperson of the Second Division that rendered the 07 September 2011 Resolution, he decided to send a copy of the Vidal-Anama Memorandum only to those who had participated in the issuance of the Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Neither Senior Associate Justice Carpio, the regular Chairperson of the Second Division, nor Justices Sereno and Reyes, its other regular Members, received a copy of this Memorandum at that time.<br><br>In the said Memorandum, which was signed by Atty.

Enriqueta Vidal, the legal and documentary bases for all the actions of the various Raffle Committees were attached and discussed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> These included the decisions of the two raffle committees that oversaw the transfer of the <i>ponencia</i>, as a regular Second Division case, from Justice Ynares-Santiago to Justice Velasco and finally to Justice Brion. A reading of the Vidal-Anama Memorandum would lead to the conclusion that the two transfers of <i>ponencia</i> were compliant with the applicable rules.<br><br>One parenthetical note. In the above Vidal-Anama Memorandum, the Raffle Committee is quoted as having relied on Administrative Order No. 84-2007 as basis for raffling out the case from the Third Division to the First and the Second Divisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Apparently, the Vidal-Anama Memorandum refers to Administrative Order No. 84-2007, as amended, <i>i.e</i>., by the Resolution dated 03 August 2010 in A.M. No. 10-4-20-SC. The implication of the latter Resolution on the assignment of the case to Justice Brion has been discussed here earlier.<br><br>On 28 September 2011, the regular Second Division “NOTED” the Letters dated 13 and 20 September 2011 of Atty. Mendoza to Atty. Vidal, asking that his inquiry be referred to the relevant Division members who took part in the 07 September 2011 Resolution. In response to an earlier suggestion to just simply direct the Division Clerk of Court to answer the letters of Atty. Mendoza, Justice Brion – the <i>ponente</i> – informed those present that he needed to consult Chief Justice Corona on this matter. <b>There was no suggestion from anyone, much less any agreement among the Justices present, to refer the matter to the En Banc.</b> Indeed, Justices Sereno and Reyes, who were then present, were not fully informed of the contents of those letters.<br><br>As related by Justice Brion to the En Banc, a meeting was held on 28 September 2011 among the Justices who participated in the deliberations of the 07 September 2011 Resolution – namely, Justices Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Perez and Mendoza – to inform them of the four letters of Atty. Mendoza and to ask for their inputs. According to him, a couple more meetings were held to this effect, but there was no unanimity on how to specifically respond to these letters.<br><br>According also to Justice Brion, on 30 September 2011, a meeting held between Chief Justice Corona and Justices Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Perez and Mendoza yielded the recommendation to refer the matter to the En Banc and to vacate the 07 September 2011 Resolution in the meantime. Chief Justice Corona, who presided over the meeting, was also furnished a copy of the Vidal-Anama Memorandum.<br><br>On 04 October 2011, the following happened in the En Banc session:<br><br><blockquote>1. In the Agenda distributed, the Clerk of Court endorsed item no. 147 for inclusion therein, referring the letters of Atty. Mendoza with respect to the main FASAP case to the Court En Banc. Instead of being given its regular judicial docket number, G.R. No. 178083, it was given a separate administrative matter number, A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC.<br><br>2. This separate administrative matter in the En Banc’s agenda, apparently raffled to Justice Mariano del Castillo on 03 October 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> merited his recommendation to “refer to <i>ponente</i>,” meaning, to Justice Brion, to whom the main FASAP case in G.R. No. 178083 was assigned.<br><br>3. Without waiting for Justice Brion to respond to the recommendation of referral, the Chief Justice, who was presiding, informed the Court that the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division must be recalled, because it had a lot of serious problems. Justice Brion, the <i>ponente</i> of the said Resolution, kept quiet.<br><br>4. Despite the fact that the matter was characterized by the Chief Justice as a very sensitive matter and that the Resolution had a lot of serious problems, copies of the four letters of Atty. Mendoza were not furnished the rest of the Court.<br><br>5. Neither did the Chief Justice inform the rest of the Court that the Clerk of Court, through her Deputy Felipa B. Anama, had issued her narration of facts <i>via</i> the Vidal-Anama Memorandum, which detailed the raffle process undertaken with respect to the main FASAP case, and which tended to prove the regularity of the assignment of the case from Justice Velasco to Justice Brion, with its citation of the legal bases for the actions of the various Raffle Committees.<br><br>6. The rest of the Court assented, through their silence, to the recall of the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division.<br><br>7. There was <b>no formal referral</b> of the case by way of written resolution from the Second Division to the En Banc, but only an assumption and cognizance of the Mendoza letters by the En Banc.</blockquote><br>The Court En Banc thus issued the above-quoted <b>04 October 2011 Resolution</b> in the separate administrative matter docketed as A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC (Re: Letters of Atty. Estelito P. Mendoza re: G.R. No. 178083 – <i>Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines v. Philippine Airlines, Inc., Patria Chiong, et al</i>.) accepting and taking cognizance of the above-cited case; recalling the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division on the main FASAP case; and ordering the re-raffle of the same case to a new Member-in-Charge. At this point, four Members inhibited themselves from the main FASAP case:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Justices Carpio, Velasco, Leonardo-De Castro, and Del Castillo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As earlier stated, the main FASAP case was re-raffled to Justice Sereno, as new Member-in-Charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Under the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court, as amended, the Court En Banc cannot just take cognizance of a case assigned to a Division.&nbsp; The initiative of transferring the case from a Division to the En Banc must always come from the Division itself. Rules 2 and 15 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court provide:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Division cases</span>. – All cases and matters under the jurisdiction of the Court not otherwise provided for by law, by the Rules of Court or by these Internal Rules to be cognizable by the Court en banc shall be cognizable by the Divisions. (Rule 2, Section 4, Internal Rules of the Supreme Court)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Actions on Cases Referred to the Court En Banc</span>. — The referral of a Division case to the Court en banc shall be subject to the following rules:<br><br><blockquote>(a) the resolution of a Division denying a motion for referral to the Court en banc shall be final and shall not be appealable to the Court en banc;<br><br>(b) the Court en banc may, in the absence of sufficiently important reasons, decline to take cognizance of a case referred to it and return the case to the Division; and<br><br>(c) No motion for reconsideration of a resolution of the Court en banc declining cognizance of a referral by a Division shall be entertained. (Rule 2, Section 11, Internal Rules of the Supreme Court)</blockquote><br><i>Second Motion for Reconsideration.</i> – The Court shall not entertain a second motion for reconsideration, and any exception to this rule can only be granted in the higher interest of justice by the Court <i>en banc </i>upon a vote of at least two-thirds of its actual membership. … <b>In the Division, a vote of three Members shall be required to elevate a second motion for reconsideration to the Court <i>en banc</i></b>. (Rule 15, Section 3, Internal Rules of the Supreme Court)<br></blockquote><br>While it is true that none of the Second Division Members – whether regular or their substitutes – objected to the discussion, several important observations must be made here:<br><br><blockquote>1. When the matter of the Mendoza letters was calendared for agenda in the En Banc, not all Members of the Court – including certain regular members of the Second Division, such as Justices Carpio, Sereno and Reyes – were sufficiently alerted to the significance of their contents.<br><br>2. Except for Chief Justice Corona and those who took part in the 07 September 2011 Resolution, neither the Members of the Second Division, nor any of the remaining Members of the Court were furnished a copy of the Vidal-Anama Memorandum before or during the En Banc Session, which would have clearly shown the regularity of the assignment of the case to Justice Brion as a regular Second Division matter.<br><br>3. The impression given to the majority of the Court was that something deeply irregular had transpired, something akin to not vesting Justice Brion with authority to act on the main FASAP case – such that, to protect the Court, the 07 September 2011 Resolution must be recalled and the case taken cognizance of as an En Banc matter.</blockquote><br>Given that the factual bases for the impressions of the majority of the Court do not exist, and that the resulting conclusion that allowed them to accede to the 04 October 2011 Resolution on the instant administrative matter can no longer be sustained, I submit that no such irregularity in the application of the rules occurred. Therefore, the main FASAP case in G.R. No. 178083 should be returned to the Second Division as a regular case, and the recalled 07 September 2011 Resolution be reinstated and duly executed under the existing laws and rules.<br><br>While it is true that the Supreme Court has the power to suspend its rules “(i)n the interest of sound and efficient administration of justice,” under Rule 1, Section 4 of its Internal Rules, the interest of justice in this case requires that the rules be appropriately followed. The 04 October 2011 Resolution to transfer the case from the Second Division to the En Banc was apparently pursuant to the desire to observe the rules, not suspend them. The transfer of the case to the Second Division having been proven to be regularly made, there was no need for the suspension of any rule.<br><br>The following are therefore very clear:<br><br><i>First</i>, the assignment of the case to Justice Brion as <i>ponente</i> and its transfer to the regular Second Division to which he belongs complies with all the applicable rules.<br><br><i>Second</i>, there was no proper referral of the main FASAP case from the Second Division to the Court En Banc; hence, the latter did not act properly in taking cognizance of the case under the 04 October 2011 Resolution.<br><br>No Division of the Court is a body inferior to the Court En Banc; and each Division sits veritably as the Court En Banc itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The Court En Banc is not an appellate Court to which decisions or resolutions of a Division may be appealed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Before a judgment or resolution on a case becomes final and executory, the Court En Banc may accept a referral by the Division for <b>sufficiently important reasons</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Otherwise, the case would be returned to the Division for decision or resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The proposal to refer the case to the Court En Banc must first be agreed upon and made by the Division and formal notice thereof should then be sent to the Clerk of Court. The Clerk of Court would then calendar the referral in the Agenda for consideration of the Court En Banc. In this case, no such formal notice of a referral was made by the regular Second Division or sent to the Clerk of Court En Banc to elevate the main FASAP case for the consideration of the Court En Banc.<br><br>In fact, the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court are explicit on referring cases to the Court En Banc in instances in which the matter to be considered is a case that has already been decided by the Division and is already the subject of a second motion for reconsideration, similar to the circumstance in the case of PAL. In a Division, a vote of three Members shall be required to elevate a second motion for reconsideration to the Court En Banc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Applying this rule to PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR in the main FASAP case, no decision or vote by at least three Members of the regular Second Division was ever made to refer the case to the Court En Banc. Those who informally met with the Chief Justice and decided to raise the main FASAP case to the Court En Banc without any formal written notice thereof committed a serious lapse. The determination of sufficiently important reasons to refer the case, which was already the subject of a 2<sup>nd</sup> motion for reconsideration, was within the purview of the regular Members of the Second Division, and not by those who merely substituted for them in the 07 September 2011 Resolution. Regardless of the validity of that Resolution, the referral to the Court En Banc was a separate and distinct matter that should have been decided by the regular Members of the Second Division. Hence, Justices Sereno and Reyes, as regular members of the Second Division who – during their absence in the 07 September 2011 Session of the Second Division were substituted by Justices Bersamin and Mendoza, respectively – should have been included in the discussion on the referral of the matter to the Court En Banc.<br><br>For the Court to take cognizance of the Mendoza letters as a separate administrative matter independent from the judicial case in G.R. No. 178083 in order to justify the recall of the Second Division’s 07 September 2011 Resolution is unacceptable because it is plainly a circumvention of the above-discussed rules on the proper referral of a case from a Division to the En Banc. Rather than formally filing a motion for the referral of their case to the En Banc, any party-litigant may now, under the majority’s ruling, subscribe to Atty. Mendoza’s course of action and simply write a separate letter to the Clerk of Court or any of the justices, which can now be treated as an independent administrative matter so that the Court En Banc may unilaterally appropriate or take away a case from the Division. This new rule being egregiously created in this case by the majority will open the floodgates for all disgruntled litigants or their counsel to appeal unfavorable final judgments of the Court’s three Divisions to the En Banc.<br><br>Absent a formal referral by the regular Members of the Second Division and an articulation of sufficiently important reasons, the Court En Banc cannot properly take cognizance of the main FASAP case; nor can it oust, on its own, the authority of the Second Division over that case.<br><br><b>Thus, I maintain that the Court En Banc should recall its 04 October 2011 Resolution and return this case to the Second Division for reinstatement and finality of the 07 September 2011 Resolution.</b><br><br>It must be further noted that the decisions of the two raffle committees headed by Chief Justice Corona and by retired Justice Carpio-Morales, which led to the assignment of this case from Justice Ynares-Santiago to Justice Velasco and eventually to Justice Brion, were concurred in by retired Justices Chico-Nazario and Nachura and by incumbent Justices Velasco and Brion.<br><br>Significantly also, all three main dispositions of this case in favor of FASAP – the&nbsp; 22 July 2008 Decision, the 02 October 2009 Resolution denying PAL’s 1st MR, and the 07 September 2011 Resolution denying PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR – were uniformly unanimous, and concurred in by a total of ten (10) justices, retired and incumbent:<br><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="34%"><div align="CENTER">22 July 2008 <br> Decision</div></td> <td width="33%"><div align="CENTER">02 October 2009<br> Resolution</div></td> <td width="33%"><div align="CENTER">07 September 2011<br> Resolution</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p align="JUSTIFY">1.

Mendoza’s<br>Letters to the Clerk of Court</b><br></center><br>After the four Mendoza letters were received by the Court, the parties to the main FASAP case filed three significant pleadings: (a) PAL’s Motion to Vacate dated 03 October 2011; (b) FASAP’s Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 October 2011; and (c) PAL’s Comment on the said Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><b>A.&nbsp; PAL’s Motion to Vacate dated 03 October 2011&nbsp; </b><br><br>It appears that a day before the issuance of the Court En Banc’s 04 October 2011 Resolution recalling the Second Division’s 07 September 2011 Resolution, or at 11:31 a.m. of 03 October 2011, the Court received a copy of PAL’s Motion to Vacate (Resolution dated September 7, 2011) [the Motion to Vacate]. However, the Motion to Vacate was received only on 04 October 2011 at 3:00 p.m., by the Court’s Judicial Records Office, Judgment Division.<br><br>In the Motion to Vacate, PAL argued that the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division denying its 2nd MR should be vacated on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote>A.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 07 September 2011 Resolution was issued in violation of Sections 4 and 13, Article VIII of the Constitution.<br><br>A.2. It was issued in violation of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court.</blockquote><br>A.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>PAL’s First Ground in the Motion to Vacate</i><br><br>Quoting portions of the Records of the Constitutional Commission dated 14 July 1986, PAL argued that the intention of the Constitution is for cases or matters heard by the division to be decided/resolved with the concurrence of “a majority of the Members who actually took part in the deliberations on the issues in the case and voted thereon …” and that the conclusion shall be reached “in consultation before the case is assigned to a Member for the writing of the opinion of the Court,” with the phrase “in consultation” having a settled meaning as “after due deliberation.”<br><br>PAL concluded that the constitutional requirement may not have been met because those who participated in the issuance of the 07 September 2011 Resolution – Justices Brion, Mendoza, and Perez – had never taken part in the resolution of any matter in connection with the instant case, while Justice Bersamin was designated on 06 September 2011, or only one day before the 07 September 2011 Resolution was voted upon.<br><br>Effectively, although PAL was not articulating this thought explicitly, it was arguing that, under the Constitution, only Justices Peralta and Bersamin could have taken part in any deliberation on its 2nd MR. It was also effectively claiming that a one-day notice to Justice Bersamin of his designation as a replacement Member of the Second Division was not enough notice for him to take part in the deliberation on the 2nd MR, even though he had earlier voted to deny the 1<sup>st</sup> MR in the 02 October 2009 Resolution.<br><br><i>A.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; PAL’s Second Ground in the Motion to Vacate.&nbsp; </i><br><br>PAL insisted that its motion should have been resolved by a Special Third Division, based on A. M. No. 99-8-09-SC dated 17 November 2009 (Amended Rules on who shall resolve motions for reconsideration of decisions or signed resolutions in cases assigned to the division of the court). It argued that although another Court issuance, A.M. No. 99-8-09-SC, as amended (Rules on who shall Resolve Motions for Reconsideration in Cases Assigned to the Divisions of the Court, 15 February 2000), provides that a special division need not be constituted to resolve motions for reconsideration of decisions or resolutions that have already been denied with finality, this latter rule would not apply to its case. PAL contended that when its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR was allowed by the Third Division in the 20 January 2010 Resolution, the Court’s 02 October 2009 Resolution denying the 1<sup>st</sup> MR “with finality” was thereby suspended.<br><br>Although PAL was not explicitly saying so, it was in effect arguing that when it filed a 2nd MR on 03 November 2009 after the denial of its 1st MR by the&nbsp; 02 October 2009 Resolution, the rules required that (1) a Special Third Division consisting of Justices Chico-Nazario, Nachura, Peralta and Bersamin, with an additional fifth Member, should have been constituted to take cognizance of the case; and (2) the <i>ponencia</i> should have been raffled only to these first four Members who had actually taken part in the deliberation on the 1st MR. Thus, its Motion for Reconsideration should not have been raffled off to Justice Velasco.<br><br>PAL was anchoring its argument on the eventual admission of its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, an action initiated by Justice Velasco after the case was raffled to him on 11 November 2009. It was saying that, by admitting the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, the Court did not consider the said motion for reconsideration is to have been denied with finality, hence, the assignment of the case to Justice Velasco was erroneous, because he was not among the remaining four Justices who had concurred in the Decision or Resolution of the main FASAP case. But how could PAL argue that the assignment of the case to Justice Velasco was wrong and at the same time claim benefit from his action as Member-in-Charge?<br><br>At the time when the Raffle Committee met on 11 November 2009 for the purpose, among others, of making a decision on how to dispose of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, the legal status of the main FASAP case was unambiguous – its 1<sup>st</sup> MR had been “denied with finality.”&nbsp; There was no room to read into the case any other legal status. The Raffle Committee could have taken cognizance of only that status; it was bereft of any authority to dwell on any other future possibility, including the admission of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR admitted a year later when Justice Velasco was designated as Member-in-Charge.<br><br>A.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>PAL’s Prayer in Its Motion to Vacate</i><br><br>PAL additionally contended that parties should be made aware of who among the Members of this Court were deliberating on its case, so that they may be allowed to move for their inhibition. We note at this point that this argument was being raised, bereft of any basis to claim a right of prior information on who would ultimately constitute the membership in a Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>PAL prays that the Court: (1) direct the Clerk of Court to respond to all its inquiries as contained in its letters; (2) vacate the 07 September 2011 Resolution and thereafter refer its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR to a Special Third Division constituted in accordance with A. M. No. 99-8-09-SC dated 17 November 2009 and Section 7, Rule 2 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court; and, (3) considering the issues involved, refer its Motion to Vacate to the Court En Banc for resolution.<br><br><b>B.&nbsp; FASAP’s Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 October 2011&nbsp; </b><br><br>In its Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 October 2011, FASAP argued that the 04 October 2011 Resolution of the Court En Banc – taking cognizance of the main FASAP case, recalling the Second Division’s 07 September 2011 Resolution denying PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, and re-raffling the case to a new Member-in-Charge – was wrong, since the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division was already final, executory and immutable. FASAP also claimed that the recall by the Court En Banc was violative of due process because the latter did not provide the reason therefor, and the recall arose from an <i>ex parte</i> consideration of mere letters from PAL’s counsel, Atty. Mendoza. Finally, the recall was already not a valid exercise of the functions of the Court En Banc, whether administrative or judicial.<br><br><b>C.&nbsp; PAL’s Comment on FASAP’s Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 October 2011</b><br><br>In its Comment on FASAP’s Motion for Reconsideration, PAL argued that the recall made by the Court En Banc was proper and in keeping with due process, because the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division violated the Constitution and the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court.<br><br>PAL also contended that the Court had the power to recall its own orders and resolutions and to take cognizance, <i>motu proprio</i>, of cases being heard by any of its Divisions, as it had done in the past. It cited several instances in which the Court En Banc had re-submitted and re-deliberated on cases and pointed to Rule 135, Section 5 of the Rules of Court on the inherent powers of the court, including “(g) [t]o amend and control its process and orders so as to make them more conformable to law and justice.”<br><br>Finally, PAL claimed that the four Mendoza letters were not <i>ex parte</i> third motions for reconsiderations, because neither the merits of the main FASAP case in G.R. No. 178083 nor any prayer for reconsideration of the 07 September 2011 Resolution was discussed therein.<br><br>PAL prayed that: (1) FASAP’s Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 October 2011 be denied; and (2) that the Court En Banc proceed with the disposition of the main FASAP case in G.R. No. 178083.<br><br><center><b>IV<br>Main Disposition of the Case</b><br></center><br><b>A.&nbsp; The Sufficiency of the Factual Findings in the Case </b><br><br>Considering that the assignment of the main FASAP case in G. R. No. 178083 was perfectly regular, the 04 October 2011 Resolution of the Court En Banc recalling the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division has been found to be without of any legal basis. Hence, this should have been sufficient for the Court to vacate the 04 October 2011 Resolution and to return the main FASAP case to the Second Division for proper action.<br><br>I vote to simply <b>NOTE</b> the four Mendoza letters that have become the subject of the instant administrative matter (A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC). Atty. Mendoza, counsel for PAL, should be guided by the findings in this Opinion in order to find some of the answers to the questions raised in his letters to the Clerk of Court. His various requests to the Clerk of Court for (a) copies of Special Orders regarding the reorganization of the various Divisions relative to the main FASAP case; (b) information on and copies of the official assignments of the <i>ponentes</i> as well as additional Members to the various Divisions to which the said case was assigned; and (c) information on dates and times when deliberations took place, should be denied. Although Atty. Mendoza, as counsel for PAL is entitled to the <b>results of the raffle of the main FASAP case</b> under the rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this is not a <i>carte blanche</i> authority to demand the smallest minutiae of the Court’s processes in relation thereto, especially since this case has already been decided with finality. If as the majority in the Decision seek to imply that such detailed requests should be entertained in all cases by this Court, an unduly oppressive burden will be imposed that would prevent this Court from discharging its constitutional duty to resolve with reasonable dispatch the many other cases pending before it.<br><br>It is important to note that any of the five Members of the Second Division who voted for the 07 September 2011 Resolution – namely, Justices Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Perez and Mendoza – could have easily dissented therefrom, in keeping with the practice observed in this Court, but none of them dissented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; Deliberations took place not only on the main FASAP case in G.R. No. 178083, but also on many other cases calendared for the day. Justices Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Perez and Mendoza, as regular or additional Members of the Second Division, in fact signed several other Decisions and Resolutions of the Second Division of this Court promulgated on 07 September 2011, as listed below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> If any of them felt that they could not participate in the deliberations in the main FASAP case in the manner that the Constitution required them to, they could have easily done so by either requesting deferment of the discussion to give them time to reflect on the draft resolution, or by writing their own Dissent from the unsigned 07 September 2011 Resolution. None of them did and, thus, the said Resolution remains on record as a unanimous Decision of the Second Division.<br><br>In assailing the composition of the Second Division during its 07 September 2011 Session, which acted on the main FASAP case, Atty. Mendoza was effectively placing serious doubts on the effectivity of all actions of the Second Division on the 147 other items on that day’s Agenda, including the signed Decisions and Resolution above-cited. Giving in to his assertions would wreak havoc on the Court’s procedures and allow litigants to incessantly question the validity of orders based on mere suspicions about the propriety of the composition of a Division of the Court.<br><br>The 07 September 2011 Resolution was far from transgressing the constitutional requirements for the valid adoption of a decision. Indeed, while the Constitution requires a Division action to have the concurrence of at least three Justices thereof, the Decision to uphold FASAP’s position has been consistently and unanimously concurred in by all the justices who acted on the case. The 22 July 2008 Decision of the Third Division in favor of FASAP, penned by Justice Ynares-Santiago, was unanimously concurred in by Justices Austria-Martinez, Chico-Nazario, Nachura and Leonardo-De Castro. PAL’s 1st MR of the Decision was denied with finality in the signed 02 October 2009 Resolution by the Special Third Division, penned once again by Justice Ynares-Santiago and unanimously concurred in by Justices Chico-Nazario, Nachura, Peralta and Bersamin. Thereafter, the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division denying PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, penned by Justice Brion, was concurred in by Justices Peralta, Perez, Bersamin and Mendoza. In sum, the position expressed in the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Court has been shared by ten (10) Justices of this Court throughout the years.<br><br><b>B.&nbsp; The Validity of the Raffle of the main FASAP Case&nbsp; </b><br><br>In the Decision, the majority, led by Justice Brion as <i>ponente</i>, explained the consequences of the 20 January 2010 Resolution, which accepted the review prayed for by PAL in its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. To my respected colleagues, the said Resolution, which opened the main FASAP case entirely anew for review on the merits, should have been raffled off to the remaining Members of the Division, who participated in the deliberations and previous rulings, specifically Justices Peralta or Bersamin. However, I must register my dissent to this position since it glosses over factual circumstances attendant in this case and makes hairline distinctions in the rules to come up with a strained conclusion to justify the recall of the 07 September 2011 Resolution, penned by no less than Justice Brion, himself. The raffle of the case to Justice Velasco, then to Justice Brion and his subsequent ruling in 07 September 2011 Resolution are reasonable and consistent with our rules.<br><br><i>First</i>, the Court was tasked to resolve the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR filed by PAL, which was undoubtedly a <b>prohibited pleading</b> and was already in contravention of the Court’s express ruling against entertaining any further pleadings in the main FASAP case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Hence, when the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR was filed on 03 November 2009, the status of the case was one where a 1<sup>st</sup> MR had already been filed and subsequently <b>denied with finality</b>. Since Justice Ynares Santiago had already retired and the then prevailing rules on resolving motions for reconsideration had no application for motions for reconsiderations of decisions or resolutions which were already denied with finality,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Raffle Committee correctly treated the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR as an ordinary matter to be raffled to the now regular members of the Third Division, which was the Division that issued the 22 July 2008 Decision and 02 October 2009 Resolution. The Raffle Committee found no need to forward the matter to Justice Martin S. Villarama, Jr., who succeeded Justice Ynares Santiago and inherited her caseload,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> since the main FASAP case was already denied with finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>There can be no arguing with the majority, when it found no fault in the position taken by the Clerk of Court, as explained in the Vidal-Anama Memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> It would indeed be unreasonable for the Court to require the Clerk to divine or speculate on a future and favorable resolution of PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and consequently, proceed to raffle the case to the original Members of the Division who participated and concurred in the Decision or denial of the 1<sup>st</sup> MR. Hence, as the majority found, there was nothing erroneous with respect to the raffle of the case after the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR was filed and that the assignment to Justice Velasco was still proper.<br><br>I must however make a marked divergence with the majority with respect to the actions of the Clerk of Court and the Raffle Committee after the issuance of the 20 January 2010 Resolution, penned by Justice Velasco, to grant the motion for leave to file the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and thus, give new life to the main FASAP case. As the majority explained, throwing the case wide open for another review warrants its removal from Justice Velasco’s caseload and the conduct of another raffle to either Justices Peralta or Bersamin, who are the remaining members of the Court that decided the 02 October 2009 Resolution denying PAL’s 1<sup>st</sup> MR. However, the majority’s proposition is not only riddled with operational inefficiency, but likewise opens all final decisions of any Division to second-guessing by Members of the two other Divisions.<br><br>It is incongruent, if not burdensome, for a Member of this Court, acting in a Division, to revive a case that has been denied with finality on a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and then, to throw that same motion back to the other Justices for them to review anew the substantial merits of the case, which they have already decided. As the new Member-in-Charge of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR of the main FASAP case, Justice Velasco together with the Members of the then reorganized Third Division found some cause for review of the main FASAP case, when it issued the 20 January 2010 Resolution. Presumably, they reviewed the two unanimously supported <i>ponencias</i> of Justice Ynares-Santiago and found issues in the case worth looking anew. Having resolved to re-open the case for&nbsp; a third review, the burden should have been on Justice Velasco, as Member-in-Charge, and the other Members of the reorganized Third Division to hear the parties on the 2<i>nd</i> MR and resolve the matter on a final decision.<br><br>For the Court to recognize the action of the Third Division to re-open a final decision and suddenly throw back the responsibility of deciding the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR to the original Members who decided the main FASAP case is to second-guess decisions of the various Divisions of this Court and to allow a peculiar circumvention of our rule on immutability of judgments. The unacceptable contradiction lies in the fact that based on the ponencia of Justice Brion, a Member of this Court who does not “intimately know the facts and merits of the case,” can be given authority to re-open a final decision on 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and yet be precluded from holding on to the case to decide its substantial merits. Worse, those Members, who had in fact participated in the deliberations of the Decision and Resolution of the 1<sup>st</sup> MR, will now be compelled to review their own findings based on the recommendation of Member, who instigated the reopening, but will not participate in the same review.<br><br>The original Members of Third Division, which issued the 22 July 2008 Decision and 02 October 2009 Resolution, including Justices Peralta and Bersamin, and the five other Justices,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> have already made known their unanimous stand on the main FASAP case by their votes thereon. PAL cannot be allowed, by merely the retirement of Justice Ynares Santiago, to question the unfavorable rulings of a Court’s Division on a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. The principle of immutability of final judgment is better protected and upheld by disallowing review of a final decision by a Division on a prohibited second motion for reconsideration based solely on the retirement of the <i>ponente</i> or a change in the composition of the Division.<br><br>Furthermore, the introduction by the majority of the concept of a <b>nominal <i>ponente</i>,</b> to decide whether to open a third review of a decided case on a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, f<b>inds no support in any existing rule or jurisprudence</b>. Justice Velasco, to whom the case was properly raffled, and the members of the reorganized Third Division, at the time the 2nd MR was filed, had full authority to decide the motion in two respects: (1) whether to accept the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR despite the finality of the decision; and (2) if accepted, subsequently rule on the substantial merits of the main FASAP case based on the arguments in the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. Justice Velasco was in no sense a <b>nominal <i>ponente</i></b>, who will make a first determination of the propriety of accepting the 2nd MR and thereafter forward the second determination of the merits of the case to the “<b>ruling <i>ponente</i></b>” – the existing Members who were part of the Division which originally deliberated and decided the main FASAP case. Contrary to the majority’s conclusions, Justice Velasco is the proper <i>ponente</i> to whom the case was raffled to, with the dual responsibilities (1) to decide on accepting the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and (2) if accepted, to resolve the substantial merits thereof.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the subsequent inhibition of Justice Velasco was not cause to resort to the rule on resolving motions for reconsideration. What was called for was the regular application of the ordinary rules on inhibition and substitution of Members of the Court.<br><br>Under the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court, the general rule on resolving motions for reconsideration, as relied on by the majority itself, is expressed in its entirety as follows:<br><br><blockquote><i>Resolutions of Motions for Reconsideration or Clarification of Decisions or Signed Resolutions and All Other Motions and Incidents Subsequently Filed; Creation of a Special Division. </i>— Motions for reconsideration or clarification of a decision or of a signed resolution and all other motions and incidents subsequently filed in the case shall be acted upon by the ponente and the other Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution.<br><br><b>If the <i>ponente</i> has retired, is no longer a Member of the Court, is disqualified, or has inhibited himself or herself from acting on the motion for reconsideration or clarification, he or she shall be replaced through raffle by a new ponente who shall be chosen among the new Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution and who concurred therein.</b> If only one Member of the Court who participated and concurred in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution remains, he or she shall be designated as the new ponente.<br><br>If a Member (not the ponente) of the Division which rendered the decision or signed resolution has retired, is no longer a Member of the Court, is disqualified, or has inhibited himself or herself from acting on the motion for reconsideration or clarification, he or she shall be replaced through raffle by a replacement Member who shall be chosen from the other Divisions until a new Justice is appointed as replacement for the retired Justice. Upon the appointment of a new Justice, he or she shall replace the designated Justice as replacement Member of the Special Division.<br><br>Any vacancy or vacancies in the Special Division shall be filled by raffle from among the other Members of the Court to constitute a Special Division of five (5) Members.<br><br>If the <i>ponente</i> and all the Members of the Division that rendered the Decision or signed Resolution are no longer Members of the Court, the case shall be raffled to any Member of the Court and the motion shall be acted upon by him or her with the participation of the other Members of the Division to which he or she belongs.<br><br><b>If there are pleadings, motions or incidents subsequent to the denial of the motion for reconsideration or clarification, the case shall be acted upon by the ponente on record with the participation of the other Members of the Division to which he or she belongs at the time said pleading, motion or incident is to be taken up by the Court</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Briefly stated, the general rule is that the <i>ponente</i> of the case and the other Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution shall act upon motions for reconsideration or clarification. If the <i>ponente</i> had already retired, is no longer a member, is disqualified or has inhibited himself or herself, he or she will be replaced by the Members of the Division who participated in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution and who concurred therein. This rule is specific only to a <b>first motion for reconsideration</b>, which is permitted under the Rules of Court.<br><br>However, a different rule obtains for pleadings, motions or incidents <b>subsequent to the denial of the motion for reconsideration or clarification</b>, including in this case, a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, which is already a prohibited pleading. The <i>ponente</i> on record shall still continue to act on these motions, pleadings or incidents after the denial of the motion for reconsideration, but with the participation of the Division to which he or she belongs at the time the said pleading, motion or incident is taken up by the Court, and <b>not</b> by the members of the original Division who participated and concurred in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution. The principle therefore is that after the resolution of the 1<sup>st</sup> MR, all incidents subsequent thereto shall stay with the <i>ponente</i>, and if he or she retires, with the Division that decided the case and resolved the 1<sup>st</sup> MR.<br><br>Hence, the general rule relied by the majority cannot be applied in the instant case because what is being resolved is not a 1<sup>st</sup> MR (which was in fact already denied with finality) but a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. Being a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR subsequent to the denial of the 1<sup>st</sup> motion for reconsideration, the case was correctly raffled to Justice Velasco, as a regular Member of the Third Division, at the time the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR was filed and taken up.<br><br>Neither can the inhibition of Justice Velasco result in the return of the resolution of the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR to those Members of the Court who participated and concurred in the rendition of the decision or signed resolution in the main FASAP case. After Justice Velasco resolved to accept the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and then inhibited himself due “to close personal relationship,” the Raffle Committee applied the regular rules on inhibition and substitutions of members of a Division.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Hence, there was nothing irregular or out of the ordinary when the case was subsequently raffled from Justice Velasco, who had by then moved to the First Division, to Justice Brion, as a member of the other two Divisions (namely the Third Division, and subsequently the Second Division, after the re-organization):<br><br><blockquote>The case is presently assigned to Justice Velasco, Jr. who inhibited from the case due to close relation to one of the parties.<br><br>Following the pertinent provisions of Administrative Circular No. 84-2007, the case must be re-raffled among the Members of the Second and Third Divisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></blockquote><br>The distinctions in applying the rules on resolving 1<sup>st</sup> motions for reconsideration and the rules on inhibition between a nominal <i>ponente</i> and a Member-in-Charge are illusory in this case. After Justice Velasco, as Member-in-Charge, recommended that PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR be given due course, nothing changed the fact that the 2nd MR continues to be a <b>motion subsequent to the denial of the 1<sup>st</sup> MR.</b> Under our Internal Rules, all motions, pleadings or incidents subsequent to the denial of the first motion for reconsideration or clarification shall be acted upon by the <i>ponente</i> on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> However, since Justice Ynares Santiago had already retired, these subsequent motions, pleadings or incidents in the main FASAP case will remain with the Third Division which resolved the 1<sup>st</sup> MR, but will now be raffled off as an ordinary case among that Division’s present Members, in this instance to Justice Velasco. When Justice Velasco recused himself afterwards on 17 January 2011, the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR nevertheless continues to be treated as a <b>motion subsequent to the denial of a 1<sup>st</sup> MR</b>. Much like any ordinary case, the Court’s regular rules arising from a valid inhibition of a Justice now govern, and the special rules for resolution of a 1<sup>st</sup> MR in case of the retirement of the <i>ponente</i> still do not apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Hence, following the regular rules for inhibition and substitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR was properly re-raffled out of the hands of Justice Velasco to the Members of the two other Divisions, in this case to Justice Brion of the Third Division, and eventually to the Second Division, after the re-organization. This is not a simplistic view of the rules of this Court to the main FASAP case but a direct, proper and appropriate application thereof.<br><br><i>Finally</i>, the supposed exigencies, which compelled the recall of the 07 September 2011 Resolution, penned by Justice Brion himself, are infinitesimally and overwhelmingly insufficient to retract a substantial ruling by the Second Division on PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR.<br><br>That the 07 September 2011 Resolution would lapse into finality after the 15<sup>th</sup> day, or on 04 October 2011, was not a compelling reason to recall it. At that point, the main FASAP case had already been decided with finality by the 02 October 2009 Resolution which denied the 1<sup>st</sup> MR and PAL did not have any realistic expectation that its 2<sup>nd</sup> MR would be given any more judicial consideration. In fact, the recalled 07 September 2011 reiterated the substantial findings of Third Division, as penned by Justice Ynares Santiago, and ultimately denied the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. In hindsight, the much underscored time constraint was not as shocking to the judicial sense as to warrant a <i>motu proprio</i> recall by the En Banc of the 07 September 2011 Resolution of the Second Division, because the case had already been decided with finality since 02 October 2009 and was on its third review.<br><br>In any case, the concerns raised by the majority regarding the proper raffling of the main FASAP case (albeit properly executed by the Raffle Committee) could have been raised by the party concerned and was in fact questioned in the third and fourth letters of Atty. Mendoza as well as in the Motion to Vacate filed by PAL. There was no need for the Court En Banc to act with haste prior to the lapse of the 15-day period to move for reconsideration because the case was already denied with finality twice over (by 02 October 2009 and 07 September 2011 Resolutions). The recall of the 07 September 2011 Resolution by the Second Division was unduly precipitous and done without proper disclosure to all Members of the Court of the factual circumstances surrounding the issues.<br><br>The majority’s emphasis on the fear that the Court would be accused of “flip-flopping” if the 07 September 2011 Resolution be recalled on the ground of <b>lack of jurisdiction</b> of the Second Division after the lapse of the period is baseless. This concern erroneously assumes that a ruling made by one of the Divisions can be questioned based on the ground that another Division of this Court has purportedly better jurisdiction over deciding the case. Each Division sits veritably as the Court En Banc itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The Divisions of the Court are not inferior bodies to the Court En Banc; neither are they independent tribunals, whose decisions can be appealed on a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR to the other two divisions.<br><br>It is axiomatic that “jurisdiction once acquired is not lost but continues until the case is finally terminated.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The jurisdiction of a court depends upon the state of facts existing at the time it is invoked, and if the jurisdiction once attaches to the person and subject matter of the litigation, the subsequent happening of events, although they are of such a character as would have prevented jurisdiction from attaching in the first instance, will not operate to oust jurisdiction already attached.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> In <i>Mercado v. CA,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the Court even went so far as to say that errors committed by the court in the exercise of its jurisdiction will not deprive it of the same:<br><br><blockquote>Now, jurisdiction, once acquired, is not lost by any error in the exercise thereof that might subsequently be committed by the court. Where there is jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter, the decision of all other questions arising in the case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction. <b>And when a court exercises its jurisdiction, an error committed while engaged in that exercise does not deprive it of the jurisdiction being exercised when the error is committed.</b> If it did, every error committed by a court would deprive it of jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment would be a void judgment. This, of course, can not be allowed. The administration of justice would not survive such a rule. … (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Applying the foregoing principles to the factual circumstances of the instant case, this Court through its Second Division was not ousted of its jurisdiction when the case was assigned to Justice Brion and he, together with the other members of the Second Division, voted to deny PAL’s 2<sup>nd</sup> MR in the recalled 07 September 2011 Resolution. Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that some errors attended the assignment of the case from Justice Velasco to Justice Brion by the Raffle Committee (albeit, no such mistake occurred in this instance, as it was done in accordance with our existing rules), this Court through its Second Division cannot be considered by the majority as having lost jurisdiction by that purported lapse and thus, enable a fourth review by either Justices Peralta or Bersamin.<br><br>Neither can a claim of violation of substantive or procedural due process rights of PAL by this alleged mistake in the internal operations of the Court be sustained because it cannot be denied that PAL was afforded all the opportunity to ventilate its legal claims before the Court. In fact, when the Second Division, speaking through Justice Brion, voted to deny the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, the main FASAP case had already been decided with finality in favor of FASAP and was on its third review by this Court. Thus, the parties, especially PAL, had been given more than adequate opportunities to argue the cause before this Court. In sum, the purported mistake in the raffle of the case pointed to by the majority is not so grave and deplorable to our sense of justice as to warrant the retraction of the substantive decision of the members of this Court’s Second Division that voted without any dissent to deny the 2nd MR and finally lay to rest this case. The aim here is not just to give definitive resolution to the controversy between the parties in this case but to ensure that final decisions of this Court are indeed final.<br><br>Indeed, the recall of the 07 September 2011 Resolution produced the very effect or perception that Justice Brion, speaking for the majority, wanted to avoid – flip-flopping on cases decided with finality on account of a prohibited 2<sup>nd</sup> MR and personal correspondences by a party’s counsel. There can be no surer indication of flip-flopping than the subsequent and sudden denial of the petition in the main FASAP case on a 2<sup>nd</sup> MR, despite the grant of the petition in three rulings by at least ten justices (22 July 2008 Decision, 02 October 2009 Resolution and the recalled 07 September 2011 Resolution).<br><br>The view of the majority that the recall of the 07 September 2011 Resolution did not constitute a reversal of the substantial issues is a false view of the effects of such an action.&nbsp; This argument ignores the fact that the substantial merits of the case is yet again opened for review and the case reverts back to its status after the 20 January 2010 Resolution penned by Justice Velasco, which is the grant of the motion for leave to file the 2<sup>nd</sup> MR. Yet, even Justice Brion in the recalled 07 September 2011 Resolution asserted that “the issues raised by PAL in the 2nd MR have already been discussed and settled by the Court in the July 22, 2008 Decision.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It is so odd that this Court would open the main FASAP case for a fourth review by either Justices Peralta or Bersamin, when no new or earth-shattering argument has been offered that has not been taken up in the past that would warrant a reversal of the undisputed and repeatedly reiterated finding of this Court that PAL was guilty of illegal dismissal.<br><br>Finally, the unfounded allegations by PAL of the mishandling of the raffle of the case (albeit erroneous) which supported a review of the substantial merits of the main FASAP case clearly compelled discussion of the administrative matters and operations of this Court. Contrary to the insinuation that this possibly violates the 14 February 2011 Resolution of this Court on its internal deliberations, these matters are decidedly outside the province of judicial privilege, since it treats of issues not with respect to internal deliberations of the merits of the case, but on the procedural and administrative proceedings in raffling and designating the Members of the Court to handle cases.<br><br>Rather than write <i>finis</i> to the controversy hounding PAL and its employees, the Court has opened the flood gates anew for a fourth review of the main FASAP case, which had already achieved finality but has been resurrected by the mere expedience of supposed confusion in the raffling of the case. If this Court is to adhere to its character as a court of last resort, it must stop giving never-ending refuge to parties who obstinately seek to resist execution of our final decisions on the sole ground of their counsel’s creativity in re-labelling a prohibited second motion for reconsideration, or the changing composition of the three Divisions of this Court. Otherwise, the Court might as well lay to rest in the sepulcher the founding judicial principles of immutability of judgments and <i>res judicata</i>.&nbsp; I am duty-bound to register my dissent from the position taken by the majority in this case. Nothing has been established in the letters or pleadings to merit the Court’s extraordinary or special treatment in reopening for a third time, a unanimously-agreed upon&nbsp; Decision and to assign as new <i>ponente</i>, either of the two Justices who had twice agreed with that Decision. Nothing can be more unconstitutionally deprivatory of the winning party’s right to enforcement of a final judgment.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, I vote to (a) <b>RECALL</b> the Court’s En Banc 04 October 2011 Resolution in A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC; and (b) <b>RETURN</b> the main case in G.R. No. 178083 to the regular Second Division for implementation of the reinstated 07 September 2011 Resolution. I also vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Motion for Reconsideration dated 17 October 2011 of the Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP) in A.M. No. 11-10-1-SC.<br><br>I also find that the claim of violation by the Court of the Constitution and the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court argued by Philippine Airlines, Inc., in its Motion to Vacate dated 03 October 2011 and in its Comment dated 03 November 2011 to be <b>WITHOUT ANY MERIT.</b> Hence, the said Motion to Vacate filed by Philippine Airlines, Inc., (PAL) in G.
