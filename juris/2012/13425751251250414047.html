The remaining two commissioners submitted their Commissioners' Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> recommending the amount of&nbsp; P4,615,194.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> as the “just and fair market value of the land subject of the case considering that the land was cleared, worked and cultivated by the farmers and/or parents of the farmers-beneficiaries as early as 1980 and introduced valuable improvements thereon such as coconuts, falcattas, bananas, corn and other agricultural crops.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b></center><br>On October 8, 2002, the RTC, rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> fixing the just compensation of the property at P7,927,660.60<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> computed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Cornland (3rd class)&nbsp; – 143.5528 has @ P52,000/ha. – P 7,464,745.60<br>Cocoland (3rd class) –&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.4305 has. @ P30,000/ha. – P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 462,915.00<br><div style="margin-left: 160px;">Total ----------------------------&nbsp; P 7,927,660.60</div></blockquote><br>The reclassification of the acquired property from rainfed riceland, bushland and bushland rolling to cornland and cocoland was allegedly “supported by plaintiff's evidence,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which was not particularly identified.&nbsp; Nonetheless, while the RTC gave more credence to the Appraisal Report submitted by Asian, it did not adopt its valuation of P11,395,000.00 and instead fixed lower values but higher than those recommended by the Board of Commissioners at P4,615,194.00.&nbsp; It likewise awarded 5% attorney's fees in consonance with Article 2208 of the Civil Code, holding that the plaintiff was compelled to litigate due to defendant's acts.<br><br>Petitioner LBP and the DAR Secretary filed separate motions for reconsideration which were both denied in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated December 27, 2002.<br><br>LBP appealed to the CA, averring that the RTC erred in disregarding R.A.

No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by DAR A.O. No. 11, Series of 1994.&nbsp; Moreover, the classification of the acquired property into coconut and corn lands was misleading because at the time of actual taking, 154.6055 has. were idle and abandoned and 4.4825 has. consisted of rainfed riceland.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>For purposes of determining just compensation, the fair market value of an expropriated property is determined by its <i>character</i> and <i>price</i> at the time of taking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; In the implementation of R.A.
