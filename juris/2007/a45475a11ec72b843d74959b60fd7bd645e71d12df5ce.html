				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking the reversal of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 14 June 2001, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 15 February 2002, both rendered by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Lingayen, Pangasinan, Branch 68 in Civil Case No. 18037, with the latter ruling in favor of respondent Province of Pangasinan.<br><br>The present petition stemmed from a <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for <span style="font-style: italic;">Mandamus, Collection of Sum of Money </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Damages</span> instituted by respondent Province of Pangasinan represented by its Provincial Treasurer, Ramon A. Crisostomo, against petitioner Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (DIGITEL) on 1 March 2000.&nbsp; Said <span style="font-style: italic;">complaint</span> docketed as Civil Case No. 18037, was filed before RTC, Br. 68 of Lingayen, Pangasinan.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, took effect on 1 January 1992. &nbsp;Of significance to the present petition are Sections 137 and 232<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Local Government Code. &nbsp;Section 137 of the Local Government Code, in principle, withdrew any exemption<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> from the payment of a tax on businesses enjoying a franchise. &nbsp;Expressly, it authorized local governments to impose a franchise tax on businesses enjoying a franchise within its territorial jurisdiction, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 137. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Franchise Tax</span>. - Notwithstanding any exemption granted by any law or other special law, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">the province may impose a tax on business enjoying a franchise</span>, at the rate not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of one percent (1%) of the gross annual receipts for the preceding calendar year based on the income receipt, or realized, within its territorial jurisdiction. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Section 232 likewise authorizes the imposition of an <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span> tax on real property by the local government of a province, city or municipality within the Metropolitan Manila Area wherein the land, building, machinery and other improvement not thereinafter specifically exempted. The particular provision reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 232. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Power to Levy Real Property Tax</span>. A province or city or a municipality within the Metropolitan Manila Arena <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">may levy an annual ad valorem tax on real property</span> such as land, building, machinery, and other improvement not hereinafter specially exempted. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>On 13 November 1992, petitioner DIGITEL was granted, under <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Provincial Ordinance No. 18-92</span>, a provincial franchise to install, maintain and operate a telecommunications system within the territorial jurisdiction of respondent Province of Pangasinan. &nbsp;Under the said provincial franchise, the grantee is required to pay <span style="font-style: italic;">franchise</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">real property taxes, viz:</span><br><blockquote>SECTION 6. The grantee shall pay to the Province of Pangasinan <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">the applicable franchise tax</span> as maybe provided by appropriate ordinances in accordance with the Local Government Code and other existing laws. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Exept for the foregoing and the real estate tax on its land and building, it shall be subject to no other tax.</span></span> The telephone posts, apparatus, equipment and communication facilities of the grantee are exempted from the real estate tax. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Pursuant to the mandate of Sections 137 and 232 of the Local Government Code, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Panlalawigan</span> of respondent Province of Pangasinan enacted on 29 December 1992, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Provincial Tax Ordinance No. 1</span>, entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Real Property Tax Ordinance of 1992."</span>&nbsp; Section 4 thereof imposed a real property tax&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;on real properties located within the territorial jurisdiction of the province. &nbsp;The particular provision, however, technically expanded the application of Sec. 6 of the provincial franchise of petitioner DIGITEL to include <span style="font-style: italic;">machineries</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">other improvements</span>, not thereinafter exempted, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 4.&nbsp; Imposition of Real Property Tax. - <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">There shall be levied an annual AD VALOREM tax on real property <span style="font-weight: bold;">such as land, building, machinery, and other improvement not hereinafter specifically exempted</span></span>, situated or located within the territorial jurisdiction of Pangasinan at the rate of one percent (1%) of the assessed value of said real property. (Emphasis supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>On 10 September 1993, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Provincial Tax Ordinance No. 4</span>, otherwise known as <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Pangasinan Franchising Ordinance of 1993</span>," was similarly ratified. &nbsp;Sections 4, 5 and 6 thereof, positively imposed a franchise tax on businesses enjoying a franchise within the territorial jurisdiction of respondent Province of Pangasinan.<br><br>Thereafter, petitioner DIGITEL was granted by Republic Act No. 7678,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> a legislative franchise authorizing the grantee to install, operate and maintain telecommunications systems, this time, <span style="font-style: italic;">throughout the Philippines</span>.&nbsp; Under its legislative franchise, particularly Sec. 5 thereof, petitioner DIGITEL became liable for the payment of a franchise tax "as may be prescribed by law of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications businesses transacted under it by the grantee,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> as well as real property tax "on its real estate, and buildings "exclusive of this franchise."&nbsp; Sec. 5 reads in full that:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. Tax Provisions. - The grantee shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusive of this franchise</span> as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay</span>. In addition thereto, the grantee <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shall pay to the Bureau of Internal Revenue each year, within thirty (30) days after the audit and approval of the accounts, <span style="font-style: italic;">franchise tax</span></span> as may be prescribed by law of all gross receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications business transacted under this franchise by the grantee: Provided, that the grantee shall continue to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be liable for income taxes</span> payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code pursuant to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 72 unless the latter enactment is amended or repealed, in which case the amendment or repeal shall be applicable thereto. The grantee shall file the return with and pay the tax due thereon to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative in accordance with the National Internal Revenue Code and the return shall be subject to audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Later, respondent Province of Pangasinan, in its examination of its record found that petitioner DIGITEL had a franchise tax deficiency for the years 1992, 1993 and 1994. &nbsp;It was alleged that apart from the Php40,000.00 deposit representing the grantee's acquiescence or acceptance of the franchise, as required by respondent Province of Pangasinan, petitioner DIGITEL had never paid any franchise tax to respondent Province of Pangasinan since the former started its operation in 1992. &nbsp;Accordingly, the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Sangguniang Panlalawigan</span> passed Resolution No. 364 on 14 October 1994, categorically directing petitioner DIGITEL to:<br><blockquote>[C]ommunicate its conformity to Ordinance No. 40 to the Sanggunian thru the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Secretary and to pay the necessary and overdue franchise taxes to the Provincial Treasurer of Pangasinan within fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof otherwise its franchise shall be declared in operative (sic) and its operations terminated;"<br></blockquote>In the <span style="font-style: italic;">interregnum</span>, on 16 March 1995, Congress passed Republic Act No. 7925, otherwise known as <span style="font-style: italic;">"The Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines."</span> Section 23 of this law entitled Equality of Treatment in the Telecommunications Industry, provided for the <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> application to any previously granted telecommunications franchises of any advantage, favor, privilege, exemption or immunity granted under existing franchises, or those still to be granted, to be accorded immediately and unconditionally to earlier grantees. &nbsp;Section 23 reads below:<br><blockquote>SECTION 23. Equality of Treatment in the Telecommunications Industry. - Any advantage, favor, privilege, exemption, or immunity granted under existing franchises, or may hereafter be granted, <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">shall ipso facto become part of previously granted telecommunications franchises and shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the grantees of such franchises</span> x x x. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The provincial franchise and real property taxes remained unpaid despite the foregoing measures instituted. &nbsp;Consequently, in a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated 30 October 1998, the Provincial Legal Officer of respondent Province of Pangasinan, Atty. Geraldine U. Baniqued, demanded from petitioner DIGITEL compliance with Provincial Tax Ordinance No. 4., specifically the first paragraph of Section 4 thereof but which was wittingly or unwittingly misquoted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to read:<br><blockquote>'No persons shall establish and / or operate a public utility business enterprises (sic) within the territorial jurisdiction of the Province of Pangasinan whether in one municipality or group of municipalities, except by virtue of a franchise granted by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Pangasinan.'<br></blockquote>On 17 November 1998, petitioner DIGITEL took exception to respondent Province of Pangasinan's claim on the ground that prior to the approval of its legislative franchise, its operation of a telecommunications system was done under a <span style="font-style: italic;">Facilities Management</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Agreement</span> it had previously executed with the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC). Such agreement was purportedly the result of a public bidding wherein petitioner DIGITEL was "awarded the right to manage the operation, maintenance and development of government telecommunications facilities under its Regional Telecommunications Development Project Phases A and B x x x and National Telephone Program Phase I Tranche 1 x x x covering Regions I to V."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It clarified that since "the facilities in the Province of Pangasinan are just part of the government owned facilities awarded to DIGITEL," not only did the DOTC retain ownership of said facilities, the latter likewise "provided for the budget for (the) expenses under its allocation from the government;" hence, "all revenues generated from the operation of the facilities inured to the DOTC;" and all the fees received by petitioner DIGITEL were purely for services rendered.<br><br>Further, it argued that under its legislative franchise, the payment of a franchise tax to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) would be <span style="font-style: italic;">"in lieu of all taxes"</span> on said franchise or the earnings therefrom.<br><br>Unconvinced, on 8 December 1998, respondent Province of Pangasinan countered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the provisions of its franchise were subject not only to the provisions of the Constitution, but to <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">"applicable laws, rules and regulations"</span> as well; that among the <span style="font-style: italic;">applicable laws</span> being referred to were Sec. 137 of the Local Government Code, which authorizes it to "impose a tax on business enjoying a franchise x x x;" and Sec. 6 of Provincial Ordinance No. 4, which similarly imposes a tax on a business enjoying a franchise.<br><br>On 1 March 2000, no settlement having been made, respondent Province of Pangasinan, represented by the latter's Provincial Treasurer, Ramon A. Crisostomo, filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> for <span style="font-style: italic;">Mandamus, Collection of Sum of Money</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Damages</span> before Branch 68 of the RTC of Lingayen, Pangasinan, docketed as Civil Case No. 18037.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">Complaint</span> prayed that petitioner DIGITEL be ordered:<br><blockquote><ol><li>to x x x open its books, records and other pertinent documents so that the provincial government can make the proper assessment of the Taxes due.<br><br></li><li>after determination of the defendant's capital investment and subsequent gross receipts, to pay plaintiff the sum equivalent to 1/20<sup>th</sup> of one percent (1%) of the total capital investment for the first year of its operation and thereafter, fifty percent (50%) of one percent (1%) of the gross receipts realized during the preceding calendar year for the year 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and up to the present.<br><br></li><li>after determination of all of defendant's real properties, to pay the Real Property Tax due after its proper computation.<br><br></li><li>to pay legal interest of the amounts from the time it was due until the whole amount is fully complied with.<br><br></li><li>to pay the cost of this suit.</li></ol></blockquote>On 14 June 2001, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered a <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in favor of respondent Province of Pangasinan, the dispositive part of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff, as follows:<br><ol><li>Ordering the defendant to open its books, records and other pertinent documents so that the provincial government can make the proper assessment of the franchise tax and real property tax due;<br><br></li><li>After the determination of the defendant's capital investment and subsequent gross receipts, to pay&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;plaintiff the sum equivalent to 1/20<sup>th</sup> of one percent (1%) of the total capital investment for the first year of its operation (1993), and thereafter, fifty percent (50%) of one percent (1%) of the gross receipts realized during the preceding calendar year 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and up to the present;<br><br></li><li>After determination of all of defendant's real properties, to pay Real Property Tax due after its proper computation, pursuant to Section 4 of the Real Property Tax Ordinance of 1992 of the plaintiff;<br><br></li><li>To pay 1) A surcharge of twenty-five percent of the amount of the franchise tax due or a fraction thereof until the delinquent tax shall have been fully paid; 2) To pay an interest of two percent (2%) per month on the unpaid amount or a fraction thereof, until the delinquent tax shall have been fully paid, but in no case shall the total interest on the unpaid tax or proportion thereof exceed 36 months;<br><br></li><li>To pay the cost of this suit.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In ruling against the claimed exemption, the court a quo held that petitioner DIGITEL's legislative franchise does not work to exempt the latter from payment of provincial franchise and real property taxes. The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo </span>reasoned that the provincial and legislative franchises are separate and distinct from each other; and, that prior to the grant of its legislative franchise, petitioner DIGITEL had already benefited from the use of it. Moreover, it pointed out that Section 137 of the Local Government Code had already withdrawn any exemption granted to anyone; as such, the local government of a province may impose a tax on a business enjoying a franchise.<br><br>On the other hand, petitioner DIGITEL maintains that its legislative franchise being an earlier enactment, by virtue of Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925, the <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>, immediate and unconditional application to it of the <span style="font-style: italic;">tax exemption</span> found in the franchises of Globe, Smart and Bell, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Section 9 (b) of Republic Act No. 7229</span>, Globe's legislative franchise; in <span style="font-style: italic;">Section 9 of Republic Act No. 7294</span>, Smart's legislative franchise; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Section 9 of Republic Act No. 7294</span>, Bell's legislative franchise, all basically or similarly containing&nbsp; the phrase <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">"shall pay a franchise tax equivalent to x x x of all gross receipts of the business transacted under this franchise by the grantee, its successors or assigns and the said percentage shall be in lieu of all taxes on this franchise or earnings thereof.</span><br><br>Stated simply, Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925, in relation to the pertinent provisions of the legislative franchises of Globe, Smart and Bell, "the national franchise tax for which petitioner (DIGITEL) is liable to pay shall be 'in lieu of any and all taxes of any kind, nature or description levied, established or collected by any authority whatsoever, municipal, provincial, or national, from which the grantee is hereby expressly granted."<br><br>Petitioner DIGITEL's <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span> was denied in a <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 15 February 2002.<br><br>As the controversy involves pure questions of law, this Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, was filed directly with this Court, predicated on the following arguments:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN DECLARING THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE IS A SPECIAL LAW.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT PETITIONER IS LIABLE TO PAY REAL PROPERTY TAX AND FRANCHISE TAX.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>THE PROVISIONS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE MAY BE RECONCILED WITH THOSE OF PETITIONER'S LEGISLATIVE FRANCHISE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV.<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN NOT RULING THAT PETITIONER'S LEGISLATIVE FRANCHISE, REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7678, IS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V.<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE NON-IMPAIRMENT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT EXTEND TO NOR COVER FRANCHISES ISSUED BY CONGRESS.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">VI.<br></div><br>ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT PETITIONER SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE TO PAY FRANCHISE AND REAL PROPERTY TAXES, IT IS NONETHELESS STILL EXEMPT FROM PAYMENT THEREOF IN VIEW OF ITS REGISTRATION WITH THE BOARD OF INVESTMENTS AS A NON-PIONEER BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 133 (G) OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE.<br></blockquote>The plethora of arguments raised can be reduced to two basic but essential issues, namely: 1) Whether or not petitioner DIGITEL is entitled to the exemption from the payment of provincial franchise tax in view of Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> otherwise known as the "Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines," in relation to the tax exemption provisions found in the legislative franchises of <span style="font-style: italic;">Globe Mackay Cable and Radio Corporation, Smart Information Technologies, Incorporated</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bell Telecommunication Philippines, Incorporated.</span><br><br>Stated otherwise, are the "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" clauses/provisos found in Republic Act No. 7229, the legislative franchise of Globe; Republic Act No. 7294, the legislative franchise of Smart; and Republic Act No. 7692, the legislative franchise of Bell, <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-à-vis</span> Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925, applicable to petitioner DIGITEL such that the latter is now exempt from the payment of any other taxes except the national franchise and income taxes?<br><br>And, 2) if answered in the negative, whether or not petitioner DIGITEL's real properties found within the territorial jurisdiction of respondent Province of Pangasinan are exempt from the payment of real property taxes by virtue of the phrase<span style="font-style: italic;"> "exclusive of this franchise"</span> found in Section 5 of its legislative franchise, Republic Act No. 7678?<br><br>At the outset, worth noting is the fact that prior to the enactment and effectivity of its legislative franchise, with only a provincial franchise to speak of, petitioner DIGITEL did not enjoy any exemption from the payment of franchise and real property taxes. &nbsp;In fact, Provincial Ordinance No. 18-92, its provincial franchise, categorically made it liable for the payment of such taxes. It was only with the enactment of Republic Act No. 7925 in 1995 and succeeding legislative franchises containing the "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" clauses/provisos that petitioner DIGITEL can claim exemption to such tax liabilities.<br><br>The case at bar is actually not one of first impression. Indeed, as far back as 2001, this Court has had the occasion to rule against the claim for tax exemption under Republic Act No. 7925. In the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. v. City of Davao,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we already clarified the confusion brought about by the effect of Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925 - that the word <span style="font-style: italic;">"exemption"</span> as used in the statute refer's or pertain's merely to an exemption from regulatory or reporting requirements of the DOTC or the NTC and not to the grantee's tax liability.<br><br>The issue in the <span style="font-style: italic;">PLDT v. City of Davao </span>case was whether or not, by virtue of Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925 (Public Telecommunications Policy of the Philippines), PLDT is again entitled to an exemption from the payment of local franchise tax in view of the grant of a tax exemption to Globe and Smart telecommunications companies. &nbsp;Before the enactment of Republic Act No. 7925 in 1995, the Congress of the Philippines granted in favor of Globe<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and Smart<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> franchises<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that contain "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" clauses or provisos. &nbsp;Then came Republic Act No. 7925, particularly Section 23 thereof, providing, more or less, that <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">any advantage, favor, privilege, exemption, or immunity granted under existing franchises, or may hereafter be granted, shall be made part of previously enacted franchises and made automatically applicable to the grantees thereof</span>. &nbsp;Subsequently, in "January 1999, when PLDT applied for a mayor's permit to operate its Davao Metro Exchange, it was required to pay the local franchise tax for the first to the fourth quarter of 1999 x x x. &nbsp;PLDT challenged the power of the city government to collect the local franchise tax and demanded a refund of what it had paid as local franchise tax for the year 1997 and for the first to the third quarters of 1998."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The latter believed itself to be exempt from payment of such tax even though Section 12 of its franchise (Republic Act No. 7082) containing the "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" proviso had already been withdrawn by the provisions of the Local Government Code. &nbsp;Its belief was anchored on the<span style="font-style: italic;"> effect</span> of the above-mentioned Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925 - that because the franchises of Globe and Smart contain "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" clauses or provisos, the same grant of tax exemption must be regarded to have become <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> part of PLDT's previously granted telecommunications franchise.<br><br>In denying PLDT's petition, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, held that in approving Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925, Congress did not intend it to operate as a blanket tax exemption to all telecommunications entities; thus, it cannot be considered as having amended petitioner PLDT's franchise so as to entitle it to exemption from the imposition of local franchise taxes. &nbsp;The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia </span>went on further to elucidate that:<br><blockquote>To begin with, tax exemptions are highly disfavored. x x x<br><br>The tax exemption must be expressed in the statute in clear language that leaves no doubt of the intention of the legislature to grant such exemption. And, even if it is granted, the exemption must be interpreted in <span style="font-style: italic;">strictissimi juris </span>against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. (Citation omitted.)<br><br>In the present case, petitioner justifies its claim of tax exemption by strained inferences. First, it cites R.A. No. 7925, otherwise known as the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines, §23 x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Petitioner then claims that Smart and Globe enjoy exemption from the payment of the franchise tax by virtue of their legislative franchises per opinion of the Bureau of Local Government Finance of the Department of Finance. Finally, it argues that because Smart and Globe are exempt from the franchise tax, it follows that it must likewise be exempt from the tax being collected by the City of Davao because the grant of tax exemption to Smart and Globe ipso facto extended the same exemption to it.<br><br>The acceptance of petitioner's theory would result in absurd consequences. To illustrate: In its franchise, Globe is required to pay a franchise tax of only one and one-half percentum (1 ½%) of all gross receipts from its transactions while Smart is required to pay a tax of three percent (3%) on all gross receipts from business transacted. Petitioner's theory would require that, to level the playing field, any 'advantage, favor, privilege, exemption, or immunity' granted to Globe must be extended to all telecommunications companies, including Smart. If, later, Congress again grants a franchise to another telecommunications company imposing, say, one percent (1%) franchise tax, then all other telecommunications franchises will have to be adjusted to 'level the playing field' so to speak. <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">This could not have been the intent of Congress in enacting §23 of Rep. Act 7925. Petitioner's theory will leave the Government with the burden of having to keep track of all granted telecommunications franchises, lest some companies be treated unequally. It is different if Congress enacts a law specifically granting uniform advantages, favor, privilege, exemption, or immunity to all telecommunications entities.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The fact is that the term "exemption" in </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">§</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">23 is too general.</span> A cardinal rule in statutory construction is that legislative intent must be ascertained from a consideration of the statute as a whole and not merely of a particular provision. x x x Hence, a consideration of the law itself in its entirety and the proceedings of both Houses of Congress is in order. [Citation omitted.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Art. VIII, entitled Telecommunications Development, where §23 is found, provides for public ownership of telecommunications entities, privatization of existing facilities, and the equality of treatment provision.

At the outset, every presumption is against it. A well-founded doubt is fatal to the claim. It is only when the terms of the concession are too explicit to admit fairly of any other construction that the proposition can be supported.' <span style="font-weight: bold;">In this case, the word 'exemption' in </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">§</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">23 of R.A. No. 7925 could contemplate exemption from certain regulatory or reporting requirements, bearing in mind the policy of the law</span> x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>From the preceding discourse, there is nothing more left to be argued. The issue has been settled. The Court's pronouncement in the above-discussed case has been reiterated in a number of cases concerning the import of Section 23 of Republic Act No. 7925. Therefore, this Court has no recourse but to deny petitioner DIGITEL's claim for exemption from payment of provincial franchise tax.<br><br>The foregoing pronouncement notwithstanding, in view of the passage of Republic Act No. 7716,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> abolishing the franchise tax imposed on telecommunications companies effective 1 January 1996 and in its place is imposed a 10 percent Value-Added-Tax (VAT),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" clause/provision in the legislative franchises of Globe, Smart and Bell, among others, has now become <span style="font-style: italic;">functus officio</span>, made inoperative for lack of a franchise tax. Therefore, taking into consideration the above, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">from 1 January 1996, petitioner DIGITEL ceased to be liable for national franchise tax and in its stead is imposed a 10% VAT in accordance with Section 108 of the Tax Code.</span><br><br>As to the issue relating to the claim of payment of real property taxes, of particular import is Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7678, the legislative franchise of petitioner DIGITEL. &nbsp;Sec. 5 of said law again states that:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5.&nbsp; Tax Provisions. - The grantee shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property <span style="font-weight: bold;">exclusive of this franchise</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay x x x. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Owing to the phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">"exclusive of this franchise</span>," petitioner DIGITEL stands firm in its position that it is equally exempt from the payment of real property tax. &nbsp;It maintains that said phrase found in Section 5 above-quoted qualifies or delimits the scope of its liability respecting real property tax - that real property tax should only be imposed on its assets that are actually, directly and exclusively used in the conduct of its business pursuant to its franchise.<br><br>According to respondent Province of Pangasinan, however, "the phrase 'exclusive (of this) franchise' in the legislative franchise of Petitioner Digitel did not specifically or categorically express that such franchise grant intended to provide privilege to the extent of impliedly repealing Republic Act No. 7160."<br><br>Thus, the question is, whether or not petitioner DIGITEL's real properties located within the territorial jurisdiction of respondent Province of Pangasinan are exempt from real property taxes by virtue of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7678.<br><br>We rule in the affirmative. However, it is with the <span style="font-style: italic;">caveat</span> that such exemption solely applies to those real properties <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">actually, directly and exclusively used by the grantee in its franchise.</span><br><br>The present issue actually boils down to a dispute between the inherent taxing power of Congress and the delegated authority to tax of the local government borne by the 1987 Constitution. In the afore-quoted case of <span style="font-style: italic;">PLDT v. City of Davao</span>, we already sustained the power of Congress to grant exemptions over and above the power of the local government's delegated taxing authority notwithstanding the source of such power. &nbsp;And fairly recently, in the case of <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The City Government of Quezon City v. Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> we again had the opportunity to echo the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> of Mr. Justice Vicente V. Mendoza that:<br><blockquote>Indeed, <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">the grant of taxing powers to local government units under the Constitution and the LGC does not affect the power of Congress to grant exemptions to certain persons, pursuant to a declared national policy</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span> The legal effect of the constitutional grant to local governments simply means that in interpreting statutory provisions on municipal taxing powers, doubts must be resolved in favor of municipal corporations. [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Succinctly put, had the Congress of the Philippines intended to tax each and every real property of petitioner DIGITEL, regardless of whether or not it is used in the business or operation of its franchise, it would not have incorporated a qualifying phrase, which such manifestation admittedly is.&nbsp; And, to our minds, "the issue in this case no longer dwells on whether Congress has the power to exempt"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> petitioner DIGITEL's properties from realty taxes by its enactment of Republic Act No. 7678 which contains the phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">"exclusive of this franchise,"</span> in the face of the mandate of the Local Government Code. The more pertinent issue to consider is whether or not, by passing Republic Act No. 7678, Congress intended to exempt petitioner DIGITEL's real properties actually, directly and exclusively used by the grantee in its franchise.<br><br>The fact that Republic Act No. 7678 was a later piece of legislation can be taken to mean that Congress, knowing fully well that the Local Government Code had already withdrawn exemptions from real property taxes, chose to restore such immunity even to a limited degree. &nbsp;Accordingly:<br><blockquote>The Court views this subsequent piece of legislation as an express and real intention on the part of Congress to once again remove from the LGC's delegated taxing power, all of the franchisee's x x x properties that are actually, directly and exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>In view of the unequivocal intent of Congress to exempt from real property tax those real properties actually, directly and exclusively used by petitioner DIGITEL in the pursuit of its franchise, respondent Province of Pangasinan can only levy real property tax on the remaining real properties of the grantee located within its territorial jurisdiction not part of the above-stated classification. &nbsp;Said exemption, however, merely applies from the time of the effectivity of petitioner DIGITEL's legislative franchise and not a moment sooner.<br><br>In fine, petitioner DIGITEL is found accountable to respondent Province of Pangasinan for the following tax liabilities: 1) as to provincial franchise tax, from 13 November 1992 until actually paid; and 2) as to real property tax, for the period starting from 13 November 1992 until 28 December 1992, it shall be imposed only on the lands and buildings of petitioner DIGITEL located within the subject jurisdiction; for the period commencing from 29 December 1992 until 16 February 1994, in addition to the lands and buildings aforementioned, it shall similarly be imposed on machineries and other improvements;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and, by virtue of the National Franchise of petitioner DIGITEL or Republic Act No. 7678, in accordance with the Court's ruling in the abovementioned <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayantel </span>case, from the date of effectivity on 17 February 1994 until the present, it shall be imposed only on real properties <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> actually, directly and exclusively used in the franchise of petitioner DIGITEL. &nbsp;In addition to the foregoing summary, pertinent provisions of law respecting interests, penalties and surcharges shall also be made to apply to herein subject tax liabilities.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
