He ignored the comments of the two. When he arrived at his boarding house, he mentioned the remarks to his two other brods while watching television. These two brods had earlier finished eating their dinner at Manang’s. Then, the three, together with four other persons went back to Manang’s and confronted the two who were still in the restaurant.  By admission of respondent Bungubung in his testimony, one of the two was a member of the Tau Gamma Phi Fraternity.  There was no rumble or physical violence then.<br><br>After this incident, a meeting was conducted between the two heads of the fraternity through the intercession of the Student Council.  The Tau Gamma Phi Fraternity was asking for an apology.  “<i>Kailangan ng</i> apology” in the words of respondent Aguilar.  But no apology was made.<br><br>Then, 5 members of the Tau Gamma Phi Fraternity went to the <i>tambayan</i> of the Domino Lux Fraternity in the campus.  Among them were respondents Bungubung, Reverente and Papio.  They were looking for a person whose description matched James Yap.  According to them, this person supposedly “<i>nambastos ng brod</i>.”  As they could not find Mr. Yap, one of them remarked “<i>Paano ba iyan.  Pasensiya na lang.</i>”<br><br>Came March 29, 1995 and the following events.<br><br>Ten minutes before his next class at 6:00 p.m., Mr. James Yap went out of the campus using the Engineering Gate to buy candies across Taft Avenue.  As he was about to re-cross Taft Avenue, he heard heavy footsteps at his back.  Eight to ten guys were running towards him.  He panicked.  He did not know what to do.  Then, respondent Bungubung punched him in the head with something heavy in his hands – “<i>parang</i> knuckles.”  Respondents Reverente and Lee were behind Yap, punching him.  Respondents Bungubung and Valdes who were in front of him, were also punching him.  As he was lying on the street, respondent Aguilar kicked him.  People shouted; guards arrived; and the group of attackers left.<br><br>Mr. Yap could not recognize the other members of the group who attacked him.  With respect to respondent Papio, Mr. Yap said “<i>hindi ko nakita ang mukha niya, hindi ko nakita sumuntok siya.</i>”  What Mr. Yap saw was a long haired guy also running with the group.<br><br>Two guards escorted Mr. Yap inside the campus.  At this point, Mr. Dennis Pascual was at the Engineering Gate. Mr. Pascual accompanied Yap to the university clinic; reported the incident to the Discipline Office; and informed his fraternity brods at their <i>tambayan</i>.  According to Mr. Pascual, their head of the Domino Lux Fraternity said: “<i>Walang gagalaw.  Uwian na lang.</i>”<br><br>Mr. Ericson Cano, who was supposed to hitch a ride with Dennis Pascual, saw him under the clock in Miguel Building.  However, they did not proceed directly for home.  With a certain Michael Perez, they went towards the direction of Dagonoy Street because Mr. Pascual was supposed to pick up a book for his friend from another friend who lives somewhere in the area.<br><br>As they were along Dagonoy Street, and before they could pass the Kolehiyo ng Malate Restaurant, Mr. Cano first saw several guys inside the restaurant.  He said not to mind them and just keep on walking.  However, the group got out of the restaurant, among them respondents Reverente, Lee and Valdes.  Mr. Cano told Mr. Lee: “<i>Ayaw namin ng gulo</i>.”  But, respondent Lee hit Mr. Cano without provocation.  Respondent Reverente kicked Mr. Pascual and respondent Lee also hit Mr. Pascual.  Mr. Cano and Mr. Perez managed to run from the mauling and they were chased by respondent Lee and two others.<br><br>Mr. Pascual was left behind. After respondent Reverente first kicked him, Mr. Pascual was ganged-upon by the rest.  He was able to run, but the group was able to catch up with him.  His shirt was torn and he was hit at the back of his head with a lead pipe.  Respondent Lee who was chasing Cano and Perez, then returned to Mr. Pascual.<br><br>Mr. Pascual identified respondents Reverente and Lee, as among those who hit him.  Although Mr. Pascual did not see respondent Valdes hit him, he identified respondent Valdez (sic) as also one of the members of the group.<br><br>In fact, Mr. Cano saw respondent Valdes near Mr. Pascual.  He was almost near the corner of Leon Guinto and Estrada; while respondent Pascual who managed to run was stopped at the end of Dagonoy along Leon Guinto. Respondent Valdes shouted: “<i>Mga putang-ina niyo</i>.” Respondent Reverente hit Mr. Pascual for the last time.  Apparently being satisfied with their handiwork, the group left.  The victims, Cano, Perez and Pascual proceeded to a friend’s house and waited for almost two hours, or at around 8:00 in the evening before they returned to the campus to have their wounds treated.  Apparently, there were three cars roaming the vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The mauling incidents were a result of a fraternity war.  The victims, namely: petitioner James Yap and Dennis Pascual, Ericson Cano, and Michael Perez, are members of the “Domino Lux Fraternity,” while the alleged assailants, private respondents Alvin Aguilar, James Paul Bungubung, Richard Reverente and Roberto Valdes, Jr. are members of “Tau Gamma Phi Fraternity,” a rival fraternity.<br><br>The next day, March 30, 1995, petitioner Yap lodged a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> with the Discipline Board of DLSU charging private respondents with “direct assault.”  Similar complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> were also filed by Dennis Pascual and Ericson Cano against Alvin Lee and private respondents Valdes and Reverente.  Thus, cases entitled “<i>De La Salle University and College of St. Benilde v. Alvin Aguilar (AB-BSM/9152105), James Paul Bungubung (AB-PSM/9234403), Robert R. Valdes, Jr. (BS-BS-APM/9235086), Alvin Lee (EDD/9462325), Richard Reverente (AB-MGT/9153837) and Malvin A. Papio (AB-MGT/9251227)</i>” were docketed as Discipline Case No. 9495-3-25121.<br><br>The Director of the DLSU Discipline Office sent separate notices to private respondents Aguilar, Bungubung and Valdes, Jr. and Reverente informing them of the complaints and requiring them to answer. Private respondents filed their respective answers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>As it appeared that students from DLSU and CSB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> were involved in the mauling incidents, a joint DLSU-CSB Discipline Board<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was formed to investigate the incidents.  Thus, petitioner Board Chairman Emmanuel Sales sent notices of hearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to private respondents on April 12, 1995.  Said notices uniformly stated as follows:<br><blockquote>Please be informed that a joint and expanded Discipline Board had been constituted to hear and deliberate the charge against you for violation of CHED Order No. 4 arising from the written complaints of James Yap, Dennis C. Pascual, and Ericson Y. Cano.<br><br>You are directed to appear at the hearing of the Board scheduled on April 19, 1995 at 9:00 a.m. at the Bro. Connon Hall for you and your witnesses to give testimony and present evidence in your behalf.  You may be assisted by a lawyer when you give your testimony or those of your witnesses.<br><br>On or before April 18, 1995, you are further directed to provide the Board, through the Discipline Office, with a list of your witnesses as well as the sworn statement of their proposed testimony.<br><br>Your failure to appear at the scheduled hearing or your failure to submit the list of witnesses and the sworn statement of their proposed testimony will be considered a waiver on your part to present evidence and as an admission of the principal act complained of.<br><br>For your strict compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>During the proceedings before the Board on April 19 and 28, 1995, private respondents interposed the common defense of alibi, summarized by the DLSU-CSB Joint Discipline Board as follows:<br><blockquote>First, in the case of respondent Bungubung, March 29, 1995 was one of the few instances when he was picked-up by a driver, a certain Romeo S. Carillo.  Most of the time, respondent Bungubung goes home alone sans driver.  But on this particular date, respondent Bungubung said that his dad asked his permission to use the car and thus, his dad instructed this driver Carillo to pick-up his son.  Mr. Carillo is not a family driver, but works from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. for the Philippine Ports Authority where the elder Bungubung is also employed.<br><br>Thus, attempting to corroborate the alibi of respondent Bungubung, Mr. Carillo said that he arrived at La Salle at 4:56 p.m.; picked-up respondent at 5:02 p.m.; took the Roxas Blvd. route towards respondent’s house in BF Parañaque (on a Wednesday in Baclaran); and arrived at the house at 6:15 p.m.  Respondent Bungubung was dropped-off in his house, and taking the same route back, Mr. Carillo arrived at the South Harbor at 6:55 p.m. the Philippine Ports Authority is located at the South Harbor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]<br><br></sup><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Secondly, respondent Valdes said that he was with his friends at McDonald’s Taft just before 6:00 p.m. of March 29, 1995.  He said that he left McDonald at 5:50 p.m. together to get some medicine at the university clinic for his throat irritation.  He said that he was at the clinic at 5:52 p.m. and went back to McDonald, all within a span of 3 or even 4 minutes.<br><br>Two witnesses, a certain Sharon Sia and the girlfriend of respondent Valdes, a certain Jorgette Aquino, attempted to corroborate Valdez’ alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><center><br>x x x x<br></center><br>Third, respondent Reverente told that (<i>sic</i>) the Board that he was at his home at 5:00 p.m. of March 29, 1995.  He said that he was given the responsibility to be the paymaster of the construction workers who were doing some works in the apartment of his parents.  Although he had classes in the evening, the workers according to him would wait for him sometimes up to 9:00 p.m. when he arrives from his classes.  The workers get paid everyday.<br><br>Respondent Reverente submitted an affidavit, unsigned by the workers listed there, supposedly attesting to the fact that he paid the workers at the date and time in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]<br><br></sup><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Fourth, respondent Aguilar “solemnly sw[ore] that [he] left DLSU at 5:00 p.m. for Camp Crame for a meeting with some of the officers that we were preparing.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>On May 3, 1995, the DLSU-CSB Joint Discipline Board issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> finding private respondents guilty.  They were meted the supreme penalty of automatic expulsion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> pursuant to CHED Order No. 4.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  The dispositive part of the resolution reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, considering all the foregoing, the Board finds respondents ALVIN AGUILAR (AB-BSM/9152105), JAMES PAUL BUNGUBUNG (AB-PSM/9234403), ALVIN LEE (EDD/94623250) and RICHARD V. REVERENTE (AB-MGT/9153837) guilty of having violated CHED Order No. 4 and thereby orders their automatic expulsion.<br><br>In the case of respondent MALVIN A. PAPIO (AB-MGT/9251227), the Board acquits him of the charge.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Private respondents separately moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> before the Office of the Senior Vice-President for Internal Operations of DLSU.  The motions were all denied in a Letter-Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated June 1, 1995.<br><br>On June 5, 1995, private respondent Aguilar filed with the RTC, Manila, against petitioners a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and injunction under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with prayer for temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or writ of preliminary injunction.  It was docketed as Civil Case No. 95-74122 and assigned to respondent Judge of Branch 36.  The petition essentially sought to annul the May 3, 1995 Resolution of the DLSU-CSB Joint Discipline Board and the June 1, 1995 Letter-Resolution of the Office of the Senior Vice-President for Internal Affairs.<br><br>The following day, June 6, 1995, respondent Judge issued a TRO<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> directing DLSU, its subordinates, agents, representatives and/or other persons acting for and in its behalf to refrain and desist from implementing Resolution dated May 3, 1995 and Letter-Resolution dated June 1, 1995 and to immediately desist from barring the enrollment of Aguilar for the second term of school year (SY) 1995.<br><br>Subsequently, private respondent Aguilar filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion to amend his petition to correct an allegation in paragraph 3.21<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of his original petition.

Respondent Judge also issued corresponding temporary restraining orders to compel petitioner DLSU to admit said private respondents.<br><br>On June 19, 1995, petitioner Sales filed a motion to dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> in behalf of all petitioners, except James Yap.  On June 20, 1995, petitioners filed a supplemental motion to dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the petitions-in-intervention.<br><br>On September 20, 1995, respondent Judge issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> denying petitioners’ (respondents there) motion to dismiss and its supplement, and granted private respondents’ (petitioners there) prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction.  The pertinent part of the Order reads:<br><blockquote>For this purpose, respondent, its agents, representatives or any and all other persons acting for and in its behalf is/are restrained and enjoined from –<br><ol><li>Implementing and enforcing the Resolution dated May 3, 1995 ordering the automatic expulsion of petitioner and the petitioners-in-intervention from the De La Salle University and the letter-resolution dated June 1, 1995, affirming the Resolution dated May 3, 1995; and<br><br></li><li>Barring the enrolment of petitioner and petitioners-in-intervention in the courses offered at respondent De La Salle University and to immediately allow them to enroll and complete their respective courses/degrees until their graduation thereat in accordance with the standards set by the latter.<br></li></ol>WHEREFORE, the ancillary remedy prayed for is granted.

In view of the refusal of petitioner DLSU to enroll private respondent Aguilar, CHED wrote a letter dated June 26, 1996 addressed to petitioner Quebengco requesting that private respondent Aguilar be allowed to continue attending his classes pending the resolution of its motion for reconsideration of Resolution No. 181-96.

No. 7722 did not transfer to the CHED the DECS’ power of supervision/review over expulsion cases involving institutions of higher learning.  They say that unlike B.P. Blg. 232, R.A. No. 7722 makes no reference to the right and duty of learning institutions to develop moral character and instill discipline among its students.  The clear concern of R.A. No. 7722 in the creation of the CHED was academic, i.e., the formulation, recommendation, setting, and development of academic plans, programs and standards for institutions of higher learning.  The enumeration of CHED’s powers and functions under Section 8 does not include supervisory/review powers in student disciplinary cases.  The reference in Section 3 to CHED’s “coverage” of institutions of higher education is limited to the powers and functions specified in Section 8.  The Bureau of Higher Education, which the CHED has replaced and whose functions and responsibilities it has taken over, never had any authority over student disciplinary cases.<br><br>We cannot agree.<br><br>On May 18, 1994, Congress approved R.A. No. 7722, otherwise known as “An Act Creating the Commission on Higher Education, Appropriating Funds Thereof and for other purposes.”<br><br>Section 3 of the said law, which paved the way for the creation of the CHED, provides:<br><blockquote>Section 3.  <i>Creation of the Commission on Higher Education</i>. – In pursuance of the abovementioned policies, the Commission on Higher Education is hereby created, hereinafter referred to as Commission.<br><br>The Commission shall be independent and separate from the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) and attached to the office of the President for administrative purposes only.

No. 7722 did not transfer to the CHED the DECS’ power of supervision/review over expulsion cases involving institutions of higher learning.<br><br><b>First</b>, the foregoing provisions are <b><i>all-embracing</i></b>.  They make no reservations of powers to the DECS insofar as institutions of higher learning are concerned.  They show that the authority and supervision over all public and private institutions of higher education, as well as degree-granting programs in all post-secondary educational institutions, public and private, belong to the CHED, not the DECS.<br><br><b>Second</b>, to rule that it is the DECS which has authority to decide disciplinary cases involving students on the tertiary level would <b><i>render nugatory</i></b> the coverage of the CHED, which is “both public and private institutions of higher education as well as degree granting programs in all post secondary educational institutions, public and private.”  That would be absurd.<br><br>It is of public knowledge that petitioner DLSU is a private educational institution which offers tertiary degree programs.  Hence, it is under the CHED authority.<br><br><b>Third</b>, the policy of R.A. No. 7722<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> is <b><i>not only</i></b> the protection, fostering and promotion of the right of all citizens to affordable quality education at all levels and the taking of appropriate steps to ensure that education shall be accessible to all.  The law is <b><i>likewise</i></b> concerned with ensuring and protecting academic freedom and with promoting its exercise and observance for the continued intellectual growth of students, the advancement of learning and research, the development of responsible and effective leadership, the education of high-level and middle-level professionals, and the enrichment of our historical and cultural heritage.<br><br>It is thus safe to assume that when Congress passed R.A. No. 7722, its members were aware that disciplinary cases involving students on the tertiary level would continue to arise in the future, which would call for the invocation and exercise of institutions of higher learning of their right to academic freedom.<br><br><b>Fourth</b>, petitioner DLSU cited no authority in its bare claim that the Bureau of Higher Education, which CHED replaced, never had authority over student disciplinary cases. In fact, the responsibilities of other government entities having functions similar to those of the CHED <b><i>were transferred</i></b> to the CHED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Section 77 of the MRPS<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> on the process of review in student discipline cases should therefore be <b><i>read in conjunction</i></b> with the provisions of R.A.
