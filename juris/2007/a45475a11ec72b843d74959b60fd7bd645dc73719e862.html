Bago-Viga road, with the length of 79.818 kilometers, in the island province of Catanduanes.<br><br>The CP I project is one of the four packages comprising the project for the improvement/rehabilitation of the Catanduanes Circumferential Road, covering a total length of about 204.515 kilometers, which is the main highway in Catanduanes Province. The road section (Catanduanes Circumferential Road) is part of the Arterial Road Links Development Project (Phase IV) funded under Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 dated December 28, 1999 between the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Background</span><br></div><br>Based on the Exchange of Notes dated December 27, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Government of Japan and the Government of the Philippines, through their respective representatives, namely, Mr. Yoshihisa Ara, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Republic of the Philippines, and then Secretary of Foreign Affairs Domingo L.

These loans were aimed at promoting our country’s economic stabilization and development efforts.<br><br>The Exchange of Notes consisted of two documents: (1) a Letter from the Government of Japan, signed by Ambassador Ara, addressed to then Secretary of Foreign Affairs Siazon, confirming the understanding reached between the two governments concerning the loans to be extended by the Government of Japan to the Philippines; and (2) a document denominated as Records of Discussion where the salient terms of the loans as set forth by the Government of Japan, through the Japanese delegation, were reiterated and the said terms were accepted by the Philippine delegation.

Petitioner PMA ’59 Foundation, Inc., on the other hand, is a non-stock, non-profit corporation organized under the existing Philippine laws. It claims that its members are all taxpayers and alumni of the Philippine Military Academy. It is represented by its President, Carlos L. Agustin.<br><br>Named as public respondents are the DPWH, as the government agency tasked with the implementation of government infrastructure projects; the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) as the government agency that authorizes the release and disbursement of public funds for the implementation of government infrastructure projects; and the Department of Finance (DOF) as the government agency that acts as the custodian and manager of all financial resources of the government.

They claim that as taxpayers and concerned citizens, they have the right and duty to question the expenditure of public funds on illegal acts. They point out that the Philippine Government allocates a peso-counterpart for CP I, which amount is appropriated by Congress in the General Appropriations Act; hence, funds that are being utilized in the implementation of the questioned project also partake &nbsp;of taxpayers’ money. The present action, as a taxpayers’ suit, is thus allegedly proper.<br><br>They likewise characterize the instant petition as one of transcendental importance that warrants the Court’s adoption of a liberal stance on the issue of standing. It cited several cases where the Court brushed aside procedural technicalities in order to resolve issues involving paramount public interest and transcendental importance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Further, petitioner Abaya asserts that he possesses the requisite standing as a former member of the House of Representatives and one of the principal authors of Republic Act No. 9184 (RA 9184)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, the law allegedly violated by the public respondents.<br><br>On the substantive issues, the petitioners anchor the instant petition on the contention that the award of the contract to private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation violates RA 9184, particularly Section 31 thereof which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 31. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceiling for Bid Prices</span>. – The ABC shall be the upper limit or ceiling for the Bid prices. Bid prices that exceed this ceiling shall be disqualified outright from further participating in the bidding. There shall be no lower limit to the amount of the award.<br></blockquote>In relation thereto, the petitioners cite the definition of the ABC, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Definition of Terms.</span> –<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>(a) <span style="font-style: italic;">Approved Budget for the Contract (ABC)</span>. – refers to the budget for the contract duly approved by the Head of the Procuring Entity, as provided for in the General Appropriations Act and/or continuing appropriations, in the case of National Government Agencies; the Corporate Budget for the contract approved by the governing Boards, pursuant to E.O. No. 518, series of 1979, in the case of Government-Owned and/or Controlled Corporations, Government Financial Institutions and State Universities and Colleges; and the Budget for the contract approved by the respective Sanggunian, in the case of Local Government Units.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>The petitioners theorize that the foregoing provisions show the mandatory character of ceilings or upper limits of every bid. Under the above-quoted provisions of RA 9184, all bids or awards should not exceed the ceilings or upper limits; otherwise, the contract is deemed void and inexistent.<br><br>Resolution No. PJHL-A-04-012 was allegedly issued with grave abuse of discretion because it recommended the award of the contract to private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation whose bid was more than P200 million overpriced based on the ABC. As such, the award is allegedly illegal and unconscionable.<br><br>In this connection, the petitioners opine that the contract subsequently entered into by and between the DPWH and private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation is void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> for being prohibited by RA 9184. They stress that Section 31 thereof expressly provides that “bid prices that exceed this ceiling shall be disqualified outright from participating in the bidding.” The upper limit or ceiling is called the ABC and since the bid of private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation exceeded the ABC for the CP I project, it should have been allegedly disqualified from the bidding process and should not, by law, have been awarded the said contract. They invoke Article 1409 of the Civil Code:<br><blockquote>ART. 1409. The following contracts are inexistent and void from the beginning:<br><br>(1) Those whose cause, object or purpose is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy;<br>(2) Those which are absolutely simulated or fictitious;<br>(3) Those whose cause or object did not exist at the time of the transaction;<br>(4) Those whose object is outside the commerce of men;<br>(5) Those which contemplate an impossible service;<br>(6) Those where the intention of the parties relative to the principal object of the contract cannot be ascertained;<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">(7) Those expressly prohibited or declared void by law.</span><br></blockquote>For violating the above provision, the contract between the DPWH and private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation is allegedly inexistent and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> and can produce no effects whatsoever.<br><br>It is the contention of the petitioners that RA 9184 is applicable to both local- and foreign-funded procurement contracts. They cite the following excerpt of the deliberations of the Bicameral Conference Committee on the Disagreeing Provisions of Senate Bill No. 2248 and House Bill No. 4809:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><blockquote>REP. ABAYA. Mr. Chairman, can we just propose additional amendments? Can we go back to Section 4, Mr. Chairman?<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN. ANGARA). Section? Section ano, Del, 4?

It should read as follows: “This Act shall apply to the procurement of goods, supplies and materials, infrastructure projects and consulting services regardless of funding source whether local or foreign by the government.”<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN (SEN.

Medyo nga problematic ‘yan eh. Now, just for the record Del, can you repeat again the justification for including foreign funded contracts within the scope para malinaw because the World Bank daw might raise some objection to it.<br><br>REP. ABAYA. Well, Mr. Chairman, we should include foreign funded projects kasi these are the big projects. To give an example, if you allow bids above government estimate, let’s say take the case of 500 million project, included in that 500 million is the 20 percent profit. If you allow them to bid above government estimate, they will add another say 28 percent of (sic) 30 percent, 30 percent of 500 million is another 150 million. Ito, this is a rich source of graft money, aregluhan na lang, 150 million, five contractors will gather, “O eto 20 million, 20 million, 20 million.” So, it is rigged. ‘Yun ang practice na nangyayari. If we eliminate that, if we have a ceiling then, it will not be very tempting kasi walang extra money na pwedeng ibigay sa ibang contractor. So this promote (sic) collusion among bidders, of course, with the cooperation of irresponsible officials of some agencies. So we should have a ceiling to include foreign funded projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners insist that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 between the JBIC and the Philippine Government is neither a treaty, an international nor an executive agreement that would bar the application of RA 9184. They point out that to be considered a treaty, an international or an executive agreement, the parties must be two sovereigns or States whereas in the case of Loan Agreement No. PH-P204, the parties are the Philippine Government and the JBIC, a banking agency of Japan, which has a separate juridical personality from the Japanese Government.<br><br>They further insist on the applicability of RA 9184 contending that while it took effect on January 26, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 was executed prior thereto or on December 28, 1999, the actual procurement or award of the contract to private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation was done after the effectivity of RA 9184. The said law is allegedly specific as to its application, which is on the actual procurement of infrastructure and other projects only, and not on the loan agreements attached to such projects. Thus, the petition only prays for the annulment of Resolution No. PJHL-A-04-012 as well as the contract between the DPWH and private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation. The petitioners clarify that they do not pray for the annulment of Loan Agreement No. PH-P204. Since the subject procurement and award of the contract were done after the effectivity of RA 9184, necessarily, the procurement rules established by that law allegedly apply, and not Presidential Decree No. 1594 (PD 1594)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and Executive Order No. 40 (EO 40), series of 2001, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> as contended by the respondents. The latter laws, including their implementing rules, have allegedly been repealed by RA 9184. Even RA 4860, as amended, known as the Foreign Borrowings Act, the petitioners posit, may have also been repealed or modified by RA 9184 insofar as its provisions are inconsistent with the latter.<br><br>The petitioners also argue that the “Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184, Otherwise Known as the Government Procurement Reform Act, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part A</span>” (IRR-A) cited by the respondents is not applicable as these rules only govern domestically-funded procurement contracts. They aver that the implementing rules to govern foreign-funded procurement, as in the present case, have yet to be drafted and in fact, there are concurrent resolutions drafted by both houses of Congress for the Reconvening of the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee for the formulation of the IRR for foreign-funded procurements under RA 9184.<br><br>The petitioners maintain that disbursement of public funds to implement a patently void and illegal contract is itself illegal and must be enjoined. They bring to the Court’s attention the fact that the works on the CP I project have already commenced as early as October 2004. They thus urge the Court to issue a writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> to set aside Resolution No. PJHL-A-04-012 as well as to declare null and void the contract entered into between the DPWH and private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation. They also pray for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and, eventually, a writ of prohibition to permanently enjoin the DPWH from implementing Resolution No. PJHL-A-04-012 and its contract with private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation as well as the DBM from disbursing funds for the said purpose.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Respondents’ Counter-Arguments</span><br></div><br>The public respondents, namely the DPWH, DBM and DOF, and their respective named officials, through the Office of the Solicitor General, urge the Court to dismiss the petition on grounds that the petitioners have no <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi</span> and, in any case, Resolution No. PJHL-A-04-012 and the contract between the DPWH and private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation are valid.<br><br>According to the public respondents, a taxpayer’s <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi </span>was recognized in the following cases: (a) where a tax measure is assailed as unconstitutional;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (b) where there is a question of validity of election laws;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (c) where legislators questioned the validity of any official action upon the claim that it infringes on their prerogatives as legislators;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (d) where there is a claim of illegal disbursement or wastage of public funds through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (e) where it involves the right of members of the Senate or House of Representatives to question the validity of a presidential veto or condition imposed on an item in an appropriation bill;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> or (f) where it involves an invalid law, which when enforced will put the petitioner in imminent danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result thereof, or that he has been or is about to be denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> None of the above considerations allegedly obtains in the present case.<br><br>It is also the view of the public respondents that the fact that petitioner Abaya was a former lawmaker would not suffice to confer <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi</span> on himself. Members of Congress may properly challenge the validity of an official act of any department of the government only upon showing that the assailed official act affects or impairs their rights and prerogatives as legislators.<br><br>The public respondents further assail the standing of the petitioners to file the instant suit claiming that they failed to allege any specific injury suffered nor an interest that is direct and personal to them. If at all, the interest or injuries claimed by the petitioners are allegedly merely of a general interest common to all members of the public. Their interest is allegedly too vague, highly speculative and uncertain to satisfy the requirements of <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi.</span><br><br>The public respondents find it noteworthy that the petitioners do not raise issues of constitutionality but only of contract law, which the petitioners not being privies to the agreement cannot raise. This is following the principle that a stranger to a contract cannot sue either or both the contracting parties to annul and set aside the same except when he is prejudiced on his rights and can show detriment which would positively result to him from the implementation of the contract in which he has no intervention. There being no particularized interest or elemental substantial injury necessary to confer <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi,</span> the public respondents implore the Court to dismiss the petition.<br><br>On the merits, the public respondents maintain that the imposition of ceilings or upper limits on bid prices in RA 9184 does not apply because the CP I project and the entire Catanduanes Circumferential Road Improvement Project, financed by Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 executed between the Philippine Government and the JBIC, is governed by the latter’s Procurement Guidelines which precludes the imposition of ceilings on bid prices. Section 5.06 of the JBIC Procurement Guidelines reads:<br><blockquote>Section 5.06. Evaluation and Comparison of Bids.<br><br>x x x<br><br>(e) Any procedure under which bids above or below a predetermined bid value assessment are automatically disqualified is not permitted.<br></blockquote>It was explained that other foreign banks such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank (WB) similarly prohibit the bracketing or imposition of a ceiling on bid prices.<br><br>The public respondents stress that it was pursuant to Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 that the assailed Resolution No. PJHL-A-04-012 and the subsequent contract between the DPWH and private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation materialized. They likewise aver that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 is governed by RA 4860, as amended, or the Foreign Borrowings Act. Section 4 thereof states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. In the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness under this Act, the President of the Philippines may, when necessary, agree to waive or modify, the application of any law granting preferences or imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding, including among others [Act No. 4239, Commonwealth Act No. 138], the provisions of [CA 541], insofar as such provisions do not pertain to constructions primarily for national defense or security purposes, [RA 5183]; <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however,</span> That as far as practicable, utilization of the services of qualified domestic firms in the prosecution of projects financed under this Act shall be encouraged: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, further,</span> That in case where international competitive bidding shall be conducted preference of at least fifteen <span style="font-style: italic;">per centum</span> shall be granted in favor of articles, materials or supplies of the growth, production or manufacture of the Philippines: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, finally</span>, That the method and procedure in comparison of bids shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution.<br></blockquote>DOJ Opinion No. 46, Series of 1987, is relied upon by the public respondents as it opined that an agreement for the exclusion of foreign assisted projects from the coverage of local bidding regulations does not contravene existing legislations because the statutory basis for foreign loan agreements is RA 4860, as amended, and under Section 4 thereof, the President is empowered to waive the application of any law imposing restrictions on the procurement of goods and services pursuant to such loans.<br><br>Memorandum Circular Nos. 104 and 108, issued by the President, to clarify RA 4860, as amended, and PD 1594, relative to the award of foreign-assisted projects, are also invoked by the public respondents, to wit:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Memorandum Circular No. 104:</span><br><br>In view of the provisions of Section 4 of Republic Act No. 4860, as amended, otherwise known as the “Foreign Borrowings Act”<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><blockquote>It is hereby clarified that foreign-assisted infrastructure projects may be exempted from the application for the pertinent provisions of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Presidential Decree (P.D.)

It is pointed out by the public respondents that executive agreements are essentially contracts governing the rights and obligations of the parties. A contract, being the law between the parties, must be faithfully adhered to by them. Guided by the fundamental rule of <span style="font-style: italic;">pacta sunt servanda,</span> the Philippine Government bound itself to perform in good faith its duties and obligations under Loan Agreement No. PH-P204.<br><br>The public respondents further argue against the applicability of RA 9184 stating that it was signed into law on January 10, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> On the other hand, Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 was executed on December 28, 1999, where the laws then in force on government procurements were PD 1594 and EO 40. The latter law (EO 40), in particular, excluded from its application “any existing and future government commitments with respect to the bidding and award of contracts financed partly or wholly with funds from international financing institutions as well as from bilateral and other similar foreign sources.”<br><br>The applicability of EO 40, not RA 9184, is allegedly bolstered by the fact that the “Invitation to Prequalify and to Bid” for the implementation of the CP I project was published in two leading national newspapers, namely, the Manila Times and Manila Standard on November 22, 29 and December 5, 2002, or before the signing into law of RA 9184 on January 10, 2003. In this connection, the public respondents point to Section 77 of IRR-A, which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 77. <span style="font-style: italic;">Transitory Clause. –</span><br><br>In all procurement activities, if the advertisement or invitation for bids was issued prior to the effectivity of the Act, the provisions of EO 40 and its IRR, PD 1594 and its IRR, RA 7160 and its IRR, or other applicable laws as the case may be, shall govern.<br><br>In cases where the advertisements or invitations for bids were issued after the effectivity of the Act but before the effectivity of this IRR-A, procuring entities may continue adopting the procurement procedures, rules and regulations provided in EO 40 and its IRR, or other applicable laws, as the case may be.<br></blockquote>Section 4 of RA 9184 is also invoked by the public respondents as it provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Scope and Applications.</span> – This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or –controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed</span>.<br></blockquote>It is also the position of the public respondents that even granting <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 were an ordinary loan contract, still, RA 9184 is inapplicable under the non-impairment clause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of the Constitution.

Further, Section 5.06 of the JBIC Procurement Guidelines categorically provides that “[a]ny procedure under which bids above or below a predetermined bid value assessment are automatically disqualified is not permitted.”<br><br>The public respondents explain that since the contract is the law between the parties and Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 states that the JBIC Procurement Guidelines shall govern the parties’ relationship and further dictates that there be no ceiling price for the bidding, it naturally follows that any subsequent law passed contrary to the letters of the said contract would have no effect with respect to the parties’ rights and obligations arising therefrom.<br><br>To insist on the application of RA 9184 on the bidding for the CP I project would, notwithstanding the terms and conditions of Loan Agreement No. PH-P204, allegedly violate the constitutional provision on non-impairment of obligations and contracts, and destroy vested rights duly acquired under the said loan agreement.<br><br>Lastly, the public respondents deny that there was illegal disbursement of public funds by the DBM. They asseverate that all the releases made by the DBM for the implementation of the entire Arterial Road Links Project – Phase IV, which includes the Catanduanes Circumferential Road Improvement Project, were covered by the necessary appropriations made by law, specifically the General Appropriations Act (GAA). Further, the requirements and procedures prescribed for the release of the said funds were duly complied with.<br><br>For its part, private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation similarly assails the standing of the petitioners, either as taxpayers or, in the case of petitioner Abaya, as a former lawmaker, to file the present suit. In addition, it is also alleged that, by filing the petition directly to this Court, the petitioners failed to observe the hierarchy of courts.<br><br>On the merits, private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation asserts that the applicable law to govern the bidding of the CP I project was EO 40, not RA 9184, because the former was the law governing the procurement of government projects at the time that it was bidded out. EO 40 was issued by the Office of the President on October 8, 2001 and Section 1 thereof states that:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Scope and Application.</span> This Executive Order shall apply to the procurement of: (a) goods, supplies, materials and related services; (b) civil works; and (c) consulting services, by all National Government agencies, including State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Government Financial Institutions (GFIs), hereby referred to as the ‘Agencies.’ <span style="font-weight: bold;">This Executive Order shall cover the procurement process from the pre-procurement conference up to the award of contract.</span><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>The Invitation to Prequalify and to Bid was first published on November 22, 2002. On the other hand, RA 9184 was signed into law only on January 10, 2003. Since the law in effect at the time the procurement process was initiated was EO 40, private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation submits that it should be the said law which should govern the entire procurement process relative to the CP I project.<br><br>EO 40 expressly recognizes as an exception from the application of the provisions thereof on approved budget ceilings, those projects financed by international financing institutions (IFIs) and foreign bilateral sources. Section 1 thereof, quoted in part earlier, further states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Scope and Application.</span> x x x<br><br>Nothing in this Order shall negate any existing and future government commitments with respect to the bidding and award of contracts financed partly or wholly with funds from international financing institutions as well as from bilateral and other similar foreign sources.<br></blockquote>Section 1.2 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of EO 40 is likewise invoked as it provides:<br><blockquote>For procurement financed wholly or partly from Official Development Assistance (ODA) funds from International Financing Institutions (IFIs), as well as from bilateral and other similar foreign sources, the corresponding loan/grant agreement governing said funds as negotiated and agreed upon by and between the Government and the concerned IFI shall be observed.<br></blockquote>Private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation thus postulates that following EO 40, the procurement of goods and services for the CP I project should be governed by the terms and conditions of Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 entered into between the JBIC and the Philippine Government. Pertinently, Section 5.06 of the JBIC Procurement Guidelines prohibits the setting of ceilings on bid prices.<br><br>Private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation claims that when it submitted its bid for the CP I project, it relied in good faith on the provisions of EO 40. It was allegedly on the basis of the said law that the DPWH awarded the project to private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Coporation even if its bid was higher than the ABC. Under the circumstances, RA 9184 could not be applied retroactively for to do so would allegedly impair the vested rights of private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation arising from its contract with the DPWH.<br><br>It is also contended by private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation that even assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that RA 9184 could be applied retroactively, it is still the terms of Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 which should govern the procurement of goods and services for the CP I project. It supports its theory by characterizing the said loan agreement, executed pursuant to the Exchange of Notes between the Government of Japan and the Philippine Government, as an executive agreement.<br><br>Private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation, like the public respondents, cites RA 4860 as the basis for the Exchange of Notes and Loan Agreement No. PH-P204. As an international or executive agreement, the Exchange of Notes and Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 allegedly created a legally binding obligation on the parties.<br><br>The following excerpt of the deliberations of the Bicameral Conference Committee on the Disagreeing Provision of Senate Bill No. 2248 and House Bill No. 4809 is cited by private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation to support its contention that it is the intent of the lawmakers to exclude from the application of RA 9184 those foreign-funded projects:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><blockquote>REP.

Thereafter, he issued Executive Order No. 262 (2000) amending EO 302 (1996) and EO 201 (2000).<br><br>On October 8, 2001, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued EO 40, the law mainly relied upon by the respondents, entitled Consolidating Procurement Rules and Procedures for All National Government Agencies, Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations and Government Financial Institutions, and Requiring the Use of the Government Procurement System. It accordingly repealed, amended or modified all executive issuances, orders, rules and regulations or parts thereof inconsistent therewith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 2003, President Arroyo signed into law RA 9184. It took effect on January 26, 2004, or fifteen days after its publication in two newspapers of general circulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It expressly repealed, among others, EO 40, EO 262 (2000), EO 302(1996) and PD 1594, as amended:<br><blockquote>SEC. 76. <span style="font-style: italic;">Repealing Clause.</span> —This law repeals Executive Order No. 40, series of 2001, entitled “Consolidating Procurement Rules and Procedures for All National Government Agencies, Government Owned or Controlled Corporations and/or Government Financial Institutions, and Requiring the Use of the Government Electronic Procurement System”; Executive Order No. 262, series of 1996, entitled “Amending Executive Order No. 302, series of 1996, entitled Providing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for the Procurement of Goods/Supplies by the National Government” and Section 3 of Executive Order No. 201, series of 2000, entitled “Providing Additional Policies and Guidelines in the Procurement of Goods/Supplies by the National Government”; Executive Order No. 302, series of 1996, entitled “Providing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for the Procurement of Goods/Supplies by the National Government” and Presidential Decree No. 1594 dated June 11, 1978, entitled “Prescribing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for Government Infrastructure Contracts.” This law amends Title Six, Book Two of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the “Local Government Code of 1991”; the relevant provisions of Executive Order No. 164, series of 1987, entitled “Providing Additional Guidelines in the Processing and Approval of Contracts of the National Government”; and the relevant provisions of Republic Act No. 7898 dated February 23, 1995, entitled “An Act Providing for the Modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and for Other Purposes.” Any other law, presidential decree or issuance, executive order, letter of instruction, administrative order, proclamation, charter, rule or regulation and/or parts thereof contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of this Act is hereby repealed, modified or amended accordingly.<br></blockquote>In addition to these laws, RA 4860, as amended, must be mentioned as Section 4 thereof provides that “[i]n the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness under this Act, the President of the Philippines may, when necessary, agree to waive or modify the application of any law granting preferences or imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding x x x Provided, finally, That the method and procedure in the comparison of bids shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution.”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">EO 40, not RA 9184, is applicable to the procurement</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">process undertaken for the CP I project. RA 9184</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">cannot be given retroactive application.</span><br><br>It is not disputed that with respect to the CP I project, the Invitation to Prequalify and to Bid for its implementation was published in two leading national newspapers, namely, the Manila Times and Manila Standard on November 22, 29 and December 5, 2002. At the time, the law in effect was EO 40. On the other hand, RA 9184 took effect two months later or on January 26, 2003. Further, its full implementation was even delayed as IRR-A was only approved by President Arroyo on September 18, 2003 and subsequently published on September 23, 2003 in the Manila Times and Malaya newspapers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The provisions of EO 40 apply to the procurement process pertaining to the CP I project as it is explicitly provided in Section 1 thereof that:<br><blockquote>SEC. 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Scope and Application.</span> – This Executive Order shall apply to see procurement of (a) goods, supplies, materials and related service; (b) civil works; and (c) consulting services, by all National Government agencies, including State Universities and Colleges (SUCs), Government-Owned or –Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and Government Financial Institutions (GFIs), hereby referred to as “Agencies.” <span style="font-weight: bold;">This Executive Order shall cover the procurement process from the pre-procurement conference up to the award of the contract.</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>Nothing in this Order shall negate any existing and future government commitments with respect to the bidding and award of contracts financed partly or wholly with funds from international financing institutions as well as from bilateral and similar foreign sources.<br></blockquote>The procurement process basically involves the following steps: (1) pre-procurement conference; (2) advertisement of the invitation to bid; (3) pre-bid conference; (4) eligibility check of prospective bidders; (5) submission and receipt of bids; (6) modification and withdrawal of bids; (7) bid opening and examination; (8) bid evaluation; (9) post qualification; (10) award of contract and notice to proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Clearly then, when the Invitation to Prequalify and to Bid for the implementation of the CP I project was published on November 22, 29 and December 5, 2002, the procurement process thereof had already commenced and the application of EO 40 to the procurement process for the CP I project had already attached.<br><br>RA 9184 cannot be applied retroactively to govern the procurement process relative to the CP I project because it is well settled that a law or regulation has no retroactive application unless it expressly provides for retroactivity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Indeed, Article 4 of the Civil Code is clear on the matter: “[l]aws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided.” In the absence of such categorical provision, RA 9184 will not be applied retroactively to the CP I project whose procurement process commenced even before the said law took effect.<br><br>That the legislators did not intend RA 9184 to have retroactive effect could be gleaned from the IRR-A formulated by the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee (composed of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Constitutional Amendments and Revision of Laws, and two members thereof appointed by the Senate President and the Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, and two members thereof appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives) and the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB). Section 77 of the IRR-A states, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 77. Transitory Clause<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">In all procurement activities, if the advertisement or invitation for bids was issued prior to the effectivity of the Act, the provisions of E.O. 40 and its IRR, P.D. 1594 and its IRR, R.A. 7160 and its IRR, or other applicable laws, as the case may be, shall govern.</span><br><br>In cases where the advertisements or invitations for bids were issued after the effectivity of the Act but before the effectivity of this IRR-A, procuring entities may continue adopting the procurement procedures, rules and regulations provided in E.O. 40 and its IRR, P.D. 1594 and its IRR, R.A. 7160 and its IRR, or other applicable laws, as the case may be.<br></blockquote>In other words, under IRR-A, if the advertisement of the invitation for bids was issued prior to the effectivity of RA 9184, such as in the case of the CP I project, the provisions of EO 40 and its IRR, and PD 1594 and its IRR in the case of national government agencies, and RA 7160 and its IRR in the case of local government units, shall govern.<br><br>Admittedly, IRR-A covers only fully domestically-funded procurement activities from procurement planning up to contract implementation and that it is expressly stated that IRR-B for foreign-funded procurement activities shall be subject of a subsequent issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Nonetheless, there is no reason why the policy behind Section 77 of IRR-A cannot be applied to foreign-funded procurement projects like the CP I project. Stated differently, the policy on the prospective or non-retroactive application of RA 9184 with respect to domestically-funded procurement projects cannot be any different with respect to foreign-funded procurement projects like the CP I project. It would be incongruous, even absurd, to provide for the prospective application of RA 9184 with respect to domestically-funded procurement projects and, on the other hand, as urged by the petitioners, apply RA 9184 retroactively with respect to foreign- funded procurement projects. To be sure, the lawmakers could not have intended such an absurdity.<br><br>Thus, in the light of Section 1 of EO 40, Section 77 of IRR-A, as well as the fundamental rule embodied in Article 4 of the Civil Code on prospectivity of laws, the Court holds that the procurement process for the implementation of the CP I project is governed by EO 40 and its IRR, not RA 9184.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Under EO 40, the award of the contract to private</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation is valid</span><br><br>Section 25 of EO 40 provides that “[t]he approved budget of the contract shall be the upper limit or ceiling of the bid price. Bid prices which exceed this ceiling shall be disqualified outright from further participating in the bidding. There shall be no lower limit to the amount of the award. x x x” It should be observed that this text is almost similar to the wording of Section 31 of RA 9184, relied upon by the petitioners in contending that since the bid price of private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation exceeded the ABC, then it should not have been awarded the contract for the CP I project.<br><br>Nonetheless, EO 40 expressly recognizes as an exception to its scope and application those government commitments with respect to bidding and award of contracts financed partly or wholly with funds from international financing institutions as well as from bilateral and other similar foreign sources. The pertinent portion of Section 1 of EO 40 is quoted anew:<br><blockquote>SEC.<span style="font-style: italic;"> 1. Scope and Application. – x x x</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nothing in this Order shall negate any existing and future government commitments with respect to the bidding and award of contracts financed partly or wholly with funds from international financing institutions as well as from bilateral and similar foreign sources.</span></blockquote>In relation thereto, Section 4 of RA 4860, as amended, was correctly cited by the respondents as likewise authorizing the President, in the contracting of any loan, credit or indebtedness thereunder, “when necessary, agree to waive or modify the application of any law granting preferences or imposing restrictions on international competitive bidding x x x.” The said provision of law further provides that “the method and procedure in the comparison of bids shall be the subject of agreement between the Philippine Government and the lending institution.”<br><br>Consequently, in accordance with these applicable laws, the procurement of goods and services for the CP I project is governed by the corresponding loan agreement entered into by the government and the JBIC, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, Loan Agreement No. PH-P204. The said loan agreement stipulated that the procurement of goods and services for the Arterial Road Links Development Project (Phase IV), of which CP I is a component, is to be governed by the JBIC Procurement Guidelines. Section 5.06, Part II (International Competitive Bidding) thereof quoted earlier reads:<br><blockquote>Section 5.06. Evaluation and Comparison of Bids<br><br>x x x<br><br>(e) Any procedure under which bids above or below a predetermined bid value assessment are automatically disqualified is not permitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote>It is clear that the JBIC Procurement Guidelines proscribe the imposition of ceilings on bid prices. On the other hand, it enjoins the award of the contract to the bidder whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid. The pertinent provision, quoted earlier, is reiterated, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 5.09. Award of Contract<br><br>The contract is to be awarded to the bidder whose bid has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid and who meets the appropriate standards of capability and financial resources. A bidder shall not be required as a condition of award to undertake responsibilities or work not stipulated in the specifications or to modify the bid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>Since these terms and conditions are made part of Loan Agreement No. PH-P204, the government is obliged to observe and enforce the same in the procurement of goods and services for the CP I project. As shown earlier, private respondent China Road &amp; Bridge Corporation’s bid was the lowest evaluated bid, albeit 28.95% higher than the ABC. In accordance with the JBIC Procurement Guidelines, therefore, it was correctly awarded the contract for the CP I project.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if RA 9184 were to be applied retroactively, the</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">terms of the Exchange of Notes dated December 27,</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">1999 and Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 would still</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">govern the procurement for the CP I project</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For clarity, Section 4 of RA 9184 is quoted anew, thus:</span><br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Scope and Applications</span>. – This Act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local or foreign, by all branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or –controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the subject matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is a signatory shall be observed.</span><br></blockquote>The petitioners, in order to place the procurement process undertaken for the CP I project within the ambit of RA 9184, vigorously assert that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 is neither a treaty, an international agreement nor an executive agreement. They cite Executive Order No. 459 dated November 25, 1997 where the three agreements are defined in this wise:<br><blockquote>a) International agreement – shall refer to a contract or understanding, regardless of nomenclature, entered into between the Philippines and another government in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument or in two or more related instruments.<br><br>b) Treaties – international agreements entered into by the Philippines which require legislative concurrence after executive ratification. This term may include compacts like conventions, declarations, covenants and acts.<br><br>c) Executive agreements – similar to treaties except that they do not require legislative concurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners mainly argue that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 does not fall under any of the three categories because to be any of the three, an agreement had to be one where the parties are the Philippines as a State and another State. The JBIC, the petitioners maintain, is a Japanese banking agency, which presumably has a separate juridical personality from the Japanese Government.<br><br>The petitioners’ arguments fail to persuade. The Court holds that Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 taken in conjunction with the Exchange of Notes dated December 27, 1999 between the Japanese Government and the Philippine Government is an executive agreement.<br><br>To recall, Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 was executed by and between the JBIC and the Philippine Government pursuant to the Exchange of Notes executed by and between Mr. Yoshihisa Ara, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Philippines, and then Foreign Affairs Secretary Siazon, in behalf of their respective governments. The Exchange of Notes expressed that the two governments have reached an understanding concerning Japanese loans to be extended to the Philippines and that these loans were aimed at promoting our country’s economic stabilization and development efforts.<br><br>Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 was subsequently executed and it declared that it was so entered by the parties “[i]n the light of the contents of the Exchange of Notes between the Government of Japan and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines dated December 27, 1999, concerning Japanese loans to be extended with a view to promoting the economic stabilization and development efforts of the Republic of the Philippines.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Under the circumstances, the JBIC may well be considered an adjunct of the Japanese Government. Further, Loan Agreement No. PH-P204 is indubitably an integral part of the Exchange of Notes. It forms part of the Exchange of Notes such that it cannot be properly taken independent thereof.<br><br>In this connection, it is well to understand the definition of an “exchange of notes” under international law. The term is defined in the United Nations Treaty Collection in this wise:<br><blockquote>An “exchange of notes” is a record of a routine agreement that has many similarities with the private law contract. The agreement consists of the exchange of two documents, each of the parties being in the possession of the one signed by the representative of the other. Under the usual procedure, the accepting State repeats the text of the offering State to record its assent. The signatories of the letters may be government Ministers, diplomats or departmental heads. The technique of exchange of notes is frequently resorted to, either because of its speedy procedure, or, sometimes, to avoid the process of legislative approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>It is stated that “treaties, agreements, conventions, charters, protocols, declarations, memoranda of understanding, <span style="font-style: italic;">modus vivendi</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">exchange of notes</span>” all refer to “international instruments binding at international law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It is further explained that-<br><blockquote>Although these instruments differ from each other by title, they all have common features and international law has applied basically the same rules to all these instruments. These rules are the result of long practice among the States, which have accepted them as binding norms in their mutual relations. Therefore, they are regarded as international customary law. Since there was a general desire to codify these customary rules, two international conventions were negotiated. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“1969 Vienna Convention”), which entered into force on 27 January 1980, contains rules for treaties concluded between States. The 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations (“1986 Vienna Convention”), which has still not entered into force, added rules for treaties with international organizations as parties. Both the 1969 Vienna Convention and the 1986 Vienna Convention do not distinguish between the different designations of these instruments. Instead, their rules apply to all of those instruments as long as they meet the common requirements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>Significantly, an exchange of notes is considered a form of an executive agreement, which becomes binding through executive action <span style="font-style: italic;">without </span>the need of a vote by the Senate or Congress. The following disquisition by Francis B. Sayre, former United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, entitled “The Constitutionality of Trade Agreement Acts,” quoted in <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Customs v. Eastern Sea Trading,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> is apropos:<br><blockquote>Agreements concluded by the President which fall short of treaties are commonly referred to as executive agreements and are no less common in our scheme of government than are the more formal instruments – treaties and conventions. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They sometimes take the form of exchange of notes and at other times that of more formal documents denominated “agreements” or “protocols”.</span> The point where ordinary correspondence between this and other governments ends and agreements – whether denominated executive agreements or <span style="font-weight: bold;">exchange of notes</span> or otherwise – begin, may sometimes be difficult of ready ascertainment. It would be useless to undertake to discuss here the large variety of executive agreements as such, concluded from time to time. Hundreds of executive agreements, other than those entered into under the trade-agreements act, have been negotiated with foreign governments. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>The Exchange of Notes dated December 27, 1999, stated,<span style="font-style: italic;"> inter alia,</span> that the Government of Japan would extend loans to the Philippines with a view to promoting its economic stabilization and development efforts; Loan I in the amount of Y79,8651,000,000 would be extended by the JBIC to the Philippine Government to implement the projects in the List A (including the Arterial Road Links Development Project - Phase IV); and that such loan (Loan I) would be used to cover payments to be made by the Philippine executing agencies to suppliers, contractors and/or consultants of eligible source countries under such contracts as may be entered into between them for purchases of products and/or services required for the implementation of the projects enumerated in the List A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> With respect to the procurement of the goods and services for the projects, it bears reiterating that as stipulated:<br><blockquote>3. The Government of the Republic of the Philippines will ensure that the products and/or services mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 3 of Part I and sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 4 of Part II <span style="font-weight: bold;">are procured in accordance with the guidelines for procurement of the Bank,</span> which set forth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inter alia,</span> the procedures of international tendering to be followed except where such procedures are inapplicable or inappropriate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>The JBIC Procurements Guidelines, as quoted earlier, forbids any procedure under which bids above or below a predetermined bid value assessment are automatically disqualified.
