PO2 Del-ong then examined the content of the sealed plastic sachet.&nbsp; Certain that what appellant gave him was<span style="font-style: italic;"> shabu</span>, PO2 Del-ong scratched his head using his left hand to alert his fellow team members that the sale of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> was already consummated.&nbsp; Thereupon, the rest of the buy-bust team rushed towards appellant and informed him that he was being arrested.&nbsp; They likewise advised him of his constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>PO3 Aguirre then frisked appellant and recovered from the latter four small transparent sachets containing crystalline substance.<br><br>Appellant was thereafter taken to the police station where the buy-bust team prepared the arrest report, booking sheet, and their joint affidavit.&nbsp; They also made a request for the initial testing of the evidence they confiscated from appellant.&nbsp; The task of conducting the preliminary test was performed by PO2 Joseph Filog who issued a certification dated 8 August 2002, the pertinent portion of which states:<br><blockquote>The purpose of which is to determine the presence of regulated drug on the above specimen.<br><br>That by using the "SIMONS REAGENT" to the white crystalline substance from the five (5) plastic heat sachets, gave <span style="font-weight: bold;">POSITIVE</span> result of "DARK BLUE COLOR" which indicates the presence of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, an active component of Shabu, a regulated drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The sachets of white crystalline substance were also examined by the Regional Crime Laboratory Office of the Philippine National Police.&nbsp; This test yielded the following results:<br><blockquote>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimens (Exhs.

The reason for this, being, that the trial court is in a better position to decide the credibility of witnesses having heard their testimonies and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Considering, however, that at stake is no less than the liberty of appellant, we thoroughly examined the entire records of this case.&nbsp; Unfortunately for appellant, we failed to identify any error committed by the trial court both in its appreciation of the evidence presented before it and in the conclusion it reached.<br><br>In the prosecution of offenses involving this provision of the statute, it is necessary that the following elements be established: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; What is material to the prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of evidence of <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In this case, all the elements of the crime have been sufficiently established.&nbsp; The witnesses for the prosecution were able to prove that the buy-bust operation indeed took place and the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> subject of the sale was brought and duly identified in court.&nbsp; The poseur-buyer (PO2 Del-ong) positively identified appellant as the one who sold to him a packet of white crystalline substance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> which was later confirmed by two chemical examinations to be <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>As recalled by the PO2 Del-ong, the designated poseur-buyer, the events that led to the apprehension of appellant are as follows:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br> <blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">Q&nbsp;</td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">When the male Civilian Informant went to your office and gave those informations, what happened next?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">Acting on said information and with supervision of our Chief of office, Police Chief Inspector Garcia formed our team to conduct Narcotics buy-bust operation against the suspect, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">What was your role in that buy-bust operation?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">Poseur-buyer to be introduced by the Civilian Informant to the suspect, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q</td><td> <div align="justify">Did you use buy-bust money?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td> <div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">How much?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td> <div align="justify">In the amount of P150.00, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q&nbsp;</td><td> <div align="justify">Did you have any xerox copy of that money authenticated prior to the buy-bust operation?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">Yes, actually when we will conduct the buy-bust operation, our Chief of office handed to PO2 Bulalit one (1) piece of one hundred peso bill and one (1) piece of fifty peso bill to be photocopied and have it authenticated to the City Prosecutor's Office, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">PROS.

However, like alibi, we view the defense of frame-up with disfavor as it can easily be concocted and is commonly used as a standard line of defense in most prosecutions arising from illegal sale of drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; For the claim of frame-up to prosper, the defense must present clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption that the arresting policemen performed their duties in a regular and proper manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Appellant failed to substantiate his claim that he was an unfortunate prey to a supposed ploy concocted by the police.&nbsp; By all indications, he did not know anyone of the members of the buy-bust team which apprehended him.&nbsp; There was, therefore, no motive for them to frame him up.&nbsp; Absent any proof of motive to falsely accuse him of such a grave offense, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty and the findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses shall prevail over appellant's bare allegation that he was framed-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, the categorical and convincing testimonies of the policemen, backed up by physical evidence, overcome the unsubstantiated claim of ill-motive by appellant.<br><br>In this jurisdiction, the conduct of buy-bust operation is a common and accepted mode of apprehending those involved in illegal sale of prohibited or regulated drugs.&nbsp; It has been proven to be an effective way of unveiling the identities of drug dealers and of luring them out of obscurity.&nbsp; Thus, unless the defense could persuade us otherwise, we are inclined to confer full credit and faith to the testimonies of the members of the buy-bust team as regards the conduct of their operation.<br><br>Appellant's claim that his warrantless arrest was invalid is similarly devoid of merit.&nbsp; The rule is settled that an arrest made after an entrapment does not require a warrant inasmuch as it is considered a valid warrantless arrest pursuant to Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; which states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Arrest without warrant; when lawful. </span>- A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">(a)</td><td width="95%">When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense.</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As the legitimacy of the buy-bust operation is beyond question, the subsequent warrantless arrest as well as the warrantless search and seizure was permissible, thus:<br><blockquote>This interdiction against warrantless searches and seizures, however, is not absolute and such <span style="font-weight: bold;">warrantless searches and seizures have long been deemed permissible by jurisprudence in instances of </span>&nbsp;(1) search of moving vehicles, (2) seizure in plain view, (3) customs searches, (4) waiver or consented searches, (5) stop and frisk situations (Terry search), and <span style="font-weight: bold;">search incidental to a lawful arrest</span>.&nbsp; The last includes a valid warrantless arrest, for, while as a rule, an arrest is considered legitimate [if] effected with a valid warrant of arrest, t<span style="font-weight: bold;">he Rules of Court recognize</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">permissible warrantless arrest,</span> to wit: (1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">arrest in <span style="font-style: italic;">flagrante delicto</span></span>, (2) arrest effected in hot pursuit, and (3) arrest of escaped prisoners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Having established the guilt of the appellant for the crimes charged, we shall now proceed to a determination of the appropriate penalties to be imposed upon him.<br><br>The unauthorized sale of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu </span>carries with it the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, the unauthorized possession of less than five grams of said substance is penalized with a prison term of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years and a fine of Three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00) up to Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Section 98, Article XIII of Republic Act No. 9165 expressly provides for the limited application of the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on said law.&nbsp; This section reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 98. <span style="font-style: italic;">Limited Applicability of the Revised Penal Code</span>. - Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the provisions of the Revised Penal Code (Act No. 3815), as amended, shall not apply to the provisions of this Act, except in the case of minor offenders.&nbsp; Where the offender is a minor, the penalty for acts punishable by life imprisonment to death provided herein shall be <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>to death.<br></blockquote>Under the aforesaid section, the provisions of the Revised Penal Code shall no longer apply to the provisions of Republic Act No. 9165 except when the offender is a minor.&nbsp; Thus, Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code shall not be used in the determination of the penalty to be imposed on the accused.&nbsp; Since Section 98 of the said law contains the word "shall," the non-applicability of the Revised Penal Code provisions is mandatory, subject only to the exception in case the offender is a minor.<br><br>With the advent of Republic Act No. 9165, the Courts, in determining the appropriate minimum and maximum of the penalty to be meted out to offenders, shall be guided solely by the pertinent part of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. xxx; and if the offense is punished by any other law, the court shall&nbsp; sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same.<br></blockquote>In the imposition of the proper penalty, the courts, taking into account the circumstances attendant in the commission of the offense, are given discretion to impose either life imprisonment or death, and the fine as provided for by law.&nbsp; In light, however, of the effectivity of Republic Act No. 9346 entitled, "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines," the imposition of the supreme penalty of death shall only be life imprisonment and fine.&nbsp; Hence, the penalty of life imprisonment imposed on appellant in Criminal Case No. 20441-R is proper. We, however, find the fine of P1,000,000.00 to be excessive and hereby reduce the same to P500,000.00 considering that the records do not reveal any prior arrest or conviction of appellant for a drug-related offense.<br><br>We likewise affirm the conviction and penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fifteen (15) years and the fine of P300,000.00 meted out by the trial court with respect to Criminal Case No. 20442-R.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the Decision dated 28 October 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
