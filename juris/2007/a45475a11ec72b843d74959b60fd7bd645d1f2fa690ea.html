				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure seeking to reverse and set aside the Court of Appeals Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 26 April 2002 in CA-G.R. CV No. 53130 entitled, <i>Rizalino, Ernesto, Leonora, Bibiano, Jr., Librado, Enriqueta, Adolfo, and Jesus, all surnamed Oesmer vs. Paraiso Development Corporation,</i> as modified by its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 4 March 2003, declaring the Contract to Sell valid and binding with respect to the undivided proportionate shares of the six signatories of the said document, herein petitioners, namely: Ernesto, Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora (all surnamed Oesmer); and ordering them to execute the Deed of Absolute Sale concerning their 6/8 share over the subject parcels of land in favor of herein respondent Paraiso Development Corporation, and to pay the latter the attorney's fees plus costs of the suit.  The assailed Decision, as modified, likewise ordered the respondent to tender payment to the petitioners in the amount of P3,216,560.00 representing the balance of the purchase price of the subject parcels of land.<br><br>The facts of the case are as follows:<br><br>Petitioners Rizalino, Ernesto, Leonora, Bibiano, Jr., Librado, and Enriqueta, all surnamed Oesmer, together with Adolfo Oesmer (Adolfo) and Jesus Oesmer (Jesus), are brothers and sisters, and the co-owners of undivided shares of two parcels of agricultural and tenanted land situated in Barangay Ulong Tubig, Carmona, Cavite, identified as Lot 720 with an area of 40,507 square meters (sq. m.) and Lot 834 containing an area of 14,769 sq. m., or a total land area of 55,276 sq. m.  Both lots are unregistered and originally owned by their parents, Bibiano Oesmer and Encarnacion Durumpili, who declared the lots for taxation purposes under Tax Declaration No. 3438<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (cancelled by I.D. No. 6064-A) for Lot 720 and Tax Declaration No. 3437<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (cancelled by I.D. No. 5629) for Lot 834.  When the spouses Oesmer died, petitioners, together with Adolfo and Jesus, acquired the lots as heirs of the former by right of succession.<br><br>Respondent Paraiso Development Corporation is known to be engaged in the real estate business.<br><br>Sometime in March 1989, Rogelio Paular, a resident and former Municipal Secretary of Carmona, Cavite, brought along petitioner Ernesto to meet with a certain Sotero Lee, President of respondent Paraiso Development Corporation, at Otani Hotel in Manila. The said meeting was for the purpose of brokering the sale of petitioners' properties to respondent corporation.<br><br>Pursuant to the said meeting, a Contract to Sell<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was drafted by the Executive Assistant of Sotero Lee, Inocencia Almo.  On 1 April 1989, petitioners Ernesto and Enriqueta signed the aforesaid Contract to Sell.  A check in the amount of P100,000.00, payable to Ernesto, was given as option money.  Sometime thereafter, Rizalino, Leonora, Bibiano, Jr., and Librado also signed the said Contract to Sell.  However, two of the brothers, Adolfo and Jesus, did not sign the document.<br><br>On 5 April 1989, a duplicate copy of the instrument was returned to respondent corporation.  On 21 April 1989, respondent brought the same to a notary public for notarization.<br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated 1 November 1989, addressed to respondent corporation, petitioners informed the former of their intention to rescind the Contract to Sell and to return the amount of P100,000.00 given by respondent as option money.<br><br>Respondent did not respond to the aforesaid letter.  On 30 May 1991, herein petitioners, together with Adolfo and Jesus, filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for Declaration of Nullity or for Annulment of Option Agreement or Contract to Sell with Damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bacoor, Cavite.  The said case was docketed as Civil Case No. BCV-91-49.<br><br>During trial, petitioner Rizalino died.  Upon motion of petitioners, the trial court issued an Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated 16 September 1992, to the effect that the deceased petitioner be substituted by his surviving spouse, Josefina O. Oesmer, and his children, Rolando O. Oesmer and Fernando O. Oesmer.  However, the name of Rizalino was retained in the title of the case both in the RTC and the Court of Appeals.<br><br>After trial on the merits, the lower court rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated 27 March 1996 in favor of the respondent, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of herein [respondent] Paraiso Development Corporation.  The assailed Contract to Sell is valid and binding only to the undivided proportionate share of the signatory of this document and recipient of the check, [herein petitioner] co-owner   Ernesto Durumpili Oesmer.  The latter is hereby ordered to execute the Contract of Absolute Sale concerning his 1/8 share over the subject two parcels of land in  favor of herein [respondent] corporation, and to pay the latter the attorney's fees in the sum of Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos plus costs of suit.<br><br>The counterclaim of [respondent] corporation is hereby Dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Unsatisfied, respondent appealed the said Decision before the Court of Appeals.  On 26 April 2002, the appellate court rendered a Decision modifying the Decision of the court <i>a quo</i> by declaring that the Contract to Sell is valid and binding with respect to the undivided proportionate shares of the six signatories of the said document, herein petitioners, namely: Ernesto, Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora (all surnamed Oesmer).  The decretal portion of the said Decision states that:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the Decision of the court a quo is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b>.  Judgment is hereby rendered in favor of herein   [respondent] Paraiso Development Corporation.  The assailed Contract to Sell is valid and binding with respect to the undivided proportionate share of the six (6) signatories of this document, [herein petitioners], namely, Ernesto, Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora (all surnamed Oesmer).  The said [petitioners] are hereby ordered to execute the Deed of Absolute Sale concerning their 6/8 share over the subject two parcels of land and in favor of herein [respondent] corporation, and to pay the latter the attorney's fees in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) plus costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Aggrieved by the above-mentioned Decision, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the same on 2 July 2002.  Acting on petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, the Court of Appeals issued a Resolution dated 4 March 2003, maintaining its Decision dated 26 April 2002, with the modification that respondent tender payment to petitioners in the amount of P3,216,560.00, representing the balance of the purchase price of the subject parcels of land.  The dispositive portion of the said Resolution reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the assailed Decision is hereby  modified.  Judgment is hereby rendered in favor of herein [respondent] Paraiso Development Corporation.  The assailed Contract to Sell is valid and binding with  respect to the undivided proportionate shares of the six (6) signatories of this document, [herein petitioners], namely, Ernesto, Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora (all surnamed Oesmer).  The said [petitioners] are hereby ordered to execute the Deed of Absolute Sale concerning their 6/8 share over the subject two parcels of land in favor of herein [respondent] corporation, and to pay the latter attorney's fees in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) plus costs of suit.  Respondent is likewise ordered to tender payment to the above-named [petitioners] in the amount of Three Million Two Hundred Sixteen Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Pesos (P3,216,560.00) representing the balance of the purchase price of the subject two parcels of land. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br>Petitioners come before this Court arguing that the Court of Appeals erred:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>On a question of law in not holding that, the supposed Contract to Sell (Exhibit D) is not binding upon petitioner Ernesto Oesmer's co-owners (herein petitioners Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora).<br><br></li><li>On a question of law in not holding that, the supposed Contract to Sell (Exhibit D) is void altogether considering that respondent itself did not sign it as to indicate its consent to be bound by its terms.  Moreover, Exhibit D is really a unilateral promise to sell without consideration distinct from the price, and hence, void.</li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners assert that the signatures of five of them namely: Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora, on the margins of the supposed Contract to Sell did not confer authority on petitioner Ernesto as agent to sell their respective shares in the questioned properties, and hence, for lack of written authority from the above-named petitioners to sell their respective shares in the subject parcels of land, the supposed Contract to Sell is void as to them.  Neither do their signatures signify their consent to directly sell their shares in the questioned properties.  Assuming that the signatures indicate consent, such consent was merely conditional.  The effectivity of the alleged Contract to Sell was subject to a suspensive condition, which is the approval of the sale by all the co-owners.<br><br>Petitioners also assert that the supposed Contract to Sell (Exhibit D), contrary to the findings of the Court of Appeals, is not couched in simple language.<br><br>They further claim that the supposed Contract to Sell does not bind the respondent because the latter did not sign the said contract as to indicate its consent to be bound by its terms.  Furthermore, they maintain that the supposed Contract to Sell is really a unilateral promise to sell and the option money does not bind petitioners for lack of cause or consideration distinct from the purchase price.<br><br>The Petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>It is true that the signatures of the five petitioners, namely: Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora, on the Contract to Sell did not confer authority on petitioner Ernesto as agent authorized to sell their respective shares in the questioned properties because of Article 1874 of the Civil Code, which expressly provides that:<br><blockquote>Art. 1874.  When a sale of a piece of land or any interest therein is through an agent, the authority of the latter shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void.</blockquote>The law itself explicitly requires a written authority before an agent can sell an immovable.  The conferment of such an authority should be in writing, in as clear and precise terms as possible.  It is worth noting that petitioners' signatures are found in the Contract to Sell.  The Contract is absolutely silent on the establishment of any principal-agent relationship between the five petitioners and their brother and co-petitioner Ernesto as to the sale of the subject parcels of land.  Thus, the Contract to Sell, although signed on the margin by the five petitioners, is not sufficient to confer authority on petitioner Ernesto to act as their agent in selling their shares in the properties in question.<br><br>However, despite petitioner Ernesto's lack of written authority from the five petitioners to sell their shares in the subject parcels of land, the supposed Contract to Sell remains valid and binding upon the latter.<br><br>As can be clearly gleaned from the contract itself, it is not only petitioner Ernesto who signed the said Contract to Sell; the other five petitioners also personally affixed their signatures thereon.  Therefore, a written authority is no longer necessary in order to sell their shares in the subject parcels of land because, by affixing their signatures on the Contract to Sell, they were not selling their shares through an agent but, rather, they were selling the same directly and in their own right.<br><br>The Court also finds untenable the following arguments raised by petitioners to the effect that the Contract to Sell is not binding upon them, except to Ernesto, because: (1) the signatures of five of the petitioners do not signify their consent to sell their shares in the questioned properties since petitioner Enriqueta merely signed as a witness to the said Contract to Sell, and that the other petitioners, namely: Librado, Rizalino, Leonora, and Bibiano, Jr., did not understand the importance and consequences of their action because of their low degree of education and the contents of the aforesaid contract were not read nor explained to them; and (2) assuming that the signatures indicate consent, such consent was merely conditional, thus, the effectivity of the alleged Contract to Sell was subject to a suspensive condition, which is the approval by all the co-owners of the sale.<br><br>It is well-settled that contracts are perfected by mere consent, upon the acceptance by the offeree of the offer made by the offeror.  From that moment, the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage and law.  To produce a contract, the acceptance must not qualify the terms of the offer.  However, the acceptance may be express or implied.  For a contract to arise, the acceptance must be made known to the offeror.  Accordingly, the acceptance can be withdrawn or revoked before it is made known to the offeror.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the Contract to Sell was perfected when the petitioners consented to the sale to the respondent of their shares in the subject parcels of land by affixing their signatures on the said contract.  Such signatures show their acceptance of what has been stipulated in the Contract to Sell and such acceptance was made known to respondent corporation when the duplicate copy of the Contract to Sell was returned to the latter bearing petitioners' signatures.<br><br>As to petitioner Enriqueta's claim that she merely signed as a witness to the said contract, the contract itself does not say so.  There was no single indication in the said contract that she signed the same merely as a witness. The fact that her signature appears on the right-hand margin of the Contract to Sell is insignificant.  The contract indisputably referred to the "Heirs of Bibiano and Encarnacion Oesmer," and since there is no showing that Enriqueta signed the document in some other capacity, it can be safely assumed that she did so as one of the parties to the sale.<br><br>Emphasis should also be given to the fact that petitioners Ernesto and Enriqueta concurrently signed the Contract to Sell.  As the Court of Appeals mentioned in its Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the records of the case speak of the fact that petitioner Ernesto, together with petitioner Enriqueta, met with the representatives of the respondent in order to finalize the terms and conditions of the Contract to Sell.  Enriqueta affixed her signature on the said contract when the same was drafted.  She even admitted that she understood the undertaking that she and petitioner Ernesto made in connection with the contract.  She likewise disclosed that pursuant to the terms embodied in the Contract to Sell, she updated the payment of the real property taxes and transferred the Tax Declarations of the questioned properties in her name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Hence, it cannot be gainsaid that she merely signed the Contract to Sell as a witness because she did not only actively participate in the negotiation and execution of the same, but her subsequent actions also reveal an attempt to comply with the conditions in the said contract.<br><br>With respect to the other petitioners' assertion that they did not understand the importance and consequences of their action because of their low degree of education and because the contents of the aforesaid contract were not read nor explained to them, the same cannot be sustained.<br><br>We only have to quote the pertinent portions of the Court of Appeals Decision, clear and concise, to dispose of this issue.  Thus,<br><blockquote>First, the Contract to Sell is couched in such a simple language which is undoubtedly easy to read and understand.  The terms of the Contract, specifically the amount of P100,000.00 representing the option money paid by [respondent] corporation, the purchase price of P60.00 per square meter or the total amount of P3,316,560.00 and a brief description of the subject properties are well-indicated thereon that any prudent and mature man would have known the nature and extent of the transaction encapsulated in the document that he was signing.<br><br>Second, the following circumstances, as testified by the witnesses and as can be gleaned from the records of the case clearly indicate the [petitioners'] intention to be bound by the stipulations chronicled in the said Contract to Sell.<br><br>As to [petitioner] Ernesto, there is no dispute as to his intention to effect the alienation of the subject property as he in fact was the one who initiated the negotiation process and culminated the same by affixing his signature on the Contract to Sell and by taking receipt of the amount of P100,000.00 which formed part of the purchase price.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As to [petitioner] Librado, the [appellate court] finds it preposterous that he willingly affixed his signature on a document written in a language (English) that he purportedly does not understand.  He testified that the document was just brought to him by an 18 year old niece named Baby and he was told that the document was for a check to be paid to him.  He readily signed the Contract to Sell without consulting his other siblings.  Thereafter, he exerted no effort in communicating with his brothers and sisters regarding the document which he had signed, did not inquire what the check was for and did not thereafter ask for the check which is purportedly due to him as a result of his signing the said Contract to Sell.  (TSN, 28 September 1993, pp. 22-23)<br><br>The [appellate court] notes that Librado is a 43 year old family man (TSN, 28 September 1993, p. 19).  As such, he is expected to act with that ordinary degree of care and prudence expected of a good father of a family.  His unwitting testimony is just divinely disbelieving.<br><br>The other [petitioners] (Rizalino, Leonora and Bibiano Jr.) are likewise bound by the said Contract to Sell.  The theory adopted by the [petitioners] that because of their low degree of education, they did not understand the contents of the said Contract to Sell is devoid of merit.  The [appellate court] also notes that Adolfo (one of the co-heirs who did not sign) also possess the same degree of education as that of the signing co-heirs (TSN, 15 October 1991, p. 19).  He, however, is employed at the Provincial Treasury Office at Trece Martirez, Cavite and has even accompanied Rogelio Paular to the Assessor's Office to locate certain missing documents which were needed to transfer the titles of the subject properties.  (TSN, 28 January 1994, pp. 26 &amp; 35)  Similarly, the other co-heirs [petitioners], like Adolfo, are far from ignorant, more so, illiterate that they can be extricated from their obligations under the Contract to Sell which they voluntarily and knowingly entered into with the [respondent] corporation.<br><br>The Supreme Court in the case of Cecilia <i>Mata v. Court of Appeals</i> (207 SCRA 753 [1992]), citing the case of <i>Tan Sua Sia v. Yu Baio Sontua</i> (56 Phil. 711), instructively ruled as follows:<br><br>"The Court does not accept the petitioner's claim that she did not understand the terms and conditions of the transactions because she only reached Grade Three and was already 63 years of age when she signed the documents.  She was literate, to begin with, and her age did not make her senile or incompetent. x x x.<br><br>At any rate, Metrobank had no obligation to explain the documents to the petitioner as nowhere has it been proven that she is unable to read or that the contracts were written in a language not known to her.  It was her responsibility to inform herself of the meaning and consequence of the contracts she was signing and, if she found them difficult to comprehend, to consult other persons, preferably lawyers, to explain them to her.  After all, the transactions involved not only a few hundred or thousand pesos but, indeed, hundreds of thousands of pesos.<br><br>As the Court has held:<br><br>x x x <u>The rule that one who signs a contract is presumed to know its contents has been applied even to contracts of illiterate persons on the ground that if such persons are unable to read, they are negligent if they fail to have the contract read to them.  If a person cannot read the instrument, it is as much his duty to procure some reliable persons to read and explain it to him, before he signs it, as it would be to read it before he signed it if he were able to do and his failure to obtain a reading and explanation of it is such gross negligence as will estop from avoiding it on the ground that he was ignorant of its contents</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>That the petitioners really had the intention to dispose of their shares in the subject parcels of land, irrespective of whether or not all of the heirs consented to the said Contract to Sell, was unveiled by Adolfo's testimony as follows:<br><blockquote>ATTY. GAMO: This alleged agreement between you and your other brothers and sisters that unless everybody will agree, the properties would not be sold, was that agreement in writing?<br><br>WITNESS: No sir.<br><br>ATTY. GAMO: What you are saying is that when your brothers and sisters except Jesus and you did not sign that agreement which had been marked as [Exhibit] "D", your brothers and sisters were grossly violating your agreement.<br><br>WITNESS: Yes, sir, they violated what we have agreed upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>We also cannot sustain the allegation of the petitioners that assuming the signatures indicate consent, such consent was merely conditional, and that, the effectivity of the alleged Contract to Sell was subject to the suspensive condition that the sale be approved by all the co-owners.  The Contract to Sell is clear enough.  It is a cardinal rule in the interpretation of contracts that if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulation shall control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  The terms of the Contract to Sell made no mention of the condition that before it can become valid and binding, a unanimous consent of all the heirs is necessary.  Thus, when the language of the contract is explicit, as in the present case, leaving no doubt as to the intention of the parties thereto, the literal meaning of its stipulation is controlling.<br><br>In addition, the petitioners, being owners of their respective undivided shares in the subject properties, can dispose of their shares even without the consent of all the co-heirs.  Article 493 of the Civil Code expressly provides:<br><blockquote>Article 493. Each co-owner shall have the full ownership of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may therefore <b><i><u>alienate, assign or mortgage</u></i></b> it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved.  But the effect of the alienation or the mortgage, with respect to the co-owners, shall be <b><i><u>limited</u></i></b> to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership. [Emphases supplied.]</blockquote>Consequently, even without the consent of the two co-heirs, Adolfo and Jesus, the Contract to Sell is still valid and binding with respect to the 6/8 proportionate shares of the petitioners, as properly held by the appellate court.<br><br>Therefore, this Court finds no error in the findings of the Court of Appeals that all the petitioners who were signatories in the Contract to Sell are bound thereby.<br><br>The final arguments of petitioners state that the Contract to Sell is void altogether considering that respondent itself did not sign it as to indicate its consent to be bound by its terms; and moreover, the Contract to Sell is really a unilateral promise to sell without consideration distinct from the price, and hence, again, void.  Said arguments must necessarily fail.<br><br>The Contract to Sell is not void merely because it does not bear the signature of the respondent corporation.  Respondent corporation's consent to be bound by the terms of the contract is shown in the uncontroverted facts which established that there was partial performance by respondent of its obligation in the said Contract to Sell when it tendered the amount of P100,000.00 to form part of the purchase price, which was accepted and acknowledged expressly by petitioners.  Therefore, by force of law, respondent is required to complete the payment to enforce the terms of the contract.  Accordingly, despite the absence of respondent's signature in the Contract to Sell, the former cannot evade its obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price.<br><br>As a final point, the Contract to Sell entered into by the parties is not a unilateral promise to sell merely because it used the word option money when it referred to the amount of P100,000.00, which also form part of the purchase price.<br><br>Settled is the rule that in the interpretation of contracts, the ascertainment of the intention of the contracting parties is to be discharged by looking to the words they used to project that intention in their contract, all the words, not just a particular word or two, and words in context, not words standing alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the consideration of P100,000.00 paid by respondent to petitioners was referred to as "option money."  However, a careful examination of the words used in the contract indicates that the money is not option money but <b><i><u>earnest money</u></i></b>. "Earnest money" and "option money" are not the same but distinguished thus: (a) earnest money is part of the purchase price, while option money is the money given as a distinct consideration for an option contract; (b) earnest money is given only where there is already a sale, while option money applies to a sale not yet perfected; and, (c) when earnest money is given, the buyer is bound to pay the balance, while when the would-be buyer gives option money, he is not required to buy, but may even forfeit it depending on the terms of the option.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The sum of P100,000.00 was part of the purchase price.  Although the same was denominated as "option money," it is actually in the nature of earnest money or down payment when considered with the other terms of the contract.  Doubtless, the agreement is not a mere unilateral promise to sell, but, indeed, it is a Contract to Sell as both the trial court and the appellate court declared in their Decisions.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the Petition is <b>DENIED,</b> and the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 26 April 2002 and 4 March 2003, respectively, are <b>AFFIRMED,</b> thus, (a) the Contract to Sell is <b>DECLARED</b> valid and binding with respect to the undivided proportionate shares in the subject parcels of land of the six signatories of the said document, herein petitioners Ernesto, Enriqueta, Librado, Rizalino, Bibiano, Jr., and Leonora (all surnamed Oesmer); (b) respondent is <b>ORDERED</b> to tender payment to petitioners in the amount of P3,216,560.00 representing the balance of the purchase price for the latter's shares in the subject parcels of land; and (c) petitioners are further <b>ORDERED</b> to execute in favor of respondent the Deed of Absolute Sale covering their shares in the subject parcels of land after receipt of the balance of the purchase price, and to pay respondent attorney's fees plus costs of the suit.
