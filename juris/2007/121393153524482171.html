Conformably with <i>People v.

CR. HC. No. 01415.&nbsp; The appellate court increased the award for moral damages to P75,000.00, albeit decreased the amount of exemplary damages to P25,000.00.&nbsp; The <i>fallo</i> of the Court of Appeals decision reads -<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Gumaca, Quezon (Branch 61), dated June 25, 2002, in Criminal Case No. 6467-G finding appellant Sonny Rentoria guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified rape and imposing upon him the death penalty is AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that the award of moral damages is increased to Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00) and the exemplary damages is reduced to Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P25,000.00). The decision is further AFFIRMED insofar as it awarded civil indemnity in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Pesos (P75,000.00). Costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br>In accordance with Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, in case of finality of this decision, let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of the pardoning power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The present case is again before us for our final disposition.<br><br>Accused-appellant is still seeking the reversal of the decision of the RTC, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of statutory rape on the lone assignment of error stating that -<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE WHEN HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>Essentially, it is accused-appellant's contention that the evidence presented by the prosecution was not sufficient to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt as the perpetrator of the crime charged.&nbsp; In his Brief, he avers that "the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses shows (sic) that the only direct evidence that would link the accused-appellant to the crime charged is the testimony of CCC."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He points to an alleged discrepancy or contradiction, however, to impeach CCC's testimony as flawed so as not to carry weight sufficient to sustain his conviction.&nbsp; He claims as a material inconsistency the testimony of CCC on cross-examination wherein she claimed to be either sleeping or playing when the alleged crime was being committed.&nbsp; Particularly, he argues that -<br><blockquote>Although the latter stated that she saw the accused-appellant take AAA to the "<i>sukalan</i>" and that the accused-appellant performed some acts tantamount to sexual intercourse with the victim, she contradicted herself on cross-examination when she declared that she was either sleeping or playing when the alleged crime was being committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant, thus, maintains that the significant discrepancies in the sole direct evidence showing him to be the perpetrator of the crime charged is tantamount to reasonable doubt respecting his legal culpability thereto. And there being reasonable doubt, his constitutionally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent was not overcome.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), for the <i>People of the Philippines</i>, on the other hand, asserts that the alleged conflicting points in the testimony of CCC are but trivial in nature and do not depart from the fact that accused-appellant was the author of the crime charged.&nbsp; In fact -<br><blockquote>CCC testified that she was able to remember and even repeatedly identified Sonny Rentoria as the man she saw in the sukalan. She related that the appellant, who was not wearing any pants, placed himself on top of AAA, removed AAA's panty, and moved up and down on her sister (AAA) who was crying during this sequence of events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, that CCC has a late mental development affects neither the veracity of her testimony, nor her credibility as a witness.&nbsp; The OSG further emphasizes that the RTC judge had the occasion to observe the demeanor of said witness and was satisfied that CCC was qualified and credible to give a testimony in furtherance of the prosecution's cause.&nbsp; It contends further that -<br><blockquote>In this case, Sonny Rentoria did not object to the presentation of CCC as witness for the prosecution despite the information given in the chamber hearings regarding the child's late mental development. Calibration of this witness' credibility is best left to the discretion of the trial judge, who was able to observe her demeanor while testifying [citation omitted]. Absent any showing that the trial judge abused his discretion, his findings that CCC is a qualified and credible witness should not be disturbed [citation omitted].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Considering the preceding arguments and counter-arguments, the threshold issue in this case, therefore, is whether or not the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br>We find no merit in the petition.<br><br>Before we go any further in discussing the merits of the present case, a point of clarification is in order as to the nomenclature of the crime committed and charged.&nbsp; The RTC in this case found accused-appellant guilty of the crime of <i>Statutory Rape</i> defined and punished under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B.&nbsp; We find, however, that the crime committed is <i>Qualified Rape,</i> as the Court of Appeals correctly found.<br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code defines and punishes the crime of rape, <i>viz - </i><br><blockquote>Art. 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed.</i> - Rape is committed -<br><br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through force, threat or intimidation;<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority;<br><br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present;<br></blockquote></blockquote>From the above provisions of the law, there is rape when an accused has sexual intercourse with a victim "under twelve years of age" even if any of the circumstances enumerated under paragraph (1) is absent. This is called Statutory Rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; And under the terms of Article 266-B of the same law, to wit -<br><blockquote>Art. 266-B. <i>Penalties.</i> - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br></blockquote>statutory rape is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; But the same article of the law also provides the imposition of a higher penalty,<i> i.e.</i>, death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i> </i>It reads further:<br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>5) When the victim is a child below seven (7) years old.<br></blockquote>Hence, from the foregoing, the death penalty shall be imposed in the crime of rape if any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 266-B is present in the commission of the crime. Qualifying circumstances are aggravating circumstances, which, by express provision of law, change the nature of the crime to a higher category.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, there is no question that the Information alleged the crime of rape to have been committed upon the person of the victim under the age of twelve (12) years.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the same charge sheet explicitly declares the exact age of the AAA as three years old at the time of the commission of the crime of rape.&nbsp; Since Article 266-B, paragraph 6(5) makes the rape of a child below the age of seven years as qualified, the correct classification of the rape committed by accused-appellant on the person of AAA, a three year old child at the time, is that of Qualified Rape and not Statutory Rape.&nbsp; Simply stated, under the circumstances obtaining in this case, Qualified Rape is Statutory Rape in its qualified form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>With the effectivity, however, of Republic Act No. 9346 entitled, "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines," the imposition of the supreme penalty of death has been prohibited.&nbsp; Pursuant to Section 2 thereof, the penalty to be meted to appellant shall be <i>reclusion perpetua </i>without eligibility for parole.<br><br>Now, coming to the merits of the case at bar, having weighed the evidence for the contending parties, we find no cogent reason to reverse the findings and conclusion of the RTC as affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The testimonies of AAA, BBB and CCC, as supported by that of Dr. Mislang as well as the latter's Medical Examination Report, are, in our view, more than credible and sufficient to convict accused-appellant of the crime of qualified rape.<br><br>From the quoted provisions of Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, for conviction to be had in the crime of rape, the following elements must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: 1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim; and 2) that said act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation; or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) when the victim is twelve years of age, or is demented. Settled is the rule that the foregoing elements may be established by the sole testimony of the victim, provided it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Constitution demands that every accused be presumed innocent until the charge is proved.&nbsp; Before an accused can be convicted of any criminal act, his guilt must first be proved beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In this jurisdiction, proof beyond reasonable doubt requires only a moral certainty or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind; it does not demand absolute certainty and the exclusion of all possibility of error;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> it is that engendered by an investigation of the whole proof and an inability, after such investigation, to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Basic is the principle in criminal law, that, the evidence presented must be sufficient to prove the <i>corpus delicti </i>- the body or substance of the crime and, in its primary sense, refers to the fact that a crime has been actually committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; The <i>corpus delicti</i> is a compound fact composed of two things: 1) the existence of a certain act or <i>result</i> forming the basis of the criminal charge, and 2) the existence of a criminal agency as the cause of this act or result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; In all criminal prosecutions, the burden is on the prosecution to prove the body or substance of the crime.&nbsp; In the case at bar, was the prosecution able to prove the two components of the <i>corpus delicti</i>?<br><br>The answer is yes.&nbsp; The evidence presented by the prosecution - the testimony of the AAA that the accused-appellant hurt her in her vagina; the testimony of CCC that she saw accused-appellant with his pants around his knees lie on top of her sister, remove her undergarment and make up and down motions; the testimony of BBB that her daughter AAA was three years old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> at the time of the incident in question, and that she saw her daughter with the latter's vagina all bloodied; and the testimony of Dr. Mislang narrating the medical examination conducted on AAA, and the result of such examination attesting to injuries sustained by AAA are consistent with the&nbsp; penetration of the vagina by a hard object - are fully satisfactory to buttress the existence of the crime of qualified rape.<br><br>Faced with the clear and positive identification of accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime of qualified rape, his defense of denial or alibi is unavailing and worthless.&nbsp; Alibi is an inherently a weak defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and it is not at all persuasive in the instant case when pitted against the positive and convincing identification by the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> more so, when corroborated by an eyewitness.&nbsp; For one thing, accused-appellant did not present any witness to corroborate his claim.&nbsp; For another, he has not shown the impossibility of his committing the bestial deed although he was allegedly in another barrio at the time, given the distance of the place from the scene of the crime.&nbsp; No less importantly, the trial judge was equally unimpressed by his manner on the witness stand, which suggested nothing of his innocence.&nbsp; Well-settled is the legal principle that a categorical and positive identification of an accused, without any showing of ill-motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, the defenses of denial and alibi deserve scant consideration when the prosecution has strong and convincing evidence identifying accused-appellant as the perpetrator.<br><br>In the case at bar, we are satisfied that AAA, the victim, and CCC, the eyewitness, have positively identified accused-appellant as the malefactor. We do not believe, given the naiveté and limited intelligence of AAA and CCC, due to their tender years and mental deficiency, respectively; that they could have fabricated their charges and testimonies against accused-appellant, weaving or inventing a tale purely out of mere imagination. Neither do we think, yet again considering the mental competence of AAA and CCC, that their testimonies were anything but spontaneous and brought forth only from what the former, the victim, actually endured from accused-appellant and what the latter, the eyewitness, actually saw.&nbsp; Their mental faculties are just not capable of such feat.<br><br>The RTC and the Court of Appeals both found no issue detracting from the credibility and integrity of such testimonies. Lest it be forgotten, appellate courts have consistently deferred to the findings and conclusions made by a trial judge principally because it is the latter who gets the opportunity to directly and intimately observe the witnesses and to determine, by their demeanor on the witness stand, the probative strength or weakness of that which they declare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; More so in the case at bar, wherein the examination of CCC was done in the private confines of the chambers of the trial court judge due to the child's delayed mental status. The intimate setting enabled the trial court judge to observe more carefully the probative strength and weakness of what the eyewitness had declared.<br><br>With the foregoing discussion alone, we are satisfied with the perpetration of the crime of qualified rape as well as its authorship by accused-appellant.&nbsp; Like the trial court and appellate court, this Court finds no reason to be suspicious of the testimonies of AAA and CCC.&nbsp; Both testimonies were more than candid and definitive enough to sustain accused-appellant's conviction.&nbsp; The genuineness of CCC's testimony cannot be overemphasized enough.&nbsp; The sincerity of AAA's acknowledgment of her harrowing experience at the hands of accused-appellant was shown even more when she cried at the witness stand and covered her eyes when asked to point to him, in obvious distress and torment at finding herself once again in the presence of accused-appellant.<br><br>Accused-appellant's other asseveration, that is, the supposed impeachment of the testimony of CCC due to inconsistencies, is tenuous at best. The supposed inconsistencies are more apparent than real and refer, at most, only to insignificant or trivial details.&nbsp; The foregoing bear no materiality to the commission of the crime of qualified rape with which accused-appellant has been charged and of which he has been convicted.&nbsp; As pointed out by the OSG, the seeming inconsistencies were but minor lapses brought about by the late mental development of the witness.<br><br>While it is true that there were some inconsistencies in her narration of her sister's ordeal, to our mind, such detract from neither its basic truthfulness nor its reliability.&nbsp; The minor lapses are to be expected from a person as young as she, and younger still in mental age.&nbsp; To recount, CCC's statements that she saw accused-appellant not wearing any pants; placing himself on top of AAA, while at the same time removing the latter's undergarment; and then making up and down motions, are the only declarations necessary or important anent the existence of the crime charged.&nbsp; That she fell asleep later is of no moment.<br><br>We agree further with the OSG that it is too late in the day for accused-appellant to demur to the competence of CCC as a witness. Objections thereto respecting its admissibility should have been made at the time said evidence was formally offered in court; otherwise, any evidence coming from her would be admitted.<br><br>We cannot end this <i>ponencia</i><i> </i>without conveying our sentiment concerning this nauseating crime.&nbsp; It is a sad commentary on our times that rape has become so commonplace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; But even by the modern standards of morality, it is bad enough that a man imposes his lust on a woman mature in years and emotion.&nbsp; It is particularly bestial and repulsive, however, if as in the case at bar, the victim is a toddler, barely out of infancy and only just beginning her formative years.&nbsp; The brutality and the ugliness of the deviant behavior and the unmitigating menace of the evil visited upon AAA, a very young person, by a man whose age alone - 30 years her senior - should have dissuaded him from giving free rein to the animal in him.&nbsp; Defilers of women are an especially despicable ilk of evil men, and more so those who would inflict their lasciviousness upon innocent and defenseless children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Whatever punishment is imposed on them can never expiate their loathsome offense, for which forgiveness itself, from a mortal court at least, would be a sin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Pity the helpless and innocent victim, the bewildered and violated child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in light of the foregoing, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 20 April 2006 is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Sonny Rentoria <i>y</i> Velasco is hereby found <b>GUILTY </b>of the crime of <b>QUALIFIED RAPE</b> and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> with no possibility of parole.&nbsp; Accused-appellant is further <b>ORDERED</b> to indemnify AAA in the following amounts: 1) seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00) as civil indemnity; 2) seventy-five thousand pesos (P75,000.00) as moral damages; and 3) twenty-five thousand pesos (P25,000.00) as exemplary damages.&nbsp; Costs<i> de oficio</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><b></b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio Morales, Azcuna, Tinga, Garcia, Velasco, Jr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Nachura, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J.,</span> no part.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Court of Appeals Associate Justice Aurora Santiago-Lagman with Associate Justices Ruben T.
