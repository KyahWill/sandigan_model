				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case revolves around the corporations organized and the investments acquired or funded allegedly from the coconut levy fund (the Fund, hereinafter). While it came from levies on the sale of copra or equivalent coconut products exacted for the most part from coconut farmers, the Fund went or was known under various names, such as Coconut Consumers Development Fund, Coconut Industry Investment Fund and Coconut Industry Stabilization Fund (CISF). The successive establishing legislations and the stated purpose&nbsp;&nbsp; for the exaction accounted for the differing denominations. Through the years, a part of the Fund went to various projects, was converted into different assets or invested. Playing key roles in the collection, administration and/or use of the Fund were the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA), formerly the Philippine Coconut Administration (PHILCOA), United Coconut Producers Bank (UCPB), and Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc., or the COCOFED. By legal mandate, COCOFED once received allocations from the coconut levy funds to finance its projects. Among the assets allegedly acquired thru the direct or indirect use of the Fund was a block of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) shares of stock.<br><br>Opinions had, for some time, been divided as to the nature and ownership of a fund with public roots but with private fruits, so to speak.

No. 6260 was enacted creating the Coconut Investment Company&nbsp; to administer the Coconut Investment Fund (<span style="font-weight: bold;">CIF</span>), which was to be sourced from a levy of P0.55 on the sale of every 100 kilograms&nbsp; of copra or equivalent coconut product.&nbsp; In the course of implementing R.A. No. 6260, PHILCOA declared <span style="font-weight: bold;">COCOFED</span> as the recognized national association of coconut producers with the largest membership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On June 30, 1973, then President Ferdinand E.

Lobregat (hereafter "Lobregat"), as&nbsp; COCOFED representative. Sitting as representative of the Bugsuk Hybrid Coconut Seed Nut Farm was herein respondent Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr. (hereafter “Cojuangco, Jr.").<br><br>At this juncture, it is relevant to mention some incidents referred to or recurring allegations made in several coco levy cases:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. On May 17, 1975, the COCOFED's Board passed a resolution declaring that “<span style="font-style: italic;">ownership by the coconut farmers of a commercial bank is a permanent solution to their perennial credit problems</span>”. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp; As events unfolded, the Board’s bank of choice was the First United Bank (hereafter "<span style="font-weight: bold;">FUB</span>") where Pedro Cojuangco was then the President.&nbsp; The plan then was for PCA to buy Pedro Cojuangco's controlling interest in FUB.&nbsp; However, the sale did not take a direct route from the seller (Pedro) to the buyer (PCA) as it was made to appear that Cojuangco, Jr. had the “<span style="font-style: italic;">exclusive option</span>” to acquire Pedro's controlling interest in FUB.&nbsp; Emerging from the shroud over the circuitous maze of transactions are “<span style="font-style: italic;">two documents</span>”,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; the first being a 1975 agreement&nbsp; about what appears to be PCA's buy-out of Cojuangco, Jr.’s&nbsp; option to acquire at least 72.2% of FUB's capital stock.&nbsp; Per Cojuangco, Jr’s. own admission, PCA paid the “entire amount” for the said 72.2 % equity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]&nbsp;</sup> The second document relates to an agreement to acquire a commercial bank for the benefit of coconuts farmers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">2.

On the same day, the CIIF Holding Companies signed an <span style="font-style: italic;">Agreement</span>&nbsp; placing the subject shares under a Voting Trust Agreement (VTA) in favor of Andres Soriano, Jr., who was later substituted by Cojuangco, Jr., or, upon his written delegation, Andres Jr.’s son, Andres&nbsp;&nbsp; III.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Upon assuming office as President of the Republic following the glorious 1986 EDSA Revolution, Corazon C.

It seems plain that the lifting of sequestration has no relevance to the nature of the coconut levy companies or their stock or property, or to the legality of the acquisition by private persons of their interest therein, or to the latter’s capacity or disqualification to acquire stock in the companies or any property acquired from coconut levy fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [56]</sup></blockquote>Sometime in August 1994, the PCGG and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) entered into a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Stock Purchase Agreement</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57] </sup>in which the PCGG, thereat styled&nbsp; as “owner” “with clear title”&nbsp; over a block of SMC shares consisting of 14,519,996 shares of stock – the arbitration fee shares and their stock dividends – sold the same to the GSIS for the total consideration of P1.452 Billion.

In the concrete, the PCGG would fault the Sandiganbayan for not favorably acting on its plea for approval of the PCGG-GSIS <span style="font-style: italic;">Stock Purchase Agreement</span> and corollarily for not ordering the lifting of the sequestration over the SMC shares covered thereby.<br><br>It is the PCGG’s stated position that the Compromise Agreement whence it sourced its right to the 5.5 million SMC shares&nbsp; is a valid contract between the original purported owners thereof, adding that the withdrawal of their joint petition for approval of the compromise agreement has rendered moot and academic any question respecting the validity of the transfer effected therein.

These shares are alleged to be part of the alleged ill- gotten wealth subject of Civil Case No. 0033.<br><br>We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan when it declined to approve the proposed PCGG-GSIS <span style="font-style: italic;">Stock Purchase Agreement</span>. For, this purchase agreement involves sequestered SMC shares of stock the ownership of which is still under litigation in Civil Case No. 0033. Accordingly, any ownership movement of these shares cannot be of any permanent character that will alter their being sequestered and, as correctly observed by the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> of March 18, 1992, as property in <span style="font-style: italic;">custodia legis.</span><br><br>It cannot be overemphasized that the right of the PCGG to freely dispose of the arbitration fee shares depends, in the ultimate analysis, on the right of the SMC and the UCPB groups to freely cede to PCGG the same shares unencumbered by a sequestration order. The right to effectively cede, in turn, hinges on the question of enforceability of the Compromise Agreement.&nbsp; Now then, in <span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel Corporation v. Sandiganbayan,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63] </sup>we ruled that the Compromise Agreement entered into respecting the SMC shares, significantly the subject of that and this case, falls within the unique jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, the Court adding the observation that the parties thereto themselves submitted to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan by asking for the approval of the said Compromise Agreement. This agreement, to reiterate, is the basis for the purported payment of an arbitral fee to PCGG. And as may be recalled, no less than the PCGG, per its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of June 15, 1990, consented to the Compromise Agreement, but imposed the approval of the Sandiganbayan as a condition sine qua non for the implementation thereof or for the transfer of the sequestered shares of stock covered thereby. The SMC and UCPB groups accepted the condition and incorporated by reference such condition as integral part of the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>Lest it be overlooked, the Court, in the same <span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel Corporation</span>&nbsp; case, declared that it is within the sound discretion of the&nbsp; Sandiganbayan to pass upon at the first instance and validate or invalidate, as the case may be, such compromise agreement. Discretion is a faculty of a court or an official by which it/he may decide a question either way, and still be right,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the power or liberty to decide according to the principles of justice and one’s ideas of what is right and proper under the circumstances, without willfulness or favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The Sandiganbayan has not approved the Compromise Agreement but not out of whim.<br><br>Given the foregoing perspective, the Sandiganbayan’s disinclination to approve the SMC Group- UCPB Group Compromise Agreement and by extension the PCGG-GSIS Stock Purchase Agreement can hardly be assailed as in grave abuse of discretion, a juridical concept which conveys the notion of whimsical, despotic or unreasoning action. With the view we take of the case, the graft court acted within the bounds of its sound discretion and certainly within its jurisdiction when it virtually disapproved the Compromise Agreement. For sure, the Sandiganbayan had valid reasons for acting the way it did. The graft court specifically mentioned one,<span style="font-style: italic;"> i.e.</span>,&nbsp; the pendency then before this Court of cases involving&nbsp; issues surrounding the SMC Group-UCPB Group Compromise Agreement. The cases the Sandiganbayan doubtless had in mind referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. Nos. 104637-38</span> entitled&nbsp; “<span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel Corporation, et al. v. Sandiganbayan (First Division), et al,</span>” and<span style="font-style: italic;"> G.R. No. 109797</span>&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; “<span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel Corporation, et al. v. Sandiganbayan (First Division), et al.</span>”&nbsp; These cited and now-resolved consolidated cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67] </sup>involved not only the validity of the Compromise Agreement or its implementation, but touched on the need of the Sandiganbayan’s approval of the Compromise Agreement and the propriety of the arbitration fee ceded therein to the PCGG.<br><br>For another, the judicial question of ownership over the sequestered shares – alleged to be ill-gotten wealth -&nbsp; has yet to be resolved in Civil Case No. 0033. It will be recalled that since the institution of Civil Case No. 0033, the PCGG has insisted that&nbsp; the SMC shares sought to be recovered therein, which include or are the&nbsp; same&nbsp; shares subject of the Compromise Agreement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> pertained in ownership to respondent Cojuangco, Jr. And if only to stress the point, the PCGG ordered&nbsp; on April 7, 1986 the sequestration of said block of shares on the theory that they belong to Cojuangco, Jr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> allegedly a close associate of former President Marcos and that the sale thereof by the CIIF Holding Companies was violative of EO Nos. 1 and 2, both series of 1986. The attempt of the parties in the Compromise Agreement and, by extension, in the Stock Purchase Agreement to pull a fast one on persons or entities with ostensible interest on subject shares strikes the Court as an instance of unfair play.<br><br>And for a third, there is a challenge hurled by respondents Cojuangco, Jr. and COCOFED against the legality, if not the propriety, of the consent given by PCGG to the Compromise Agreement on several grounds, but particularly in the light of the grant of the arbitral fee. While perhaps not decisively determinative of the outcome of this case, respondent Cojuangco, Jr. alleged, without so much of a comment from petitioner PCGG, that, at the time that the Compromise Agreement in question was reached, all the members of the Board of Directors of UCPB, as well as a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of SMC, were PCGG representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>There can be no dispute, as petitioner PCGG submits, about&nbsp; the Compromise Agreement between the SMC and the UCPB groups being a private agreement between the ostensible owners of the subject SMC shares. We can also concede that the same agreement, notwithstanding the maligned arbitration fee provision incorporated therein, does not contain any stipulation or clause which, under Article 1306 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> would vitiate its validity.&nbsp; The conclusion, however, that the petitioner would draw from the above premises that the proposed sale of the “arbitration fee” shares to GSIS is effective and enforceable, especially since the petition for approval of the Compromise Agreement had been withdrawn and, in fact, implemented, does not commend itself for concurrence. For, the petitioner’s posture presupposes that what the SMC and the UCPB groups were dealing with and settling merely were their own private interests. But as we articulated in <span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel</span>, the “Compromise Agreement here involves sequestered shares of stock now worth more than nine (9) billion pesos …. Their ownership is still under litigation. It is not yet known whether the shares are part of the alleged ill-gotten wealth of former President Marcos and his ‘cronies.’ Any Compromise Agreement concerning these sequestered shares … has to be approved by the Sandiganbayan.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The fact that both the UCPB and the SMC groups, pursuant to Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, withdrew, or considered their petition for approval of their Compromise Agreement withdrawn, is of no moment insofar as the necessity of the Sandiganbayan’s approval to lend enforceability to the agreement is concerned.&nbsp; For, in the context of this case, such withdrawal is ineffectual, respondents Cojuangco, Jr., COCOFED and other persons with known legal interests on the subject shares having previously filed their comment on the petition for approval&nbsp; of Compromise Agreement and eventually intervened in the case. In <span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel</span>, the Court expounded on one of the reasons for the ineffectivity, thusly:<br><blockquote>xxx The right of these persons and entities to have their claims heard and resolved cannot be defeated by the petitioners by the simple act of withdrawing their<span style="font-style: italic;"> Joint Petition for Approval of Compromise Agreement and immediately implementing its provisions</span>. To allow the unilateral withdrawal is to allow the petitioners to make a plaything of the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, submit to it when it is in their favor and repudiate it <span style="font-style: italic;">when it threatens to turn against their interest</span>. xxx.<br><br>Petitioners cannot invoke Section 1, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court which provides ‘that a complaint may be dismissed by the plaintiff by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the service of the answer …..’ The provision contemplates a complaint where there is a plaintiff and a defendant with real conflicting interests. The cases at bar are different. They started as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Joint Petition </span>for Approval of Compromise Agreement xxx. Known persons and entities claiming adverse interests on the subject shares were not impleaded. In other words, no party can assail the validity of the Compromise Agreement …. The attempt to bypass these persons … with interests in the subject shares is hardly tenable and the withdrawal of the petition and its immediate implementation when they opposed it makes petitioners’ posture doubly untenable. (Italization in the original)</blockquote>In a bid to lend legitimacy to the sale by the PCGG of the subject shares to the GSIS, the petitioner maintains that such contract would not result in the diminution in value of the sequestered assets but only in their transformation from shares of stock into cash. Petitioner’s contention may be accorded cogency were it not for the fact that the PCGG’s role as sequestrator is to ensure the return of the sequestered property to its rightful owner/s as far as possible in the same condition as it was at the time of sequestration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> with all the fruits and gains to which it is entitled,&nbsp; should allegations of its being ill-gotten cannot be proven.<br><br>In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Republic v. COCOFED</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>&nbsp; the Court observed that the lifting of sequestration in coconut levy companies does not relieve the holders of stock in such companies of the obligation of proving how that stock had been legitimately transferred to private ownership. If the correct lesson of <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. COCOFED</span> has to be pursued to its logical conclusion, may it not be assumed that the lifting of sequestration on the litigated shares of stock before the conclusion of the case for the recovery thereof&nbsp; would not alter the ill-gotten nature of such shares, if ultimately determined to be so? The answer to this poser should be in the affirmative. And here lies the danger should the desired premature lifting of the sequestration order on the arbitration fee shares be granted and the same shares should eventually be successively sold to innocent GSIS members and then to other innocent third parties.<br><br>As a final consideration, it may not be amiss to state that the PCGG arbitration fee shares – also referred to as the PCGG in-trust - for CARP shares - can trace their immediate&nbsp; roots to SMC shares of stocks held by UCPB’s CIIF group of companies which, in turn, owe their existence to the coconut levy funds and the martial law issuances. Be that as it may, no reasonable mind can plausibly escape the conclusion that the arbitration fee shares are the fruits of funds that are <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> public in character, if not part of the ill-gotten wealth then to be recovered pursuant to EO No. 1 in relation to EO No. 14,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> series of 1986. It is up for the Sandiganbayan to determine in Civil Case No. 0033 the nature of the subject shares on the basis of the evidence presented thereat. Until then, it behooves the Sandiganbayan to issue such orders and take measures toward preserving the character of the sequestered shares pending final determination of their true owners. The herein assailed order is such issuance.<br><br>With the foregoing disquisitions, the Court finds it unnecessary to delve on the procedural concerns raised by respondents Cojuangco, Jr. and Lobregat, one of which, relating to the exclusion of the Solicitor General from this petition, has been appropriately addressed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. Desierto</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76] </sup>Notwithstanding the OSG's absence during PCGG's commencement of this <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> proceedings, the underlying petition ought to be entertained. This disposition is prompted partly by the OSG's timely participation in later proceedings, a participation which is tantamount to a ratification of PCGG's act. As the Court explained in the same<span style="font-style: italic;"> Desierto </span>case:<br><blockquote>The preliminary issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the petition should be entertained even though it was filed by the PCGG without the intervention of the … (OSG).<br><br>True, the OSG is mandated to represent the Government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals … in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party.&nbsp; The OSG should have filed the instant petition in behalf of the Republic.&nbsp; However, the “ends of substantial justice” affords an exception thereto.&nbsp; We have ruled if the ends of substantial justice would be better served, and the issues in the action could be determined in a more just, speedy and inexpensive manner, then the petition should be entertained. Even assuming arguendo that the PCGG has no authority to file the petition, its unauthorized filing was ratified, and the defect was cured, when the OSG signed as co-counsel for the Republic in its Consolidated Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></blockquote>There is more reason to apply the above rule to the present case because, here, the OSG is not a mere co-signing counsel but rather the principal signatory in petitioner's culminating pleading – the “MEMORANDUM AND REPLY-MEMORANDUM FOR THE PETITIONER.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>&nbsp; We note that in the signature page thereof, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> two signatures appeared thereat: the first, being that of then Solicitor General Silvestre Bello III himself, and the second, that of Assistant Solicitor General Amparo Cabotaje-Tang.<br><br>We end this disposition with the hope that all parties concerned would now allow the Sandiganbayan uninterrupted opportunity to give repose to Civil Case No. 0033 and, in the process, determine who, by law in the light of the facts of the case, own and is/are entitled to some 33 Million shares of stock of SMC and the stock dividends they have earned through the years starting 1986. In <span style="font-style: italic;">San Miguel Corporation v.

It is high time their owner/s be now established.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever it, or he/they shall be – be they one of parties herein, the nameless coconut farmers or the UCPB or SMC groups should only be a passing concern of the Court. The more important consideration is that the issue of ownership is settled once and for all.
