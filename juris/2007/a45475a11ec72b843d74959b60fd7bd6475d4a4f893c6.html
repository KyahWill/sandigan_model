				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Assailed in the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are the November 23, 2000 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and July 26, 2001 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 57163.<br><br>The antecedent facts are not disputed.<br><br>At around 1:45 in the afternoon of March 14, 1995, a vehicular accident took place along the National Highway, Barangay Dolo, Bansalan, Davao del Sur, involving a cargo truck owned and operated by Godofredo Rapacon and driven by Rene Gucon (respondents);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>and   a bus, owned and operated by Weena Express, Inc. (petitioner), a domestic corporation, and driven by Sofonias Datulayta (Datulayta).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The vehicular accident resulted in the death of a bystander, injuries to some bus passengers and damage to the cargo truck.<br><br>Respondents demanded payment of damages against petitioner but the latter did not heed said demands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  On July 26, 1995, respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 18, Cotabato, a Complaint for Damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> against petitioner. Summons and copies of the complaint and its annexes were served on petitioner on August 4, 1995. Based on the Sheriff’s Return of Service,  service of summons was made upon petitioner on August 4, 1995 thru claim employee Rolando Devera (Devera), who voluntarily received copies of the same and claimed to be authorized to receive them for and in behalf of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Attempts were made to serve summons on Datulayta but to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>When petitioner failed to file its answer to the complaint within the reglementary period, respondents filed with the RTC a motion to declare petitioner in default, which the RTC granted in an Order dated September 6, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  Hence, respondents presented their evidence <i>ex-parte</i>.<br><br>On October 6, 1996, petitioner asked the RTC to lift the order of default, explaining that it was due to the simple negligence of Devera that it failed to receive the summons and file an answer. The RTC refused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which respondents opposed.  The RTC denied the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Solely on the basis of respondents’ evidence, the RTC rendered a Decision dated March 10, 1997, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs against the defendants, sentencing the latter jointly and solidarily:<br><ol><li>To pay plaintiff Godofredo Rapacon P162,430.00 for repairs and replacement of the damaged parts of his cargo truck; P100,000.00 for loss of income; and P6,500.00 for expenses incurred for retrieving his cargo truck from the creek;<br><br></li><li>To pay plaintiff Rene Gucon P19,200.00 for loss of income;<br><br></li><li>To pay plaintiffs Rapacon and Gucon P50,000.00 exemplary damages; P10,000.00 litigation expenses; P30,000.00 attorney’s fees and P1,000.00 court appearances fees, to be computed based on the record; and the costs of this suit.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner and Datulayta appealed to the CA, arguing that the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over their persons because the summons was not properly served on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In the November 23, 2000 Decision assailed herein, the CA dismissed the complaint against Datulayta for failure of the RTC to acquire jurisdiction over him. The CA, however, affirmed the jurisdiction of the RTC over petitioner and upheld the RTC Decision with the following modification:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that it is declared VOID insofar as defendant Sofonias Datulayta is concerned, and that the compensation for loss of income awarded to plaintiffs-appellees is DELETED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the CA denied the motion in the assailed Resolution dated July 26, 2001.<br><br>Hence, the present recourse by petitioner on the sole ground that the CA erred in ruling that the trial court acquired jurisdiction over it even when there was no valid service of summons upon it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>In affirming the jurisdiction of the RTC over petitioner, the CA held:<br><blockquote>Defendant-appellant corporation contends that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over it due to improper service of summons.  Specifically, it insists that the summons and copy of the complaint were served on it through a mere claim employee.<br><br>Section 13, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17] </sup>provides:<br><br>Sec. 13. Service upon private domestic corporation or partnership. If the defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines or a partnership duly registered, service may be made on the president, manager, secretary, cashier, agent or any of its directors.<br><br>x x x<br><br>In the case at bench, it is admitted that the summons and copy of the complaint were served on defendant-corporation through its claim employee, Rolando Devera. Devera falls squarely under the term “agent” who is authorized by law to receive the processes of the Court for defendant corporation. As a claim employee, Devera’s primary duty is to follow up cases filed by and against defendant corporation.  Hence, service of summons through him is proper and binding on the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner, however, insists that Devera’s position with petitioner is that of claim employee who does not belong to the managerial staff, but is considered as rank and file employee;  and that being an ordinary rank and file employee, Devera’s employment does not fall under the term “agent”; hence, service of summons upon him does not bind the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The CA is correct.<br><br>The procedural rule operative at the time of the filing of  the complaint for damages was Section 13, Rule 14 of the (1964) Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 13.  <i>Service upon private domestic corporation or partnership</i>. – If the defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines or a partnership duly registered, service may be made on the president, manager, secretary, cashier, agent, or any of its directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>In <i>Villa Rey Transit, Inc. v. Far East Motor Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22] </sup>we characterized an agent in the contemplation of Rule 14 under the (1964) Rules of Court, as a representative so integrated with the corporation sued as to make it <i>a priori</i> supposable that he will realize his responsibilities and know what he should do with any legal papers served on him;  one who performs vital functions in the corporation that it would be reasonable to presume that he would be able to discern the importance of papers delivered to him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and be responsible enough to transmit the same to the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner virtually admitted that the role of Devera in its operations is that of a representative in relation to cases involving it.  In its Motion to Lift the Order of Default, petitioner alleged that it failed to file an answer due to the purported simple negligence of Devera who “x x x forgot to indorse the summons and copy of the complaint to the management due to his hectic schedule <b><i>in making follow-up of cases filed by and against the corporation</i></b>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Such statement amounts to an admission that Devera regularly indorses summonses and complaints to petitioner and attends to cases involving the latter.<br><br>In addition, in his August 4, 1995 Return, the sheriff certified that Devera claimed to have the authority to receive summons for petitioner. Such statement from the sheriff deserves credence, in the absence of clear proof to the contrary. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Thus, Devera is properly considered by the RTC and the CA as an agent of petitioner within the meaning of Rule 14.  Petitioner does not dispute the Sheriff’s Return<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that he served the summons on Devera, the claim employee of petitioner.  Neither did petitioner refute in its present petition the finding of the CA that Devera’s primary duty is to follow up cases filed by and against petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that he possesses sufficient discernment of the importance of the summons and of his responsibility to transmit them to petitioner.<br><br>Against such array of evidence, petitioner’s denial that Devera is its agent does not inspire belief.  The CA committed no reversible error in holding that a summons was properly served on petitioner thru its agent Devera, and that such service of summons effectively placed petitioner under the jurisdiction of the trial court.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Double costs against petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><i>Ynares-Santiago, (Chairperson), Chico-Nazario, Nachura,</i> and <i>Azcuna</i><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</span></sup><i>, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</span></sup> As replacement of Associate Justice Ruben T.
