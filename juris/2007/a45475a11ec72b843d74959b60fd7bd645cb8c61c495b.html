No. 137785 and which Partial Agreement was, by NPC’s information, submitted before the appellate court.&nbsp; The NPC thus prays that this Court consider the said Partial Compromise Agreement in the resolution of this case.<br><br>Just compensation is to be determined as of the date of the taking of the property or the filing of the complaint whichever comes first.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; In the case at bar, just compensation should thus be determined as of July 12, 1995 when the expropriation case was filed before the trial court.<br><br>The Commissioners Valuation Report – upon which the trial court’s decision, as well as the Compromise Agreement between NPC and Romonafe, was based – took into account, in appraising the value of &nbsp;Romonafe’s property, among other considerations, “desirability, neighborhood, utility, size and time element, the prevailing market value [at] <span style="font-weight: bold;">the time of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appraisal</span> of the property</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In demurring to the Commissioners Valuation Report, NPC claims that the properties of Romonafe was valued at P1,500 per square meter in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1995</span>.&nbsp; It cites above-mentioned PAC Resolution No. 08-95.&nbsp; Romonafe contends, however, that PAC Resolution 07-97 assessed its property at P3,500 per square meter.&nbsp; Such contention deserves no consideration.&nbsp; As the OSG points out:<br><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">First.</span>&nbsp; The third perambulatory clause of PAC Resolution No. 07-97 (amending PAC Resolution No. 08-95) states:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">WHEREAS, Romonafe Corporation had submitted additional data/information which were not readily available to and duly considered by the committee during the appraisal on October 25, 1995 xxx</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>However, the plain language of PAC Resolution No. 08-95 belies the afore-quoted declaration in PAC Resolution No. 07-97 with regard to the availability of the xxx data in 1995:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>WHEREAS, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after a thorough discussion and careful analysis</span> of the narrative reports submitted by the Municipal Appraisal Committee of the concerned Municipalities, the Provincial Appraisal Committee has established the fair market value on the subject parcels of land <span style="font-weight: bold;">A VALUE WHICH IS NOT TOO HIGH ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND NOT TOO LOW ON THE PART OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x</div></blockquote>The [1995] valuation came about after the Provincial Appraisal Committee tasked the respective Municipal Assessors of Bacoor, Imus, and Dasmariñas, Cavite to conduct their own appraisal to determine the current and fair market value of the lands subject thereof within their respective jurisdictions, pursuant to Executive Order No. 132, Series of 1987, as amended.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Second.</span> PAC Resolution No. 08-95 was approved on October 25, 1995.&nbsp; However, petitioner filed a letter of reconsideration thereof only on June 9, 1997 or <span style="font-weight: bold;">after the lapse of almost one (1) year and eight (8) months</span>.&nbsp; If it felt actually and truly aggrieved by the valuation made in said resolution, why did it not immediately object thereto?&nbsp; Surely, petitioner cannot feign lack of knowledge of the existence of the same resolution after its approval considering that the appraisal was, in fact, made precisely in connection with the expropriation proceeding already filed in court on July 12, 1995.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>Third.</span> The panel of commissioners constituted by the trial court for the purpose of determining the just compensation for petitioner and VINE’s expropriated properties conducted an ocular inspection thereof on <span style="font-weight: bold;">January 10, 1997</span>.&nbsp; It then submitted to the trial court a Commissioner’s Valuation Report appraising petitioner’s property at P3,500 per square meter.<br><br>If at all, the above-recommended valuation only indicates that it is, indeed, the valuation of petitioner’s property for the year 1997.&nbsp; It cannot be seriously claimed that it was already the same valuation of the petitioner’s property on July 12, 1995, the date of the filing of the NPC’s complaint for expropriation.&nbsp; Observedly, there is a time lapse of almost one and a half (1 and ½) years from July 12, 1995 to January 10, 1997.&nbsp; It is of common knowledge that the price of real property steadily increased at an amazing speed within the periods material to this case; hence, it is simply preposterous to claim that the market value of petitioner’s property in 1995 remained constant up to 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> &nbsp;(Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote></div>It bears clarification, however, that the 1995 assessment applies only to the 96,963.38 square meters of Romonafe’s property subject of Civil Case No. 1140-95.<br><br>The Court notes that the appellate court failed to pass on NPC’s appeal with respect to the property of Vine.&nbsp; And, as NPC and even Romonafe manifest, the appellate court failed to consider the P<span style="text-decoration: underline;">artial Compromise Agreement between NPC and Vine</span> in its assailed Decision.&nbsp; A remand of the case to the appellate court is thus in order.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>Conformably with the observation in the immediately preceding paragraph, let the records of the case be remanded to the Court of Appeals for it to pass on the merits of the appeal of the National Power Corporation from the trial court’s decision respecting Vine Development Corporation and the Partial Compromise Agreement subsequently forged during the pendency of the appeal between the National Power Corporation and Vine Development Corporation.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> As will be discussed herein, the impleading of Vine Development Corporation as respondent was erroneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> RTC Records, pp. 1-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 108.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 116.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 137.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 142-145.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 153-159.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 153.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 155-156, 158-157.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 166-167.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 180-181.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 182-183.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 196-206.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 206.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 207-208.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, pp.18-26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 77.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 89-92.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 89.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 171.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 178-179.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 188-193.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 200-232.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 87-95.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 91.&nbsp;
