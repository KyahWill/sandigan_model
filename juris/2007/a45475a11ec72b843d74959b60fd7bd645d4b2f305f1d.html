(UBFHAI),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> several homeowners' associations, and residents of BF Homes Parañaque (collectively petitioners) filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for prohibition with an application for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. Petitioners questioned the constitutionality of Sections 11.5, 11.6, 15,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 17,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and 19.6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Ordinance No. 97-08.<br><br>Petitioners alleged that the reclassification of certain portions of BF Homes Parañaque from residential to commercial zone is unconstitutional because it amounts to impairment of the contracts between the developer of BF Homes Parañaque and the lot buyers. Petitioners cited the annotation on the lot buyers' titles which provides that "the property shall be used for residential purposes only and for no other purpose."<br><br>On the other hand, public respondents alleged that the passage of Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is a valid exercise of police power by the Municipal Council of Parañaque and that such ordinance can nullify or supersede the&nbsp; contractual obligations entered into by the petitioners and the developer.<br><br>Meanwhile, El Grande Aguirre Commerce and Trade Organization (EL ACTO), a non-stock, non-profit corporation, intervened as respondent. EL ACTO claimed that its members are lot owners, residents, and operators of commercial establishments along El Grande and Aguirre Avenues in BF Homes Parañaque, who will be affected if&nbsp; Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is declared unconstitutional.&nbsp; EL ACTO asserted that&nbsp; Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is a valid exercise of police power and that petitioners are guilty of estoppel since petitioners endorsed the opening of many of these commercial establishments in BF Homes Parañaque.&nbsp; EL ACTO further alleged that the instant petition should have been initially filed with the Regional Trial Court in accordance with the principle of hierarchy of courts.<br><br>On 28 June 1999, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition. Petitioners moved for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Citing the General Welfare Clause<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of Republic Act No. 7160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (RA 7160), the Court of Appeals held that the enactment of Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 which, among others, reclassified El Grande and Aguirre Avenues in BF Homes Parañaque as commercial zones, was a valid exercise of police power by the Municipality of&nbsp; Parañaque.<br><br>The Court of Appeals took judicial notice of the fact that El Grande and Aguirre Avenues are main streets of BF Homes Parañaque which have long been commercialized, thus:<br><blockquote>The declaration of El Grande and Aguirre Avenues as commercial zones through Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is an exercise of police power.<br><br>Obviously, because of the rapid and tremendous increase in population, the needs of the homeowners in the BF Parañaque Subdivision grew. The commercial zones in the area proved inadequate to service the needs of its residents. There was therefore a need to open more commercial districts. In fact, records show that several homeowners along El Grande and Aguirre Avenues converted their residences into business establishments. El Acto's members are among them.<br><br>Aside from the increasing number of commercial establishments therein, judicial notice may be taken of the fact that El Grande and Aguirre Avenues are main thoroughfares of BF Homes Parañaque which have long been commercialized. The local government therefore responded to these changes in the community by enacting Ordinance No. 97-08 x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioners raise the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether R.A. 7160, the Local Government Code of 1991 has repealed PD 957, the Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree;</li><li>Whether the power of local government units to enact comprehensive zoning ordinances has legal limitations;</li><li>Whether Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is a legitimate exercise of police power;</li><li>Whether Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is constitutional considering that it impairs a contractual obligation annotated in homeowners' titles and violates the doctrine of separation of powers;</li><li>Whether Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is enforceable pending review by the MMDA, the Metro Manila Mayor's Council and the HLURB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The resolution of these issues turns on the validity of Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Court</span><br></div><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Power to Enact Zoning Ordinances</span><br></div><br>The Municipal Council of Parañaque enacted Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 pursuant to the provisions of RA 7160 and Executive Order&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 72.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Under Section 447 of RA 7160, the Sangguniang Bayan or the Municipal Council, as the legislative body of the municipality, has the power&nbsp; to enact ordinances for the general welfare of the municipality and its inhabitants.<br><br>Among the functions of the Sangguniang Bayan enumerated under Section 447 of RA 7160 are:<br><blockquote>(2) Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the municipality as provided for under Section 18 of this Code with particular attention to agro-industrial development and countryside growth and progress, and relative thereto, shall:<br><br>x x x x<br><blockquote>(vii)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Adopt&nbsp; a&nbsp; comprehensive&nbsp; land&nbsp; use&nbsp; plan&nbsp; for the municipality:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> That the formulation, adoption, or modification of said plan shall be in coordination with the approved provincial comprehensive land use plan;<br><br>(viii)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the municipality subject to the pertinent provision of this Code;</span><br><br>(ix)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Enact integrated zoning ordinances in consonance with the approved comprehensive land use plan, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations;</span> establish fire limits or zones, particularly in populous centers; and regulate the construction,&nbsp; repair&nbsp; or&nbsp; modification&nbsp; of&nbsp; buildings within aid fire limits or zones in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Code; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>On the other hand, Executive Order No. 72 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.

Before the Municipal Council of Parañaque passed Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> it has been the subject of barangay consultations and committee hearings in accordance with Executive Order No. 72.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Reclassification of El Grande and Aguirre Avenues</span><br></div><br>Contrary to petitioners' allegations, we find Municipal Ordinance&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 97-08 reasonable and not discriminating or oppressive with respect to BF Homes Parañaque. As held by the Court of Appeals, the increasing number of homeowners in BF Homes Parañaque necessitated the addition of&nbsp; commercial areas in the subdivision to service the needs of the homeowners. In fact, several homeowners along El Grande and Aguirre Avenues already converted their residences into business establishments.&nbsp; Furthermore, as found by the Court of Appeals, El Grande and Aguirre Avenues are main thoroughfares in BF Homes Parañaque which have long been commercialized.<br><br>Even petitioner UBFHAI, the recognized umbrella organization of all homeowners' associations in BF Homes Parañaque, acknowledged the need for additional commercial area. Records reveal that as early as 30 July 1989, UBFHAI recommended for approval an "Amended Integrated Zoning Policies and Guidelines for BF Homes Parañaque."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; UBFHAI proposed another commercial zone in BF Homes Parañaque to accommodate the growing needs of the residents, thus:<br><blockquote>Subject to the approval of BF Homes, Inc., the Local Zoning Official/Planning Officer of Parañaque and the Metro Manila Commission and <span style="font-weight: bold;">in recognition of the fact that the subdivision has tremendously grown in size and population since 1983 when the above-mentioned guidelines of the MMC [Ordinance 81-01] were promulgated, such that one commercial zone for the entire subdivision is now inadequate vis-a-vis the needs of the residents, the UBFHAI is proposing another commercial zone in Phase III of the Subdivision, in the vicinity of the Parish of the Presentation of the Child Jesus as follows:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">One lot deep along Aguirre Avenue from Gov.

Contrary to petitioners' allegations, the commercial establishments endorsed by UBFHAI were not mere convenience stores, which Metro Manila Commission Ordinance No. 81-01<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and Municipal Ordinance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. 97-08 allow in residential areas.&nbsp; Among the commercial establishments which UBFHAI endorsed were a trading business,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> electronics repair shop,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> mini-grocery store,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> beauty salon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> school,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> &nbsp;dress shop,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and consultancy or management services business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the reclassification of El Grande and Aguirre Avenues in BF Homes Parañaque as commercial area was reasonable and justified under the circumstances.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Non-Impairment of Contract</span><br></div><br>Petitioners invoke Presidential Decree No. 957 (PD 957),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> otherwise known as the Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree. Petitioners maintain that PD 957 is intended primarily to protect the buyers and to ensure that subdivision developers keep their promises and representations.&nbsp; Petitioners allege that one of the promises of the developer of BF Homes Parañaque is that the property shall be used for residential purposes only. Petitioners assert that the reclassification of certain portions of BF Homes Parañaque from residential to commercial zone is unconstitutional because it impairs the contracts between the developer of BF Homes Parañaque and the lot buyers.<br><br>The Court has upheld in several cases the superiority of police power over the non-impairment clause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The constitutional guaranty of non-impairment of contracts is limited by the exercise of the police power of the State, in the interest of public health, safety, morals and general welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ortigas &amp; Co., Limited Partnership v. Feati Bank and Trust Co</span>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; the Court held that contractual restrictions on the use of property could not prevail over the reasonable exercise of police power through zoning regulations. The Court held:<br><blockquote>With regard to the contention that said resolution cannot nullify the contractual obligations assumed by the defendant-appellee-referring to the restrictions incorporated in the deeds of sale and later in the corresponding Transfer Certificates of Title issued to defendant-appellee-it should be stressed, that <span style="font-weight: bold;">while non-impairment of contracts is constitutionally guaranteed, the rule is not absolute, since it has to be reconciled with the legitimate exercise of police power, i.e., "the power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety and general welfare of the people." Invariably described as "the most essential, insistent, and illimitable of powers" and "in a sense, the greatest and most powerful attribute of government," the exercise of the power may be judicially inquired into and corrected only if it is capricious, whimsical, unjust or unreasonable, there having been a denial of due process or a violation of any other applicable constitutional guarantee</span>. As this Court held through Justice Jose P. Bengzon in <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Long Distance Company v. City of Davao, et al.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> police power "is elastic and must be responsive to various social conditions; it is not confined within narrow circumscriptions of precedents resting on past conditions; it must follow the legal progress of a democratic way of life." We were even more emphatic in <span style="font-style: italic;">Vda. De Genuino v. The Court of Agrarian Relations, et al.,</span> when We declared:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "We do not see why the public welfare when clashing with the individual right to property should not be made to prevail through the state's exercise of its police power."</span><br><br>Resolution No. 27. s-1960 declaring the western part of Highway 54, now E. de los Santos Avenue (EDSA, for short) from Shaw Boulevard to the Pasig River as an industrial and commercial zone, was obviously passed by the Municipal Council of Mandaluyong, Rizal in the exercise of police power to safeguard or promote the health, safety, peace, good order and general welfare of the people in the locality. Judicial notice may be taken of the conditions prevailing in the area, especially where Lots Nos. 5 and 6 are located. The lots themselves not only front the highway; industrial and commercial complexes have flourished about the place. EDSA, a main traffic artery which runs through several cities and municipalities in the Metro Manila area, supports an endless stream of traffic and the resulting activity, noise and pollution are hardly conducive to the health, safety or welfare of the residents in its route. Having been expressly granted the power to adopt zoning and subdivision ordinances or regulations, the municipality of Mandaluyong, through its Municipal Council, was reasonably, if not perfectly, justified under the circumstances, in passing the subject resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Likewise, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangalang v. Intermediate Appellate Court</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court upheld Metro Manila Commission Ordinance No. 81-01, which reclassified Jupiter Street in Makati into a high-density commercial zone, as a legitimate exercise of police power. The Court held that the power of the Metro Manila Commission and the Makati Municipal Council to enact zoning ordinances for the general welfare prevails over the deed restrictions on the lot owners in Bel-Air Village which restricted the use of the lots for residential purposes only. The Court held:<br><blockquote>It is not that we are saying that restrictive easements, especially the easements herein in question, are invalid or ineffective.&nbsp; As far as the Bel-Air subdivision itself is concerned, certainly, they are valid and enforceable. But they are, like all contracts, subject to the overriding demands, needs, and interests of the greater number as the State may determine in the legitimate exercise of police power. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our jurisdiction guarantees sanctity of contract and is said to be the "law between the contracting parties," but while it is so, it cannot contravene "law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy." Above all, it cannot be raised as a deterrent to police power, designed precisely to promote health, safety, peace, and enhance the common good, at the expense of contractual rights, whenever necessary.</span> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Similarly, in this case, Municipal Ordinance No. 97-08 is a legitimate exercise of police power and the reclassification of El Grande and Aguirre Avenues in BF Homes Parañaque is not arbitrary or unreasonable.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> we <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRM</span> the Decision dated 28 June 1999 and the Resolution dated 16 November 1999 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
