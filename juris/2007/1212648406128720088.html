				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative case arose from a memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> an audit team of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) submitted.&nbsp; The audit team reported on the judicial audit conducted in the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 4, Dolores, Eastern Samar (trial court) on 7 October 2004.<br><br>Judge Gorgonio T. Alvarez (Judge Alvarez), who was due for compulsory retirement on 9 September 2005, used to preside over the trial court. In view of his compulsory retirement, the audit team conducted a judicial audit of cases.&nbsp; The audit team found that the trial court had a total caseload of 200 cases consisting of 132 criminal cases and 68 civil cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The audit team found that Judge Alvarez inhibited himself from hearing Civil Case Nos. 3 (206), 53, and 139, and A.M. Nos. 03-1 and 03-2.&nbsp; Civil Case Nos. 3 (206), 53, and 139 were assigned to Judge Arnulfo O. Bugtas (Judge Bugtas), RTC, Branch 2, Borongan, Eastern Samar, while Administrative Matter Nos. 03-1 and 03-2 were assigned to Judge Juliana Adalim-White (Judge Adalim-White), RTC, Branch 5, Oras, Eastern Samar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The audit team found that:<br><ol><li>Judge Alvarez failed to act on 27 cases for a considerable length of time.<br><br></li><li>Judge Bugtas:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>failed to decide Civil Case No. 3 (206) within the reglementary 90-day period;<br><br></li><li>failed to resolve pending incidents in Civil Case No. 53 for more than four years; and<br><br></li><li>failed to resolve a motion for reconsideration in Civil Case No. 139.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Judge Adalim-White failed to act on A.M. Nos. 03-1 and 03-2 for a considerable length of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></li></ol>The audit team also found that Judge Bugtas accepted the bail bonds in Criminal Case Nos. 393 and 358, both of which were pending before Judge Alvarez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. 393, the supposed surety, Esperanza G. Aseo (Aseo), filed with Judge Alvarez an affidavit of disclaimer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated 28 January 2004 stating that (1) she did not know the accused, neither was she related to him; (2) the use of her property as bail bond was unauthorized;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) the signature on the property bond was forged; (4) she did not sign as a surety; (5) her real signature was different from the signature on the property bond; (6) she did not sign her name as "Esperanza Galo," but as "Esperanza G. Aseo"; (7) "Galo" was her maiden name while "Aseo" was her family name; and (8) the truthfulness of the property bond was questionable because copies of the tax declaration and original certificate of title over the property were not attached to the bond.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 358, Judge Bugtas accepted the bail bond on 9 December 1999 and, on the same day, then officer-in-charge Ernesto C. Quitorio (Quitorio), now legal researcher, RTC, Branch 2, Borongan, Eastern Samar signed the order of release.&nbsp; Judge Bugtas and Quitorio did not forward the bail, order of release, and other supporting papers to Judge Alvarez until after a subpoena duces tecum was issued on 29 January 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Thus, the audit team recommended to the OCA to:<br><ol><li>Direct Judge Alvarez to explain his failure to act on the 27 cases for a considerable length of time, act on these cases, and submit to the Court a copy of his decisions, resolutions, orders, and other documents.<br><br></li><li>Direct Judge Bugtas to:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>explain his failure to decide Civil Case No. 3 (206) within the 90-day reglementary period, decide the case, and submit to the Court a copy of his decision;<br><br></li><li>explain his failure to resolve the pending incidents in Civil Case No. 53 for more than four years, resolve the incidents, and submit to the Court a copy of his orders;<br><br></li><li>explain his acceptance of the bail bonds in Criminal Case Nos. 393 and 358;<br><br></li><li>explain his order to release the accused in Criminal Case No. 393 on the strength of a spurious property bond; and<br><br></li><li>resolve the motion for reconsideration in Civil Case No. 139 and submit to the Court a copy of his order.<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Direct Judge Bugtas and Quitorio to explain their failure to forward the bail, order of release, and other supporting papers in Criminal Case No. 358.<br><br></li><li>Direct Judge Adalim-White to:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>explain her failure to act on A.M.

On Criminal Case No. 393, Judge Alvarez stated that he issued several orders for the arrest of the accused and forfeiture of the property bond after the supposed surety, one Esperanza Galo, failed to produce the accused before the trial court.&nbsp; Thereafter, Aseo filed with Judge Alvarez the affidavit of disclaimer dated 28 January 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Judge Alvarez directed Aseo to furnish the trial court a copy of her voter's affidavit.&nbsp; He then compared Aseo's signatures on her voter's affidavit and affidavit of disclaimer with the signature on the property bond.&nbsp; After a very careful study, Judge Alvarez concluded that the signature on the property bond was forged -- the signatures on the voter's affidavit and the affidavit of disclaimer were different from the signature on the property bond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; On 12 May 2004, Judge Alvarez cancelled the property bond and ordered the issuance of an alias warrant of arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On Criminal Case No. 358, Judge Alvarez stated that Judge Bugtas accepted the bail bond and Quitorio signed the order of release on 9 December 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; However, Judge Bugtas and Quitorio failed to forward the bail, order of release, and other supporting papers to Judge Alvarez until after a subpoena duces tecum was issued on 29 January 2002.&nbsp; Judge Alvarez directed Quitorio to appear before him and answer questions regarding the bail.&nbsp; Instead of appearing before Judge Alvarez, Quitorio sent a written explanation stating that he did not forward the bail documents because the accused failed to cause the annotation of the lien on the property's certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In its memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated 6 May 2006, the OCA:<br><ol><li>Found that Judge Alvarez had fully complied with its directives when he acted on the 27 cases within the given period and submitted a copy of all his decisions, resolutions, orders, and other documents;<br><br></li><li>Found that Judge Bugtas:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>failed to decide Civil Case No. 3 (206) within the 90-day reglementary period;<br><br></li><li>failed to resolve the pending incidents in Civil Case No. 53 for more than four years;<br><br></li><li>acted without authority when he accepted the bail bonds in Criminal Case Nos. 393 and 358;<br><br></li><li>violated the Rules of Court when he failed to forward the bail, order of release, and other supporting papers in Criminal Case No. 358;

In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated 2 August 2006, the Court required the parties to manifest whether they were willing to submit the case for decision based on the pleadings already filed.<br><br>In his manifestation dated 11 August 2006, Judge Bugtas stated that (1) the Court had no jurisdiction over the instant case because of the approval of his optional retirement effective 31 January 2006, and (2) the Court's attitude towards judges is the reason why there are many unfilled positions in the judiciary.&nbsp; He told the Court to dismiss the instant case outright for lack of jurisdiction and order the immediate release of his retirement benefits.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 11 December 2006, the Court (1) considered Judge Bugtas to have waived his compliance with the Resolution dated 2 August 2006 and (2) dispensed with Judge Alvarez's compliance with the Resolution dated 2 August 2006.&nbsp; In a Resolution dated 26 February 2007, the Court considered Quitorio and Judge Adalim-White to have waived their compliance with the Resolution dated 2 August 2006.<br><br>The Court agrees with the OCA's recommendations, with some modifications.<br><br>Section 15, Article VIII of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> states that judges must decide all cases <i>within three months</i> from the date of submission.&nbsp; In <i>Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted at the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (Branch 1), Surigao City</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote><b>A judge is mandated to render a decision not more than 90 days from the time a case is submitted for decision.&nbsp; Judges are to</b> dispose of the court's business promptly and <b>decide cases within the period specified in the Constitution, that is, 3 months from the filing of the last pleading, brief or memorandum.&nbsp; Failure to observe said rule constitutes a ground for administrative sanction</b> against the defaulting judge, absent sufficient justification for his non-compliance therewith.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states that judges should administer justice <i>without delay</i>. Rule 3.05 of Canon 3 states that judges shall dispose of the court's business <i>promptly</i> and decide cases <i>within the required periods</i>. In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Javellana</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote>A judge cannot choose his deadline for deciding cases pending before him.&nbsp; Without an extension granted by this Court, the failure to decide even a single case within the required period constitutes gross inefficiency that merits administrative sanction.<br><br><b>The Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically Canon 3, Rule 3.05 mandates judges to attend promptly to the business of the court and decide cases within the periods prescribed by law and the Rules</b>.&nbsp; Under the 1987 Constitution, lower court judges are also mandated to decide cases within 90 days from submission.<br><br><b>Judges must closely adhere to the Code of Judicial Conduct</b> in order to preserve the integrity, competence and independence of the judiciary and make the administration of justice more efficient.&nbsp; <b>Time and again, we have stressed the need to strictly observe this duty so as not to negate our efforts to minimize, if not totally eradicate, the twin problems of congestion and delay that have long plagued our courts</b>.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Garcia-Blanco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court held that the 90-day reglementary period is <i>mandatory</i>.&nbsp; Failure to decide cases within the reglementary period constitutes a ground for administrative liability except when there are valid reasons for the delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Civil Case No. 3 (206) was submitted for decision on 10 December 2003; therefore, the decision was due on 10 March 2004. Judge Bugtas decided the case only on 22 July 2005, and only after the OCA required him to do so.&nbsp; If it were not for the judicial audit, Judge Bugtas would have left the case undecided indefinitely.<br><br>Judge Bugtas explained that he incurred the delay because the transcript of stenographic notes was incomplete.&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp; The incompleteness of the transcript of stenographic notes is not a valid excuse for delay in rendering judgment.&nbsp; Judges are required to personally take down notes of the salient portions of the hearings and to proceed in preparing the decisions without waiting for the transcript of stenographic notes.&nbsp; In <i>Re: Report on Judicial Audit in RTC - Br. 26, Manila</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court held that "judges are required to take down notes and to proceed in the preparation of decisions, even without the transcript of stenographic notes as the reglementary period continues to run with or without them."&nbsp; In <i>OCA v. Judge Salva</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote><b>[T]he 90-day reglementary period</b> for deciding or resolving cases submitted for such purposes <b>is reckoned</b> from the date when the last pleading, brief or memorandum required by the Rules of Court or by the court itself is submitted, and <b>not from the time when the transcript of stenographic notes of a case is completed</b> by the stenographer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Judges are allowed, for valid reasons, to ask for an extension of the 90-day reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Judge Bugtas did not ask for any extension.&nbsp; In <i>Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court, Branches 3, 5, 7, 60 and 61, Baguio City</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court held that failure to decide <i>even one case</i> within the 90-day reglementary period constitutes gross inefficiency.<br><br>Aside from the long delay in deciding Civil Case No. 3 (206), Judge Bugtas also failed to resolve pending incidents in Civil Case No. 53 for more than four years.&nbsp; Section 15, Article VIII of the Constitution states that judges must resolve all matters <i>within three months</i> from the date of submission unless the law requires a shorter period. Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states that judges should administer justice <i>without delay</i>. Rule 3.05 of Canon 3 states that judges shall dispose of the court's business <i>promptly</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Sianghio, Jr. v. Judge Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court held that unreasonable delays in resolving pending motions violate the norms of judicial conduct and in <i>Custodio v. Quitain</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court held that unreasonable delays in resolving motions or other incidents are administratively sanctionable.<br><br>In the instant case, Judge Bugtas did not act on the pending incidents for more than four years.&nbsp; Inaction for more than four years is clearly unreasonable. Worse, if the audit team had not conducted the judicial audit, Judge Bugtas would have left the pending incidents unresolved indefinitely.<br><br>Judge Bugtas explained that he incurred the delay because he misplaced the records of the case.&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp; Judge Bugtas' explanation cannot exonerate him or mitigate his inefficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Losing the records of the case constitutes gross negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Judge Bugtas was responsible for managing his court efficiently to ensure the prompt delivery of court services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]&nbsp; </sup>Rule 3.08, Canon 3&nbsp; of the<br><br>Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> states that judges should <i>diligently discharge administrative responsibilities</i> and <i>maintain professional competence in court management</i>.&nbsp; Rule 3.09 states that judges should organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, and require at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity. Judge Bugtas opted to ignore these rules.&nbsp; The audit team had to ask for the assistance of one Atty. Crisolito A. Tavera in looking for the records of Civil Case No. 53, which were later found in a heap of papers. In <i>Sianghio, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote><b>If only respondent judge performed his mandated duty of devising an efficient recording and filing system in his court to enable him to monitor the flow of cases and to manage their speedy and timely disposition, the records of the case would not have been misplaced</b>.<br><br>Canon 3, Rule 3.09 requires judges to manage their dockets in such a manner that the work of their courts is accomplished with reasonable dispatch.&nbsp; However, we would like to emphasize that <b>the responsibility of making a physical inventory of cases primarily rests on the presiding judge</b>.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>This is not the first time Judge Bugtas has been found grossly inefficient.&nbsp; In <i>Montes v. Bugtas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court found him grossly inefficient for failing to decide a case within the 90-day reglementary period.&nbsp; In <i>Montes</i>, Judge Bugtas explained that he incurred the delay because he left the decision in his chamber and forgot about it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; The Court sanctioned him and warned him that a repetition of the same act will be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Section 9, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> classifies undue delay in rendering a decision or order as a less serious charge.&nbsp; It is punishable by (1) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for not less than one month nor more than three months, or (2) a fine of more than P10,000 but not exceeding P20,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Rule 3.01, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states that judges should be <i>faithful to the law</i> and <i>maintain professional competence</i>.&nbsp; Section 17(a), Rule 114 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 17. <i>Bail, where filed</i>. -- (a) <b>Bail</b> in the amount fixed <b>may be filed with the court where the case is pending, or in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with any regional trial judge</b>, metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit trial judge in the province, city, or municipality.&nbsp; <b>If the accused is arrested in a province, city or municipality other than where the case is pending, bail may also be filed with any Regional Trial Court of said place</b>, or if no judge thereof is available, with any metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge, or municipal circuit trial judge therein.&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In <i>Cruz v. Judge Yaneza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote>There are prerequisites to be complied with.&nbsp; First, the application for bail must be filed in the court where the case is pending. In the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, the application for bail must be filed with another branch of the same court within the province or city.&nbsp; Second, if the accused is arrested in a province, city or municipality other than where the case is pending, bail may be filed with any regional trial court of the place.<br></blockquote>In the instant case, Judge Bugtas did not present any proof to show that (1) Judge Alvarez was unavailable, or (2) the accused were arrested in Borongan.&nbsp; According to the OCA:<br><blockquote>The criminal cases were pending before RTC, Branch 4, Dolores, Eastern Samar and <b>there was no showing that Judge Alvarez was absent or unavailable when Judge Bugtas approved the bail bonds in Criminal Cases [sic] Nos. 393 and 358 on </b><b>December 20, 1996</b><b> and </b><b>December 9, 1999</b>, respectively.&nbsp; <b>There is also no proof that the accused were arrested in Borongan to clothe Judge Bugtas with authority to grant bail</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>Since (1) Criminal Case Nos. 393 and 358 were pending before Judge Alvarez, (2) there was no showing that Judge Alvarez was unavailable, and (3) the accused were not arrested in Borongan, Judge Bugtas had no authority to accept the bail bonds in these cases.&nbsp; In <i>Espan</i><i>ï€™ol v. Mupas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the Court held that <i>judges who approve applications for bail of accused whose cases are pending in other courts are guilty of gross ignorance of the law</i>.&nbsp; In <i>Lim v. Dumlao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote><b>The requirements of Section 17(a), Rule 114 </b>x x x<b> must be complied with before a judge may grant bail. </b>The Court recognizes that not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance of the law and that, if committed in good faith, does not warrant administrative sanction, but only in cases within the parameters of tolerable misjudgment.&nbsp; <b>Where</b>, however, <b>the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, not to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law</b>.<br><br><b>Respondent judge undeniably erred in approving the bail</b> and issuing the order of release.&nbsp; <b>He is expected to know that certain requirements ought to be complied with before he can approve [the accused's] bail</b> and issue an order for his release.&nbsp; <b>The law involved is rudimentary that it leaves little room for error</b>. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 358, Judge Bugtas not only wrongfully accepted the bail but also failed to forward the bail, order of release, and other supporting papers to Judge Alvarez as required in the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Section 19, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 19. <i>Release on bail</i>. -- The accused must be discharged upon approval of the bail by the judge with whom it was filed in accordance with section 17 of this Rule.<br><br><b>When bail is filed with a court other than where the case is pending, the judge who accepted the bail shall forward it, together with the order of release and other supporting papers, to the court where the case is pending</b>, which may, for good reason, require a different one to be filed. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>In <i>Naui v. Mauricio, Sr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court held that judges should forward the records pertaining to the bail bond <i>immediately</i> after receiving them. In the instant case, Judge Bugtas accepted the bail bond in Criminal Case No. 358 on <i>9 December 1999</i>. He forwarded the bail, order of release, and other supporting papers only after a subpoena duces tecum was issued on <i>29 January 2002</i>.&nbsp; If the subpoena duces tecum were not issued, Judge Bugtas would have continued to ignore the provisions of Section 19 indefinitely.<br><br>Judge Bugtas explained that he did not forward the records pertaining to the bail because the accused failed to cause the annotation of the lien on the property's certificate of title.&nbsp; This is unacceptable.&nbsp; Section 19 is very clear: "When bail is filed with a court other than where the case is pending, the judge who accepted the bail shall forward it, together with the order of release and other supporting papers, to the court where the case is pending."<br><br>Section 11, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> states that failure of the accused to cause the annotation of the lien on the property's certificate of title within <i>10 days</i> after the approval of the property bond shall be sufficient cause for the cancellation of the bond and re-arrest and detention of the accused. Judge Alvarez could have cancelled the property bond and issued the warrant of arrest much sooner had Judge Bugtas followed Section 19.&nbsp; Moreover, since Judge Bugtas opted to accept and retain possession of the bail bond, albeit erroneously, the least he could have done was to cancel the property bond and issue a warrant of arrest when the accused failed to cause the annotation of the lien within 10 days, yet he did not do so.<br><br>Not every judicial error constitutes ignorance of the law.&nbsp; When the error is committed in good faith, it does not warrant administrative sanction.
