Corpuz who knows all the corporate officers of all respondents; that the veil of corporate fiction may be pierced if it is used as a shield to perpetuate fraud and confuse legitimate issues; that complainant never accepted the change in his position from Vice-President and Plant Manger to consultant and it is incumbent upon respondents to prove that he was only a consultant; that the Deed of Dation in Payment with Lease (Annex “C”) proves that Sta. Rosa took over the assets of Peggy Mills as early as June 15, 1992 and not 1995 as alleged by respondents; that complainant never resigned from his job but applied for retirement as per letters (Annexes “E-1”, “E-2” and “F”); that documents “G”, “H” and “I” show that Eric Hu is a top official of Peggy Mills that the closure of Peggy Mills cannot be the fault of complainant; that the strike was staged on the issue of CBA negotiations which is not part of the usual duties and responsibilities as Plant Manager; that complainant is a British national and is prohibited by law in engaging in union activities; that as per Resolution (Annex “3”) of the NLRC in the proper case, complainant testified in favor of management;

that the law itself provides for retirement benefits; that Patricio Lim by way of Memorandum (Annex “M”) approved vacation and sick leave benefits of 22 days per year effective 1986; that Peggy Mills required monthly paid employees to sign an acknowledgement that their monthly compensation includes holiday pay; that complainant was not made to sign this undertaking precisely because he is entitled to holiday pay over and above his monthly pay; that the company paid for complainant’s two (2) round trip tickets to London in 1983 and 1986 as reflected in the complainant’s passport (Annex “N”); that respondents claim that complainant is not entitled to 13<sup>th</sup> month pay but paid in 1993 and all the past 13 years; that complainant is entitled to moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees; that all doubts must be resolved in favor of complainant; and that complainant reserved the right to file perjury cases against those concerned.<br><br>In their Reply, respondents alleged that except for Peggy Mills, the other respondents are not proper persons in interest due to the lack of employer-employee relationship between them and complainant;

Isidro S. Escano; (3) Atty. Escano holds office at respondent corporations’ address; and (4) all respondent corporations have common officers and key personnel, would not justify the application of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held that there should be clear and convincing evidence that SRTI, FETMI, and Filsyn were being used as alter ego, adjunct or business conduit for the sole benefit of Peggy Mills, Inc. (PMI), otherwise, said corporations should be treated as distinct and separate from each other.<br><br>The Court of Appeals pointed out that the Articles of Incorporation of PMI show that it has six incorporators, namely, Patricio, Jose Yulo, Jr., Carlos Palanca, Jr., Cesar R. Concio, Jr., E. A. Picasso, and Walter Euyang. On the other hand, the Articles of Incorporation of Filsyn show that it has 10 incorporators, namely, Jesus Y. Yujuico, Carlos Palanca, Jr., Patricio, Ang Beng Uh, Ramon A. Yulo, Honorio Poblador, Jr., Cipriano Azada, Manuel Tomacruz, Ismael Maningas, and Benigno Zialcita, Jr.<br><br>The Court of Appeals pointed out that PMI and Filsyn have only two interlocking incorporators and directors, namely, Patricio and Carlos Palanca, Jr.<br><br>Reiterating the ruling of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Laguio v. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court of Appeals held that mere substantial identity of the incorporators of two corporations does not necessarily imply fraud, nor warrant the piercing of the veil of corporate fiction.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also pointed out that when SRTI and PMI executed the Dation in Payment with Lease, it was clear that SRTI did not assume the liabilities PMI incurred before the execution of the contract.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held that McLeod failed to substantiate his claim that all respondent corporations should be treated as one corporate<br><br>entity. The Court of Appeals thus upheld the NLRC’s finding that no employer-employee relationship existed between McLeod and respondent corporations except PMI.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that Eric Hu, as an officer of PMI, should be exonerated from any liability, there being no proof of malice or bad faith on his part. The Court of Appeals, however, ruled that McLeod was entitled to recover from PMI and Patricio, the company’s Chairman and President.<br><br>The Court of Appeals pointed out that Patricio deliberately and maliciously evaded PMI’s financial obligation to McLeod. The Court of Appeals stated that, on several occasions, despite his approval, Patricio refused and ignored to pay McLeod’s retirement benefits. The Court of Appeals stated that the delay lasted for one year prompting McLeod to initiate legal action. The Court of Appeals stated that although PMI offered to pay McLeod his retirement benefits, this offer for P300,000 was still below the “floor limits” provided by law. The Court of Appeals held that an employee could demand payment of retirement benefits as a matter of right.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that considering that PMI was no longer in operation, its “officer should be held liable for acting on behalf of the corporation.”<br><br>The Court of Appeals also ruled that since PMI did not have a retirement program providing for retirement benefits of its employees, Article 287 of the Labor Code must be followed. The Court of Appeals thus upheld the NLRC’s finding that McLeod was entitled to retirement pay equivalent to 22.5 days for every year of service from 1980 to 1992 based on a salary rate of P50,495 a month.<br><br>The Court of Appeals held that McLeod was not entitled to payment of vacation, sick leave and holiday pay because as Vice President and Plant Manager, McLeod is a managerial employee who, under Article 82 of the Labor Code, is not entitled to these benefits.<br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that for McLeod to be entitled to payment of service incentive leave and holidays, there must be an agreement to that effect between him and his employer.<br><br>Moreover, the Court of Appeals rejected McLeod’s argument that since PMI paid for his two round-trip tickets Manila-London in 1983 and 1986, he was also “entitled to unused airline tickets.” The Court of Appeals stated that the fact that PMI granted McLeod “free transport to and from Manila and London for the year 1983 and 1986 does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> characterize it as regular that would establish a prevailing company policy.”<br><br>The Court of Appeals also denied McLeod’s claims for underpayment of salaries and his 13<sup>th</sup> month pay for the year 1994. The Court of Appeals upheld the NLRC’s ruling that it could be deduced from McLeod’s own narration of facts that he agreed to the reduction of his compensation from P60,000 to P50,495 in August 1990 to November 1993.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found the award of moral damages for P50,000 in order because of the “stubborn refusal” of PMI and Patricio to respect McLeod’s valid claims.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also ruled that attorney’s fees equivalent to 10% of the total award should be given to McLeod under Article 2208, paragraph 2 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>McLeod submits the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether the challenged Decision and Resolution of the 14th Division of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 15 June 2000 and 27 December 2000, respectively, in CA-G.R.

The mere fact that Patricio was president and director of PMI is not a ground to conclude that he should be held solidarily liable with PMI for McLeod’s money claims.<br><br>The ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU v. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> which the Court of Appeals cited, does not apply to this case. We quote pertinent portions of the ruling, thus:<br><blockquote>(a) Article 265 of the Labor Code, in part, expressly provides:<br><br>“Any worker whose employment has been terminated as a consequence of an unlawful lockout shall be entitled to reinstatement with full backwages.”<br><br>Article 273 of the Code provides that:<br><br>“Any person violating any of the provisions of Article 265 of this Code<span style="font-weight: bold;"> shall be punished by a fine of not exceeding five hundred pesos and/or imprisonment</span> for not less than one (1) day nor more than six (6) months.”<br><br>(b) How can the foregoing provisions be implemented when the employer is a corporation? The answer is found in Article 212 (c) of the Labor Code which provides:<br><blockquote>“(c) ‘Employer’ includes any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly. The term shall not include any labor organization or any of its officers or agents except when acting as employer.”The foregoing was culled from Section 2 of RA 602, the Minimum Wage Law. Since RANSOM is an artificial person, it must have an officer who can be presumed to be the employer, being the “person acting in the interest of (the) employer” RANSOM. The corporation, only in the technical sense, is the employer.</blockquote>The responsible officer of an employer corporation can be held personally, not to say even criminally, liable for non-payment of back wages. That is the policy of the law.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) If the policy of the law were otherwise, the corporation employer can have devious ways for evading payment of back wages. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the instant case, it would appear that RANSOM, in 1969, foreseeing the possibility or probability of payment of back wages to the 22 strikers, organized ROSARIO to replace RANSOM, with the latter to be eventually phased out if the 22 strikers win their case.</span> RANSOM actually ceased operations on May 1, 1973, after the December 19, 1972 Decision of the Court of Industrial Relations was promulgated against RANSOM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Clearly, in <span style="font-style: italic;">A.C. Ransom</span>, RANSOM, through its President, organized ROSARIO to evade payment of backwages to the 22 strikers. This situation, or anything similar showing malice or bad faith on the part of Patricio, does not obtain in the present case. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Santos v. NLRC</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court held, thus:<br><blockquote>It is true, there were various cases when corporate officers were themselves held by the Court to be personally accountable for the payment of wages and money claims to its employees. In <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU vs. NLRC</span>, for instance, the Court ruled that under the Minimum Wage Law, the responsible officer of an employer corporation could be held personally liable for nonpayment of backwages for “(i)f the policy of the law were otherwise, the corporation employer (would) have devious ways for evading payment of backwages.” In the absence of a clear identification of the officer directly responsible for failure to pay the backwages, the Court considered the President of the corporation as such officer. The case was cited in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Chua vs. NLRC</span> in holding personally liable the vice-president of the company, being the highest and most ranking official of the corporation next to the President who was dismissed for the latter’s claim for unpaid wages.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>A review of the above exceptional cases would readily disclose the attendance of facts and circumstances that could rightly sanction personal liability on the part of the company officer. In <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">A.C. Ransom</span>, the corporate entity was a family corporation and <span style="font-weight: bold;">execution against it could not be implemented because of the disposition posthaste of its leviable assets evidently in order to evade its just and due obligations. The doctrine of “piercing the veil of corporate fiction” was thus clearly appropriate. <span style="font-style: italic;">Chua</span></span> likewise involved another family corporation, and this time the conflict was between two brothers occupying the highest ranking positions in the company. There were incontrovertible facts which pointed to extreme personal animosity that resulted, evidently in bad faith, in the easing out from the company of one of the brothers by the other.<br><br>The basic rule is still that which can be deduced from the Court’s pronouncement in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Sunio vs. National Labor Relations Commission</span>; thus:<br><blockquote>We come now to the personal liability of petitioner, Sunio, who was made jointly and severally responsible with petitioner company and CIPI for the payment of the backwages of private respondents. This is reversible error. The Assistant Regional Director’s Decision failed to disclose the reason why he was made personally liable. Respondents, however, alleged as grounds thereof, his being the owner of one-half (½) interest of said corporation, and his alleged arbitrary dismissal of private respondents.<br><br>Petitioner Sunio was impleaded in the Complaint in his capacity as General Manager of petitioner corporation. There appears to be no evidence on record that he acted maliciously or in bad faith in terminating the services of private respondents. His act, therefore, was within the scope of his authority and was a corporate act.<br><br>It is basic that a corporation is invested by law with a personality separate and distinct from those of the persons composing it as well as from that of any other legal entity to which it may be related. Mere ownership by a single stockholder or by another corporation of all or nearly all of the capital stock of a corporation is not of itself sufficient ground for disregarding the separate corporate personality. Petitioner Sunio, therefore, should not have been made personally answerable for the payment of private respondents’ back salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>Thus, the rule is still that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil applies only when the corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime. In the absence of malice, bad faith, or a specific provision of law making a corporate officer liable, such corporate officer cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities. Neither Article 212(c) nor Article 273 (now 272) of the Labor Code expressly makes any corporate officer personally liable for the debts of the corporation. As this Court ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">H.L. Carlos Construction, Inc. v. Marina Properties Corporation</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><blockquote>We concur with the CA that these two respondents are not liable. Section 31 of the Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68) provides:<br><blockquote>“Section 31. <span style="font-style: italic;">Liability of directors, trustees or officers</span>. - Directors or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith ... shall be liable jointly and severally for all damages resulting therefrom suffered by the corporation, its stockholders and other persons.”</blockquote>The personal liability of corporate officers validly attaches only when (a) they assent to a patently unlawful act of the corporation; or (b) they are guilty of bad faith or gross negligence in directing its affairs; or (c) they incur conflict of interest, resulting in damages to the corporation, its stockholders or other persons.<br><br>The records are bereft of any evidence that Typoco acted in bad faith with gross or inexcusable negligence, or that he acted outside the scope of his authority as company president. The unilateral termination of the Contract during the existence of the TRO was indeed contemptible – for which MPC should have merely been cited for contempt of court at the most – and a preliminary injunction would have then stopped work by the second contractor. Besides, there is no showing that the unilateral termination of the Contract was null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote>McLeod is not entitled to payment of vacation leave and sick leave as well as to holiday pay.

We find it pertinent to quote some portions of Apolinario Posio’s testimony, to wit:<br><blockquote>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also stated that before the period of the strike as shown by annex “K” of the reply filed by the complainant which was I think a voucher, the salary of Mr. McLeod was roughly P60,000.00 a month?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as shown by their annex “L” to their reply, that this was reduced to roughly P50,000.00 a month?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You stated that this was indeed upon the instruction by the Vice-President of Peggy Mills at that time and that was Mr. Philip Lim, would you not?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of your own personal knowledge, can you say if this was, in fact, by agreement between Mr. Philip Lim or any other officers of Peggy Mills and Mr. McLeod?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I recall it correctly, I assume it was an agreement, verbal agreement with, between Mr. Philip Lim and Mr. McLeod, because the voucher that we prepared was actually acknowledged by Mr. McLeod, the reduced amount was acknowledged by Mr. McLeod thru the voucher that we prepared.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, Mr. Witness, you mean to tell us that Mr. McLeod continuously received the reduced amount of P50,000.00 by signing the voucher and receiving the amount in question?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as you remember, Mr. Posio, was there any complaint by Mr. McLeod because of this reduced amount of his salary at that time?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t have any personal knowledge of any complaint, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, that is in so far as you were concerned, he said nothing when he signed the voucher in question?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, you also stated that the reason for what appears to be an agreement between Peggy Mills and Mr. McLeod in so far as the reduction of his salary from P60,000.00 to P50,000.00 a month was because he would have a reduced number of working days in view of the strike at Peggy Mills, is that right?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that this was so because on account of the strike, there was no work to be done in the company?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, you also stated if you remember during the first time that you testified that in the beginning, the monthly salary of the complainant was P60,000.00, is that correct?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And because of the long period of the strike, when there was no work to be done, by agreement with the complainant, his monthly salary was adjusted to only P50,495 because he would not have to report for work on Saturday. Do you remember having made that explanation?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<br><br>Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also stated that the complainant continuously received his monthly salary in the adjusted amount of P50,495.00 monthly signing the necessary vouchers or pay slips for that without complaining, is that not right, Mr. Posio?<br><br>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></blockquote>Since the last salary that McLeod received from PMI was P50,495, that amount should be the basis in computing his retirement benefits. McLeod must be credited only with his service to PMI as it had a juridical personality separate and distinct from that of the other respondent corporations.<br><br>Since PMI has no retirement plan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> we apply Section 5, Rule II of the Rules Implementing the New Retirement Law which provides:<br><blockquote>5.1 In the absence of an applicable agreement or retirement plan, an employee who retires pursuant to the Act shall be entitled to retirement pay equivalent to at least one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole year.<br><br>5.2 Components of One-half (1/2) Month Salary. ? For the purpose of determining the minimum retirement pay due an employee under this Rule, the term “one-half month salary” shall include all of the following:<br><blockquote>(a) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fifteen (15) days salary of the employee based on his latest salary rate</span>. x x x</blockquote></blockquote>With McLeod having worked with PMI for 12 years, from 1980 to 1992, he is entitled to a retirement pay equivalent to ½ month salary for every year of service based on his latest salary rate of P50,495 a month.<br><br>There is no basis for the award of moral damages.<br><br>Moral damages are recoverable only if the defendant has acted fraudulently or in bad faith, or is guilty of gross negligence amounting to bad faith, or in wanton disregard of his contractual obligations. The breach must be wanton, reckless, malicious, or in bad faith, oppressive or abusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> From the records of the case, the Court finds no ultimate facts to support a conclusion of bad faith on the part of PMI.<br><br>Records disclose that PMI had long offered to pay McLeod his money claims. In their Comment, respondents assert that they offered to pay McLeod the sum of P840,000, as “separation benefits, and not P300,000, if only to buy peace and to forestall any complaint” that McLeod may initiate before the NLRC. McLeod admitted at the hearing before the Labor Arbiter that PMI has made this offer ?<br><blockquote>ATTY.
