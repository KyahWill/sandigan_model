The March 1, 2004 order denying its notice of appeal for non payment of appeal fees was erroneous because it had in fact paid the required fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Thus, the RTC, by issuing its March 24, 2004 omnibus order, effectively prevented Equitable from appealing the patently wrong<i> </i>February 5, 2004 decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This petition is meritorious.<br><br><b>EQUITABLE WAS NOT GUILTY <br>OF FORUM SHOPPING</b><br><br>Forum shopping exists when two or more actions involving the same transactions, essential facts and circumstances are filed and those actions raise identical issues, subject matter and causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The test is whether, in two or more pending cases, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of actions and reliefs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Equitable's petition for relief in the RTC and its petition for certiorari in the CA did not have identical causes of action. The petition for relief from the denial of its notice of appeal was based on the RTC's judgment or final order preventing it from taking an appeal by "fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> On the other hand, its petition for certiorari in the CA, a special civil action, sought to correct the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction committed by the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In a petition for relief, the judgment or final order is rendered by a court with competent jurisdiction. In a petition for certiorari, the order is rendered by a court without or in excess of its jurisdiction.<br><br>Moreover, Equitable substantially complied with the rule on non-forum shopping when it moved to withdraw its petition for relief in the RTC on the same day (in fact just four hours and forty minutes after) it filed the petition for certiorari in the CA. Even if Equitable failed to disclose that it had a pending petition for relief in the RTC, it rectified what was doubtlessly a careless oversight by withdrawing the petition for relief just a few hours after it filed its petition for certiorari in the CA — a clear indication that it had no intention of maintaining the two actions at the same time.<br><br><b>THE TRIAL COURT <br>COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE <br>OF DISCRETION IN ISSUING <br>ITS MARCH 1, 2004 AND <br>MARCH&nbsp;&nbsp; 24, 2004 ORDERS</b><br><br>Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote> Section 1. <i>Petition for Certiorari. </i>When <b>any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</b>, and <b>there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law</b>, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br>The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof, copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a sworn certificate of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of Section 3, Rule 46<br></blockquote>There are two substantial requirements in a petition for certiorari. These are:<br><blockquote><ol> <li>that the tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions acted without or in excess of his or its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and<br><br></li><li>that there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<br></li></ol></blockquote>For a petition for certiorari premised on grave abuse of discretion to prosper, petitioner must show that the public respondent patently and grossly abused his discretion and that abuse amounted to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power was exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The March 1, 2004 order denied due course to the notices of appeal of both Equitable and respondents. However, it declared that the February 5, 2004 decision was <b>final and executory only with respect to Equitable.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; As expected, the March 24, 2004 omnibus order denied Equitable's motion for reconsideration and granted respondents' motion for the issuance of a writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The March 1, 2004 and March 24, 2004 orders of the RTC were obviously intended to prevent Equitable, et al. from appealing the February 5, 2004 decision. Not only that. The execution of the decision was undertaken with indecent haste, effectively obviating or defeating Equitable's right to avail of possible legal remedies. No matter how we look at it, the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering those orders.<br><br>With regard to whether Equitable had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, we hold that there was none. The RTC denied due course to its notice of appeal in the March 1, 2004 order. It affirmed that denial in the March 24, 2004 omnibus order. Hence, there was no way Equitable could have possibly appealed the February 5, 2004 decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Although Equitable filed a petition for relief from the March 24, 2004 order, that petition was not a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; A petition for relief under Rule 38 is an equitable remedy allowed only in exceptional circumstances or where there is no other available or adequate remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Thus, we grant Equitable's petition for certiorari and consequently give due course to its appeal.<br><br><b>EQUITABLE RAISED PURE <br>QUESTIONS OF LAW IN ITS <br>PETITION FOR REVIEW</b><br><br>The jurisdiction of this Court in Rule 45 petitions is limited to questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> There is a question of law "when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of facts being admitted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Equitable does not assail the factual findings of the trial court. Its arguments essentially focus on the nullity of the RTC's February 5, 2004 decision. Equitable points out that that decision was patently erroneous, <b>specially the exorbitant award of damages</b>, as it was inconsistent with existing law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>THE PROMISSORY NOTES <br>WERE VALID</b><br><br>The RTC upheld the validity of the promissory notes despite respondents' assertion that those documents were contracts of adhesion.<br><br>A contract of adhesion is a contract whereby almost all of its provisions are drafted by one party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The participation of the other party is limited to affixing his signature or his "adhesion" to the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> For this reason, contracts of adhesion are strictly construed against the party who drafted it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>It is erroneous, however, to conclude that contracts of adhesion are invalid <i>per se. </i>They are, on the contrary, as binding as ordinary contracts. A party is in reality free to accept or reject it. A contract of adhesion becomes void only when the dominant party takes advantage of the weakness of the other party, completely depriving the latter of the opportunity to bargain on equal footing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>That was not the case here. As the trial court noted, if the terms and conditions offered by Equitable had been truly prejudicial to respondents, they would have walked out and negotiated with another bank at the first available instance. But they did not. Instead, they continuously availed of Equitable's credit facilities for five long years.<br><br>While the RTC categorically found that respondents had outstanding dollar- and peso-denominated loans with Equitable, it, however, failed to ascertain the total amount due (principal, interest and penalties, if any) as of July 9, 2001.&nbsp; The trial court did not explain how it arrived at the amounts of US$228,200 and P1,000,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In <i>Metro Manila Transit Corporation v. D.M. Consunji,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> we reiterated that this Court is not a trier of facts and it shall pass upon them only for compelling reasons which unfortunately are not present in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Hence, we ordered the partial remand of the case for the sole purpose of determining the amount of actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br><b>ESCALATION CLAUSE <br>VIOLATED THE PRINCIPLE OF <br>MUTUALITY OF CONTRACTS </b><br><br>Escalation clauses are not void <i>per se</i>. However, one "which grants the creditor an unbridled right to adjust the interest independently and upwardly, completely depriving the debtor of the right to assent to an important modification in the agreement" is void. Clauses of that nature violate the principle of mutuality of contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Article 1308<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> of the Civil Code holds that a contract must bind both contracting parties; its validity or compliance cannot be left to the will of one of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>For this reason, we have consistently held that a valid escalation clause provides:<i> </i><br><blockquote> <ol><li>that the rate of interest will only be increased if the applicable maximum rate of interest is increased by law or by the Monetary Board; and<br><br></li><li>that the stipulated rate of interest will be reduced if the&nbsp; applicable maximum rate of interest is reduced by law or by the Monetary Board (de-escalation clause).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The RTC found that Equitable's promissory notes uniformly<i> </i>stated<i>: </i><br><blockquote> If subject promissory note is extended, the interest for subsequent extensions shall be at such rate as shall be determined by the bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote>Equitable dictated the interest rates if the term (or period for repayment) of the loan was extended. Respondents had no choice but to accept them. This was a violation of Article 1308 of the Civil Code. Furthermore, the assailed escalation clause did not contain the necessary provisions for validity, that is, it neither provided that the rate of interest would be increased only if allowed by law or the Monetary Board, nor allowed de-escalation. For these reasons, the escalation clause was void.<br><br>With regard to the proper rate of interest, in <i>New Sampaguita Builders v. Philippine National Bank</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>we held that, because the escalation clause was annulled, the principal amount of the loan was subject to the original or stipulated rate of interest. Upon maturity, the amount due was subject to legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Consequently, respondents should pay Equitable the interest rates of 12.66% p.a. for their dollar-denominated loans and 20% p.a. for their peso-denominated loans from January 10, 2001 to July 9, 2001. Thereafter, Equitable was entitled to legal interest of 12% p.a. on all amounts due.<br><br><b>THERE WAS NO <br>EXTRAORDINARY&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFLATION</b><br><br>Extraordinary inflation exists when there is an unusual decrease in the purchasing power of currency (that is, beyond the common fluctuation in the value of currency) and such decrease could not be reasonably foreseen or was manifestly beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time of the obligation. Extraordinary deflation, on the other hand, involves an inverse situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Article 1250 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Article 1250. In case an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the currency stipulated should intervene, the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of payment, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.<br></blockquote>For extraordinary inflation (or deflation) to affect an obligation, the following requisites must be proven: <blockquote><ol><li>that there was an official declaration of extraordinary inflation or deflation from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br></li><li>that the obligation was contractual in nature;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and<br><br></li><li>that the parties expressly agreed to consider the effects of the extraordinary inflation or deflation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Despite the devaluation of the peso, the BSP never declared a situation of extraordinary inflation. Moreover, although the obligation in this instance arose out of a contract, the parties did not agree to recognize the effects of extraordinary inflation (or deflation).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The RTC never mentioned that there was a such stipulation either in the promissory note or loan agreement. Therefore, respondents should pay their dollar-denominated loans at the exchange rate fixed by the BSP on the date of maturity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br><b>THE AWARD OF MORAL AND <br>EXEMPLARY DAMAGES LACKED <br>BASIS</b><br><br>Moral damages are in the category of an award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered, not to impose a penalty to the wrongdoer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> To be entitled to moral damages, a claimant must prove:<br><blockquote><ol> <li>That he or she suffered besmirched reputation, or physical, mental or psychological suffering sustained by the claimant;<br><br></li><li>That the defendant committed a wrongful act or omission;<br><br></li><li>That the wrongful act or omission was the proximate cause of the damages the claimant sustained;<br><br></li><li>The case is predicated on any of the instances expressed or envisioned by Article 2219<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> and 2220<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In <i>culpa contractual </i>or breach of contract, moral damages are recoverable only if the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith or in wanton disregard of his contractual obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The breach must be wanton, reckless, malicious or in bad faith, and oppressive or abusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that respondents did not pay Equitable the interest due on February 9, 2001 (or any month thereafter prior to the maturity of the loan)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> or the amount due (principal plus interest) due on July 9, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Consequently, Equitable applied respondents' deposits to their loans upon maturity.<br><br>The relationship between a bank and its depositor is that of creditor and debtor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> For this reason, a bank has the right to set-off the deposits in its hands for the payment of a depositor's indebtedness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Respondents indeed defaulted on their obligation. For this reason, Equitable had the option to exercise its legal right to set-off or compensation. However, the RTC mistakenly (or, as it now appears, deliberately) concluded that Equitable acted "fraudulently or in bad faith or in wanton disregard" of its contractual obligations despite the absence of proof.

For Article 1250 to apply, not only must the obligation be contractual, the parties must, more importantly, agree to recognize the effects of extraordinary inflation (or deflation, as the case may be). Here, despite the contractual obligation (i.e., a loan), neither the loan agreement nor the promissory notes contained a provision stating that the parties agreed to recognize the effects of extraordinary inflation or deflation.
