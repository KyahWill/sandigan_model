Determination of Just Compensation. - In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered.  The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property, as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation."<br></blockquote><u>These factors have been translated into a basic formula in [DAR AO 6-92]</u>, as amended by [DAR AO 11-94], issued pursuant to the DAR's rule-making power to carry out the object and purposes of R.A. 6657, as amended.<br><br><b style="text-decoration: underline;">The formula stated in [DAR AO 6-92], as amended, is as follows:</b><br><br>"LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">LV = Land Value<br>CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br>CS = Comparable Sales<br>MV = Market Value per Tax Declaration<br></div><br>The above formula <i>shall</i> be used if all <b>the three factors are present,</b> relevant and applicable.<br><br>A.1 When <b>the CS factor is not present</b> and CNI and MV are applicable, the formula <i>shall</i> be:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">LV = (CNI x 0.9) + (MV x 0.1)<br></div><br>x x x x<br><br>While the determination of just compensation involves the exercise of judicial discretion, however, <u>such discretion <i>must</i> be discharged within the bounds of the law.</u> Here, the RTC wantonly disregarded R.A. 6657, as amended, and its implementing rules and regulations.

Celada,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court set aside the valuation fixed by the RTC of Tagbilaran, which was based solely on the valuation of neighboring properties, because it did not apply the DAR valuation formula.  The Court explained:<br><blockquote> While [the RTC] is required to consider the acquisition cost of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declaration and the assessments made by the government assessors to determine just compensation, it is equally true that <u>these factors have been translated into a basic formula by the DAR</u> pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of R.A. No. 6657.  As the government agency principally tasked to implement the agrarian reform program, it is the DAR's duty to issue rules and regulations to carry out the object of the law.  [The] DAR [Administrative Order] precisely "filled in the details" of Section 17, R.A. No. 6657 by providing a basic formula by which the factors mentioned therein may be taken into account. <u><b>The [RTC] was at no liberty to disregard the formula which was devised to implement the said provision.</b></u><br><br>It is elementary that rules and regulations issued by administrative bodies to interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce, have the force of law, and are entitled to great respect.  <u><b>Administrative issuances partake of the nature of a statute</b> and have in their favor a presumption of legality.  As such, courts cannot ignore administrative issuances especially when, as in this case, its validity was not put in issue. <b>Unless an administrative order is declared invalid, courts have no option but to apply the same.</b></u> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted) </blockquote> Consequently, as the amount of P2,232,868 adopted by the RTC in its December 21, 2001 Order was<b> not</b> based on any of the mandatory formulas prescribed in DAR AO 6-92, as amended by DAR AO 11-94, the Court of Appeals erred when it affirmed the valuation adopted by the RTC.<br><br>The second and more important issue is the correct valuation of the property. Petitioner asserts that the valuation of P947,956.68 computed by Commissioner Empleo is based on DAR AO 6-92, as amended by DAR AO 11-94, and should, therefore, be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  On this score, the petition fails.<br><br>The pertinent portions of Item II of DAR AO 6-92, as amended by DAR AO 11-94, provide: <br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>There shall be one basic formula for the valuation of lands covered by [Voluntary Offer to Sell] or [Compulsory Acquisition] regardless of the date of offer or coverage of the claim: <br><br></li><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)<br>Where:         LV  = Land Value<br>                   CNI = Capitalized Net Income<br>                   CS   = Comparable Sales<br>                   MV  = Market Value per Tax Declaration<br></div><br>The above formula shall be used if all the three factors are present, relevant and applicable.<br><br>A.1 When the CS factor is not present <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25] </sup> and CNI and MV are applicable, the formula shall be:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">LV = (CNI x 0.9) + (MV x 0.1)<br></div><br>x x x x<br><br>A.5 For purposes of this Administrative Order, the date of receipt of claimfolder by LBP from DAR shall mean the date when the claimfolder is determined by the LBP to be complete with all the required documents and valuation inputs duly verified and validated, and is ready for final computation/processing.<br><br>A.6 The basic formula in the grossing-up of valuation inputs such as x x x Market Value per Tax Declaration (MV) shall be: <br>              <table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="33%"><div align="justify">Grossed-up Valuation Input</div></td><td width="6%"><div align="justify">=</div></td><td width="61%"><div align="justify">Valuation input x Regional Consumer Price Index (RCPI) Adjustment Factor</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The RCPI Adjustment Factor shall refer to the ratio of RCPI for the month issued by the National Statistics Office as of the date when the claimfolder (CF) was received by LBP from DAR for processing or, in its absence, the most recent available RCPI for the month issued prior to the date of receipt of CF from DAR and the RCPI for the month as of the date/effectivity/registration of the valuation input.
