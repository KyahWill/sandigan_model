Velasquez (Ernesto), and his friends were drinking and singing outside the house of Ernesto's parents at Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas when a gunshot rang out.  Ernesto ran towards the road in front of his parent's house and saw Glenn driving a jeepney loaded with several passengers and heading towards the southern direction.  Minutes later, Glenn, who was driving alone this time and heading towards the northern direction, passed again in front of the house of Ernesto's parents.  Ernesto flagged down and asked Glenn who had fired a gunshot earlier in front of his parent's house. Glenn responded, <i>"Wala ka nang pakialam kung sino ang nagpaputok!"</i>  Irked, Ernesto pushed Glenn's left chin with his palm and told the latter <i>"Umalis ka na, bastos ka!"</i> When Glenn was about to leave, he threatened Ernesto, <i>"Humanda ka, babalikan ka namin, papatayin ka namin!"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 1 September 1998, at around 8:00 in the morning, petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto boarded a red Nissan Sentra Super Saloon car with plate number UBU-674 and traversed the southern road of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas. Petitioner drove the car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At about 9:30 in the morning of 1 September 1998, petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto, on board the same car, arrived at the house of Ernesto's parents at Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  Petitioner and Ruperto went out of the car and inquired from Ernesto's wife, Vida Velasquez (Mrs. Velasquez), the whereabouts of Ernesto.  Mrs. Velasquez replied that Ernesto was in Mataasnakahoy.  Thereafter, petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto left and proceeded to the direction of Mataasnakahoy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>At 1:30 in the afternoon of 1 September 1998, petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto reached Mataasnakahoy and parked the car near a chapel.  Petitioner went out of the car while Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto remained inside.  Petitioner then walked towards a group of persons, among them Ernesto, who were playing a card game called <i>tong-its</i> near the chapel.  Petitioner approached Ernesto and asked, <i>"Ikaw ba si Ernesto Velasquez?"</i> Ernesto answered, <i>"Ako nga po."</i>  Petitioner asked him again, <i>"Ay bakit ganoon, bakit mo sinampal agad si Glenn Gonzales?"</i> Ernesto retorted, <i>"Hindi ko sinampal, nilamas ko lamang ang bibig dahil masama ang nalabas sa bibig niya." </i> Subsequently, petitioner called Glenn, who was inside the car.  When Glenn alighted, petitioner told Glenn, <i>"Yon pala namay nilamas lamang ang bibig mo ay anong desisyon mo?"</i>  Without saying a word, Glenn drew a short firearm, approached Ernesto frontally and shot the latter who was sitting at that moment.  Ernesto stood up and tried to run, but he fell towards the ground.  Glenn fired more shots at Ernesto, who was lying on the ground.  Petitioner also drew a short firearm and shot Ernesto once.  When petitioner and Glenn were about to board the car, petitioner noticed that Ernesto was still alive.  Thus, petitioner told Manolito and Ruperto who were at the backseat of the car, <i>"Pare, buhay pa ito, gamitin mo yung mahaba."</i>  Ruperto then handed an M-16 armalite to Manolito. The latter took the armalite and moved to the driver's seat. Thereupon, Manolito shot Ernesto with the armalite.  Ruperto also shot Ernesto with a short firearm.  When petitioner was about to board the car, he brandished his short firearm and shouted, <i>"Sino pa sa inyo?"</i>  Thereafter, petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto left the crime scene on board the car.  Subsequently, several persons brought Ernesto to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Petitioner denied any involvement in the killing of Ernesto.  He alleged that on 1 September 1998, at about 9:30 in the morning, Manolito and Glenn arrived at his house at Barangay II, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas. Manolito and Glenn told him that they will hitch a ride with him in going to Barangay Lumanglipa since petitioner will also go to the said place with his car to buy <i>tilapia</i> from his mother-in-law for the birthday of his son on the next day, September 2.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  While on their way to Barangay Lumanglipa, Manolito and Glenn asked him if they can pass by the house of Ernesto's parents. He agreed. However, upon reaching Barangay Lumanglipa, Manolito and Glenn changed their minds and instead requested him to proceed to the barangay hall of Lumanglipa. While traversing the road leading to the barangay hall, they saw Ruperto in a nearby chapel. Manolito and Glenn told him to stop the car and wait for them. Manolito and Glenn alighted from the car and talked with Ruperto.  Petitioner drove the car a little farther and parked it beside the road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Later, he went out of the car and decided to go to the house of "Pareng Digo." But before he could go farther, he heard gunshots and saw some persons scampering. He went back inside the car and started the engine. When he maneuvered the car towards the road back to Barangay II, Mataasnakahoy, Manolito, Glenn and Ruperto suddenly appeared and boarded the car.  The three, who were nervous and jittery, told him to speed up the car.  He then asked them, <i>"Bakit, bakit ano bang nangyari?"</i> One of the three whom he could no longer recall told him, <i>"Basta idiretso mo at saka na kami magpapaliwanag sayo"</i>  After traveling for a few minutes, one of the three whom he could not also remember directed him to pull over on the side of the road because they will just talk to somebody.  He told the three that he will go ahead and that he was leaving the car to them.  He immediately went out of the car and boarded a jeepney bound for Lipa City.  Upon seeing a telephone booth along the way, he alighted from the jeepney, entered the telephone booth and called his house at Barangay II, Mataasnakahoy.  A person, whom he again failed to recall, answered his call and instructed him to proceed to his house/residence at Sta. Cruz, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, he boarded a bus bound for Manila.  Upon reaching his house/residence at Sta. Cruz, Manila, he slept.  When he woke up the next morning, his wife told him that he was implicated in the murder of Ernesto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After trial, the RTC rendered a Decision dated 13 October 2004 finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder. Thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, ARNALDO MENDOZA, guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as co-principal by direct participation, of the crime of murder, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, with one (1) aggravating circumstance, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH.<br><br>Arnaldo Mendoza is also ordered to pay the heirs of Ernesto Velasquez the sums of P50,000.00, as indemnification for his death, P35,000.00, as actual damages, P100,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay his proportionate share of the costs. For insufficiency and unreliability of the evidence of loss of earning capacity, no award for the same is made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated 25 October 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated 8 November 2004 which were denied by the RTC in its Order dated 24 November 2004.<br><br>Undaunted, petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals. On 30 November 2005, the appellate court promulgated its Decision affirming with modification the RTC decision.  The modification pertains only to the amount of moral and exemplary damages. The appellate court decreed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lipa City, finding accused-appellant ARNALDO MENDOZA <b><i>GUILTY</i></b> beyond reasonable doubt of murder and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death is hereby <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>. With regard to the civil aspect of the case, except with respect to the civil indemnity and actual damages, same is <b><i>MODIFIED</i></b> to read as follows: Appellant is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>However, pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the Amended Rules to Govern Review of Death Penalty Cases, We refrain from entering judgment and, instead, forthwith certify the case and elevate its entire record to the Supreme Court for further review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated 3 January 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> but was denied by the appellate court in its Resolution dated 5 July 2006.<br><br>Before us, petitioner assigns in his Petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Supplemental Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and Supplemental Brief <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN HOLDING THAT THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES ARE CREDIBLE.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN HOLDING THAT CONSPIRACY EXISTS AND THAT AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF EVIDENT PREMEDITATION AND ABUSE OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH ATTENDED THE KILLING OF THE VICTIM.<br><br><center>III.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN HOLDING THAT ACCUSED IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER.<br><br><center>IV.<br></center><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE TOTALLY DENIED ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF HIS DAY IN COURT.<br></blockquote>Anent the first issue, petitioner maintains that the prosecution failed to establish the true identity of the person who shot to death Ernesto; that the prosecution's alleged eyewitness Dante Ciruelas (Ciruelas) did not mention in his affidavit that he saw petitioner shoot Ernesto after the latter was shot by Glenn, whereas during the trial, Ciruelas testified that he saw petitioner shoot Ernesto right after Glenn shot Ernesto; that such is a material and substantial inconsistency which adversely affects the credibility of Ciruelas as an eyewitness; and that Ciruelas's testimony was not corroborated by other prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also asserts that there is a material discrepancy between the testimonies of Ciruelas and the doctor who autopsied the body of Ernesto, namely, Dr. Antonio S. Vertido (Dr. Vertido).  According to petitioner, Ciruelas testified that during the incident, Glenn positioned himself at a distance of one meter in front of Ernesto, who was then seated on a chair and playing <i>tongits</i>, and shot the latter for the first time.  Thus, if Ernesto was sitting and facing Glenn at the time he was allegedly shot by the latter, the bullet that hit Ernesto should have been located somewhere in his chest or in any upper portion of his body and that the gunshot wound should have a point of entry somewhere in the anterior or front portion of Ernesto's body and not at his back or in the posterior portion of his body.  On the contrary, Dr. Vertido testified that, except for the gunshot wound in the right thigh of Ernesto, the entry points of the three other gunshot wounds were located at Ernesto's back or in the posterior part thereby indicating that the assailant was at Ernesto's back at the time the latter was shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further avers that Dr. Vertido's testimony that the three gunshot wounds sustained by Ernesto were caused by an armalite bullet and that the fourth gunshot wound was caused by a .22 caliber bullet is very inconsistent with his other statement that all of the four gunshot wounds sustained by Ernesto have the same diameter; that no bullets and empty shells from the armalite allegedly used by Manolito were found in the body of Ernesto and in the crime scene; and that the deformed slug and empty shells presented by the prosecution were not subjected to ballistic examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As testimonial evidence, the prosecution presented the following witnesses, namely: Reynaldo Velasquez (Reynaldo), Ciruelas, Maximino Guiterrez (Gutierrez), SPO1 Dominador Castillo (SPO1 Castillo), Dr. Vertido, Police Chief Inspector Ruben S. Castillo (Police Chief Castillo) and Mrs. Marquez.<br><br><b>Reynaldo</b>, brother of Ernesto and a resident of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas, testified that he knows petitioner because petitioner and the latter's wife are natives of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  He also knows Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto because they are all residents also of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  He narrated that on 31 August 1998, at about 5:00 in the afternoon, he was with Ernesto and the latter's friends outside their parent's house located at Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas. Ernesto and the latter's friends were then drinking and singing when a gunshot rang out.  He immediately looked on the road opposite his parent's house and saw Glenn driving a jeepney filled with passengers and was traveling on the southern direction leading to the Poblacion of Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  At about 7:00 in the evening, he was buying cigarettes in a nearby store when he saw Glenn, who was driving alone on the northern direction, pass by in front of his parent's house.  At a distance of two meters, he saw Ernesto flag down Glenn.  When Glenn pulled over on the side of the road, Ernesto approached the former and inquired as to who fired a gunshot when he and his visitors passed in front of his parent's house in going to the Poblacion.  Glenn replied <i>"Wala ka nang pakialam kung sino ang nagpaputok!"</i> Irked, Ernesto pushed Glenn's left chin with his palm and told the latter, <i>"Umalis ka na, bastos ka!"</i> When Glenn was about to leave, he threatened Ernesto, <i>"Humanda ka, babalikan ka namin, papatayin ka namin!"</i>  Thereafter, Glenn sped away while he led Ernesto to his own house, which is adjacent to the house of their parents.<br><br>The next day, 1 September 1998, at around 8:00 in the morning, he drove his own jeepney and went to the Poblacion.  On the way, he saw, on the southern part of Barangay Lumanglipa, petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto on board a maroon Nissan Sentra Super Saloon with plate number UBU-674.  Petitioner was the one driving.  He nodded at petitioner, but the latter just looked at him and ignored him.  Since then, he did not see petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>Ciruelas</b>, uncle of Ernesto and a resident of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas, testified that he knows petitioner because the latter's wife was his former classmate and that he also knows Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto for they are all residents of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  He declared that on 1 September 1998, at about 1:00 in the afternoon, he was with a group of persons playing <i>tongits</i> in a table near a road which was four meters away from a chapel at Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  Among the persons present were Ernesto, and certain individuals, namely, Menandro Ariola (Ariola), German Ciruelas (German), Ruel Umali (Ruel) and Petillano Umali (Petillano).  Only German, Ruel and Ariola were playing <i>tongits</i> then, while he, Ernesto, Petillano and some unidentified persons were merely kibitzers or onlookers. At about 1:15 in the afternoon, Ernesto substituted Ariola as one of the <i>tongits</i> players.  At around 1:30 in the afternoon, while watching Ernesto and his companions play <i>tongits</i>, he noticed a maroon Nissan Sentra Super Saloon with plate number UBU-674 approach their place/position.  He saw petitioner driving the said car with Manolito, Glenn and Ruperto on board as passengers.  Petitioner parked the car at a distance of three meters from the table where Ernesto, German and Ruel were playing <i>tongits</i>. Petitioner went out of the car and approached Ernesto who was then seated and playing <i>tongits</i>.  He was then one meter away from the position of Ernesto.  Petitioner asked Ernesto, <i>"Ikaw ba si Ernesto Velasquez?"</i> Ernesto answered, <i>"Ako nga po."</i> Petitioner asked again, <i>"Ay bakit ganon, bakit mo sinampal agad si Glenn?"</i> Ernesto replied <i>"Hindi ko po sinampal."</i> Petitioner once more asked, <i>"Bakit mo sinampal agad si Glenn Gonzales?"</i> Ernesto responded, <i>"Hindi ko sinampal, nilamas ko lamang ang bibig dahil masama ang nalabas sa bibig niya."</i>  Petitioner went back to the car and called Glenn who was inside the car.  When Glenn alighted from the car, petitioner told the former, <i>"Yon pala namay nilamas lamang ang bibig mo ay anong desisyon mo?"  </i>Without saying a word, Glenn drew a short firearm and upon cocking it, a bullet ejected therefrom. Glenn went in front of Ernesto who was then seated and playing <i>tongits</i>, and shot the latter once.  Stunned, he took cover nearby but did not entirely leave the scene, while the rest of the players and onlookers scampered to different directions and hid.  He saw Ernesto stand up and try to run but the latter fell with his right face hitting the ground.<br><br>Glenn fired more shots at Ernesto, while the latter was lying on the ground.  Thereafter, at a distance of more or less two meters from petitioner, Glenn saw petitioner shoot Ernesto once with a short firearm.  When petitioner was about to board the car, he noticed that Ernesto was still breathing. Petitioner then informed Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto that Ernesto was still alive.  Within a distance of more or less four meters, Glenn saw Ruperto, who was then at the backseat of the car, take an armalite and give it to Manolito who was then seated beside the driver's seat.  Manolito took the armalite, sat in the driver's seat, and shot Ernesto several times with the armalite. Ruperto, who was in the backseat of the car, also drew a short firearm and shot Ernesto.  Petitioner then looked around and shouted, <i>"Sino pa sa inyo?"</i> Subsequently, petitioner boarded the car while Manolito sat beside him and Glenn moved to the backseat.  Petitioner drove the car and proceeded to the direction of the town proper.  Afterwards, he and several others immediately approached Ernesto and loaded the latter into a jeepney. They brought Ernesto to Dr. Faller Hospital where he was pronounced dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>Gutierrez</b>, Barangay Captain of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas from 1998 up to 2002, testified that he knows petitioner, Glenn, Manolito, Ruperto and their respective families because they are all natives/residents of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas. He told the court that on 1 September 1998, at around 1:30 in the afternoon, while fixing the engine of his <i>motor banca</i> at the lakeshore of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas, which is about thirty meters away from his house, he heard gunshots coming from the place near his house.  He went to his house to verify the gunshots.  When he was about twelve meters away from reaching his house, he took cover beside a <i>sari-sari</i> store owned by a certain Armenio Ciruelas. He saw petitioner, Glenn and Ruperto holding pistols while Manolito was holding an armalite.  They were four meters away in front of his house. Petitioner and Glenn were standing beside a maroon Nissan Sentra Super Saloon with plate number UBU-674, while Manolito and Glenn were seated at the backseat of the car.  Thereafter, he heard petitioner say, <i>"Pare, buhay pa ito, gamitin mo yung mahaba."</i> Manolito then opened the window of the car, placed the barrel of an armalite outside the window, and fired the armalite several times.  He did not see the person to whom the shots were directed because his view was blocked by the car.  He saw Ciruelas hiding beside the post of a nearby chapel while also watching the incident.<br><br>Later, he heard petitioner utter, <i>"Sino pa sa inyo?"</i> Petitioner, Glenn, Manolito and Ruperto thereafter left the scene.  He then approached the bloodied Ernesto who was sprawled on the ground in front of his house.  He and several persons brought Ernesto to Dr. Faller Hospital.  Since Ernesto was already pronounced dead, he and some companions brought Ernesto's body to the Mataasnakahoy Police Station to report the incident.  Upon the advice of Police Chief Castillo, he instructed Ciruelas to bring Ernesto's body to San Jose, Batangas for autopsy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b>SPO1 Castillo</b>, a member of the Philippine National Police since 1985, testified that in September 1998, he was assigned at the Police Station of Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  On 1 September 1998, he reported for work as duty investigator from 8:00 in the morning of that day up to 8:00 in the morning of the following day.  On the said date, at about 2:30 in the afternoon, he, Police Chief Castillo and other colleagues were in the Police Station of Mataasnakahoy, Batangas, when German reported a shooting incident at Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas.  German told him that the perpetrators were on board a maroon Nissan Sentra Super Saloon with plate number UBU-674.  He and some colleagues alerted and requested the nearby police stations of Lipa City, Malvar, Balete, Tanauan City, Cuenca and San Jose to block the route of the said vehicle and apprehend its occupants.  After being informed that the victim was in the hospital and was already dead, he, Police Chief Castillo and some colleagues went to the crime scene and conducted an investigation.  Upon arriving at the crime scene, they saw a plastic table and three chairs in disarray, and some blood stains near the table.  They also found four empty shells of Super Caliber .38, one live ammunition of Super Caliber .38 and one deformed slug of Super Caliber .38.  These were recovered two meters away from the table. He interviewed Gutierrez and other persons who witnessed the incident. Subsequently, he prepared a sketch of the crime scene and placed, as markings, three parallel lines on the said empty shells and three parallel curving on the live ammunition.  He assured the court that the empty shells and live ammunition recovered from the crime scene came from a Super Caliber .38 because it was indicated on the shells themselves.<br><br>SPO1 Castillo personally prepared the criminal complaint and listed as one of the exhibits attached thereto one empty shell of an M-16 armalite rifle since this was recovered by Police Chief Ruben Castillo from a maroon Nissan Sentra Super Saloon with plate number UBU-674. On 2 September 1998, he was then off-duty when Police Chief Castillo called and told him that the car which fits the description of the car allegedly used by the assailants during the incident was found abandoned in Barangay Magape, Balete, Batangas. Police Chief Castillo proceeded to the said place, towed the car and brought it to the police station of Barangay Lumanglipa, Mataasnakahoy, Batangas. When he reported for duty on 3 September 1998, he saw the car in front of the police station, and Police Chief Castillo handed him an empty shell of an M-16 armalite rifle recovered from the same car.  He then placed his marking "DCC" on the surface of the empty shell and searched the car.  He did not find anything else so he just took a picture of it.  Thereafter, he took the statements of Gutierrez, Ariola and Ciruelas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>Dr. Vertido</b>, Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation, Batangas Regional Office, testified that he conducted an autopsy on the body of Ernesto on the evening of 1 September 1998.

Manolito and Glenn told him to stop the car and wait for them.  Manolito and Glenn alighted from the car and talked with Ruperto.  He drove the car a little farther and parked it beside the road.  Later, he went out of the car and decided to go to the house of "<i>Pareng</i><i> </i>Digo."  But before he could go farther, he heard gunshots and saw some persons scampering.  He went back inside the car and started the engine.  When he maneuvered the car towards the road leading to Barangay II, Matasnakahoy, Manolito, Glenn and Ruperto suddenly appeared and boarded the car.  The three, who appeared nervous and jittery, told him to speed up the car.  He then asked them, <i>"Bakit, bakit ano bang nangyari?"</i> One of the three whom he could no longer recall told him, <i>"Basta idiretso mo at saka na kami magpapaliwanag sayo"</i> After traveling for a few minutes, one of the three whom he could not also remember, directed him to pull over on the side of the road because they will just talk to somebody.  He told the three that he will go ahead and that he was leaving the car to them.  He immediately got out of the car and boarded a jeepney bound for Lipa City. Upon seeing a telephone booth along the way, he alighted from the jeepney, entered the telephone booth and called his house at Barangay II, Mataasnakahoy.

In lieu of the death penalty, the following shall be imposed:<br><br>(a) the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, when the law violated makes use of   the nomenclature of the penalties of the Revised Penal Code; or<br><br>(b) the penalty of life imprisonment, when the law violated does not make use of the nomenclature of the penalties of the Revised Penal Code.<br></blockquote>Notwithstanding the reduction of the penalty imposed on petitioner, he is not eligible for parole following Section 3 of said law which provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. Persons convicted of offenses punished with <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> or whose sentences will be reduced to <i>reclusion</i> <i>perpetua</i>, by reason of this Act, shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, as amended.<br></blockquote>As regards the civil liability of petitioner, we find the damages awarded and their corresponding amounts to be correct.  However, we deem it proper to increase the civil indemnity from P50,000.00 to P75, 000.00 based on prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>  In addition to the damages awarded, we also imposed on all the amounts of damages an interest at the legal rate of 6% from this date until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, after due deliberation, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 30 November 2005 in CA-H.C.
