Appellant thereafter removed her short pants and underwear and tried to insert his penis inside her vagina but failed, drawing him to, while AAA was in a lying position, instead insert his finger inside her vagina and mash her breasts. She boxed appellant but she was subdued by him. &nbsp;And she cried, but appellant covered her mouth, rendering it difficult for her to breathe. &nbsp;Appellant thereafter dozed off to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>AAA did not report the incident as appellant had threatened that he would kill the members of the family if she did.

And while she had the opportunity to report to her classmates and teacher, she did not do so, &nbsp;apprehensive that they might tease her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. C-55120:</span><br><br>Also at nighttime sometime in January 1998, while AAA was sleeping with her five siblings at the upper floor of their house, she was awakened as appellant forcibly undressed her and again succeeded in inserting his penis inside her vagina. She tried to resist appellant's moves by boxing his chest, but to no avail. &nbsp;And while she cried, appellant again covered her mouth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Again, AAA did not narrate the incident to any of her siblings with whom she often quarrelled in the discharge of household chores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> &nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. C-55121:</span><br><br>On the night of February 14, 1998, while AAA was sleeping with her siblings, she was again awakened as appellant touched her vagina. He removed her underwear, inserted a finger and then inserted his penis inside her vagina. She resisted by boxing him but appellant held her hands and told her to give in; otherwise, he would harm her. &nbsp;She was frightened, but she did not cry anymore because she did not want appellant to cover her mouth again to render her unable to breathe. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>She did not also report the incident because appellant had warned her against doing so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. C-55122:</span><br><br>On March 26, 1998, three days before her graduation from grade school, AAA was awakened as appellant took off her clothes and directed her to, as she did, lie down on her side. With appellant at her back, he inserted his penis inside her vagina. She could not offer any resistance, however, on account of her position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While she initially cried, the fear that appellant would again cover her mouth prompted her to stop. After appellant ejaculated, he went to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Every time appellant had sexual intercourse with AAA, he would be kind to her the following morning; otherwise, she expected appellant to beat her buttocks with a fiber glass object,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> &nbsp;the same object which he was using to hit her brother's head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Asked by the defense counsel during cross-examination, on observing her to be "aggressive" in answering the questions he was propounding, whether that was "how [she] [had been] talking within the household," AAA replied in the negative, but explaining that her "aggressive" manner was reflective of her anger at her father for the "<span style="font-style: italic;">ginawang kahayupan</span>" to her and her sister BBB  "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ginahasa niya po kaming dalawa</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. C-55123:</span><br><br>On November 5, 1998, between two and three o'clock in the morning, appellant removed AAA's short pants and had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; She offered no resistance as she was afraid that he would beat her again.

It modified the duration of the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. C-55119, for acts of lasciviousness, the amount of moral damages awarded in each rape case which it increased to <s>P</s>75,000 from <s>P</s>50,000, and the amount of exemplary damages in each rape case which it reduced to <s>P</s>25,000 from <s>P</s>50,000.&nbsp; Additionally, the appellate court awarded the amount of <s>P</s>75,000 in each rape case as civil indemnity.<br><br>In modifying the penalty for acts of lasciviousness, the appellate court explained:<blockquote>The penalty for acts of lasciviousness is <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>. There <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance alleged and proven in this case</span>, the penalty prescribed shall be imposed in its medium period, i.e., from 2 years, 4 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, said penalty shall constitute the maximum term, while the minimum shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the offense, i.e., <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> or 1 month and 1 day to 6 months. Appellant should, therefore, be sentenced to suffer the penalty of 6 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, as minimum, to 4 years and 2 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span>, as maximum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Thus the appellate court disposed as follows:<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 128, convicting accused-appellant Enrique Ceballos of acts of lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. C-55119 and of five (5) counts of rape in Criminal Cases Nos.

In addition to the moral damages awarded by the trial court which is increased to [<s>P</s>]75,000.00 and exemplary damages which is hereby reduced to [<s>P</s>]25,000.00, civil indemnity in the amount of [<s>P</s>]75,000.00 is awarded to the victims, in each of the five (5) counts of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Emphasis and italics in the original)</blockquote>The cases are now before this Court for final review and have been given one docket number.&nbsp;<br><br>By Resolution of November 8, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court required the parties to simultaneously submit Supplemental Briefs if they so desired. Both parties filed their respective Manifestations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that they were no longer filing supplemental briefs.<br><br>In rape cases, the credibility of the victim is almost always the single most important issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> If the testimony of the victim passes the test of credibility, which means it is credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, the accused may be convicted solely on that basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In its Decision, the trial court observed:<blockquote>. . . Though inherently shy, [AAA and BBB] displayed an air of confidence and sincerity in their narration. Their testimony was <span style="font-weight: bold;">straightforward, categorical and convincing</span>. Showing no signs of remorse, they braved the embarrassment and stigma of a public trial, came forward and courageously revealed the dastardly acts of their own father. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At some points during the taking of their testimony, when they were narrating the rape committed on their person by their own father, <span style="font-weight: bold;">both cried</span></span>. This emotional condition displayed by the sisters is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">evidence of the veracity of their claim</span>. The Court sees no reason at all to doubt their narration of what happened during the instances they were defiled by the accused, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no reason at all why these two young sisters would impute so grave a crime as rape</span> against their own father, if the same were not true.<br><br>Indeed, it would be the height of depravity for the two sisters who have no experience of sexual perversity to concoct a scenario that would lead their father on the death row and in the process, drag themselves and the rest of the their family to a lifetime of ridicule and shame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The observations of the trial court, which are substantiated by the records of the cases, deserve the respect of appellate courts.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Apropos</span> is the following observation of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Briones</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><blockquote>. . . [A] daughter would not accuse her own father of a serious offense like rape, had she really not been aggrieved. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Her testimony against him is entitled to greater weight, since reverence and respect for elders is too deeply ingrained in Filipino children and is even recognized by law</span>. . . . That she would accuse her own father of this heinous crime had she not been aggrieved would be absurd.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Appellant's argument that the acts complained of could not have been committed due to the presence of other people fails.&nbsp; As repeatedly held by this Court, lust is no respecter to time and place. The nearby presence of the relatives of the victim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the cramped condition of the room, the presence of other people therein, or the high risk of being caught, have been held as not sufficient and effective to deter the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>As for appellant's allegation that AAA and BBB falsely charged him as he was strict and had had quarrels with his wife CCC, the same was correctly brushed aside by the appellate court as "puerile and . . . too flimsy to merit even scant consideration."&nbsp; Indeed, <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Bidoc</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> teaches:<blockquote>. . . <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[P]arental punishment or disciplinary chastisement is not enough for a daughter in a Filipino family to falsely accuse her father of rape</span>. She would not subject herself to an examination of her private parts, undergo the trauma and humiliation of public trial, and embarrass herself with the need to narrate in detail how she was raped if she was not in fact raped. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It takes depravity for a young girl to concoct a tale of defloration, which would put her own father on death row, drag herself and the rest of her family to a lifetime of shame, and make them the object of gossip among their classmates and friends</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>One of appellant's letters, Exhibit "L," dated July 13, 1999, sent to CCC and children, which reads in part:<blockquote>. . .&nbsp; Nalulungkot ako sa mga pangyayari sa ating buhay.&nbsp; Sana matanggap niyo na ito sa sarili ninyo at <span style="font-weight: bold;">mapatawad na ninyo ako sa aking kasalanang nagawa</span>.&nbsp; Siguro naman alam naman niyo na hindi naman ako likas na masama.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kung nagawa ko man iyong mga bagay na iyon dala na rin ng naging kahinaan ko</span>.&nbsp; Lahat naman tayo ay nagkakamali at ang nangyari sa akin ay kinamuhian ko rin ang aking sarili sapagkat hindi ko alam matagal akong nabilanggo sa bisig ng diyablo na siyang tunay na may kagagawan sa pagwasak sa buhay natin.&nbsp; Alam niyo lahat ng kasalanan ng nagagawa ng tao ay simbuyo ng damdamin na inutos ng diyablo na di natin napaglalabanan sapagkat wala sa puso natin si Cristo.
