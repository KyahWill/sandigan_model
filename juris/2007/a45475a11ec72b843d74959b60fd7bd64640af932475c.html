Respondents assert otherwise.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>Section 17, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 17. <i>Judgment</i>. — If after trial the court finds that the allegations of the complaint are true, it shall render judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the restitution of the premises, <b>the sum justly due as arrears of rent or as reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises, attorney's fees and costs.</b>  If it finds that said allegations are not true, it shall render judgment for the defendant to recover his costs.  If a counterclaim is established, the court shall render judgment for the sum found in arrears from either party and award costs as justice requires.

Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  In this case, Progressive Development Corporation, Inc. (Progressive), as lessor, repossessed the leased premises from the lessee allegedly pursuant to their contract of lease whereby it was authorized to do so if the lessee failed to pay monthly rentals.  The lessee filed a case for forcible entry with damages against Progressive before the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City.  During the pendency of the case, the lessee filed an action for damages before the RTC, drawing Progressive to file a motion to dismiss based on <i>litis pendentia</i>.  The RTC denied the motion.<br><br>On appeal by Progressive, the Court of Appeals sustained the RTC order denying the motion to dismiss.<br><br>Progressive brought the case to this Court.   Citing Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, this Court reversed the lower courts' ruling, it holding that "all cases for forcible entry or unlawful detainer shall be filed before the Municipal Trial Court which shall include not only the plea for restoration of possession but also all claims for damages and costs therefrom."  In other words, this Court held that <u>"no claim for damages arising out of forcible entry or unlawful detainer may be filed separately and independently of the claim for restoration of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>In thus ruling, this Court in Progressive made a comparative study of the therein two complaints, thus:<br></u><blockquote><u>A comparative study of the two (2) complaints filed by private respondent against    petitioner before the two (2) trial courts shows that not only are the elements of <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">res adjudicata</span> present, at least insofar as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the claim for actual and compensatory damages is concerned, but also that the claim for damages</span>—<span style="text-decoration: underline;">moral and exemplary in addition to actual and compensatory</span>—<span style="text-decoration: underline;">constitutes <span style="font-weight: bold;">splitting a single cause of action.</span></span>  Since this runs counter to the rule against multiplicity of suits, the dismissal of the second action becomes imperative.<br><br>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">complaint for <span style="font-style: italic;">forcible entry</span></span> contains the following pertinent allegations —</u><blockquote><u>2.01  On 02 January 1989, plaintiff entered into a contract of lease with defendant PDC over a property designated as Ground Floor, Seafood Market (hereinafter "Subject Premises") situated at the corner of EDSA corner MacArthur Street, Araneta Center, Cubao, Quezon City, for a period of ten (10) years from 02 January 1989 to 30 April 1998.<br><br>2.02  Immediately after having acquired actual physical possession of the Subject Premises, plaintiff established and now operates thereon the now famous Seafood Market Restaurant.

A copy of the lease contract is attached hereto as Annex "A."<br><br></u></li><li><u>Immediately thereafter, plaintiff took over actual physical possession of Subject Premises, and established thereon the now famous "Seafood Market Restaurant."<br></u></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><u>x x x x<br></u></div><ol start="7"><li><u>On October 31, 1992 at around 8:30 p.m., defendant PDC, without the benefit of any writ of possession or any lawful court order and with the aid of approximately forty (40) armed security guards and policemen under the supervision of defendant Tejam, forcibly entered the subject premises through force, intimidation, threats and stealth and relying on brute force and in a thunderboltish manner and against plaintiff's will, unceremoniously drew away all of plaintiffs men out of the subject premises, thereby depriving herein plaintiff of its actual, physical and natural possession of the subject premises.  The illegal high-handed manner of gestapo like take-over by defendants of subject premises is more particularly described as follows:  x x x x<br><br></u></li><li><u>To date, defendants continue to illegally possess and hold the Subject Premises, including all the multi-million improvements, fixtures and equipment therein owned by plaintiff, all to the damage and prejudice of plaintiff.  The actuations of defendants constitute an unlawful appropriation, seizure and taking of property against the will and consent of plaintiff.  Worse, defendants are threatening to sell at public auction and without the consent, of plaintiff and without lawful authority, the multi-million fixtures and equipment of plaintiff and at prices way below the market value thereof.  Plaintiff hereby attaches as Annex "B" the letter from defendants dated August 6, 1993 addressed to plaintiff, informing the latter that the former intends to sell at an auction on August 19, 1993 at 2:00 p.m. properties of the plaintiff presently in defendants' possession.<br></u></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><u>x x x x<br></u></div><ol start="12"><li><u>Defendant's unlawful takeover of the premises constitutes a violation of its obligation under Art. 1654 of the New Civil Code requiring the lessor to maintain the lessee in peaceful and adequate enjoyment of the lease for the entire duration of the contract.

Since actual and compensatory damages were already prayed for in the forcible entry case before the MeTC, it is obvious that this cannot be relitigated in the damage suit before the RTC by reason of <i>res adjudicata</i>.<br></u></blockquote><u><u>The other claims for moral and exemplary damages cannot also succeed considering that <b>these sprung from the main incident being heard before the MeTC</b>. </u>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (Italics in the original;  Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>It bears noting, however, that as reflected in the earlier-quoted allegations in the complaint for damages of herein petitioners, their claim for damages have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no direct relation</span> to their loss of possession of the premises.
