				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court is a Special Civil Action for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court involving certain issuances of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) with prayer for the issuance of temporary restraining order (TRO), status quo ante order and/or writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Petitioner Mayor Salip Aloy Jainal and private respondent Julhatab J. Talib (Talib) were duly certified candidates for Mayor of Indanan, Sulu in the 10 May 2004 elections. During the canvassing, Talib objected to the inclusion of certain returns before the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC). On 20 May 2004, petitioner was proclaimed by the MBC as the winning candidate with an alleged margin of 1,018 votes.<br><br>On 23 May 2004, Talib filed a pre-proclamation case with the COMELEC, docketed as SPC No. 04-169, praying for the annulment of election returns pertaining to twenty-one (21) precincts, representing 3,788 votes, and for his proclamation as the Mayor of Indanan, Sulu.  Talib claimed that his official watchers were asked to leave the precincts before the counting and the preparation of the election returns. Furthermore, the election returns for these precincts did  not  bear  the  signatures  of the members of the Board of Election<br><br>Inspectors (BEI) and his official watchers, a fact which indicates that said election returns were manufactured. Talib also noted that the number of votes cast exceeded the number of voters in Precinct    Nos. 33A and 34A.<br><br>Petitioner, in his memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> prayed for the dismissal of the Talib petition, contending that the latter's allegations were the proper subject of an election protest in the proper trial court.<br><br>The members of the MBC were summoned and directed to file their verified answer to Talib's petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> They failed to file their Answer and, despite notice, they also failed to attend the scheduled hearing of SPC No. 04-169. They also failed to submit the memorandum required by the COMELEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Talib, however, presented an affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> signed by Daryl Kinazo and Roy M. Cuevas, Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, of the MBC of Indanan, Sulu to the effect that Indanan, Sulu was not their original station; that the stations of COMELEC personnel  were  re-shuffled  and  they were re-assigned  to  Indanan,  Sulu  because  the  election officer originally<br><br>assigned there for canvassing was nowhere to be found; that when they assumed their duties as members of the MBC, they noticed that some election returns canvassed by them were materially incomplete while others bore erasures.<br><br>On 22 March 2005, the COMELEC (2nd Division) issued a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is granted in part. The election returns from the following precincts are hereby annulled:<br><ol><li>Precinct    33A (Barangay Kagay)</li><li>Precinct 34A (Barangay Kagay)</li><li>Precinct 17A (Barangay Buansa)</li><li>Precinct 18A (Barangay Buansa)</li><li>Precinct 19A (Barangay Buansa)</li><li>Precinct 20A (Barangay Buansa)</li><li>Precinct 21A (Barangay Buansa)</li><li>Precinct 22A (Barangay Buansa)</li><li>Precinct 9A/9B (Barangay Adjid)<br></li></ol>The proclamation of respondent Salip Aloy Jainal is likewise annulled. The vacancy in the position of Indanan Mayor will be filled up pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Local Government Code.<br><br>The Election Officer of Indanan is ordered to convene the Board of Election Inspectors in the abovementioned precincts, after notifying the parties concerned and after ensuring that the integrity of the ballot boxes and the ballots are not compromised, in order to recount the ballots cast in the abovementioned precincts. After the recount, the new results will be canvassed and the mayoralty winner proclaimed. If a recount is deemed not possible, he is    to make a report to the Commission so that a special election may be immediately scheduled in the affected precincts.<br><br>Let a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court of Jolo, Sulu hearing Election Protest Case No. 5-4-04.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>On 1 April 2005, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of the COMELEC 2nd Division's 22 March 2005 Resolution. On 18 September 2006, the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> denied reconsideration but modified the resolution of its 2nd Division by declaring the election return pertaining to Precinct 9A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of Barangay Adjid as valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Hence, petitioner filed the instant petition, including Hussi Ahajan (Ahajan) as private respondent in his capacity as Vice-Mayor who, under the provisions of the Local Government Code, will fill up the vacancy created by the annulment of petitioner's proclamation.<br><br>On 8 November 2006 and 2 February 2007, Talib<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and Ahajan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> filed their Comments on the Petition, respectively. On 5 December 2006, acting upon the Manifestation and Motion filed by the Office of the Solicitor General, this Court excused it from filing a comment on behalf of the COMELEC in accordance with Sec. 5, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The issues for resolution of this Court may be summarized as follows: (1) whether Talib should have followed the procedure outlined  in  Sec.  20  of  Republic  Act (R.A.) No. 7166 for contesting<br><br>election returns; (2) whether the order of the Regional Trial Court of Jolo, Sulu in Election Protest Case No. 5-4-04 upholding petitioner's proclamation as Mayor of Indanan, Sulu precludes the COMELEC from issuing the assailed resolutions; (3) whether the COMELEC observed the procedure outlined in Sec. 235 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code) for annulling election returns; and (4) whether it was proper for the COMELEC to "pierce-the-veil" of election returns.<br><br>In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Ahajan questions, as an additional issue, the validity of the 5 October 2006 Order of the COMELEC which directed him, as Vice-Mayor, or any ranking councilor to cease and desist from assuming the position of Acting Mayor. Said Order was issued during the pendency of the present petition and after Ahajan had already taken his oath and assumed office as Acting Mayor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> pursuant to the COMELEC resolutions of 22 March 2005 and 18 September 2006.<br><br>On the first issue, petitioner contends that Talib should have followed the mandatory terms of Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for contesting election returns by appealing to the COMELEC with all the attached evidence and forms within the reglementary period.<br><br>Indeed, Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166    provides for the steps, outlined below, to be undertaken by a party contesting the inclusion or exclusion of any election return:<br><blockquote>1) Submitting oral objections and thereupon entering the objections in the form for written objections to be prescribed by the COMELEC;<br><br>2) Submitting evidence in support of the objections within twenty-four (24) hours;<br><br>3) Informing the MBC of his intention to appeal from the MBC ruling on his objections;<br><br>4) Filing with the MBC a written and verified notice of appeal within forty-eight (48) hours from suspension of the    canvass, and taking an appeal to the COMELEC within an inextendible period of five (5) days from filing the notice of appeal.<br></blockquote>However, the provision also requires the MBC to perform certain acts, to wit:<br><blockquote>1) Recording the oral objections in the minutes of the canvass;<br><br>2)  Automatically deferring the canvass of the contested returns and proceeding to canvass the uncontested returns;<br><br>3)  Summarily and immediately ruling on the objections upon receipt of the evidence;<br><br>4) Entering its ruling in the prescribed form and authenticating the same;<br><br>5)  Entering in the minutes of the canvass a party's signified intention to appeal the ruling to the COMELEC;<br><br>6)  Suspending the canvass after canvassing all the uncontested returns and ruling upon the contested returns; and<br><br>7)  Making an appropriate report to the COMELEC immediately upon receipt of the notice of appeal, elevating therewith the complete records and evidence submitted in the canvass, and furnishing the parties with copies of the report.<br></blockquote>Apparently relying on his bare allegation, petitioner does not state in what respect and on what basis Talib failed to comply with Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166. It is incumbent upon petitioner to prove the alleged non-compliance. In the absence of such proof, there is no aspect in the proceedings before the MBC which legally precludes Talib from filing his petition before the COMELEC in accordance with the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. In fact, petitioner did not even raise this issue of non-compliance with Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166 in his Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> filed before the COMELEC.<br><br>There is no dispute that Talib had objected to the inclusion of the election returns in question before the MBC. Petitioner admitted this in his petition before this Court and in his Memorandum submitted to the COMELEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioner further admitted that the MBC had denied Talib's petition to exclude the election returns. But the MBC thereafter proceeded to canvass the election returns, including even the contested ones, contrary to Sec. 20 (b) of R.A. No. 7166, which requires it to automatically defer the canvass of the contested returns. And, as may be gathered from the results of such canvass, the MBC proceeded to proclaim petitioner as the winner of the elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Clearly, Talib did what was required of him by Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166 as far as the circumstances would allow. He made oral objections to the inclusion of the election returns. It was then incumbent on the MBC to immediately make a categorical ruling on the said objections, even without the benefit of additional evidence considering that Talib's basic evidence consists of the questioned election returns themselves, as they clearly depict on their face the stark absence of the printed names and signatures of the members of the BEI in violation of Sec. 212<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the Omnibus Election Code. <span style="font-style: italic;">Res ipsa loquitur</span>. The thing speaks for itself.<br><br>In view of the absence of the names and signatures of the members of the BEI on the returns, the MBC was further duty bound to comply with Section 212 and Section 234<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the Omnibus Election Code. Said provisions respectively allow and require the MBC to summon the members of the BEI to complete the election returns and/or correct the same should it appear that some requisites in form or data are omitted in the election returns.<br><br>Assuming, however, that Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166 was not complied with, Talib cannot be faulted or made to suffer for such non-compliance as it was the MBC who did not comply with its duties under Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166. When Talib made his objections to the inclusion of the contested election returns, there was no other recourse for the MBC except to rule on the objections, suspend the canvass of the contested election returns, and suspend the proclamation of petitioner, in that sequence. Instead of doing so, the MBC, after ruling on the objections, included the contested returns in the canvass and immediately proclaimed petitioner.<br><br>These actions of the MBC rendered it impossible for Talib to comply with Sec. 20 of R.A. No. 7166 any further. It should be noted that the forty-eight (48)-hour period for filing a verified notice of appeal with the MBC is reckoned from suspension of the canvass. The appeal to the COMELEC is also reckoned five (5) days from suspension of the canvass. Understandably, Talib had no other recourse but to go directly to the COMELEC.<br><br>It is worthy of note that what was filed with and resolved by the poll body is a pre-proclamation case. Pre-proclamation cases refer to any question pertaining to or affecting the proceedings of the board of canvassers which may be raised by any candidate or by any registered political party or coalition of political parties before the board or directly with the Commission, or any matter raised under Sections 233, 234, 235 and 236 in relation to the preparation, transmission, receipt, custody and appreciation of election returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The general rule is that a pre-proclamation case before the COMELEC is, logically, no longer viable after a proclamation has been made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> However, this rule admits of exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> as when the proclamation is null and void. The proclamation of petitioner in this case is void for three (3) reasons: (1) it was based on a canvass that should have been suspended with respect to the contested election returns; (2) it was done without prior COMELEC authorization which is required in view of the unresolved objections of Talib to the inclusion of certain returns in the canvass; and (3) it was predicated on a canvass that included unsigned election returns involving such number of votes as will affect the outcome of the election. In this regard, it has long been recognized that among the reliefs that the COMELEC may grant is to nullify a proclamation or suspend the effects of one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Parenthetically, the absence of the required signatures and thumbmarks rendered the election returns concerned materially defective. The crucial circumstance also served as a proper subject of a pre-proclamation controversy, particularly falling under paragraph (b) of Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which the COMELEC resolved in the assailed issuances.<br><br>On the second issue, petitioner calls the attention of this Court to the 3 March 2005 order of the Regional Trial Court of Jolo, Sulu in Election Protest Case No. 5-4-04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> upholding petitioner's proclamation as Mayor of Indanan, Sulu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He claims that the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> should not have ignored the existence of the order in his motion for reconsideration considering that the order is a judicial affirmation of his proclamation as such Mayor.<br><br>Note that Election Protest Case No. 5-4-04 is an election protest case filed by Isnaji, the third candidate for the position of Mayor against petitioner and Talib. Being an election protest or a post-proclamation case, it is markedly different from the case filed by Talib before the COMELEC which is a pre-proclamation case.<br><br>Verily, the order of the trial court in the election protest case does not conflict with nor diminish the legal effect of the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> Resolution of 18 September 2006, invalidating eight (8) of the nine (9) questioned election returns. Particularly, the order is not inconsistent with the directive of the COMELEC to the Election Officer of Indanan to convene the BEI in the concerned precincts for a recount, after notice to the parties and after ensuring that the integrity of the ballot boxes are not compromised. The order of the trial court directed a dismissal of the election protest on a technicality, that is, for failure of Isnaji as protestant to prosecute the protest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> No election returns were examined and no ballots revised. The questioned election returns could not have been examined before the trial court because they were already with the COMELEC at that time in connection with Talib's pre-proclamation case. The trial court perfunctorily considered the report of the Revision Committee and on that basis concluded that it was no longer necessary to continue with the case because of petitioner's "enormous lead" over Isnaji, not Talib.<br><br>Although denominated as a respondent in Election Protest Case No. 5-4-04, Talib could not be expected to participate therein because of his pending pre-proclamation case with the COMELEC. Had he participated in the election protest, his pre-proclamation case would have been deemed abandoned because the general rule is that the filing of an election protest or a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> precludes the subsequent filing of a pre-proclamation controversy, or amounts to the abandonment of one earlier filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Without a doubt, the dismissal of Election Protest Case No. 5-4-04 could not have cast an adverse or prejudicial effect on Talib's pending pre-proclamation case.<br><br>On the third issue, petitioner contends that the COMELEC acted prematurely and precipitately in annulling the questioned election returns as well as his proclamation as Mayor, without first observing the procedure outlined in Sec. 235 of the Omnibus Election Code. Said provision states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 235. When election returns appear to be tampered with or falsified. â”€  If the election returns submitted to the board of canvassers appear to be tampered with, altered or falsified after they have left the hands of the board of election inspectors, or otherwise not authentic, or were prepared by the board of election inspectors under duress, force, intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the member of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers shall use the other copies of said election returns and, if necessary, the copy inside the ballot box which upon previous authority given by the Commission may be retrieved in accordance with Section 220 hereof. If the other copies of the returns are likewise tampered with, altered, falsified, not authentic,<br><br>prepared under duress, force, intimidation, or prepared by persons other than the members of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers or any candidate affected shall bring the matter to the attention of the Commission. The Commission shall then, after giving notice to all candidates concerned and after satisfying itself that nothing in the ballot box indicates that its identity and integrity have been violated, order the opening of the ballot box and, likewise after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved shall order the board of election inspectors to recount the votes of the candidates affected and prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of canvassers as basis of the canvass.<br></blockquote>Contrary to petitioner's contention, the COMELEC fully complied with this Court's exhortation in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dagloc v. COMELEC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that the above-quoted provision be followed to ascertain the will of the electorate. Indeed, the COMELEC did not instantaneously nullify the questioned election returns as claimed by petitioner. Utilizing the first procedure contained in the first sentence of Sec. 235, the COMELEC used other copies of said suspect election returns, namely the election returns submitted by Talib. When this was not enough, it even resorted to an examination of the COMELEC copies. And when it was evident that the election returns for the nine (9)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> precincts were manufactured or fabricated because the printed names and signatures of the members of the BEI were absent, it was only then that the COMELEC annulled the said election returns<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and petitioner's proclamation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The COMELEC thereafter   ordered   the  Election<br><br>Officer of Indanan to convene the BEI in the concerned precincts for a recount, if possible, or to report to the COMELEC the impossibility of a recount so that a special election can be immediately scheduled. Clearly, the issuances of the COMELEC can hardly be described as precipitate and premature.<br><br>Finally, the fourth issue. Petitioner claims that in the absence of strong evidence, the election returns must be accorded <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> status as <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> reports on the count.<br><br>It is a well-entrenched rule in jurisprudence that in a pre-proclamation controversy, the board of canvassers and the COMELEC are not to look beyond or behind election returns which are on their face regular and authentic returns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Chu v. COMELEC,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> aside from reiterating the rule against piercing the veil of returns, this Court intimated that a pre-proclamation case is the proper remedy if the defects and irregularities are apparent from a physical inspection of the election returns.<br><br>In the case at bar, the COMELEC did not have to look at other evidence to conclude that the election returns were manufactured because the defects were apparent on the face of the election returns themselves. In fact, a detailed description of each questioned election return was provided in the Resolution of the COMELEC (2nd Division).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Before we close, we note with disapproval the action taken by petitioner when, on 3 October 2006, he filed with the COMELEC<span style="font-style: italic;"> en banc</span> the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation,</span> praying for an order suspending the implementation and execution of the 22 March 2005 and 18 September 2006 COMELEC resolutions. Clearly, the move is violative of the prohibition against forum-shopping.<br><br>There is forum-shopping when a party seeks to obtain remedies in an action in one court, which had already been solicited, and in other courts and other proceedings in other tribunals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Forum-shopping, an act of malpractice, is considered as trifling with the courts and abusing their processes.  It is improper conduct and degrades the administration of justice.  If the act of the party or its counsel clearly constitutes willful and deliberate forum-shopping, the same shall constitute direct contempt, and a cause for administrative sanctions, as well as a ground for the summary dismissal of the case with prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the relief sought in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation</span> is basically the same as the prayer for a temporary restraining order in the present petition which was still pending resolution by this Court at the time the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation </span>was filed before the COMELEC. However, for as long as the present petition, including the prayer for injunctive relief, pends before this Court, the assailed COMELEC resolutions remain presumptively valid. With the filing of the present petition, only this Court has jurisdiction to nullify the COMELEC resolutions or suspend their enforcement.<br><br>Another violation of the ban against forum-shopping lies in petitioner's failure to inform this Court of its filing of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation</span> with the COMELEC. Such undertaking is prescribed by Sec. 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Rule 8 of the Rules of Court and conformably with such prescription, petitioner assumed the undertaking by executing the certification against forum-shopping in the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>What is worse than petitioner's forum-shopping is the poll body's favorable action on petitioner's <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation</span> despite knowledge of the pending petition with this Court. Such action on the part of COMELEC should not be countenanced and deserves disapprobation.<br><br>Under Sec. 13, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, a decision or resolution of the Commission <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc </span>in Special Actions and Special Cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> shall become final and executory after five (5) days from its promulgation unless restrained by this Court. Clearly, the effects of the 22 March 2005 and 18 September 2006 resolutions can no longer be suspended not only because the resolutions are already final and executory but also because the power to suspend enforcement lies only with this Court. Thus, in granting the motion and ordering the Vice-Mayor or any ranking councilor to cease and desist from assuming the position of Acting Mayor of Indanan, Sulu, it committed what amounts to a usurpation of this Court's prerogative that is to issue the TRO which is precisely one of the reliefs sought in the present petition. It behooved the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> to deny or at least refuse to take action on the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>Quite plainly, the 5 October 2006 order of the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">En banc</span> is null and void for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion, without jurisdiction and in usurpation of this Court's prerogative and jurisdiction. Consequently, the COMELEC should be taken to task for entertaining the <span style="font-style: italic;">Extreme Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation</span> and granting an injunctive relief asked for therein despite a clear showing and despite its foreknowledge, of the forum-shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>With the nullification of petitioner's proclamation, the position of Municipal Mayor of Indanan, Sulu is vacant. The Local Government Code is clear on the matter of succession. Sec. 44 of R.A. No. 7160 and Art. 83, Rule XIV of the Implementing Rules of the Local Government Code governing vacancies and succession, quoted below, apply:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Sec. 44.
