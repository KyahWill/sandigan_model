(RTC) in Civil Case No. 02-843; and</li><br><li>Resolution dated September 11, 2006, denying Land Bank's motion for reconsideration of the July 31, 2006 resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol></blockquote>


The ultimate facts:<br><br>
Sometime in March 1992, after the Philippine Airlines (PAL) was
privatized, Land Bank purchased from the National Government some
75,000,000 PAL shares at <s>P</s>14.3925 per share or for a total consideration of <s>P</s>1,079,437,485.01.<br><br>
Meanwhile, respondents, together with the Philippine National Bank
(PNB), the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the &nbsp;AFP
Retirement and Separation Benefits System (AFP-RSBS), all stockholders
of PAL, &nbsp;and several other parties, formed a consortium in order to
purchase 67% of PAL’s capital stocks which were then being sold by
public bidding. For this purpose, the aforesaid consortium organized a
holding company – the PR Holdings Inc. (PR Holdings) - to hold the PAL
shares of stock.<br><br>
As it were, Land Bank, with the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS) and the National Government, owned 33% of the issued and
outstanding shares of stock of PAL, while respondents and other
stockholders of PR Holdings owned the other 67%.<br><br>
On March 29, 1995, the minority stockholders in PR Holdings filed a
case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), docketed as SEC
Case No. 03-95-5019, seeking the distribution of PR Holdings’ shares of
stock in PAL to its stockholders in proportion to their equity.<br><br>
While the aforementioned SEC case was pending, the said minority
stockholders of PR Holdings agreed to dissolve the latter and
distribute its assets, consisting of PAL shares, to its &nbsp;stockholders
by way of liquidating dividends. &nbsp;However, the majority group composed
of the respondents, joined by Land Bank, PNB, DBP, AFP-RSBS and GSIS,
voted in favor of respondents' proposal to increase PAL's capital
stocks from Five Billion Pesos (<s>P</s>5,000,000,000.00) to Ten Billion Pesos (<s>P</s>10,000,000,000.00). Land Bank, along with PNB, DBP, AFP-RSBS and GSIS, however, have the so-called &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">put-option</span> to sell their PAL shares of stock to respondents and the latter are obligated to buy the same at Five Pesos (<s>P</s>5.00)
per share on the sixth year after the effectivity of the Stockholders’
Agreement executed by and among respondents, PNB and GSIS in 2002. It
was also stipulated in said&nbsp; agreement that respondents’ obligation
under the <span style="font-style: italic;">put-option</span> shall be
guaranteed by Fortune Tobacco Corporation and Asia Brewery Inc., the
two (2) flagship corporations of Mr. Lucio Tan, as joint and solidary
co-obligors of respondents.<br><br>
Pursuant to the aforementioned Stockholders' Agreement, Asia Brewery
Inc. and Fortune Tobacco Corporation, as joint and solidary co-obligors
of the respondents, executed a Guaranty Agreement in favor of Land
Bank, DBP, PNB, GSIS, AFP-RSBS, and the National Government.
Thereunder, Asia Brewery Inc. and Fortune Tobacco Corporation
undertook, in firm and unqualified commitment, to buy-back the PAL
shares of stock at <s>P</s>5.00
per share, should the respondents be unable to perform their obligation
to buy the same. The pertinent portions of the Guaranty Agreement read:
<blockquote>WHEREAS, in a Stockholders' Agreement (the 'Agreement')
executed by and among ASCOT HOLDINGS &amp; EQUITIES, INC.,&nbsp; CUBE&nbsp;
FACTORS HOLDINGS, INC., SIERRA HOLDINGS &amp; EQUITIES, INC., NETWORK
HOLDINGS &amp; EQUITIES, INC. and POL HOLDINGS, INC. (as party of the
First Part); PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE
PHILIPPINES and AFP-RETIREMENT AND SEPARATION BENEFITS SYSTEM (as Party
of the Second Part); GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, LAND BANK OF
THE PHILIPPINES and the REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (as a party of the
Third Part), which is made and integral part hereof by reference, the
Party of the First Part agreed, in par. 4 thereof, as follows:
<blockquote><ol start="4"><li>The Parties of the Second and Third Part shall have the
option to sell their existing PAL shares, inclusive of the PAL shares
acquired as a result of the dissolution of PRHI, to the Party of the
First Part, at <s>P</s>5.00 per share plus premium paid as provided in
par. 1.b of this Agreement, if any, which may be exercised on the sixth
year after the effectivity of this agreement, provided that if on the
fifth year, the net book value of PAL is more than <s>P</s>10 billion
and had a net income of the preceding twelve (12) months, the option
may be exercised on the fifth year. The obligation of the Party of the
First Part under this provision shall be guaranteed by Asia Brewery,
Inc. and Fortune Tobacco Corporation.</li></ol></blockquote>



NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the GUARANTORS hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">jointly and severally guarantee</span>
the performance by the Party of the First Part of its obligation to
purchase the PAL shares of the Parties of the Second and Third Part at <s>P</s>5.00
per shares plus premium paid as provided in par. 1.b of the Agreement
as and when required in par. 4 thereof. In the event that the Party of
the First Part is unable to perform its aforesaid obligation,
GUARANTORS hereby undertake <span style="text-decoration: underline;">irrevocably and unconditionally</span> to purchase from the Parties of the Second and Third Part all of their PAL shares as provided in par. 4 of the Agreement.
</blockquote>
On July 23, 2002, instead of honoring the Stockholders' Agreement,
respondents filed with the RTC of Makati a complaint against Land Bank,
PNB, DBP, GSIS, AFP-RSBS and the Republic of the Philippines, praying
that they be released from the obligation to buy the PAL shares of
petitioner and other defendants therein at <s>P</s>5.00
per share, as earlier agreed upon under the Stockholders' Agreement, on
ground of alleged radical change in the conditions prevailing at the
time the said agreement was entered and the present. &nbsp;In their
complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 02-843, respondents, as
plaintiffs, argued that under the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">“rebus sic stantibus”</span>
embodied in Article 1267, in relation to Article 1174, of the New Civil
Code, the occurrence of unforeseen events alleged in the complaint
(such as <span style="font-style: italic;">“fleet expansion and
re-equiptment of PAL, the pilot strike, the Asian economic downturn,
the devaluation of the peso and the purported reduced demand for air
travel”</span>) released them from complying with their obligation to purchase the PAL shares of stock from the defendants.<br><br>
Land Bank and the other defendants in Civil Case No. 02-843 contended
that the events or circumstances cited by the respondents were not
valid grounds for the latter to be released from their obligation under
the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">rebus sic stantibus</span>.
According to the defendants, when the parties entered into the said
Stockholders' Agreement, they have assumed the risk of deterioration
and/or improvement of the business of PAL, and that the parties made
sure that respondents' obligations to buy the PAL shares at <s>P</s>5.00
per share will be fulfilled exactly under the terms of the same
Stockholders’ Agreement, as in fact respondents expressly stipulated
that their obligation thereunder shall be assumed irrevocably and
unconditionally by Fortune Tobacco Corporation and Asia Brewery Inc.
per the Guaranty Agreement dated August 5, 1996. Additionally, Land
Bank argued that the case was not an intra-corporate dispute inasmuch
as PAL is not at all a party to the suit.<br><br>



In a “Judgment” dated March 15, 2006, the trial court ruled in favor of the respondents, thus:



<blockquote>FOR THE REASONS GIVEN, judgment is rendered in favor of the
plaintiffs and against the defendants, declaring plaintiffs released
from the obligation to comply with defendants' option to sell their
shares in Philippine Airlines, Inc. under Article IV (4) of the
Stockholders Agreement (Annex A, Complaint) executed in May 1996. The
counterclaims interposed by all defendants are dismissed.<br><br>



No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>



SO ORDERED.</blockquote>
On July 4, 2006, the trial court denied Land Bank's motion for
reconsideration. &nbsp;Therefrom, Land Bank decided to go to the CA on a
petition &nbsp;for &nbsp;review. For the purpose, it filed with the CA, on July
25, 2006, a &nbsp;motion &nbsp;for &nbsp;extension &nbsp;of &nbsp;time &nbsp;to &nbsp;file &nbsp;the &nbsp;intended
&nbsp;petition &nbsp;for &nbsp;review.<br><br>

Unfortunately, the motion was denied by the CA in its first assailed resolution dated July 31, 2006 which partly reads:



<blockquote>Consequently, the filing by petitioner of a motion for
reconsideration before the trial court did not toll the reglementary
period to appeal the judgment via a petition for review under the Rule
43 of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</span>,
as amended. The period of appeal having already lapsed or expired, this
Court has no more jurisdiction to entertain the present case, much less
to grant the motion for extension of time to file the intended petition.<br><br>



ACCORDINGLY, the present motion for extension of time filed on July 25, 2006 is hereby DENIED.<br><br>



SO ORDERED.
</blockquote>
On August 16, 2006, petitioner Land Bank filed a motion for
reconsideration of the above resolution urging that even though a
motion for reconsideration of the March 15, 2006 “Judgment” of the
trial court is not allowed under the Interim Rules of Procedure
Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under R.A. No. 8799,
nonetheless it implored the appellate court to consider the filing
thereof as sufficient, &nbsp;“in the interest of substantial justice,” to
suspend the running of the reglementary period to appeal. Petitioner
hastens to add that the March 15, 2006 “Judgment” and the July 4, 2006
Order of the trial court had created a dangerous precedent when said
court upheld respondents' contention that the occurrence of the <span style="font-style: italic;">“fleet
expansion and re-equiptment of PAL, pilot strike, Asian economic
downturn, the devaluation of the peso and the purported reduced demand
for air travel”</span> have absolved them from their obligation to comply with the Stockholders’ Agreement.<br><br>
With its motion for reconsideration having been denied by the CA in its
equally challenged resolution of September 11, 2006, petitioner is now
with this Court <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span>
the present recourse, urging the Court to compel the CA to approve its
motion for extension of time to file petition for review, and,
ultimately, to give due course to its intended petition for review.<br><br>



We <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISS.</span><br><br>
It is beyond quibbling that the assailed “Judgment” in Civil Case No.
02-843 was issued by the RTC in the exercise of its special
jurisdiction over intra-corporate controversies under R.A. No. 8799.
Civil Case No. 02-843 was, therefore, governed by the Interim Rules of
Corporate Rehabilitation and the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing
Intra-Corporate Controversies under R.A. No. 8799, as well as A.M. No.
04-9-07-SC of &nbsp;this Court prescribing the mode of appeal from decisions
of the RTC in intra-corporate controversies.<br><br>



Under Section 8(3), Rule 1 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies Under R.A. No. 8799, <span style="font-style: italic;">motion
for new trial, or for reconsideration of judgment or order, or for
re-opening of trial are prohibited pleadings in said cases</span>.&nbsp;
Hence, the filing by petitioner of a motion for reconsideration before
the trial court did not toll the reglementary period to appeal the
judgment <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> a petition for
review under Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended.
As a consequence, the CA has no more jurisdiction to entertain the
petition for review which Land Bank intended to file before it, much
less to grant the motion for extension of time for the filing thereof.<br><br>
The prohibited motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner with
the trial court did not suspend the period to appeal the RTC’s
“Judgment” of March 15, 2006. Consequently, that “Judgment” became
final and executory 15-days thereafter. When petitioner filed a motion
for extension to file a petition for review in the CA on July 25, 2006,
or one hundred twenty four (124) &nbsp;days &nbsp;after &nbsp;it &nbsp;received the RTC
“Judgment,” there was no more period to extend.&nbsp; Given these undeniable
facts, the CA cannot be faulted for denying petitioner’s motion for
extension. There is no abuse, much less grave abuse, of discretion, to
speak of.<br><br>
Petitioner insists, however, that the CA committed grave abuse of
discretion in denying its motion for extension because the prohibited
pleading it filed in the trial court was still sufficient to suspend
the running of the reglementary period to appeal <span style="font-style: italic;">“in the interest of substantial justice.”</span>
Unfortunately, there is &nbsp;a scarcity of law or jurisprudence to support
petitioner’s novel theory.&nbsp; It is obvious that a prohibited pleading
cannot toll the running of the period to appeal since such pleading
cannot be given any legal effect precisely because&nbsp; of its being
prohibited.<br><br>



In <span style="font-style: italic;">Sebastian and Cardenas v. Morales, et al.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> we held:



<blockquote>Under Rule 1, Section 6 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure, liberal construction of the Rules is the controlling
principle to effect substantial justice. Thus, litigations should, as
much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on technicalities.
This does not mean, however that procedural rules are to be ignored or
disdained at will to suit the convenience of a party. Procedural law
has its own rationale in the orderly administration of justice, namely,
to ensure the effective enforcement of substantive rights by providing
for a system that obviates arbitrariness, caprice, despotism, or
whimsically in the settlement of disputes. Hence, it is a mistake to
suppose that substantive law and procedural law are contradictory to
each other, or as often suggested, that enforcement of procedural rules
should never be permitted if it would result in prejudice to the
substantive rights of the litigants.<br><br>
x x x Hence, rules of procedure must be faithfully followed except only
when for persuasive reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant
of an injustice not commensurate with his failure to comply with the
prescribed procedure.&nbsp; x x x
</blockquote>Procedural rules setting the period for perfecting an
appeal or filing an appellate petition are generally inviolable. It is
doctrinally entrenched that appeal is not a constitutional right but a
mere statutory privilege. Hence, parties who seek to avail of the
privilege must comply with the statutes or rules allowing it. The
requirements for perfecting an appeal within the reglementary period
specified in the law must, as a rule, be strictly followed. Such
requirements are considered indispensable interdictions against
needless delays, and are necessary for the orderly discharge of the
judicial business. For &nbsp;sure, &nbsp;the &nbsp;perfection of an appeal in the
manner and within the period set by law is not only mandatory, but
jurisdictional as well. Failure to perfect an appeal renders the
judgment appealed from final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>
We must stress that the bare invocation of “the interest of substantial
justice” is not a magic wand that will automatically compel this Court
to suspend procedural rules. Procedural rules are not to be belittled
or dismissed simply because their non-observance may have resulted in
prejudice to a party's substantive rights.&nbsp; Like all rules, they are
required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons
when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not
commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying
with the procedure prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
The Court reiterates that rules of procedure, especially those
prescribing the time within which certain acts must be done, have oft
been held as absolutely indispensable to the prevention of needless
delays and to the orderly and speedy discharge of business. Indeed, in
no uncertain terms, the Court held that the said rules may be relaxed
only in “exceptionally meritorious cases.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This case &nbsp;is &nbsp;not one of those.<br><br>



Petitioner’s claim that it supposedly stands to lose its substantial investment in shares of stock amounting to <s>P</s>1,079,437,485.61 just because it filed a motion for reconsideration, is unfounded.&nbsp; As we see it, the so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">loss of substantial investment </span>that
petitioner complains about is more imaginary than real.&nbsp; As it is,
petitioner’s shares in PAL have not been taken away &nbsp;from &nbsp;it; &nbsp;neither
&nbsp;has &nbsp;petitioner been deprived of any of its proprietary rights <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-à-vis </span>the
said shares of stock.&nbsp; Petitioner continues to hold and own the shares
in its name.&nbsp; Respondents, who own the majority of the shares in PAL,
have all the more reason to keep the company afloat and thriving since
they have more to lose.&nbsp; Any benefit that respondents may derive from
the continued profitable operations of PAL will likewise benefit
petitioner.<br><br>
The Court &nbsp;may &nbsp;deign &nbsp;to &nbsp;veer &nbsp;away &nbsp;from &nbsp;the general rule only if,
in its assessment, the appeal on its face appears absolutely
meritorious. Indeed, the Court has, in a number of instances, relaxed
procedural rules in order to serve and achieve substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  In the circumstances obtaining in this case, however, the occasion does not warrant the desired relaxation.<br><br>
