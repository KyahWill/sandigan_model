Respondent then received its harvest and gave half of it to Benjamin Tirona.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On March 2, 1963, Benjamin Tirona conveyed his share of the parcel of land to respondent’s father, Pastor Encarnacion.

Tirona, Edgardo Onas, Gaudencio Libang, Francisco Dacanay, Jr., and Benjamin T. Tirona, instituted an ejectment case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> against respondent before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Kawit, Cavite (docketed as Civil Case No. 122),&nbsp; alleging the following:<br><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>That the plaintiffs are the legitimate heirs of the deceased Emiliano T. Tirona, Alfredo T. Tirona, Teodoro T. Tirona, residents of Kawit, Cavite[,]&nbsp; who died on April 8, 1952, June 23, 1931, and October 18, 1959, respectively;<br><br></li><li>That the said deceased Emiliano T. Tirona, Alfredo T. Tirona, Teodoro T. Tirona, and Benjamin T. Tirona who is represented in this case by his attorney-in-fact, Emmanuel M. Tirona[,] are the registered owner (sic) of a parcel of land known as Lot No. 966 of the Cadastral survey of Kawit, situated in the Municipality of Kawit, Cavite, consisting of 17,049 square meters, more or less, covered by Original Certificate of Title No. (1799) RO-912, Book (A-9) RO-7, Page (229) 12 of the Register of Deeds for the Provinces (sic) of Cavite, which parcel of land is more particularly described and bounded as follows:<br><blockquote>A parcel of land (Lot No. 966 of the Cadastral Survey of Kawit), with the improvements thereon, situated in the Municipality of Kawit.

Tirona, on April 8, 1952, June 23, 1931, and October 18, 1959, respectively[,] have been in peaceful possession of the above-described parcel of land;<br><br></li><li>That sometime in February of 1973, the defendant Cirilo V. Encarnacion through strategy and stealth took possession of the above described parcel of land;<br><br></li><li>That when the plaintiffs became aware of the fact that the defendant, through strategy and stealth, took possession of the above-described parcel of land, they demanded upon him to surrender peaceably the possession of the same to them; however, defendant unjustifiably and illegally refused to do so and even threatened the plaintiffs with bodily harm should they attempt to take possession of the above-described parcel of land from him x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Respondent denied that he took possession of Lot No. 966 through strategy and stealth. &nbsp;He averred that he and his father bought the whole parcel of land from Teodoro and Benjamin Tirona and that they had been in possession of the land as owners; that at the time of the sale, no certificate of title was delivered to them or even presented by the vendors, who alleged, among others, that&nbsp; the land had not been surveyed nor had been the object of any registration proceedings; that respondent introduced and had been making improvements on the property, investing thereon substantial amounts up to the present; that none of the plaintiffs ever disturbed his peaceful possession of the land; and that it was only when OCT No. (1799) RO-912 was annexed to the Complaint that he came to know that&nbsp; Lot No. 966 was titled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>After trial, the MTC declared the plaintiffs in the ejectment case as the lawful owners of Lot No. 966. &nbsp;It found no merit in respondent’s contention that the parties in the two separate sales actually intended to convey Lot No. 966.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> &nbsp;On appeal, however, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Cavite dismissed the Complaint. &nbsp;&nbsp;It ruled that the MTC had no jurisdiction to try the case since respondent raised a genuine issue of ownership that was “not merely frivolous but on the contrary appears to be meritorious.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> &nbsp;The plaintiffs, through counsel, then elevated the case to the Court of Appeals, which, on November 13, 1975, denied the Petition for Review for failure to file the same within the reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> &nbsp;Petitioners failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the CA resolution, and thus, the CFI decision became final and executory on December 9, 1975.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Respondent continued to occupy Lot No. 966. &nbsp;Sometime in the 1970s, he developed one-half (1/2) of the track garden into a fishpond. &nbsp;He bulldozed the land and constructed a dike and added salt beds therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, when the CFI rendered its adverse ruling in the ejectment case, the petitioners left the administration of the land to their counsel, Atty. Antonio Jose F. Cortez. &nbsp;In the years that ensued, they continued with their migration to the United States of America (U.S.A). Petitioners, however, were able to transfer the title of Lot No. 966 in their names when TCT No. T-81513 was issued on March 2, 1976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> &nbsp;At that time, petitioners Teodoro D. Tirona and Gallardo D. Tirona were still minor children of their now deceased father, Arnaldo C. Tirona, one of the registered owners of TCT No. T-81513.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Almost twenty years later, on October 2, 1995, petitioners filed the instant case, docketed as Civil Case No. 1193-1195, for <i>accion publiciana</i> against respondent. &nbsp;In the Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> petitioners, except for brothers Teodoro and Gallardo D. Tirona, who only succeeded to the rights of their father, alleged this time that they are the registered owners of Lot No. 966, which is now covered by TCT No. T-81513. &nbsp;Claiming that respondent has been in possession of Lot No. 966 since 1959 without any title thereto or right to occupy the same, petitioners prayed, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that judgment issue (sic) evicting defendant from the property covered by TCT No. 81513 and placing plaintiffs in possession thereof.<br><br>It is further respectfully prayed that defendant be ordered to pay plaintiff for his use of their property and/or for unearned profits as follows:<br><blockquote>a. P1,000.00 per month from 1959 up to 1970;<br>b. P2,000.00 per month from 1971 to 1980;<br>c. P5,000.00 per month from 1981 to 1990;<br>d. P10,000.00 per month from 1991 up to the present.<br></blockquote>It is likewise respectfully prayed that defendant be ordered to pay exemplary damages of P1,000,000.00, attorney’s fees of P100,000.00, appearance fees of P2,000.00 for every court session attended by counsel and costs of litigation.<br><br>Plaintiffs pray for such and further relief as may be just and equitable in the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent moved to dismiss the Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> arguing in the main that since he has been in actual physical possession of the land for almost thirty-six (36) years, petitioners’ action to recover the property is already barred by laches. &nbsp;He asserted that even after deducting the period covered by the ejectment case previously filed, the remaining number of years which had elapsed since 1959 still spanned thirty-four (34) years.<br><br>Considering the Motion to Dismiss as well as the Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> thereto, the Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and the Rejoinder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> filed by the parties, the court, on August 20, 1996, resolved to require respondent to file his answer and “defer the final hearing and determination of the motion until the trial, in view of the fact that the ground relied upon does not appear to be indubitable.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Respondent asserted in his Answer with Counterclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that, at the time of the sale, even the Tirona brothers thought that Lot No. 966 was just part of Lot No. 965 and that it had no separate Torrens title.&nbsp; In fact, according to them, the parcels of land sold to him in 1959 and to his father in 1963 were covered by only one title. &nbsp;It appeared, though, that while there were actually two parcels of land contemplated, only Lot No. 965 was mentioned in the deeds of sale.<br><br>Petitioners countered that, on the face of the deeds of sale, there was really no such intention on the part of the Tirona brothers to convey Lot No. 966. &nbsp;Even if they admitted that Lot No. 966 has been in respondent’s possession since 1959, it was because Teodoro mortgaged it to him. However, said mortgage indebtedness is now already paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> &nbsp;According to petitioners, the applicable law relative to properties covered by Torrens title is Section 47 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (formerly Section 46 of Act No. 496), which states that “<i>[n]o title to registered land in derogation of the title of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession.</i>”<br><br>After trial, the RTC dismissed the Complaint on April 6, 2000:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered[,] the Complaint is hereby DISMISSED. Considering the above discussed underlying circumstances of the case, this Court is not inclined to award any damages nor attorney’s fees and no pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>While the court was inclined to believe that petitioners proved to be the registered owners of Lot No. 966, finding that TCT No. 81513 has more probative value when weighed against respondent’s evidence, it nonetheless ruled that such fact will not bar the operation of the equitable principle of laches. &nbsp;It opined that the ejectment case filed against respondent in 1973 mirrored petitioners’ neglect and lack of diligence to assert their claim. &nbsp;Said case was instituted fourteen (14) years after their supposed dispossession. Even if the period of its pendency be excluded, petitioners still allowed another twenty (20) years to elapse before commencing the present case, or thirty-four (34) years from 1959, thus, giving rise to the presumption that they have either abandoned their right or have declined to assert it. &nbsp;On the other hand, the court noted that respondent’s possession has remained undisturbed since 1959 as in fact Lot No. 966 was cultivated, improvements were introduced, and community relations already established. &nbsp;To the RTC, respondent appeared to have a valid title over said lot.&nbsp; &nbsp;The respondent’s act of simultaneously taking possession of Lot Nos. 965 and 966 at the time of the conveyance and the presumptive acquiescence of Teodoro Tirona indicated that the parties’ intent at the time of the execution of the Deed of Sale in 1959 was to convey both lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioners appealed the case, imputing errors alleged as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>THE DECISION RUNS COUNTER TO EXISTING LAWS PROSCRIBING ACQUISITION OF TITLE THROUGH ADVERSE POSSESSION<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT IGNORED PUBLIC POLICY ON PERSONS LIVING ABROAD<br><br></li><li>THE COURT A QUO DISREGARDED ACTS OF PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS IN HOLDING ON TO THE PROPERTY<br><br></li><li>PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANTS NEVER ABANDONED THEIR CLAIM ON LAND SUBJECT OF LITIGATION<br><br></li><li>DEFENDANT-APPELLEE EXERCISED OWNERSHIP OVER A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT WAS NEVER SOLD OR INTENDED TO BE SOLD TO HIM<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Still unconvinced, the Court of Appeals sustained the RTC, disposing, thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The April 6, 2000 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>In its November 28, 2003 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the appellate court reiterated the enshrined rule that notwithstanding the express provision of the law that no title to registered land in derogation of the title of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession, petitioners are still barred to recover possession of Lot No. 966 by virtue of laches. It held that petitioners’ long passivity to file the <i>accion publiciana</i> case renders their claim a stale demand. Though admitting that respondent has been in continued possession of Lot No. 966 since 1959, petitioners did not contest the same until 1973.&nbsp; Moreover, the contention that they did not leave any managers or administrators to take charge of Lot No. 966 despite migrating to the U.S.A. belied their claim of non-abandonment. &nbsp;Article 1108 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> which petitioners invoke, covers only prescription, not laches, which is an entirely different concept in law.<br><br>Petitioners moved to reconsider the Decision but were denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Hence, this petition substantially interjecting the same errors assigned before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>Essentially, the parties would want us to resolve two (2) principal issues:&nbsp; <i>first,</i> whether the Tirona brothers and the Encarnacions actually intended that the sale in 1959 and 1963 should include Lot. No. 966; and <i>second,</i> whether the equitable doctrine of laches defeats petitioners’ legal title over said Lot.<br><br>Anent the <i>first</i> issue, the Court finds and so holds that the same raised pure questions of fact, which may not be the subject of a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> &nbsp;The Supreme Court is not a trier of facts; it is not our function to review, re-evaluate or re-examine evidence presented by the parties during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; The factual findings of the trial court when affirmed by the appellate court are conclusive and binding on the parties and must remain undisturbed by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> unless the case falls under any of the following recognized exceptions:&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="15%">(1)</td><td width="85%"><div align="justify">When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation,&nbsp; surmises and conjectures;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(2)</td><td><div align="justify">When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or&nbsp; impossible;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(3)</td><td><div align="justify">Where there is a grave abuse of discretion;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(4)</td><td><div align="justify">When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(5)</td><td><div align="justify">When the findings of fact are conflicting;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(6)</td><td><div align="justify">When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(7)</td><td><div align="justify">When the findings are contrary to those of the trial court;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(8)&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(9)&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(10)</td><td><div align="justify">When the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>From the records of the case, no cogent evidence appears that would impel us to apply the above doctrine differently. &nbsp;The courts below have not overlooked essential facts, documentary, testimonial or otherwise, which, if considered in its entirety, may produce a different outcome. &nbsp;Hence, we find no compelling reason to revisit the factual conclusions of the RTC and the CA which upheld the apparent legal title of petitioners over Lot No. 966.<br><br>With respect to the <i>second</i> issue, we rule that albeit petitioners appear to be the legal owners of Lot. No. 966, they are barred from recovering its possession by reason of laches.&nbsp; While jurisprudence is settled on the imprescriptibility&nbsp; and indefeasibility of a Torrens title, there is equally an abundance of cases where we unequivocally ruled that registered owners may lose their right to recover possession of property through the equitable principle of laches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Again, by laches we mean:<br><blockquote>x x x the&nbsp; failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it. The defense of laches is an equitable one and does not concern itself with the character of the defendant’s title, but only with whether or not by reason of plaintiff’s long inaction or inexcusable neglect, he should be barred from asserting his claim at all, because to allow him to do so would be inequitable and unjust to defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>As the appellate court said in discarding the applicability of Art. 1108 of the Civil Code in this case, laches is poles apart from prescription, thus:<br><blockquote>“Laches” has been defined as “such neglect or omission to assert a right, taken in conjunction with lapse of time and other circumstances causing prejudice to an adverse party, as will operate as a bar in equity.” It is a delay in the assertion of a right “which works disadvantage to another” because of the “inequity founded on some change in the condition or relations of the property or parties.” It is based on public policy which, for the peace of society, ordains that relief will be denied to a stale demand which otherwise could be a valid claim. It is different from and applies independently of prescription. While prescription is concerned with the fact of delay, laches is concerned with the effect of delay. Prescription is a matter of time; laches is principally a question of inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced, this inequity being founded on some change in the condition of the property or the relation of the parties.

The Torrens system does not create or vest title. It has never been recognized as a mode of acquiring ownership, especially considering the fact that both the Madrids and Marquezes obtained their respective TCT's only in October 1986, twenty-seven long (27) years after petitioners first took possession of the land. If the Madrids and Marquezes wished to assert their ownership, they should have filed a judicial action for recovery of possession and not merely to have the land registered under their respective names. For as earlier mentioned, Certificates of Title do not establish ownership.(Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>To be sure, a Torrens title has never been recognized as a mode of acquiring ownership, especially so that petitioners obtained their title over Lot No. 966 only in March 1976, or about seventeen (17) years after respondent took possession of the land. &nbsp;If they really yearned to assert their ownership, petitioners should have taken a more appropriate affirmative action, not merely registering the Lot in their names but promptly taking &nbsp;judicial action to recover its possession. &nbsp;To stress, a certificate of title does not, by itself, establish indubitable ownership.<br><br>In<i> Mejia de Lucas v. Gamponia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the rationale for the doctrine of laches was laid down in this wise:<br><blockquote>“The reason upon which the rule is based is not alone the lapse of time during which the neglect to enforce the right has existed, but the changes of condition which may have arisen during the period in which there has been neglect. In other words, where a court of equity finds that the position of the parties has to change that equitable relief cannot be afforded without doing injustice, or that the intervening rights of third persons may be destroyed or seriously impaired, it will not exert its equitable powers in order to save one from the consequences of his own neglect.” x x x<br><br>In effect, the principle is one of estoppel because it prevents people who have slept on their rights from prejudicing the rights of third parties who have placed reliance on the inaction of the original patentee and his successors-in-interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>There is no doubt that respondent will suffer if petitioners are allowed to recover Lot No. 966. &nbsp;Respondent had already developed and invested a lot in it for more than thirty (30) years now. &nbsp;We cannot sanction the petitioners’ stale demand and act of resurrecting all over again an issue that had been already settled by the passage of time and equity of the case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.
