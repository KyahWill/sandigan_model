[The Republic] insists on the inclusion of the additional defendants for they are considered as necessary parties without whom no complete relief can be afforded to the [Republic].<br></li></ol><br>x x x x<br><ol start="8"><br><li><u>Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court</u> further states that: x x x [p]arties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just.  x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>   (Underscoring supplied) </li></ol></blockquote> By Resolution of November 15, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Sandiganbayan denied the Republic's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint as follows: <blockquote> This present Motion was denied when it was first filed on 27 January 2005 because it was not set for hearing; the motion for reconsideration of the resolution denying it was also denied.<br><br>Although parties may be dropped or added by order of the court, this can only be made in accordance with the Rules of Court.  This brings us to the question of whether there is compliance with the procedures on how this is done.  And while technicalities are brushed aside, this policy is not equivalent to allowing neglect or abuse of the rules by party litigants.  Specifically on the single point of impleading the proper defendants for its case, plaintiff has managed to drag the case far too long as will be shown below.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Plaintiff's first task of identifying the proper defending parties for its cause of action dates as far back as <b>July of 1987</b> when it filed Civil Case No. 0009, but it failed to include the present defendants; up to <b>28 October 1997</b> when it filed the present complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 0178 again without properly including the proper parties; up to <b>28 October 2004</b> when it was given an extension of time to file its Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint to implead the proper parties; up to <b>10 November 2004</b> when another extension of time was given for the same purpose; up to <b>16 December 2004</b> for yet another extension of time, and up to<b> 5 January 2005</b> for the last extension of time accorded by this Court.  When it finally filed the Motion for Leave on <b>27 January 2005</b>, it was still not in conformity with the requirements of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Legal proceedings are directional in time advancing from the commencement of the action toward its conclusion and by no means going backwards.  For those instances where modifications or corrections are allowed and liberality on technical rules is sanctioned, the Rules of Court still define the parameters under which these should be undertaken.  Adherence to these guidelines is imperative, otherwise the proceedings could very well be taken for granted or be at the mercy of the party litigants.<br><br><b><u>The grant of leave to file amended pleadings is a matter peculiarly within the sound discretion of the court</u></b>.  With the lame effort of the plaintiff in carrying out its task, the liberality with which this Court accommodated the same request a number of times, and this Court's earlier resolution already denying the same motion, plaintiff cannot now be heard on the same plea all over again.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </blockquote> The Republic's December 6, 2005 Motion for Reconsideration<i> Ad Cautela</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> having been denied by Resolution of March 6, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> it filed the present petition for certiorari and prohibition.<br><br>It bears pointing out, at the outset, that the parties, as well as the Sandiganbayan, are mistaken in their assumption that this case falls under Section 3 of Rule 10 of the Rules of Court (amendments by leave of court).  For it falls under Section 2 of said Rule (amendments as a matter of right).<br><br>Under Section 2 of Rule 10, a party may amend his pleading once as a matter of right at any time <u>before a responsive pleading is served</u>, and thereafter, only upon leave of court.  It is true that when the Republic filed its Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint most of the private respondents had already filed their respective answers.  This does not bar the Republic from amending its original Complaint once, however, <b>as a matter of right</b>, against Andres L. Africa, Racquel S. Dinglasan, Evelyn A. Romero, and Rosario Songco, the non-answering private respondents.  As this Court ruled in <i>Siasoco, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <blockquote> It is clear that plaintiff x x x can amend its complaint once, as a matter of right, before a responsive pleading is filed.  Contrary to the petitioners' contention, the fact that Carissa had already filed its Answer did not bar private respondent from amending its original Complaint once, as a matter of right, against herein petitioners.  <b>Indeed, where <u>some but not all</u> the defendants have answered, plaintiffs may amend their Complaint once, as a matter of right, in respect to claims asserted solely against the non-answering defendants</b>, but not as to claims asserted against the other defendants.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </blockquote> As the proposed amendments pertain only to the non-answering private respondents, they may still be made as a matter of right.  Being a matter of right, its exercise does not depend upon the discretion or liberality of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>In fine, the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion when it denied the Republic's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the November 15, 2005 and March 6, 2006 Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case No. 0178 are <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.
