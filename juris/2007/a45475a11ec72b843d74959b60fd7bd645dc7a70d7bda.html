Fernandez, Jr., Regional Trial Court of Las Piñas City, Branch 254 (trial court) in Criminal Case No. 02-0527.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The 5 August 2002 Order denied petitioner Reynaldo de Castro’s (petitioner) Motion for Reinvestigation and the 28 August 2002 Order denied petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>On the evening of 11 June 2002, barangay <span style="font-style: italic;">tanods</span> invited petitioner to the barangay hall in connection with a complaint for sexual assault filed by AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on behalf of her daughter BBB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner accepted the invitation without any resistance.<br><br>On 12 June 2002, the barangay officials turned over petitioner to the Las Piñas City Police Station.<br><br>On 13 June 2002, the police indorsed the complaint to the city prosecutor of Las Piñas City for inquest proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Later, the state prosecutor issued a commitment order for petitioner’s detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 18 June 2002, &nbsp;State Prosecutor Napoleon A. Monsod filed an Information against&nbsp; petitioner for the crime of rape.&nbsp; The Information reads:<br><blockquote>The undersigned State Prosecutor II accuses REYNALDO DE CASTRO y AVELLANA of the crime of Rape (Art. 266-A, par. 2 in relation to Art. 266-B, Revised Penal Code, as amended by R[.]A[.] [No.] 8353 and R[.]A[.] [No.] 7659) and in relation with R[.]A[.] [No.] 7610, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 11<sup>th</sup> day of June 2002 or prior thereto, in the City of Las Piñas, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commits [sic] act[s] of sexual assault with one [BBB], a seven (7) years [sic] old minor, by touching and inserting his finger into her vagina against her will and consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>On 1 July 2002, petitioner filed a Motion for Reinvestigation praying that the trial court issue an order directing the Office of the Prosecutor of Las Piñas City to conduct a preliminary investigation in accordance with Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Petitioner also asked that the charge filed against him be amended to acts of lasciviousness instead of rape since “fingering” is not covered under Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of Republic Act No. 8353 (RA 8353).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; In the Order dated 5 August 2002, the trial court denied petitioner’s Motion for Reinvestigation.<br><br>On 22 August 2002, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; In the Order dated 28 August 2002, the trial court denied the motion.&nbsp; Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioner raises the following issues:<br><br><ol><li> WHETHER A FINGER CONSTITUTES AN OBJECT OR INSTRUMENT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8353; and<br><br></li><li> WHETHER THE ACCUSED IS ENTITLED TO A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION IN FULL ACCORD WITH RULE 112 OF THE RULES ON CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>We dismiss the petition.<br><br>At the outset, we declare that petitioner availed of the wrong remedy in assailing the trial court’s Orders.&nbsp; Petitioner filed before this Court a petition captioned “Petition for Certiorari” and specifically stated that the petition is based on Rule 65.&nbsp; However, petitioner also stated that the issues raised are pure questions of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which properly fall under Rule 45.<br><br>Under Rule 65, a special civil action for certiorari lies where a court has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, petitioner failed to allege any circumstance which would show that in issuing the assailed Orders, the trial court acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Moreover, following the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;hierarchy of courts, a special civil action for certiorari assailing an order of the Regional Trial Court should be filed with the Court of Appeals and not with this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner did not raise any special reason or compelling circumstance that would justify direct recourse to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, if the petition is to be treated as a petition for review under Rule 45, the petition would fail because only judgments or final orders that completely dispose of the case can be the subject of a petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, the assailed Orders are only interlocutory orders.&nbsp; Petitioner should have proceeded with the trial of the case and if the trial court renders an unfavorable verdict, petitioner should assail the Orders as part of an appeal that may eventually be taken from the final judgment to be rendered in this&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Additionally, the petition will not prosper because petitioner failed to comply with the requirements under Rule 45 as to the documents, and their contents, which should accompany the petition.&nbsp; Petitioner failed to submit a duplicate original or certified true copy of the 28 August 2002 Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner also failed to show the timeliness of the filing of the petition because the petition did not state the date when petitioner received the 28 August 2002 Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Hence, on the issue alone of the propriety of the remedy sought by petitioner, this petition must fail.<br><br>On the merits, petitioner is deemed to have waived his right to a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Under Section 7 of&nbsp; Rule 112,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; if an information is filed in court without a preliminary investigation, the accused may, within five days from the time he learns of its filing, ask for a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; The accused’s failure to request for a preliminary investigation within the specified period is deemed a waiver of his right to a preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In this case, the information against petitioner was filed with the trial court on 18 June 2002.&nbsp; On 20 June 2002, one Glenn Russel L. Apura, on behalf of Atty. Eduardo S. Villena (Atty. Villena), requested for copies of the pertinent documents on petitioner’s case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; On 25 June 2002, Atty. Villena entered his appearance as counsel for petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Yet, petitioner only asked for a reinvestigation on 1 July 2002 or more than five days from the time petitioner learned of the filing of the information.&nbsp; Therefore, petitioner is deemed to have waived his right to ask for a preliminary investigation.<br><br>Petitioner also questions the charge filed against him by the prosecutor.&nbsp; Petitioner insists that a “finger” does not constitute an object or instrument in the contemplation of RA 8353.<br><br>Petitioner is mistaken.&nbsp; Under the present law on rape, Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353,&nbsp; and as interpreted in<span style="font-style: italic;"> People v. Soriano</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the insertion of one’s finger into the genital of another constitutes “rape through sexual assault.”&nbsp; Hence, the prosecutor did not err in charging petitioner with the crime of&nbsp; rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE, </span>we <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISS</span> the petition.&nbsp; We <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRM</span> the assailed Orders dated 5 August 2002 and 28 August 2002 of Judge Manuel B.
