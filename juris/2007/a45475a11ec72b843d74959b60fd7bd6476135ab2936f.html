Deles, the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> while administrative proceedings are pending clearly constitutes direct contempt of court as it is clearly an inevitable case of forum shopping.<br><br>The Court shall first discuss the procedural aspect of the present case.<br><br>The petitioner brought the instant case before the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The proper remedy available to the petitioner should have been a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, not a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>A petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is proper to correct errors of jurisdiction committed by the lower court, or grave abuse of discretion which is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This remedy can be availed of when “there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>”<br><br>Appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, on the other&nbsp;&nbsp; hand, is a mode of appeal available to a party desiring to raise only questions of law from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the petitioner seeks to reverse the Decision of the CA, which affirmed the Decision of the RTC, which in turn reversed the Decision of the MTC ordering the respondent to vacate the subject property. &nbsp;The general rule is that the remedy to obtain reversal or modification of judgment on the merits is appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the proper remedy for the petitioner should have been a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court since the decision sought to be reversed is that of the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The existence and availability of the right of appeal proscribes a resort to <i>certiorari</i>, because one of the requisites for availment of the latter is precisely that “there should be no appeal”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; The remedy of appeal under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court was still available to the petitioner.<br><br>The Court has held that where an appeal is available, <i>certiorari</i> will not prosper, even if the ground therefor is grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, despite allegation by the petitioner that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion, this does not negate the fact that the proper remedy should still be a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>While on some occasions, the Court has treated a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 as having been filed under Rule 45 to serve the higher interest of justice, such liberal application of the rules finds no application if the petition is filed well beyond the reglementary period for filing a petition for review without any reason therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the CA Decision on June 28, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; The Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated December 5, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> a copy of which was received by the petitioner on December 16, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Herein petition was filed on February 12, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>At the time of the filing of the complaint for ejectment, the rule is that in cases where a party filed a motion for reconsideration instead of filing a notice of appeal, the filing will interrupt the running of the 15-day appeal period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, should a party file the motion for reconsideration on the last day of the 15-day reglementary period to appeal, the party is left with only one day to file the notice of appeal upon receipt of the notice of denial of the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>In 2005, pending resolution of herein petition, this rule was amended by the Court in <i>Neypes v. Court Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; The Court held: <blockquote> To standardize the appeal periods provided in the Rules and to afford litigants fair opportunity to appeal their cases, the Court deems it practical to allow a fresh period of 15 days within which to file the notice of appeal in the Regional Trial Court, counted from receipt of the order dismissing a motion for a new trial or motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Henceforth, this <b>“fresh period rule”</b> shall also apply to Rule 40 governing appeals from the Municipal Trial Courts to the Regional Trial Courts; Rule 42 on petitions for review from the Regional Trial Courts to the Court of Appeals; Rule 43 on appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals and <b>Rule 45 governing appeals by <i>certiorari</i> to the Supreme Court</b>. The new rule aims to regiment or make the appeal period uniform, to be counted from receipt of the order denying the motion for new trial, motion for reconsideration (whether full or partial) or any final order or resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> Thus, with the advent of the “fresh period rule,” parties who availed themselves of the remedy of motion for reconsideration are now allowed to file a notice of appeal within fifteen days from the denial of that motion.<br><br>A petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should have been filed with the court fifteen days from December 16, 2002, or from the date of notice of the denial of petitioner’s motion for reconsideration, as provided for in Section 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> as amended by <i>Neypes</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> &nbsp;Instead, petitioners filed with the court a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court on February 12, 2003, way beyond the “fresh period rule.”<br><br>Clearly, the petitioner had lost its right to appeal by failing to avail itself of it seasonably either before or after the “fresh period rule”.<br><br>To remedy that loss, petitioner resorted to the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> as a mode of obtaining a reversal of the judgment from which they failed to appeal.&nbsp; This cannot be done.&nbsp; The CA decision had become final and had thus gone beyond the reach of any court to modify in any substantive aspect.<br><br>The special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> cannot be used as a substitute for an appeal which the petitioner already lost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the Court should have outrightly dismissed the present petition for the wrong mode of remedy.&nbsp; However, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, the Court may disregard procedural lapses, so that a case may be resolved on its merits based on the evidence presented by the parties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>.<br><br>Petitioner seeks to evict the private respondent from the subject land, contending that the latter occupied the property by reason of PNB’s tolerance.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that the allegation of the agrarian nature of a case is a defense which is often raised by a defendant in an ejectment case, and that this allegation is an attempt to divest the regular courts of their jurisdiction over the ejectment case.&nbsp; Petitioner further argues that before the regular courts are divested of their jurisdiction, it would be essential to first establish all the indispensable elements of tenancy relationship, to wit: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject is agricultural land; (3) there is consent by the landowner; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation; and (6) there is a sharing of the harvests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that the present case from the outset has involved a determination of an agrarian dispute over the land in question originally owned by PNB.&nbsp; Citing the RTC Decision, respondent contends that the Motion to Dismiss filed before the MTC on the pendency of the agrarian case before the DAR Adjudication Board should have caused the MTC to proceed with caution, rather than brushing aside the allegation of the pendency of an agrarian issue before the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>From the outset, respondent has insisted that the MTC had no jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case.&nbsp; In his Supplemental Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> respondent argued that the MTC cannot take jurisdiction over the case in view of pending DARAB CASE No. R-0605-142-96, between the parties, involving the same property and issues.<br><br>Essentially, respondent sought the dismissal of the pending unlawful detainer case in the MTC by invoking the defense of <i>litis pendentia</i>.<br><br>For <i>litis pendentia</i> to lie as a ground for a motion to dismiss, the following requisites must be present: (1) that the parties to the action are the same; (2) that there is substantial identity in the causes of action and reliefs sought; (3) that the result of the first action is determinative of the second in any event and regardless of which party is successful<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>.<br><br>A closer examination of the records of the case reveals that herein respondent is not included as a party to DARAB CASE No. R-0605-142-96 mentioned by him in his Supplemental Position Paper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Litis pendentia</i> cannot, therefore, be invoked by the respondent.&nbsp; Contrary to the claim of respondent, the parties in the unlawful detainer case in the MTC and the DARAB case are different, as he is not included as a petitioner in the DARAB case.<br><br>More significantly, not being a party to the DARAB case, respondent has no personality to assert that the DAR has primary jurisdiction over the land subject matter of the MTC case considering that he is not identified as one of the farmers-beneficiaries-petitioners in the DARAB case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Further, the CA should not have relied on the Investigation Reports of MARO Officer Villa dated March 4, 1997 and March 26, 1997, as the same were not executed pursuant or in relation to any pending case. Moreover, browsing through the Investigation Reports, it is clear that its tenor is only recommendatory or directory in nature.&nbsp; Thus, the execution of the Investigation Reports does not automatically divest the regular courts of their jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case.<br><br>It bears stressing that respondent died on May 1, 1999.&nbsp; However, up to this point, no proper substitution has yet been effected upon the person of Mrs. Teresita Fernandez, the heir of respondent. &nbsp;In fact, nothing has been heard from Mrs. Teresita Fernandez throughout the pendency of the case before this Court.<br><br>Despite several pleadings filed before this Court, nowhere in the records is it shown that Atty. Romeo A. Deles, counsel for the deceased respondent, was authorized by Mrs. Teresita Fernandez to represent her.<br><br>The death of a client divests counsel of authority.&nbsp; A dead client has no personality and cannot be represented by an attorney<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>.&nbsp; The relationship of attorney and client ceases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>.&nbsp; Thus, all pleadings filed by the counsel on behalf of the decedent were all unauthorized pleadings, hence, invalid<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>.<br><br>Thus, the Manifestation dated June 26, 2003 of Atty. Romeo A. Deles, former counsel of respondent, that the representatives of the petitioner should be punished for direct contempt for deliberate forum shopping does not deserve consideration.&nbsp; First, it was filed by a former counsel; and second, the issue of forum shopping was raised by respondent before the Court for the first time in the June 26, 2003 Manifestation.&nbsp; Well-settled is the rule that higher courts are precluded from entertaining matters neither alleged in the pleadings nor raised during the proceedings below, but ventilated for the first time only in a motion for reconsideration or on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
