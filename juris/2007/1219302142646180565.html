In addition, Item C authorizes payment of premium of 0.5 month per year of service to <b>affected regular officials and employees</b>, with emphasis on allowance for other GOCCs and GFIs in adopting their own <b>separation packages </b>with incentives and premium <b>over and above </b>the <i>existing retirement benefits</i>.<br><br>Both premiums under Items A and C refer to <b>separation pay for affected regular officials and employees.</b><br><br>This proposed Revised ERIP was recommended for approval by then Executive Secretary Torres on July 10, 1996 and approved by then President Ramos on July 19, 1996.&nbsp; The words of recommendation as approved were categorical, thus:<br><blockquote><ol start="8"> <li>After review, taking into consideration the <b>similar incentive/separation benefits</b> granted by the NPC, DBP, CB and PNB, we find the within ERIP proposal of MWSS to be in order.&nbsp; Hence, we recommend its approval by the President.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Indubitably, the proposed Revised ERIP of MWSS, as recommended by the Executive Secretary and approved by the President insofar as it concerned petitioners, referred <b>only</b> to <b>separation benefits to affected officials and employees of MWSS</b>.&nbsp; Consequently, officials and employees <b>entitled to be paid their retirement benefits </b>are those (1) affected by the reorganization of MWSS who had availed themselves of and paid the Revised ERIP and (2) qualified to retire under existing laws such as RA No. 1616.<br><br>That the guidelines implementing the Revised ERIP contained a provision that "[t]he ERIP to be paid by MWSS to officials and employees qualified to retire shall be the difference between the incentive package and the retirement benefit under any existing retirement law (RA 1616, 1146 or 660)" is not contrary to this pronouncement. The provision applies to MWSS officials and employees <b>qualified to retire but not affected by the reorganization</b>, in consonance with the directive in EO No. 286 "to study and propose schemes or measures <b>to provide personnel who shall voluntarily resign from the service incentives and other benefits</b>."&nbsp; Nevertheless, even assuming otherwise, it must be emphasized that, as guidelines, they should not and could not change the correct and clear import of the provisions of the law from which they are based.&nbsp; Well-settled is the rule that implementing guidelines cannot expand or limit the provision of the law it seeks to implement.&nbsp; Otherwise, it shall be considered <i>ultra vires</i>.<br><br>In fine, officials and employees of MWSS who were affected by its reorganization and qualified to retire under existing laws such as RA No. 1616 are entitled to claim retirement benefits, notwithstanding their receipt of benefits under the Revised ERIP of MWSS. Whereas, officials and employees of MWSS who were not affected by its reorganization but voluntarily retired, being qualified for retirement, are entitled to receive the incentive under the Revised ERIP to the extent of its difference from the retirement benefit under any existing retirement law such as RA No. 1616.&nbsp; This does not run contrary to the provision on Exclusiveness of Benefits under the GSIS law:<br><blockquote> Whenever other laws provide similar benefits for the same contingencies covered by this Act, the member who qualifies to the benefits shall have the option to choose which benefits will be paid to him.&nbsp; However, if the benefits provided by the law chosen are less than the benefits provided under this Act, the GSIS shall pay only the difference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The provision applies to the second category of MWSS officials and employees, <i>i.e.</i>, those who were qualified to retire but not affected by its reorganization.<br><br>Petitioners herein alleged that they already received their benefits under the Revised ERIP of the MWSS.&nbsp; Necessarily, what must be determined now is what the records do not show -- who among them were affected by the reorganization of the MWSS, and who were not affected but nonetheless opted to retire.&nbsp; In other words, what must be shown through competent documents/evidence are the positions phased out by reason of the reorganization, and who among herein petitioners were holding the positions.&nbsp; This must be done, notwithstanding that subsequent to its reorganization, MWSS ceased to exist.&nbsp; Petitioners, at the time of the reorganization, acquired rights that had attained vested status – rights that may not be lawfully taken away from them.<br><br>Verily, petitioners affected by the reorganization who are claiming retirement benefits under RA No. 1616 must hereafter submit their claims to the GSIS with proper bases; <i>i.e.</i>, that their positions in MWSS were phased out or otherwise affected by the reorganization and that, through the presentation of their service records, they are entitled to retirement benefits under RA No. 1616.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the petition is partially GRANTED.&nbsp; Petitioners who were affected by the reorganization of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and qualified to retire under Republic Act No. 1616 are entitled to receive their retirement benefits thereunder.<br><br>The Government Service Insurance Commission is DIRECTED (1) to EXPEDITE the payment of the claims of petitioners affected by the reorganization and qualified to retire under RA No. 1616; and (2) to SUBMIT to this Court its REPORT of compliance within ten (10) days therefrom.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Quisumbing,&nbsp; Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez,&nbsp; Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio Morales, Azcuna, Tinga, Chico-Nazario, Velasco, Jr., Nachura, Reyes,</i> and <i>Leonardo-De Castro, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, J.</span>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Chairman Guillermo N.
