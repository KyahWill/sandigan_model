They sought to annul Free Patent No. (IX-8)985 and the corresponding Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-22556 issued in the name of "Gregorio Lumocso" covering Lot No. 6195.  The case was raffled to the RTC of Dipolog City, Branch 9, and docketed as Civil Case No. 5188.

The two complaints were also raffled to Branch 9 of the RTC of Dipolog City and docketed as Civil Case Nos. 5433 and 5434, respectively.  In Civil Case No. 5433, petitioners prayed that judgment be rendered:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Declaring [a] portion of Lot 6196-A titled under OCT (P23527) 4888 equivalent to one hectare located at the western portion of Lot 4888 as private property of the plaintiffs under Sec. 48(B) CA 141 otherwise known as Public Land OCT (<i>sic</i>) as amended by RA No. 1942;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendant to reconvey the equivalent of one (1) hectare forested portion of her property in question in favor of the plaintiffs within 30 days from the finality of the decision in this case segregating one hectare from OCT (P23527) 4888, located at its Western portion and if she refuse (<i>sic</i>), ordering the Clerk of Court of this Honorable Court to execute the deed of reconveyance with like force and effect, as if executed by the defenda[n]t herself;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendant to pay P30,000.00 for the 22 forest trees illegally cut; P20,000.00 for moral damages; P20,000.00 for Attorney's fees; P20,000.00 for litigation expenses; and to pay the cost of the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>In Civil Case No. 5434, petitioners prayed that judgment be rendered:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Declaring [a] portion of Lot 7529-A under OCT (P-23207) 12870 and Lot 6196-B OCT (P-20845) 4889 equivalent to one hectare located as (<i>sic</i>) the western portion of said lots as private property of the plaintiffs under Sec. 48(b) of [C.A.

No. 141, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 1942; g) that respondents allegedly cut into flitches the trees felled in Lot No. 6195 (Civil Case No. 5188) while the logs taken from the subject lots in Civil Case Nos. 5433 and 5434 were sold to a timber dealer in Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte;  h) that respondents "surreptitiously" filed free patent applications over the lots despite their full knowledge that petitioners owned the lots; i) that the geodetic engineers who conducted the original survey over the lots never informed them of the survey to give them an opportunity to oppose respondents' applications;  j) that respondents' free patents and the corresponding OCTs were issued "on account of fraud, deceit, bad faith and misrepresentation";  and k) that the lots in question have not been transferred to an innocent purchaser.<br><br>On separate occasions, respondents moved for the dismissal of the respective cases against them on the same grounds of: (a) lack of jurisdiction of the RTC over the subject matters of the complaints; (b) failure to state causes of action for reconveyance; (c) prescription; and (d) waiver, abandonment, laches and estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On the issue of jurisdiction, respondents contended that the RTC has no jurisdiction over the complaints pursuant to Section 19(2) of Batas Pambansa Blg.

They also contended that they have two main causes of action:  for reconveyance and for recovery of the value of the trees felled by respondents.  Hence, the totality of the claims must be considered which, if computed, allegedly falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC.<br><br>The trial court denied the respective motions to dismiss of respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>   The respondents filed a Joint Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, respondents jointly filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and Preliminary Injunction with Prayer for Issuance of Restraining Order <i>Ex Parte</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 59499.  In its Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the CA reversed the resolutions and order of the trial court.  It held that even assuming that the complaints state a cause of action, the same have been barred by the statute of limitations.  The CA ruled that  an action for reconveyance based on fraud prescribes in ten (10) years, hence, the instant complaints must be dismissed as they involve titles issued for at least twenty-two (22) years prior to the filing of the complaints.  The CA found it unnecessary to resolve the other issues.<br><br>Hence, this appeal in which petitioners raise the following issues, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>FIRST -           WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS (FORMER FIRST DIVISION) ERRED IN REVERSING THE ORDER OF THE COURT A QUO DENYING THE MOTION FOR DISMISSAL, CONSIDERING THE DISMISSAL OF A PARTY COMPLAINT IS PREMATURE AND TRIAL ON THE MERITS SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO THRESH OUT EVIDENTIARY MATTERS.<br><br>SECOND -     WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS (FORMER FIRST DIVISION) ERRED IN DISMISSING THE PETITIONERS' COMPLAINTS ON [THE] GROUND OF PRESCRIPTION.<br><br>THIRD -          WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS (FORMER FIRST DIVISION) ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS NO DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE ON RECORD TO SHOW THAT PETITIONERS OWN THE SUBJECT FOREST PORTION OF THE PROPERTIES ERRONEOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE TITLES OF PRIVATE RESPONDENTS.<br><br>FOURTH - WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITION OF HEREIN PRIVATE RESPONDENTS FILED WITH THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS (FORMER FIRST DIVISION) SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED OUTRIGHTLY FOR PRIVATE RESPONDENTS' THEREIN FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATORY REQUIREMENT OF SECTION 1 RULE 65 OF THE RULES OF COURT TO SUBMIT CERTIFIED TRUE COPIES OF THE ASSAILED ORDERS OF THE TRIAL COURT WHICH RENDERED THEIR PETITION (CA G.R. 59499) DEFICIENT IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE CITING THE CASE OF CATUIRA VS.

The cases allegedly involve more than just the issue of title and possession since the nullity of the OCTs issued to respondents and the reconveyance of the subject properties were also raised as issues. Thus, the RTC has jurisdiction under Section 19(1) of B.P. 129, which provides that the RTC has jurisdiction "[i]n all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation."  Petitioners cited:                a) <b>Raymundo v. CA</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  which set the criteria for determining whether an action is one not capable of pecuniary estimation; b) <b>Swan v. CA</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> where it was held that an action for annulment of title is under the jurisdiction of the RTC; c) <b>Santos v. CA</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> where it was similarly held that an action for annulment of title, reversion and damages was within the jurisdiction of the RTC; and d) <b>Commodities Storage and ICE Plant Corporation v. CA</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> where it was held that "[w]here the action affects title to the property, it should be filed in the RTC where the property is located."  Petitioners also contend that while it may be argued that the assessed values of the subject properties are within the original jurisdiction of the municipal trial court (MTC), they have included in their prayers "any interest included therein" consisting of 49 felled natural grown trees illegally cut by respondents.  Combining the assessed values of the properties as shown by their respective tax declarations and the estimated value of the trees cut, the total amount prayed by petitioners exceeds twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00).  Hence, they contend that the RTC has jurisdiction under Section 19(2) of B.P. 129.<br><br>Jurisdiction over the subject matter is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>   It is conferred by law and an objection based on this ground cannot be waived by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  To determine whether a court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case, it is important to determine the nature of the cause of action and of the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly held that the instant cases involve actions for reconveyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  An action for reconveyance respects the decree of registration as incontrovertible but seeks the transfer of property, which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in other persons' names, to its rightful and legal owners, or to those who claim to have a better right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> There is no special ground for an action for reconveyance.  It is enough that the aggrieved party has a legal claim on the property superior to that of the registered owner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and that the property has not yet passed to the hands of an innocent purchaser for value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The reliefs sought by the petitioners in the instant cases typify an action for reconveyance.  The following are also the common allegations in the three complaints that are sufficient to constitute causes of action for reconveyance, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>(a)     That plaintiff Valeriano S. Concha, Sr. together with his spouse Dorotea Concha have painstakingly preserve[d] the forest standing in the area [of their 24-hectare homestead] including the four hectares untitled forest land located at the eastern portion of the forest from 1931 when they were newly married, the date they acquired this property by occupation or possession;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>(b)  That spouses Valeriano S.

Thus, under the old law, there was no substantial effect on jurisdiction whether a case is one, the subject matter of which was incapable of pecuniary estimation, under Section 19(1) of B.P. 129 or one involving title to property under Section 19(2).  The distinction between the two classes became crucial with the amendment introduced by R.A. No. 7691<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> in 1994 which expanded the exclusive original jurisdiction of the first level courts to include "all civil actions which involve title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein <b>where the assessed value of the property or interest therein does not exceed Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) or, in civil actions in Metro Manila, where such assessed value does not exceed Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses and costs</b>."  Thus, under the present law, original jurisdiction over cases the subject matter of which involves "title to, possession of, real property or any interest therein" under Section 19(2) of B.P. 129 is divided between the first and second level courts, with the assessed value of the real property involved as the benchmark. This amendment was introduced to "unclog the overloaded dockets of the RTCs which would result in the speedier administration of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The cases of <b>Raymundo v.

CA</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> relied upon by the petitioners, are inapplicable to the cases at bar.  <b>Raymundo</b>  involved a complaint for mandatory injunction, not one for reconveyance or annulment of title.  The bone of contention was whether the case was incapable of pecuniary estimation considering petitioner's contention that the pecuniary claim of the complaint was only attorney's fees of P10,000, hence, the MTC had jurisdiction.  The Court defined the criterion for determining whether an action is one that is incapable of pecuniary estimation and held that the issue of whether petitioner violated the provisions of the Master Deed and Declaration of Restriction of the Corporation is one that is incapable of pecuniary estimation.  The claim for attorney's fees was merely incidental to the principal action, hence, said amount was not determinative of the court's jurisdiction.  Nor can <b>Commodities Storage and ICE Plant Corporation</b> provide any comfort to petitioners for the issue resolved by the Court in said case was venue and not jurisdiction.  The action therein was for damages, accounting and fixing of redemption period which was filed on October 28, 1994, before the passage of R.A. No. 7691.  In resolving the issue of venue, the Court held that "[w]here the action affects title to property, it should be instituted in the [RTC] where the property is situated.  The Sta. Maria Ice Plant &amp; Cold Storage is located in Sta. Maria, Bulacan.  The venue in Civil Case No. 94-727076 was therefore improperly laid."<br><br>Worse, the cases of <b>Swan v. CA</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and <b>Santos v. CA</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> cited by the petitioners, contradict their own position that the nature of the instant cases falls under Section 19(1) of B.P. 129.  The complaints in <b>Swan</b> and <b>Santos</b> were filed prior to the enactment of R.A. No. 7691.  In <b>Swan</b>, the Court held that the action being one for annulment of title, the RTC had original jurisdiction under Section 19(2) of B.P. 129.  In <b>Santos</b>, the Court similarly held that the complaint for cancellation of title, reversion and damages is also one that involves title to and possession of real property under Section 19(2) of B.P. 129.  Thus, while the Court held that the RTC had jurisdiction, the Court classified actions for "annulment of title" and "cancellation of title, reversion and damages" as civil actions that involve "title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein" under Section 19(2) of B.P. 129.<br><br>Petitioners' contention that the value of the trees cut in the subject properties constitutes "any interest therein (in the subject properties)" that should be computed in addition to the respective assessed values of the subject properties is unavailing.  Section 19(2) of B.P. 129, as amended by R.A. No. 7691, is clear that the RTC shall exercise jurisdiction "in all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, <b>where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00)</b>."  It is true that the recovery of the value of the trees cut from the subject properties may be included in the term "any interest therein."  However, the law is emphatic that in determining which court has jurisdiction, it is only the assessed value of the realty involved that should be computed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  In this case, there is no dispute that the assessed values of the subject properties as shown by their tax declarations are less than P20,000.00.  Clearly, jurisdiction over the instant cases belongs not to the RTC but to the MTC.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED that the RTC of Dipolog City, Branch 9, has no jurisdiction in Civil Case Nos. 5188, 5433 and 5434.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,</i> and <i>Azcuna, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>               Also referred to as "Lomocso" or "Lumucso" in the records.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>               The Court of Appeals was removed as public respondent pursuant to Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court and our ruling in <i>Serg's Products, Inc. v.
