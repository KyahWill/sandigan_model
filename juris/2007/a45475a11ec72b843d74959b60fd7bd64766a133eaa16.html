The couple sat on the two remaining vacant seats on opposing rows of the jeepney.  Virginia seated herself on the vehicle’s left side while Domingo occupied the vacant seat at the right row.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Moments later, the woman seated next to Virginia alighted.  Accused-appellant Conrado Glino took her place.  He was reeking of liquor.  As the jeepney ran its normal route, Virginia noticed accused-appellant inching closer to her.  His head eventually found its way on Virginia’s shoulder.  Irked, Virginia sought accused-appellant’s attention and asked him to sit properly, citing adequate space.  Accused-appellant angrily replied, “<i>Oh, kung ayaw mong may katabi, bumaba ka, at magtaxi ka!</i>”  Virginia decided to ignore his snide remarks.  She then turned her back on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant, however, persisted in violating Virginia’s personal space, leaning on the latter’s shoulders.  It was at this point that Domingo decided to tell Glino to sit properly. Accused-appellant arrogantly retorted, “<i>Anong pakialam mo?</i>”  Domingo reasoned out that he is Virginia’s husband.  Domingo further said, “<i>Kasi lalasing-lasing ka, hindi mo naman kaya!</i>” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Marvin Baloes, who, it turned out, was Glino’s equally drunk companion, cursed Domingo. Baloes then provokingly asked the latter, “<i>Anong gusto mo?</i>”  Domingo replied, “<i>Wala akong sinabing masama.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After the heated verbal tussle, accused-appellant and Baloes appeared to have calmed down, confining themselves to whispering to one another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>When the jeepney approached Casimiro Village, Baloes turned to the driver and told him that he and Glino were about to alight.  As the jeepney ground to a halt, Baloes unexpectedly drew an improvised knife and stabbed Domingo in the chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Accused- appellant then unfolded a 29-inch Batangas knife (<i>balisong</i>) and joined Baloes in stabbing Domingo. Surprised and shocked at the sudden attack, Domingo failed to offer any form of resistance to the duo’s vicious assault.  In all, Domingo sustained nine stab wounds throughout his body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Virginia tried vainly to shield Domingo from his assailants.  She tightly embraced Domingo.  Virginia’s efforts, however, all went for naught as accused-appellant Glino and Baloes were unrelenting.  When the senseless assault ceased, Virginia found herself bloodied from incised wounds in her fingers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The other passengers of the jeepney scampered for the nearest exit immediately after the first blow was struck.  Some of them had to resort to jumping from the vehicle’s window to avoid harm’s way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Glino and Baloes attempted to flee the scene of the crime and ran towards Camella Center.  Baloes, however, fell down to the ground due to intoxication.  Glino, unmindful of his companion, was able to run a distance of 45 meters before he was apprehended by traffic enforcers Alvin Cristobal and Ruben Ramirez.  The two traffic aides, who were the first to respond to the crime scene, caught sight of the slow-moving jeepney and of the passengers jumping off it.  With the help of a concerned motorist, they were able to pin Baloes and Glino to the ground.  They later turned the two suspects over to the police, who arrived shortly thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup><br><br>Subsequently, Virginia and Domingo were brought to the University of Perpetual Help, Rizal Medical Center in Las Piñas City.  Domingo was, however, pronounced dead after a few minutes.  Domingo’s chest wound proved mortal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On November 18, 1998, accused-appellant Glino and Baloes were indicted for murder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> for the death of Domingo Boji and attempted murder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  for the stabbing of Virginia Boji.  The accusatory part of the Information for murder reads:<br><br>Criminal Case No. 98-1310:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 15th day of November 1998, in the City of Las Piñas, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and both of them mutually helping and aiding each other, with intent to kill by means of treachery and evident premeditation and without any justifiable cause, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab with bladed weapons one Domingo Boji y Daza, suddenly and without warning hitting him on the different parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him serious and mortal stab wounds which directly caused his death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The indictment for attempted murder bears the following accusation:<br><br>Criminal Case No. 98-1311:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 15th day of November 1998, in the City of Las Piñas, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together, acting in common accord and mutually helping and aiding each other, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, and without any justifiable cause, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, and stab with bladed weapons one Virginia Boji y Revillas, suddenly and without warning, thereby commencing the commission of murder directly by overt acts but did not perform all the acts of execution which would produce the crime of murder as a consequence by reason of some cause or accident other than their own spontaneous desistance, that is, because the injury inflicted to Virginia Boji y Revillas was not sufficient to cause her death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>On June 15, 1999, accused Marvin Baloes succumbed to cardio-pulmonary arrest while on detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Consequently, his name was dropped from the information.  Pre-trial commenced with respect only to accused-appellant Glino. Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The People’s evidence, which essayed the foregoing facts, was principally supplied by Enrique Villaruel, Virginia Boji, SPO2 Wilfredo Dalawangbayan and Alvin Cristobal.<br><br>Villaruel testified that he was a co-passenger of the spouses Boji in the jeepney where the gruesome stabbing incident took place.  Villaruel was then on his way home to Anabu I, Cavite.  He witnessed the crime as it unfolded.  According to him, accused-appellant Glino and Baloes both stabbed Domingo; that accused-appellant was armed with a Batangas knife while Baloes used an improvised knife; that the improvised knife was left on the floor of the jeepney as accused-appellant and Baloes fled the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Virginia narrated that she distinctly saw Baloes stab Domingo in the chest area.  Glino was blocking her path, preventing her from giving aid to her husband.  When Domingo was about to fall down from where he was seated, she embraced him.  As she was holding Domingo, a knife was thrusted into her, wounding her in the hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24] </sup><br><br>On cross-examination, she disclosed she did not see who between accused-appellant and Baloes caused her wounds; that she saw accused-appellant Glino stab her husband; that they met accused-appellant and Baloes only in the jeepney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25] </sup><br><br>SPO2 Dalawangbayan testified that he was the investigator assigned to handle the case involving accused-appellant and Baloes.  The two suspects were turned over to him by traffic aides Cristobal and Ramirez.  Likewise turned over to him was a bladed weapon, a 12-inch improvised knife, confiscated from the person of Baloes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [26]</sup><br><br>At the hospital, he found Domingo in critical condition.  He later learned that the victim expired shortly after his visit.  Virginia suffered from incised wounds in her right hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  After concluding his investigation, he prepared a report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Cristobal narrated that he is a traffic aide assigned at the Casimiro and BF Resort intersection in Las Piñas City.  On the night in question, he noticed a slow-moving passenger jeepney creeping onto the sidewalk.  Moments later, the jeepney’s passengers were jumping out of its windows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Suspecting a robbery, he and his partner Ramirez immediately gave chase.  A man with bloodied clothes, later identified as Baloes, ran away from the vehicle but fell to the ground shortly after.  Another man, accused-appellant Glino, was able to run for more than five minutes before they caught up with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  He and Ramirez later executed a <i>Pinagsamang Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Upon the other hand, the trial court summed up accused-appellant’s defense, anchored on plain denial, in the following tenor:<br><blockquote>The evidence for the defense consists mainly of the lone testimony of accused Conrado Glino, who testified that he is the same accused in this case for murder.  He did not know the other accused Marvin Baloes prior to November 15, 1998 whom he knew only at the UI for the first time.  On November 15, 1998, at around 7:20 in the evening, he was inside the passenger jeepney which he boarded at Equitable, Las Piñas City near Moonwalk to go home at Imus, Cavite.  He did not have any companion.  He rode on a passenger jeep bound to Zapote. He could not recall the number of people inside the jeepney because the seats were all occupied.  He occupied the right side seat of the driver at the middle of the seat on the right side.  Then he saw the victim was stabbed by accused Baloes.  He knew the name of Baloes while they were detained at the UI.  He did not know who was stabbed.  The stabbing took place between the areas of Casimiro and Uniwide.  The person stabbed died.  He was there watching while the person was being stabbed by Baloes who was seated also at the right side inside the jeep but seated at the rear most portion of the jeep.  The person stabbed seated at the left seat inside the jeep and seating also at the rear portion of the jeep.  Baloes stabbed the person in his body, started at the chest, stomach and other parts of the body.  He did not know how many times Baloes stabbed the victim.  There was an argument between Baloes and the wife of the victim prior to the stabbing incident.  They had an argument for a short period of time which he did not know what it was about.  They were at the vicinity near Uniwide when the argument started.  He would not know how long the argument lasted and would not recall the statements of the lady.  He said they were having an argument because the lady seating beside Baloes and after that lady was only a passenger away from him.  Victim said to Baloes while pointing his finger “<i>Tumigil ka dyan, susuntukin kita.</i>”  Then Baloes suddenly drew a bladed weapon and stabbed him.  Together with other passengers, they alighted from the vehicle because he was afraid.  He waited for another passenger jeep so he could go home.  He was not able to go home because he was arrested by the police.  He could not estimate how many minutes lapsed after he was able to go down that jeep when he was arrested as he had no wrist watch, but that was for a short period of time.  Ramirez, the not so tall police officer, arrested them and they were brought to the UI after he and Baloes were immediately handcuffed using only 1 handcuff. Baloes hurriedly went down and ran away after the incident, going back towards Moonwalk. He was not arrested at the same place where Baloes was arrested.  He denied the testimony of Mrs. Boji that he and Baloes had an argument inside the jeepney they were riding regarding some space and requested that he move a bit which caused the commotion resulting to this incident.  While they were having an argument, he was seated inside the jeep and he just looked at them.  He denied having argued with Mrs. Boji and said that none argued with him.  He knows that Baloes died already (TSN, 1 September 2004).<br><br>On cross-examination, he declared that his complete name is Conrado Montes Glino.  Her mother’s name is Juliana Montes Glino.  He denied knowing the middle name of co-accused Marvin, Montes Baloes.  Shown a copy of the Information where it appeared that the middle name of Marvin Baloes is also Montes, he agreed that the middle name is Montes.  His place of residence is Malagasan 1st, Imus, Cavite.  Baloes did not tell him while they were under the custody of the police that he is also a resident of Malagasan 1st, Imus, Cavite.  He did not ask Baloes where he was from while they were together at the UI.  But he admitted that on November 15, 1998, at around 7:20 in the evening, he and Baloes were on board one and the same jeepney bound for Zapote; that while the jeep was near Uniwide Metro Mall, there was an untoward incident that took place inside the jeep; that in that incident, a certain Domingo Boji was stabbed to death.  He did not know that Virginia Boji was also stabbed and wounded.  He would not know how many the passengers were in that jeepney as he failed to count, but there were many passengers.  Both seats at the back were occupied by passengers, but he did not notice if the seat in front of the jeepney was also occupied.  There was a commotion when Domingo was stabbed.  He immediately alighted the vehicle because he was afraid and waited for another jeepney to transfer to another bound to Zapote.<br><br>He admitted that among the passengers, only he and Baloes were arrested by the police officers because he was pointed to by the witness as the assailant of Domingo Boji.  Until the time of hearing, no one among the jeepney passengers were arrested for the death of Domingo and injury inflicted to Virginia Boji.  His co-accused, in this case, Marvin Baloes is already dead.  He has no other co-accused except Baloes.  He came to know her before she took the witness stand and positively identified him as the assailant.  When he was arrested by the police officers, he shouted why they arrested him and the police said that he had to go with them and just explain at the police precinct.  He did not resist when the police officers arrested him.  He was forced to go with them because they handcuffed him.  He was waiting for a ride as he would transfer to another jeepney in going home.  It was PO Ramirez who arrested him.  He did not file a case against Ramirez for arresting him without a valid reason because he was at the detention cell nor seek for help in filing a case against Ramirez because he did not know how as that was the first time he had a case.  He had plan to file the case against Ramirez who brought him at the UI before PO1 Dalawangbayan.  They were not investigated nor interrogated.  He stayed at the UI for one week, then he was transferred at the Las Piñas City jail.  He told the police investigator, PO1 Dalawangbayan, that it was Baloes who stabbed and killed Domingo Boji but that was not included in the incident.  PO1 Dalawangbayan did not do anything when he told him that he was not included in the stabbing incident because the one who was talking only was Virginia Boji.  He did not ask PO1 Dalawangbayan to enter his statement in the blotter.  Before he was transferred to the city jail of Las Piñas City, he was brought to the City Prosecutor’s Office for inquest (TSN, 22 September 2004).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b>RTC and CA Dispositions</b><br></center><br>On November 22, 2004, the RTC handed down a judgment of conviction, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered finding accused Conrado M. Glino GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of Murder and Attempted Murder and hereby sentenced as follows:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. 98-1310, to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and its accessory penalty and indemnify the heirs of Domingo Boji y Daza the sum of P50,000.00;<br><br></li><li>Criminal Case No. 98-1311, to suffer an indeterminate prison term of 4 years and 2 months of <i>prision correccional</i> medium as minimum, to 8 years and 1 day of <i>prision mayor</i> medium as maximum and to suffer the accessory penalty provided for by law and pay Virginia Boji y Revillas the sum of P101,549.00 actual damages and the sum of P100,000.00 moral damages;<br><br></li><li>And to pay the costs in both cases.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant elevated his conviction to the CA by way of an intermediate review, conformably with the ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> On May 26, 2006, the CA affirmed the RTC judgment in full.  The <i>fallo</i> of the CA decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the assailed decision dated November 22, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 275, Las Piñas City in Criminal Cases Nos. 98-1310 and 98-1311 is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Undaunted, accused-appellant interposed the present recourse.<br><br>On September 13, 2006, We resolved to require the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desired, within thirty (30) days from notice.<br><br>In a Manifestation dated November 13, 2006, the Office of the Solicitor General, for plaintiff- appellee, opted to dispense with the filing of a supplemental brief.  Accused-appellant, through the Public Attorney’s Office, hoists the same lone error he raised before the appellate court, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN RENDERING A VERDICT OF CONVICTION DESPITE THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT’S ADMISSION THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DID NOT STAB HER HUSBAND AND THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE ACCUSED- APPELLANT STABBED HER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>In his supplemental brief, accused-appellant contends that the identity of the assailant was not firmly established.  The evidence, he argues, points to Baloes, who died even before the trial began, as the perpetrator of Domingo’s killing and Virginia’s stabbing.  In the alternative, accused-appellant submits that he is guilty of homicide and attempted homicide only, not murder and attempted murder, due to the absence of the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]<br><br></sup><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>We first tackle the conviction for murder.<br><br><b><i>Positive Identification</i></b><br><br>Accused-appellant makes capital of Virginia’s identification of Baloes as the person who stabbed her husband, Domingo.  According to him, the trial court gravely erred in rejecting his defense that he was an innocent bystander.  He insists he was not acquainted with Baloes.  They met each other only when they were both tagged by the police as the persons responsible for the melee.<br><br>We are unconvinced.  The witnesses for the People were consistent in the identification of accused-appellant as one of two assailants who mortally stabbed Domingo.

Quijada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court aptly held:<br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that the factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of witnesses, are accorded great weight and respect.  For, the trial court has the advantage of observing the witnesses through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready reply; or the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the sincere or the flippant or sneering tone, the heat, the calmness, the yawn, the sigh, the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, the carriage and mien.<br></blockquote>The doctrine was reiterated with greater firmness in the <i>ponencia</i> of now Chief Justice Reynato Puno in <i>People v. Ave</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x  It is an established rule that when it comes to credibility of witnesses, appellate courts generally do not overturn the findings of trial courts. The latter are in a best position to ascertain and measure the sincerity and spontaneity of witnesses through their actual observation of the witnesses’ manner of testifying, demeanor, and behavior in court. x x x<br></blockquote>Verily, compared to appellate magistrates who merely deal and contend with the cold and inanimate pages of the transcript of stenographic notes and the original records brought before them, the trial judge confronts the victim or his heirs, the accused and their respective witnesses.  He personally observes their conduct, demeanor and deportment while responding to the questions propounded by both the prosecutor and defense counsel.  Moreover, it is also the trial judge who has the opportunity to pose clarificatory questions to the parties.  Elsewise stated, when a trial judge makes his findings as to the issue of credibility, such findings, especially if affirmed by the CA, bear great weight, at times even finality, on the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  We see no cogent reason to depart from these settled doctrines.<br><br><b><i>Conspiracy</i></b><br><br>Even assuming, for the nonce, that it was Marvin Baloes who inflicted the fatal stab, accused-appellant cannot escape culpability.  Their obvious conspiracy is borne by the records.  There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a crime and decide to commit it.  Proof of the agreement need not rest on direct evidence.  It may be inferred from the conduct of accused indicating a common understanding among them with respect to the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>It is not necessary to show that two or more persons met together and entered into an explicit agreement setting out the details of an unlawful scheme or the details by which an illegal objective is to be carried out.  Proof that accused acted in concert, each of them doing his part to fulfill the common design to kill the victim will suffice to support a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  In conspiracy, it matters not who among the accused actually killed the victim.  The act of one is the act of all; hence, it is not necessary that all the participants deliver the fatal blow.  Tersely put, each of the accused will be deemed equally guilty of the crime committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The acts of accused-appellant Glino and Baloes before, during and after the killing of Domingo are indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action and concurrence of sentiment.  In her testimony before the trial court, Virginia categorically narrated that while Baloes was stabbing Domingo, accused-appellant Glino was blocking her path, effectively preventing her from rendering aid to her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  Accused- appellant later joined Baloes in stabbing Domingo with a Batangas knife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b><i>Lame Denial</i></b><br><br>Too, we sustain the RTC and the CA’s rejection of accused-appellant’s defense founded on denial.  Time and again, this Court has ruled that denial is the weakest of all defenses.  It easily crumbles in the face of positive identification by accused as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  Here, no less than two eyewitnesses in Villaruel and victim Virginia positively and categorically named Glino as one of the Boji couple’s assailants.  Their identification of accused-appellant was unwavering, made in a simple and straightforward manner.  Corollarily, they had no ill motive to testify falsely against Glino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  Upon the other hand, other than his bare denial, no corroborating evidence was put forth to substantiate accused-appellant’s disparate account of the incident.<br><br><b><i>Treachery</i></b><br><br>Accused-appellant next argues that he should be made liable for homicide only.  He claims treachery did not attend the killing of Domingo.<br><br>That treachery or <i>alevosia</i> was present is incontrovertible.  The essence of this qualifying circumstance is the sudden and unexpected attack by the assailant on an unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any real chance to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  It is employed to ensure the commission of the crime without the concomitant risk to the aggressor.  The rule is well-settled in this jurisdiction that treachery may still be appreciated even though the victim was forewarned of danger to his person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  What is decisive is that the attack was executed in a manner that the victim was rendered defenseless and unable to retaliate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Concededly, victim Domingo was caught unaware that an attack was forthcoming.  Although he had a verbal exchange with accused-appellant and Baloes, the assault was sudden, swift and unexpected.  All of the passengers inside the jeepney, including Domingo, thought all along that the tension had ceased and that Glino and Baloes were about to alight.  Domingo was overpowered by accused-appellant Glino and Baloes, who took turns in stabbing the hapless victim.  By all indications, Domingo was without opportunity to evade the knife thrusts, defend himself, or retaliate.  In sum, the finding of treachery stands on solid legal footing.<br><br><b><i>No Attempted Murder But<br>Less Serious Physical Injuries</i></b><br><br>We now proceed to calibrate accused-appellant’s liability for the incised wounds sustained by Virginia.  Both the trial court and the appellate court found Glino liable for attempted murder.  The RTC and the CA are in agreement that there was intent to kill Virginia as well.<br><br>An essential element of murder and homicide, whether in their consummated, frustrated or attempted stage, is intent of the offenders to kill the victim immediately before or simultaneously with the infliction of injuries.  Intent to kill is a specific intent which the prosecution must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence, while general criminal intent is presumed from the commission of a felony by <i>dolo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Delim</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court had occasion to explain the rudiments of proving intent to kill in crimes against persons.  It may consist in: (1) the means used by the malefactors; (2) the nature, location and number of wounds sustained by the victim; (3) the conduct of the malefactors before, at the time of, or immediately after the killing of the victim; (4) the circumstances under which the crime was committed; and (5) the motives of accused.  If the victim dies as a result of a deliberate act of the malefactors, intent to kill is presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In the case under review, intent to kill Virginia is betrayed by the conduct of accused-appellant and his co-assailant Baloes before, at the time of, and immediately after the commission of the crime.  In her testimony before the trial court, Virginia disclosed that she was shocked and was initially unable to come to Domingo’s succor as the first blow was struck; that as Domingo was about to fall down from where he was seated, she embraced him; that she tried to shield him from further attacks; that when the assault ceased, her finger was gushing with blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>If the assailants also intended to kill her, they could have easily stabbed her in any vital part of her body.  They did not.  The nature and location of her wound militates against the finding of their intent to kill.  According to the physician who examined her immediately after the incident, Virginia suffered from an incised wound measuring 2.5 centimeters by 0.2 centimeter in her fifth digit, right hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Gleaned from the foregoing, it is crystal-clear that the wound on Virginia was inflicted during her attempt to shield Domingo from accused-appellant’s and Baloes’ knife thrusts.  It bears stressing that Virginia embraced Domingo while the assault upon him was at its peak.  Evidently, the wound was inflicted while she was in that position.<br><br>The wound required medical attendance, and rendered Virginia incapable of labor, for a period of ten (10) to thirty (30) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  Clearly, accused-appellant Glino should be held liable for less serious physical injuries only, and not attempted murder.<br><br>Although the indictment was for attempted murder, a finding of guilt for the lesser offense of less serious physical injuries is tenable, considering that the latter offense is necessarily included in the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The essential ingredients of physical injuries constitute and form part of those constituting the felony of murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Simply put, an accused may be convicted of slight, less serious or serious physical injuries in a prosecution for homicide or murder, inasmuch as the infliction of physical injuries could lead to any of the latter offenses when carried out to its utmost degree despite the fact that an essential requisite of the crime of homicide or murder – intent to kill – is not required in a prosecution for physical injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [62]</sup><br><br><b><i>Penalties</i></b><br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended, penalizes murder in this wise:<br><blockquote>Article 248.  Murder. – Any person who, not falling within the provision of Article 246, shall kill another, shall be guilty of Murder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol><li>With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense, or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity;<br></li></ol></blockquote>There being no averment of mitigating nor aggravating circumstance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [63]</sup> that attended the killing of Domingo, the proper imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, pursuant to Article 63(2) of the RPC.<br><br>On the other hand, Article 265 of the Revised Penal Code defines and penalizes less serious physical injuries in the following manner:<br><blockquote>Article 265.  Less serious physical injuries. – Any person who shall inflict upon another physical injuries not described in the preceding articles but which shall incapacitate the offended party for labor for ten days or more, or shall require medical attendance for the same period, shall be guilty of less serious physical injuries and shall suffer the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i>.<br></blockquote>Again, absent any appreciable mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> (1 month and 1 day to 6 months) should be imposed in its medium period (between 2 months and 1 day to 4 months).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The Indeterminate Sentence Law finds no application in both cases.  The rule is well- entrenched in this jurisdiction that the law is not applicable when the penalty imposed is death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment.  Likewise, the law does not apply to those whose maximum term of imprisonment is less than one year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [65]</sup><br><br><b><i>Damages</i></b><br><br>We have arrived at the award of damages.  When death results due to a crime, the heirs of the victim are entitled to the following damages: (1) civil indemnity; (2) actual or compensatory damages; (3) moral damages; (4) exemplary damages; and (5) temperate damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Civil indemnity is mandatory and granted to the heirs of the murder victim without need of further proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  Under current jurisprudence, the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span> is in order.<br><br>We sustain the award of actual damages in the amount of P101,549.00.  The heirs of the victim Domingo were able to prove during the trial, with proper receipts, that they incurred the said expense.<br><br>The trial court and the CA, however, blundered a bit in awarding P100,000.00 as moral damages.
