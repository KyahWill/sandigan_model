				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Assailed and sought to be set aside in this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 12 October  2004 of the Court of Appeals (CA), as reiterated in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of 17 February 2005, dismissing the petitioner's appeal in <span style="font-style: italic;">CA-G.R. CR No. 28277</span> for failure to file his appellant's brief in connection with his appeal from an earlier decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Dagupan City, Branch 44, which found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide against the person of one Antonio De Vera.<br><br>Briefly, the material facts may be stated as follows:<br><br>On 6 February 2001, in the RTC of Dagupan City, an Information for Frustrated Homicide was filed against  petitioner and  three others identified only as John Doe, Peter Doe and Paul Doe, allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 27<sup>th </sup>day of June, 2000, in the City of Dagupan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, JAIME "BINONG" DE GUZMAN, JOHN DOE, PETER DOE and PAUL DOE, being then armed with a deadly weapon, with intent to kill one ANTONIO DE VERA, confederating together, acting jointly and helping each other, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and criminally, attack, assault and use personal violence upon the latter by stabbing and hitting him on vital parts of his body, the said accused having thus performed all the acts of execution which could have produced the crime of homicide as a consequence but which nevertheless did not produce it by reason of some causes independent of the will of the perpetrator, that is due to the timely and able medical attendance rendered to him, to the damage and prejudice of said ANTONIO DE VERA.<br></blockquote>On arraignment, petitioner, as accused, entered a plea of "Not Guilty."  Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>In a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 19 May 2003, the trial court found the petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and accordingly sentenced him, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Jaime "Binong" De Guzman GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide and pursuant to law, hereby sentences him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from Six (6) Years of Prision Correccional, as minimum, to Ten (10) Years of Prision Mayor in its medium period, as maximum, and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accused is ordered to pay P46,000.00 representing actual expenses incurred by the complainant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>In time, petitioner filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Notice of Appeal </span>whereupon the records of the case were elevated to the CA.<br><br>In the CA, petitioner, as appellant, through the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Extension of Time To File Appellant's Brief</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  therein praying for an extension of sixty (60) days or until 22 August 2004 within which to file his appellant's brief. The motion was granted by the appellate court in its Resolution of  2 July 2004.<br><br>Unfortunately, no appellant's brief was filed by the petitioner within the extended 60-day period. Hence, in the herein assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of 12 October 2004, the CA dismissed the appeal, thus:<br><blockquote>Despite extension granted which expired on August 22, 2004, appellant failed to file brief.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> premises considered, appeal is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span> pursuant to Section 8 Rule 124 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<br></blockquote>Upon receipt of the aforequoted dismissal resolution, petitioner, again through the PAO, filed a Motion for Reconsideration (With <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion to Admit Attached Brief for the Accused-Appellant</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>) therein alleging, through counsel, that it was only "upon receipt of the resolution dismissing his appeal that counsel became aware  of her inadvertence in failing to file the required brief within the extended period" and that the delay in filing the required appellant's brief was without any malicious intent to delay the disposition of the case, adding that the admission of the appellant's brief attached to the motion "will not cause any prejudice to public interest, but would promote and enhance the administration of justice."<br><br>In its next assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of 17 February 2005, the CA denied the motion for reconsideration:<br><blockquote>The Court has studied the PAO's explanations for non-filing of brief for the accused within the extended period prayed for by PAO and We find no cogent reason to revise, amend, and much less, reverse Our October 12, 2004 Resolution dismissing the appeal, for appellant's failure to file brief, pursuant to Sec. 8 Rule 124 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, appellant's November 9, 2004 Motion for Reconsideration is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span> for lack of merit.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<br></blockquote>Hence, petitioner's present recourse, contending in the main that the CA should have admitted his appellant's brief since the failure to file the same within the extended period was due to his counsel's inadvertence. He adds that the admission of his brief will not prejudice any party.<br><br>We <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANT </span> the petition.<br><br>Undoubtedly, this Court has invariably ruled that the right to appeal is neither a natural right nor a part of due process; it is merely a statutory privilege, and may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law.  The party who seeks to avail of the same must comply with the requirements of the rules.  Failing to do so, the right to appeal is lost. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, we find cogent reason to relax the rule in this case.<br><br>Section 8, Rule 124 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure states that the CA may, upon motion of the appellee or <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> and with notice to the appellant in either case, dismiss the appeal if the appellant fails to file his brief within the period prescribed by the rules, except where appellant is represented by a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio.</span><br><br>Clearly, if the appellant is represented by a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de parte</span> and he fails to file his brief on time, the appeal may be dismissed on motion of the appellee or by the CA with notice to the appellant. However, the rule takes exception when the appellant is represented by a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> as in this case.<br><br>For sure, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Foralan v. CA</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which is akin to this case, the Court allowed the admission of an appellant's brief even if filed out of time because the appellant therein was represented by a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio,</span> and ruled  that it was error on the part of the appellate court to dismiss the appeal <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> instead of first giving to appellant a notice to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed.<br><br>In  several  cases,  the Court had set aside technicalities in the Rules in  order  to  give way to justice and equity. The Court can overlook the short delay in the filing of pleading if strict compliance with the Rules would mean sacrificing justice to technicality.  The imminence of a person being  deprived  unjustly  of his liberty due to a procedural lapse of counsel is a strong and compelling reason to warrant suspension of the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> A healthy respect for petitioner's rights should caution courts against <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> dismissals of appeals, especially in criminal cases where the liberty of the accused is at stake. The rules allowing <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> dismissals of appeals merely  confer  a  power  and  do not  impose  a duty; and the same are not mandatory but merely directory which thus require a great deal of circumspection, considering all the attendant circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Courts are not exactly  impotent  to enforce their orders, including those requiring the filing of appellant's brief.  This is precisely the <span style="font-style: italic;">raison d"etre </span>for the courts" inherent  contempt  power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Motu proprio</span> dismissals of appeals are thus not always called for.  Although the right to appeal is a statutory, not a natural, right, it is an essential part of the judicial system and courts should proceed with caution so as not to deprive a party of this prerogative, but instead, afford every party-litigant the amplest opportunity for the proper and just disposition of his cause, freed from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  More so must this be in criminal cases where, as here, the appellant is an  indigent who could ill-afford the services of a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de parte.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW WHEREOF</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span> and the assailed resolutions of the CA are <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE.</span> The appellate court is ordered to <span style="font-weight: bold;">REINSTATE</span> petitioner's appeal in CA-G.R. CR No. 28277, entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">People of the Philippines v. Jaime "Binong" M.
