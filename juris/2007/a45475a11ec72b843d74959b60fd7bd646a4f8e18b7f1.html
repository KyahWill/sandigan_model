				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> to annul the Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA), dated January 31, 2005, in CA-G.R. CV No. 79958,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which set aside the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Rosario, Batangas in LRC Case No. RY2K1-050, and dismissed the petitioner's application for registration of a parcel of land.<br><br>On September 24, 2001, petitioner Limcoma Multi-Purpose Cooperative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> filed with the RTC an application for registration and confirmation of title over a parcel of land designated as Lot 972-A No. Csd-04-015172-D (subject lot), Cad 426, Rosario Cadastre, consisting of 646 square meters under the Property Registration Decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The subject lot was originally part of Lot 972 and, subsequently, segregated as Lot 972-A. Petitioner alleged that it is the owner in fee simple of the subject lot and the improvements thereon, and that it has been in the open, exclusive, peaceful, and continuous possession thereof for more than 30 years, reckoned from the time of possession of its predecessors-in-interest.<br><br>In the alternative, the petitioner invoked the provisions of Section 48<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the Public Land Act, as amended, based on its and its predecessor-in-interest's open, exclusive, and continuous possession of the subject lot for a period of more than 30 years prior to the filing of its application.<br><br>Considering that there were no private oppositors to the application, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> allowing petitioner to present its evidence ex-parte before the Clerk of Court, who was appointed Commissioner for that purpose.<br><br>At the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> reception of evidence, petitioner presented the testimonies of Olivia P. Gomez, Arsenia P. Alcantara, and Lorenzo P. Limbo.<br><br>Olivia P. Gomez, petitioner's Assistant General Manager, testified that she knows the subject lot which has been occupied and used by the petitioner from the date of purchase as its sales and warehouse office in Rosario, Batangas. The subject lot was bought by petitioner from the Spouses Venustiano and Arsenia Alcantara on September 4, 1991. As a cooperative, the petitioner is empowered by its Articles of Cooperation to hold real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, it is exempted from the payment of real estate taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The subject lot is not within a military reservation or forest zone but falls under a commercial classification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> There are no tenants on the subject lot and it is located along the provincial road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon continuation of Olivia's testimony, she identified the evidence to establish the historical ownership of the subject lot traced back from the petitioner's predecessors-in-interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Unfortunately, Tax Declaration (TD) No. 0884<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> could not be found in the files of the Office of the Municipal Treasurer of Rosario, Batangas despite diligent efforts to locate said document. However, TD Nos. 00584<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and 0452<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> both specifically refer to TD No. 0884 which provides the link to reflect the transfer of ownership from the Spouses Andres and Trinidad Alcantara to Venustiano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The character of petitioner's and its predecessors-in-interest's possession of the subject lot was peaceful, open, continuous, exclusive, and in the concept of owners. Olivia further testified on the subject lot's classification as certified by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Community and Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO). The CENRO Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated September 23, 2002 stated, among others, that (1) Lot 972-A is not within a reservation or forest zone; (2) there is no previously issued patent, decree, or title; (3) there is no public land application filed for the same by the applicant (petitioner) or any other person; (4) the land applied for is commercial in nature and is used as warehouse of feeds for animals; and (5) the land does not encroach upon an established watershed, riverbank protection, creek, or right of way. Olivia further reiterated that the subject lot is classified as commercial and within the alienable and disposable zone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In turn, Arsenia Alcantara identified Lot 972 and declared that it was previously owned by her parents-in-law, the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, who had occupied and possessed said lot, in the concept of owner, since 1938.  In 1982, Lot 972 was donated by the couple to their son, Venustiano. She came to know of her in-laws' ownership of Lot 972 a year after she and Venustiano were married in 1953. In this regard, Arsenia testified that the Spouses Andres and Trinidad planted and harvested several coconut trees, other    crops, and vegetables thereon. She and Venustiano, likewise, stored thereat some of their equipment and things used in their bakery. When Venustiano became the owner thereof, they put up a perimeter fence on Lot 972 and continued to use the property as a storage site for materials utilized in their bakery.<br><br>Thereafter, Lot 972 was segregated into Lots 972-A and 972-B. Lot 972-A was the subject of the petitioner's application for registration before the RTC while Lot 972-B was donated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> by Venustiano to their daughter, Trinidad Alcantara.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Finally, Arsenia identified and ratified the Deed of Sale evidencing petitioner's acquisition of the subject lot.<br><br>On cross-examination, Arsenia confirmed that there were no adverse claimants over the subject lot, and her in-laws' possession thereof was peaceful, adversarial, continuous, and open, which they (Venustiano and her) eventually continued in like manner.<br><br>Lorenzo Limbo corroborated Arsenia's testimony on the Spouses Andres and Trinidad's possession and ownership of the subject lot since 1938. Lorenzo testified that he was born and raised in Poblacion, Rosario, Batangas, the same place where the subject lot is located.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He was a resident thereof for 59 years. In addition, Lorenzo declared that he knows the subject lot which was originally part of Lot 972, and ownership thereof by the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, because Lorenzo's family used to own a parcel of land near the property. In fact, the Spouses Andres and Trinidad were compadres<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of Lorenzo's father.  Lorenzo was already a teenager in 1938 when the Spouses Andres and Trinidad possessed and tilled Lot 972 encompassing the subject lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As a boy, Lorenzo frequented the property near Lot 972, and, from 1938, he observed the Spouses Andres and Trinidad working on and utilizing the land as storage site for their business.<br><br>Lorenzo's familiarity with Lot 972 and its previous owners was solidified by his marriage to Trinidad's sister, which makes Lorenzo, Venustiano's uncle by affinity. Indeed, Lorenzo asseverated that the Spouses Andres and Trinidad were the recognized and acknowledged owners of Lot 972, and they remained owners thereof when he got married on January 18, 1951. He recalled that the Spouses Andres and Trinidad's possession was open, continuous, and exclusive, that they planted citrus on the said lot, and that the perimeter area was surrounded by <span style="font-style: italic;">madre de cacao</span>, bamboos, and some wire. The subject lot is not tenanted, is located outside a military reservation or forest zone, and is without adverse claimants.<br><br>Likewise, Lorenzo verified Arsenia's testimony on the Spouses Andres and Trinidad's donation of the subject lot to Venustiano in 1982. Initially, Lorenzo only knew from his wife that Lot 972 was donated to Venustiano by the latter's parents. Subsequently, however, he was able to confirm that the ownership of the subject lot had been transferred to Venustiano because it was of public knowledge and they became his neighbors in the same place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The RTC granted the application in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated April 10, 2003 and held, thus:<br><blockquote>Based on the testimonies of the witnesses and documentary exhibits, the applicant LIMCOMA Multi-Purpose Cooperative has the possession of the subject lot in open, continuous, adverse to the whole world and in the concept of an owner.<br><br>WHEREFORE, finding the application sufficient in form and substance, it being supported by sufficient evidence, this Court, as recommended, finds that LIMCOMA MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE has a registrable title over a parcel of land located at Barangay Namuco, Rosario, Batangas in Lot 972-A, Cad 426, Rosario Cadastre of the Subdivision Plan, Csd-04-015172-D, containing an area of SIX HUNDRED FORTY-SIX (646) SQUARE METERS and order its registration in the name of LIMCOMA MULTI-PURPOSE COOPERATIVE.</blockquote>On appeal, the appellate court reversed and set aside the Decision of the trial court, to wit:<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS,</span> the judgment appealed from must be, as it is, hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>. The verified petition instituted in Land Registration Case No. RY2K1-050 of the Regional Trial Court of Rosario, Batangas is ordered <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>In reversing the trial court, the CA ruled that petitioner failed to (1) demonstrate the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945 or earlier, required by the Property Registration Decree and the Public Land Act; and (2) overcome the presumption that the subject lot is public and alienable land.<br><br>On the other hand, petitioner maintains that it has occupied the subject lot since 1938, by virtue of its predecessors-in-interest's possession, and that it has duly established the character of the land as public and alienable. Petitioner submits that, at any rate, Lot 972, including the subject lot, was converted into private property through the Spouses Andres and Trinidad's exclusive and continuous possession of more than 30 years, from 1938 to 1982, thereby making it susceptible to prescription.<br><br>Hence, we impale the issues for resolution of this Court, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether or not the subject lot is public and alienable land, and the petitioner has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession thereof since June 12, 1945, or earlier, under a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> claim of ownership;<br><br></li><li>Corollarily, whether or not the subject lot acquired a private character in 1968, thus within the operation of the laws on prescription.</li></ol></blockquote>In disposing of the foregoing issues, the provisions of both the Property Registration Decree and the Public Land Act invoked by the petitioner bear close scrutiny.<br><br>Section 14 of the Property Registration Decree provides:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">SECTION 14.</span> Who may apply. — The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><br>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.<br><br>(2) Those who have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the provision of existing laws.</blockquote>Likewise, Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act, as amended, states:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">SECTION 48.</span> The following described citizens of the Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance of the province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title thereof, under the Land Registration Act, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public dominion, under a bona fide claim of acquisition or ownership, since June 12, 1945, or earlier, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title except when prevented by war or force majeure. These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter.</blockquote>Notably, Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree and Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act, as amended, are original registration proceedings, against the whole world, and the decree of registration issued for both is conclusive and final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It is evident from the above-cited provisions that an application for land registration must conform to three requisites: (1) the land is alienable public land; (2) the applicant's open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation thereof must be since June 12, 1945, or earlier; and (3) it is under a bona fide claim of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The laws vary only with respect to their operation. Under the Property Registration Decree, there already exists a title which the court need only confirm while the Public Land Act works under the presumption that the land applied for still pertains to the State, and the occupants and possessors merely claim an interest in the land by virtue of their imperfect title or continuous, open, and notorious possession thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Parenthetically, Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree deals with the acquisition of private lands by prescription.<br><br>We resolve the first issue in the affirmative and depart from the findings of the appellate court.<br><br>Generally, we are bound by the factual findings of the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, the recognized exceptions thereto obtain in this instance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The records reveal that the petitioner presented several documents to prove that the subject lot is alienable public land. In fact, the petitioner introduced in evidence a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> from the DENR-CENRO, dated September 30, 2002 which reads:<br><blockquote>This is to certify that the parcel of land identified as Lot 972-A, Csd-04-015172-D, situated at Barangay Namuco, Rosario, <br>Batangas containing an area of SIX HUNDRED FORTY-SIX METERS and shown at the reverse side hereof has been verified to be within the ALIENABLE AND DISPOSABLE ZONE under Project No. 27-A, land Classification Map No. 718 certified on 26 March 1928.</blockquote>The DENR-CENRO Report, likewise, contains the foregoing notation. Further, the subject lot has been classified as commercial for tax purposes. These documents all point to the undeniable fact that the subject lot is public alienable land and, thereby, overcome the presumption that such forms part of the public dominion.<br><br>In the recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Buenaventura v. Republic</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> we ruled that said Certification is sufficient to establish the true nature or    character of the subject property as public and alienable land. We similarly ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and intoned therein that the certification enjoys a presumption of regularity in the absence of contradictory evidence.<br><br>Both the DENR-CENRO Certification and Report constitute a positive government act, an administrative action, validly classifying the land in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> As adverted to by the petitioner, the classification or re-classification of public lands into alienable or disposable, mineral, or forest lands is now a prerogative of the Executive Department of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Clearly, the petitioner has overcome the burden of proving the alienability of the subject lot.<br><br>Coming now to the issue of whether the petitioner proved possession since June 12, 1945, or earlier, we find that it had adequately established its open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the subject lot since 1938, tacked to that of its predecessors-in-interest, the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, and the Spouses Venustiano and Arsenia.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the petitioner did not present "well-nigh incontrovertible" evidence to show the true nature of its possession of the subject lot, and that even granting that the Spouses Andres and Trinidad possessed and occupied the lot since 1938 in the concept of owner, such did not redound to applicant's benefit, absent proof of a valid transfer to Venustiano, the petitioner's immediate predecessor-in-interest.<br><br>We are not in accord with this ruling.<br><br>The testimonies of petitioner's witnesses consistently declared that the Spouses Andres and Trinidad occupied and possessed the subject lot in the concept of owner since 1938. Worth noting is the testimony of Lorenzo Limbo who had resided in and frequented the area since he was a child and is thus familiar with the Spouses Andres' and Trinidad's ownership of Lot 972. He gave direct and categorical testimony consisting of specific acts of ownership<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> to substantiate the petitioner's claim that the Spouses Andres and Trinidad possessed and occupied the subject lot. Lorenzo Limbo certainly knew from whereof he spoke as his father was the <span style="font-style: italic;">compadre</span> of the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, he eventually married Trinidad's sister, and he had been a longtime neighbor of the Alcantaras.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner proffered in evidence the TDs showing payment of realty taxes by the Spouses Andres and Trinidad from 1938 which was subsequently continued by Venustiano and Arsenia. Although as a rule, tax declarations are not conclusive evidence of ownership, they are proof that the holder has a claim of title over the property and serve as sufficient basis for inferring possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> These tax declarations bolster the petitioner's claim that its predecessors-in-interest possessed and occupied the lot in question since 1938.<br><br>Anent the holding of the appellate court that the Spouses Andres' and Trinidad's possession of the subject lot did not redound to petitioner's benefit, such does not find support in law.<br><br>Article 1138 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 1138. In the computation of time necessary for prescription, the following rules shall be observed:<br><br>(1) The present possessor may complete the period necessary for prescription by tacking his possession to that of his grantor or predecessor-in-interest.</blockquote>While the supposed donation of the subject lot by the Spouses Andres and Trinidad to Venustiano was not evidenced by a written instrument, the relationship between them is not in dispute, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </span>the former were the progenitors of the latter. Even if the donation was void, the tacking of possession must be allowed, considering the undisputed relationship between the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, and Venustiano. We ruled in this wise in <span style="font-style: italic;">South City Homes, Inc. v. Republic</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>To emphasize, Venustiano is a compulsory heir of the Spouses Andres and Trinidad.  Intestate succession is another means by which ownership and other real rights over property are transmitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Effectively, upon his parents' death, ownership and real rights over the subject lot, including the right of possession, were vested in Venustiano.   Consequently, upon his sale of the subject lot to the petitioner, he transmitted his rights thereto. Therefore, petitioner must be permitted to tack possession of the subject lot to that of the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, and Venustiano.<br><br>In any event, there appears to be no legal impediment to petitioner's registrable right over the subject lot. We find that petitioner has consolidated ownership thereof through ordinary acquisitive prescription, specifically, good faith possession for 10 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Prescription is a mode of acquiring ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> We have had occasion to rule in numerous instances that open, exclusive, and continuous possession for at least 30 years of alienable public land <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso jure</span> converts the same to private property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The conversion works to summon into operation Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree which, in turn, authorizes the acquisition of private lands through prescription.<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner proved that its predecessors-in-interest, the Spouses Andres and Trinidad, occupied and possessed the subject lot in the concept of owner for more than 30 years, 44 years to be exact. Prescinding therefrom, the subject lot had already been converted to private property by 1968. Accordingly, when the petitioner bought the lot from the Spouses Venustiano and Arsenia in 1991, under the belief, in good faith, that they were the transferees of the original owners, it only needed to complete the 10-year possession requirement for ordinary acquisitive prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Spouses Venustiano and Arsenia represented to petitioner that the subject lot was donated to Venustiano by his parents in 1982. This donation, even if void, serves as basis of the petitioner's good faith, absent a showing that it knew of a defect in its title or mode of acquisition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Good faith remains notwithstanding petitioner's mistaken belief that the donation was valid. Article 526, paragraph 3 of the Civil Code specifically provides that "mistake upon a doubtful or difficult question of law may be the basis of good faith."<br><br>It stands to reason, therefore, that the petitioner has acquired registrable title over the subject lot anchored on its predecessors-in- interest's possession traced back to 1938, and its own possession of 10 years, reckoned from 1991 to the filing of the application for registration in 2001.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> premises considered, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>. The January 31, 2005 Decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span>, and the April 10, 2003 Order of the Regional Trial Court granting the petitioner's application for registration of the subject lot, is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REINSTATED</span>.
