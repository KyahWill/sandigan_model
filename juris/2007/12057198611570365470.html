				<H3>RE : SUSPENSION OF ATTY. ROGELIO Z. BAGABUYO, FORMER SENIOR STATE PROSECUTOR</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AZCUNA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative case stemmed from the events of the proceedings in Crim. Case No. 5144, &nbsp;entitled <i>People v. Luis Bucalon Plaza</i>, heard before the sala of Presiding Judge Jose Manuel P. Tan, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Surigao City, Branch 29.<br><br>Crim. Case No. 5144 was originally raffled to the sala of Judge Floripinas C. Buyser, RTC of Surigao City, Branch 30. In an Order dated March 14, 2002, Judge Buyser denied the Demurrer to the &nbsp;Evidence of the accused, declaring that the evidence thus presented by the prosecution was sufficient to prove the crime of homicide and &nbsp;not the charge of &nbsp;murder. Consequently, the counsel for the defense filed a Motion to Fix the Amount of &nbsp;Bail Bond.&nbsp; Respondent Atty. Rogelio Z. Bagabuyo, then Senior State Prosecutor and the deputized prosecutor of the case, &nbsp;objected thereto mainly on the ground&nbsp; that &nbsp;the original charge of&nbsp; murder, &nbsp;punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,&nbsp; was not subject to bail under Sec. 4, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated August 30, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Judge Buyser inhibited himself from further trying the case because of the “harsh insinuation” of Senior Prosecutor Rogelio Z. Bagabuyo that he “lacks the cold neutrality of an impartial magistrate,” by allegedly suggesting the filing of the &nbsp;motion to fix the amount of bail bond by &nbsp;counsel for the accused.<br><br>The case was transferred to Branch 29 of the RTC of Surigao City, presided by Judge Jose Manuel P. Tan.&nbsp; In an Order dated November 12, 2002, Judge Tan favorably resolved&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion to Fix the Amount of Bail Bond, and fixed the amount of the bond at P40,000.<br><br>Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration of the Order dated November 12, 2002, which motion was denied for lack of merit in&nbsp; an Order dated February 10, 2003.&nbsp; In October, 2003, respondent appealed from the Orders dated November 12, 2002 and February 10, 2003, to the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>Instead of availing himself only of judicial remedies, respondent caused the publication of an article regarding the Order granting bail to the accused in the August 18, 2003 issue of the Mindanao Gold Star Daily.&nbsp; The article, entitled “<i>Senior prosecutor lambasts Surigao judge for allowing murder suspect to bail out,</i>” reads: <blockquote> SENIOR state prosecutor has lashed at a judge in Surigao City for allowing a murder suspect to go out on bail.<br><br>Senior state prosecutor Rogelio Bagabuyo lambasted Judge Manuel Tan of the&nbsp; Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 29 based in Surigao City for ruling on a motion&nbsp; that sought a bailbond for Luis Plaza who stands charged with murdering a policeman . . . .<br><br>Plaza reportedly posted a P40-thousand bail bond.<br><br>Bagabuyo argued that the crime of murder is a non-bailable offense.&nbsp; But Bagabuyo admitted that a judge could still opt to allow a murder suspect to bail out in cases when the evidence of the prosecution is weak.<br><br>But in this murder case, Bagabuyo said the judge who previously handled it, Judge F[lori]pinas &nbsp;B[uy]ser, described the evidence to be strong.&nbsp; B[uy]ser inhibited from the case for an unclear reason.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>Bagabuyo said he would contest Tan’s decision before the Court of Appeals and would file criminal and administrative charges of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> against the judge.<br><br>Bagabuyuo said he was not afraid of being cited in contempt by Judge Tan.<br><br>“This is the only way that the public would know that there are judges there who are displaying judicial arrogance.” he said.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </blockquote> In an Order dated August 21, 2003, the RTC of Surigao City, Branch 29, directed respondent and the writer of the article, Mark Francisco of the Mindanao Gold Star Daily, to appear in court on September 20, 2003 to explain why they should not be cited for indirect contempt of court for the publication of the article which degraded the court and its presiding judge with its lies and misrepresentation.<br><br>The said Order stated that contrary to the statements in the&nbsp; article, &nbsp;Judge Buyser described the evidence for the prosecution as not strong, but sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused only for homicide.&nbsp; Moreover, it was not true that Judge Buyser inhibited himself from the case for an unclear reason.&nbsp; Judge Buyser, in an Order dated August 30, 2002, declared in open court in the presence of respondent that he was inhibiting himself from the case due to the harsh insinuation of respondent that he lacked the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.<br><br>On the scheduled hearing of the contempt charge, Mark Francisco admitted that the Mindanao Gold Star Daily caused the publication of the article.&nbsp; He disclosed that respondent, in a press conference, stated that the crime of murder is non-bailable. When asked by the trial court why he printed such lies, Mr. Francisco answered that his only source was respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Mr. Francisco clarified that in the&nbsp; statement alleging that Judge Buyser inhibited himself from the case for an unclear reason, the phrase “for an unclear reason,” was added by the newspaper’s Executive Editor Herby S. Gomez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Respondent admitted that he caused the holding of the press conference, but refused to answer whether he made the statements in the article until after he shall have filed a motion to dismiss. &nbsp;For his refusal to answer, the trial court declared him in contempt of court pursuant to Sec. 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;The Court’s Order dated September 30, 2003 reads: <blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> ORDER<br></div><br>Mr. Mark Francisco for publishing this article which is a lie clothed in half truth to give it a semblance of truth is hereby ordered to pay a fine of P10,000.&nbsp; Prosecutor Bagabuyo, for obstinately refusing to explain why he should not be cited for contempt and admitting that the article published in the Mindanao Gold Star Daily on August 18, 2003 and quoted in the Order of this Court dated August 21, 2003 which is contemptuous was caused by him to be published, is hereby adjudged to have committed indirect contempt of Court pursuant to Section 3 of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court and he is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of 30 days in jail.&nbsp; The BJMP is hereby ordered to arrest Prosecutor Rogelio Z. Bagabuyo if he does not put up a bond of P100,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </blockquote> Respondent posted the required bond and was released from the custody of the law.&nbsp; He appealed the indirect contempt order to the CA.<br><br>Despite the citation of indirect contempt, respondent presented himself to the media for interviews in Radio Station DXKS, and again attacked the integrity of Judge Tan and the trial court’s disposition in the proceedings of Crim. Case No. 5144.<br><br>In an Order dated October 20, 2003, the RTC of Surigao City, Branch 29, required respondent to explain and to show cause within five days from receipt thereof why he should not be held in contempt for his media interviews that degraded the court and the presiding judge, and why he should not be suspended from the practice of law for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically Rule 11.05 of Canon 11<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and Rule 13.02 of Canon 13.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the Order, the trial court stated that respondent was interviewed by Jun Clergio, and that the interview was repeatedly aired on September 30, 2003 and in his news program between 6:00 and 8:00 a.m. on October 1, 2003.&nbsp; He was also interviewed by Tony Consing on October 1 and 2, 2003, between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. in his radio program.&nbsp; In those radio interviews, respondent allegedly called Judge Tan a judge who does not know the law, a liar, and &nbsp;a dictator who does not accord due process to the people.<br><br>The hearing for the second contempt charge was set on December 4, 2003.<br><br>On November, 20, 2003, respondent filed an Urgent Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer to Contempt alleging that he was saddled with work of equal importance and needed ample time to answer the same. He also prayed for a bill of particulars in order to properly prepare for his defense.<br><br>In an Order dated November 20, 2003, the trial court denied the motion.&nbsp; It stated that a bill of particulars is not applicable in contempt proceedings, and that respondent’s&nbsp; actions and statements are detailed in the Order of October 20, 2003.<br><br>On the scheduled hearing of December 4, 2003 respondent neither appeared in court nor informed the court of his absence.&nbsp; The trial court issued &nbsp;an &nbsp;Order dated December 4, 2003 cancelling &nbsp;the hearing “to give Prosecutor Bagabuyo all the chances he asks for,” and ordered &nbsp;him to appear&nbsp; on January 12, 2004 to explain in writing or orally why he should not be cited in contempt of court pursuant to the facts stated in the Order dated October 20, 2003.&nbsp; However, respondent did not appear in the scheduled hearing of January 12, 2004.<br><br>On January 15, 2004, the trial court received respondent’s Answer dated January 8, 2004. Respondent denied the charge that he sought to be interviewed by radio station DXKS.&nbsp; He, however, stated that right after the hearing of September 30, 2003, he was approached by someone who asked him to comment on the Order issued in open court, and that his comment does not fall within the concept of indirect contempt of court.&nbsp; He also admitted that he was interviewed by his friend, Tony Consing, at the latter’s instance.&nbsp; He justified his response during the interview as a simple exercise of his constitutional right of &nbsp;freedom of speech and that it was not meant to offend or malign, and was without malice.<br><br>On February 8, 2004, the trial court issued an Order, the dispositive portion of which reads: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, finding preponderant evidence that Prosecutor Bagabuyo has grossly violated the Canons of the legal profession and [is] guilty of grave professional misconduct, rendering him unfit to continue to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities belonging to the office of an attorney, he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law.<br><br>Likewise, he is also found guilty of indirect contempt of court, for which he is hereby ordered to suffer the penalty of IMPRISONMENT for ninety (90) days to be served at the Surigao City Jail and to pay the maximum fine of THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P30,000.00).&nbsp; Future acts of contempt will be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Let copies of the relevant records be immediately forwarded to the Supreme Court for automatic review and for further determination of grounds for [the] disbarment of Prosecutor Rogelio Z. Bagabuyo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </blockquote> The trial court found respondent’s denials to be lame as the tape of his interview on October 2, 2003, duly transcribed, showed disrespect of the court and its officers, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%">TONY CONSING&nbsp;&nbsp;

Case No. 5144 was still pending in court, also violated Rule 13.02 of Canon 13, which states that “a lawyer shall not make public statements in the media regarding a pending case tending to arouse public opinion for or against a party.”<br><br>In regard to the radio interview given to Tony Consing, respondent violated Rule 11.05 of Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility for not resorting to the proper authorities only for redress of his grievances against Judge Tan.&nbsp; Respondent also violated Canon 11 for his disrespect of the court and its officer when he stated that Judge Tan was ignorant of the law, that&nbsp; as a mahjong <i>aficionado</i>, he was studying mahjong instead of studying&nbsp; the law, and that he was a liar.<br><br>Respondent also &nbsp;violated the Lawyer’s Oath, as he has sworn to “conduct [himself] as a lawyer according to the best of [his] knowledge and discretion with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to [his] clients.”<br><br>As a senior state prosecutor and officer of the court, respondent should have set the example of observing and maintaining the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers. &nbsp;<i>Montecillo v. Gica</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; held: <blockquote> It is the duty of the lawyer to maintain towards the courts a respectful attitude.&nbsp; As an officer of the court, it is his duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the court to which he owes fidelity, according to the oath he has taken.&nbsp; Respect for the courts guarantees the stability of our democratic institutions which, without such respect, would be resting on a very shaky foundation. </blockquote> The Court is not against lawyers raising grievances against erring judges but the rules clearly provide for the proper venue and procedure for doing so, precisely because respect for the institution must always be maintained.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, Atty.
