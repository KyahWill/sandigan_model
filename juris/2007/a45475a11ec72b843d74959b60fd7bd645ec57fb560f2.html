				<BR><STRONG>TINGA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The long-term campaign for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his wife Imelda, and their associates, has been met with many impediments, some of which are featured in this case, that have led to doubts whether there is still promise in that enterprise. Yet even as the prosecution of those cases have drudged on and on, the era of their final reckoning is just beginning before this Court. The heavy hammer of the law is just starting to fall.<br><br>The instant action originated from a civil complaint for restitution and damages filed by the Republic of the Philippines against Marcos and his longtime aide Juan Tuvera, as well as Tuvera's son Victor and a corporation the younger Tuvera had controlled. Trial on the case against the Tuveras proceeded separately before the Sandiganbayan. After the Republic had presented its evidence, the Tuveras successfully moved for the dismissal of the case on demurrer to evidence. The demurrer was sustained, and it falls upon this Court to ascertain the absence or existence of sufficient proof to support the relief sought by the Republic against the Tuveras.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I</span>.<br></div><br>We begin with the facts.<br><br>Twin Peaks Development Corporation (Twin Peaks) was organized on 5 March 1984 as a corporation with a principal purpose of engaging in the real estate business. There were five incorporating stockholders, including respondent Victor Tuvera (Victor)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> who owned 48% of the shares of the fledgling corporation. Victor was the son of respondent Juan Tuvera, who was then Presidential Executive Assistant of&nbsp; President Marcos.<br><br>Acting on a letter dated 31 May 1984 of Twin Peaks’ Vice-President and Treasurer Evelyn Fontanilla in behalf of the corporation, President Marcos granted the award of a Timber License Agreement (TLA), more specifically TLA No. 356, in favor of Twin Peaks to operate on 26,000 hectares of forest land with an annual allowable cut of 60,000 cubic meters of timber and to export 10,000 cubic meters of mahogany of the narra species.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As a result, Twin Peaks was able to engage in logging operations.<br><br>On 25 February 1986, President Marcos was ousted, and Corazon C. Aquino assumed the presidency. Among her first acts as President was to establish the Philippine Commission on Good Government (PCGG), tasked with tracking down the ill-gotten wealth procured by Marcos, his family, and associates during his 20-year rule. Among the powers granted to the PCGG was the power to issue writs of sequestration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; On 13 June 1988, the PCGG issued a Writ of Sequestration on all assets, properties, records, documents, and shares of stock of Twin Peaks on the ground that all the assets of the corporation are ill-gotten wealth for having been acquired directly or indirectly &nbsp;through &nbsp;fraudulent and illegal means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This was followed two days later by Mission Order No. MER-88 (Mission Order), also issued by the PCGG, implementing the aforementioned Writ of Sequestration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On 9 December 1988, the PCGG, in behalf of the Republic, filed the Complaint now subject of this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Impleaded as defendants in the Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> were Juan and Victor Tuvera, as well as the then-exiled President Marcos. Through the Complaint, the Republic sought to recover funds allegedly acquired by said parties in flagrant breach of trust and fiduciary obligations with grave abuse of right and power in violation of the Constitution and the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In particular, the Complaint alleged that Juan Tuvera, as Presidential Executive Assistant of President Marcos, took advantage of his relationship to influence upon and connection with the President by engaging in a scheme to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of the Republic and of the Filipino people. This was allegedly accomplished on his part by securing TLA No. 356 on behalf of Twin Peaks despite existing laws expressly prohibiting the exportation of mahogany of the narra species<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and Twin Peaks’ lack of qualification to be a grantee thereof for lack of sufficient logging equipment to engage in the logging business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The Complaint further alleged that Twin Peaks exploited the country’s natural resources by engaging in large-scale logging and the export of its produce through its Chinese operators whereby respondents obtained a revenue of approximately P45 million.<br><br>The Complaint prayed that (1) TLA No. 356 be reverted to the State or cancelled; (2) respondents be jointly and severally ordered to pay P48 million<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as actual damages; and (3) respondents pay &nbsp;moral, temperate and exemplary damages, litigation expenses, and treble judicial costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It cited as grounds for relief, gross abuse of official position and authority, breach of public trust and fiduciary obligations, brazen abuse of right and power, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In their Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> respondents Victor Tuvera and Twin Peaks claimed that Twin Peaks was awarded TLA No. 356 only after its articles of incorporation had been amended enabling it to engage in logging operations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that the Republic’s reference to Chinese operations &nbsp;and &nbsp;revenue &nbsp;of &nbsp;approximately &nbsp;P45 &nbsp;million were merely imagined,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and that the PCGG has no statutory authority to institute the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; By way of counterclaim, respondents asked that the Republic be ordered to pay Victor Tuvera moral damages and to pay both Victor Tuvera and Twin Peaks exemplary damages, and to reimburse their attorney’s fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Anent the allegation that Twin Peaks sold about P3 million worth of lumber despite the Writ of Sequestration issued by the PCGG, respondents stressed that the Director of Forest Development acted within the scope of his authority and the courts have no supervising power over the actions of the Director of Forest Development and the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in the performance of their official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>As an affirmative and special defense, respondents Victor Tuvera and Twin Peaks alleged that after Twin Peaks was granted TLA No. 356 &nbsp;in &nbsp;24 August 1984, Felipe Ysmael, Jr. and Co., Inc. had filed &nbsp;a &nbsp;motion for the cancellation of the &nbsp;same with &nbsp;the &nbsp;DENR Secretary. When respondents submitted their Answer, the denial by the DENR of the Ysmael motion was under review before the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Juan Tuvera, who was abroad when the case was filed on 9 December 1988, later submitted his own Answer on 6 December 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He also denied the allegations of the Republic and alleged that as Presidential Executive Assistant of then President Marcos, he acted within the confines of his duties and had perpetrated no unlawful acts. He merely transmitted communications of approval in the course of his duties and had nothing to do with the decisions of then President Marcos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He denied having anything to do with Twin Peaks.<br><br>Juan Tuvera filed a compulsory counterclaim on the ground that the instant action had besmirched his reputation and caused serious anxiety and mental anguish thus entitling him to moral and exemplary damages and litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On 3 May 1989, respondents filed an Omnibus Motion to Nullify Writ of Sequestration and/or the Mission Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Sandiganbayan issued a Temporary Restraining Order against the PCGG requiring it to cease, refrain and desist from further implementing the Writ of Sequestration and the Mission Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Subsequently, on motion of respondents, the Sandiganbayan granted a Writ of Preliminary Injunction covering the Mission Order. The Sandiganbayan deferred its resolution on the Motion to Lift the Writ of Sequestration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>From 1988 to 1993, the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan were delayed owing to the difficulty of acquiring jurisdiction over the person of President Marcos, who was by then already in exile. Thus, upon motion by respondents, the Sandiganbayan granted them a separate pre-trial/trial from President Marcos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Respondents submitted their documentary evidence in the Pre-Trial Conference while the Republic reserved to present the same during trial.&nbsp; After the pre-trial conference, the Sandiganbayan issued a Pre-Trial Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated 3 November 1993, which presented the issues for litigation as follows:<br><blockquote>Whether or not defendant Juan C. Tuvera who was a Presidential Executive Assistant at the time material to this case, by himself and in concert with his co-defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos and Victor Tuvera, took advantage of his relation and connection with the late Marcos, secure (sic) a timber concession for Twin Peaks Development Corporation and, engage (sic) in a scheme to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of the Republic and the Filipino People.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>The Pre-Trial Order also indicated that the Republic admitted the exhibits by respondents, subject to the presentation of certified true copies thereof.

The first witness was Joveniana M. Galicia, Chief of the National Forest Management Division of the Forest Management Bureau. She identified TLA No. 356 of Twin Peaks dated 20 August 1984 and a Memorandum dated 18 July 1984. She testified that TLA No. 356 covers 26,000 hectares of forest land located in the Municipality of Isabela, Province of Quirino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The Memorandum dated 18 July 1984 addressed to Director Edmundo Cortez recited then President Marcos’ grant of the timber concession to Twin Peaks. Identified and marked in the same memorandum were the name and signature of Juan Tuvera.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Upon cross-examination, Galicia stated that she was not yet the chief of the Division when the documents she identified were submitted to the Bureau. She further stated it was her first time to see the aforementioned documents when she was asked to bring the same before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The next witness was Fortunato S. Arcangel, Regional Technical Director III of the DENR. He testified that he is a Technical Director under the Forest Management Services of the DENR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He identified Forestry Administration Order (FAO) No. 11 dated 1 September 1970. He said he was aware of TLA No. 356 of Twin Peaks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> because at the time it was issued, he was the chief of the Forestry Second Division and his duties included the evaluation and processing of applications for licenses and permits for the disposition and &nbsp;distribution &nbsp;of &nbsp;timber and other forest products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Consequently, he was aware of the process by which TLA No. 356 was issued to Twin Peaks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> According to him, they processed the application insofar as they evaluated the location of the area concerned and its present vegetative state, examined the records, and determined the annual allowable land.&nbsp; After the examination, the license agreement was prepared and submitted for approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> He continued that under FAO No. 11, a public bidding is required before any license agreement or permit for the utilization of timber within the forestry land is issued<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> but no public bidding was conducted for TLA No. 356.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He explained that no such bidding was conducted because of a Presidential Instruction not to accept any application for timber licensing as a consequence of which bidding procedures were stopped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Upon cross-examination, Arcangel said that at the time TLA No. 356 was issued, the Revised Forestry Code of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> was already in effect but there were still provisions in FAO No. 11 that remained applicable such as the terms and conditions of granting a license. He also stated that the issuance of the license to Twin Peaks emanated from the President of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Republic’s third and last witness was Teresita M. Zuñiga, employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. She identified the &nbsp;1986 Income Tax Returns of Victor P. Tuvera, Evelyn Fontanilla and Feliciano O. Salvana, stockholders of Twin Peaks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On 24 June 1994, the Republic rested its case after its formal offer of evidence, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="5" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"> <td><strong>Exhibits</strong></td> <td><strong>Documents</strong></td> <td><strong>Purpose</strong></td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td align="left" width="10%">A&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td align="left" width="25%">Timber License Agreement No. 356 of Twin Peaks Realty Development Corp. dated 20 August 1984&nbsp; </td> <td align="left" width="35%">To prove that the Timber License Agreement was executed prior to the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation of Twin Peaks Realty Development Corp.</td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"> <td valign="top">B</td> <td valign="top">Memorandum dated 18 July 1984 of Juan C.

Respondents argued that the Republic failed to present sufficient legal affirmative evidence to prove its claim. In particular, respondents’ demurrer contends that the memorandum (Exh. B) and TLA No. 356 are not “legal evidence” because “legal evidence” is not meant to raise a mere suspicion or doubt. Respondents also claim that income tax returns are not sufficient to show one’s holding in a corporation. Respondents also cited the factual antecedents culminating with the Court’s decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">Felipe Ysmael, Jr. &amp; Corp., Inc. v. Sec. of Environment and Natural Resources</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The Republic filed a Manifestation, contending that the <span style="font-style: italic;">demurrer</span> is not based on the insufficiency of its evidence but on the strength of the evidence of respondents as shown by their own exhibits. The Republic claimed that the Revised Forestry Code of the Philippines does not dispense with the requirement of public bidding. The Republic added that Sec. 5 of said law clearly provides that all applications for a timber license agreement must be filed before the Bureau of Forest Development and that respondents still have to prove compliance with the requirements for service contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Respondents opposed the Manifestation, maintaining that since the Republic admitted the exhibits of respondents during the pre-trial, it is bound by its own admission.&nbsp; Further, these same exhibits contain uncontroverted facts and laws that only magnify the conclusion that the Republic has no right to relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In its Resolution dated 23 May 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Sandiganbayan sustained the demurrer to evidence and referred to the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ysmael</span> in holding that <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> applies. The Anti-Graft Court also did not give credence to the Republic’s allegations concerning respondents’ abuse of power and/or public trust and consequent liability for damages in view of its failure to establish any violation of Arts. 19, 20 and 21 of the Civil Code.<br><br>In essence, the Sandiganbayan held that the validity of TLA No. 356 was already fully adjudicated in a Resolution/Order issued by the Office of the President on 14 August 1987, which had become final and executory with the failure of the aggrieved party to seek a review thereof. The Sandiganbayan continued that the above pronouncement is supported by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ysmael</span>. Consequently, the Sandiganbayan concluded, the Republic is barred from questioning the validity of TLA No. 356 in consonance with the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.<br><br>The Republic now questions the correctness of the Sandiganbayan’s decision to grant the demurrer to evidence because it was not based solely on the insufficiency of its evidence but also on the evidence of respondent mentioned during the pre-trial conference. The Republic also challenges the applicability of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-style: italic;">II</span>.<br></div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>Preliminarily, we observe that respondents had filed before the Sandiganbayan a pleading captioned Motion to Dismiss <span style="font-style: italic;">or </span>Demurrer to Evidence, thus evincing that they were seeking the alternative reliefs of either a motion to dismiss or a demurrer to evidence. However, the Sandiganbayan, in resolving this motion, referred to it as Motion to Dismiss <span style="font-style: italic;">on </span>Demurrer to Evidence, a pleading of markedly different character from a Motion to Dismiss <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span> Demurrer to Evidence. Still, a close reading of the Sandiganbayan Resolution reveals clearly that the Sandiganbayan was treating the motion as a demurrer, following Rule 33, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, rather than a motion to dismiss under Rule 16, Section 1.<br><br>This notwithstanding, the Sandiganbayan justified the grant of demurrer with r<span style="font-style: italic;">es judicata</span> as rationale. <span style="font-style: italic;">Res judicata</span> is an inappropriate ground for sustaining a demurrer to evidence, even as it stands as a proper ground for a motion to dismiss. A demurrer may be granted if, after the presentation of plaintiff’s evidence, it appears upon the facts and the law that the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. In contrast, the grounds for <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> present themselves even before the presentation of evidence, and it should be at that stage that the defense of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> should be invoked as a ground for dismissal. Properly speaking, the movants for demurral who wish to rely on a controlling value of a settled case as a ground for demurrer should invoke the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">stare decisis </span>in lieu<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Domondon v.

In other words, the Sandiganbayan did not dismiss the case on the insufficiency of the Republic’s evidence nor &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;strength &nbsp;of &nbsp;respondents’ &nbsp;evidence. &nbsp;Rather, &nbsp;it &nbsp;based &nbsp;its dismissal on the existence of the Ysmael case which, according to it, would render the case barred by res <span style="font-style: italic;">judicata.</span><br><br>Prescinding from this procedural miscue, was the Sandiganbayan correct in applying res<span style="font-style: italic;"> judicata</span> to the case at bar? To determine whether or not <span style="font-style: italic;">res</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">judicata</span> indeed applies in the instant case, a review of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ysmael</span> is proper.<br><br>In brief, Felipe Ysmael, Jr. &amp; Co., Inc. was a grantee of a timber license agreement, TLA No. 87. Sometime in August 1983, the Bureau of Forest Development cancelled TLA No. 87 despite the company’s letter for the reconsideration of the revocation.&nbsp; Barely one year thereafter, one-half (or 26,000 hectares) of the area formerly covered by TLA No. 87 was re-awarded to Twin Peaks under TLA No. 356.<br><br>In 1986, Felipe Ysmael, Jr. &amp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; sent separate letters to the Office of the President and the Ministry of Natural Resources primarily seeking the reinstatement of TLA No. 87 and the revocation of TLA No. 356. Both offices denied the relief prayed for. Consequently, Felipe Ysmael, Jr. &amp; Co., Inc. filed a petition for review before this Court.<br><br>The Court, through the late Justice Irene Cortes, held that Ysmael’s letters to the Office of the President and to the Ministry of Natural Resources in 1986 sought the reconsideration of a memorandum order by the Bureau of Forest Development canceling their timber license agreement in 1983 and the revocation of TLA No. 356 subsequently issued by the Bureau in 1984. Ysmael did not attack the administrative actions until after 1986. Since the decision of the Bureau has become final, it has the force and effect of a final judgment within the purview of the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata.</span> These decisions and orders, therefore, are conclusive upon the rights of the affected parties as though the same had been rendered by a court of general jurisdiction. The Court also denied the petition of Ysmael because it failed to file the special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 within a reasonable time, as well as in due regard for public policy considerations and the principle of non-interference by the courts in matters which are addressed to the sound discretion of government agencies entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under the special technical knowledge and training of such agencies.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarabia and Leido v.

With the illegality of the grant established as fact, finding Victor Tuvera, the major stockholder of Twin Peaks, liable in this case should be the ineluctable course. In order that Juan Tuvera may be held answerable as well, his own participation in the illegal grant should also be substantiated.<br><br>Regarding the first line of inquiry, the Complaint adverted to several provisions of law which ostensibly were violated by the grant of the TLA in favor of Twin Peaks. These include R.A. No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act,&nbsp; and Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Still, the most organic laws that determine the validity or invalidity of the TLA are those that governed the issuance of timber license agreements in 1984. In that regard, the Republic argues that the absence of a bidding process is patent proof of the irregularity of the issuance of the TLA in favor of Twin Peaks.<br><br>A timber license agreement authorizes a person to utilize forest resources within any forest land with the right of possession and exclusion of others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; The Forestry Reform Code prohibits any person from utilizing, exploiting, occupying, possessing or conducting any activity within any forest land unless he had been authorized to do so under a license agreement, lease, license or permit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The Code also mandates that no timber license agreement shall be issued unless the applicant satisfactorily proves that he has the financial resources and technical capability not only to minimize utilization, but also to practice forest protection, conservation and development measures to insure the perpetuation of said forest in productive condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> However, the Code is silent as to the procedure in the acquisition of such timber license agreement.

Since timber is not a readily renewable natural resource, it is essential and appropriate that the &nbsp;State &nbsp;serve and act as a jealous and zealous guardian of our forest lands, with the layers of bureaucracy that encumber the grant of timber license agreements effectively serving as a defensive wall against the thoughtless ravage of our forest resources.<br><br>There is no doubt that no public bidding occurred in this case. Certainly, respondents did not raise the defense in their respective answers. The absence of such bidding was testified on by prosecution witness Arcangel. Yet even if we consider that Twin Peaks could have acquired the TLA through “negotiation,” the prescribed requirements for “negotiation” under the law were still not complied with.<br><br>It is evident that Twin Peaks was of the frame of mind that it could simply walk up to President Marcos and ask for a timber license agreement without having to comply with the elaborate application procedure under the law. This is indicated by the letter dated 31 May 1984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> signed by Twin Peaks’ Vice President and Treasurer Evelyn Fontanilla, addressed directly to then President Marcos, wherein Twin Peaks expressed that “we would like to request a permit to export 20,000 cubic meters of logs and to cut and process 10,000 cubic meters of the narra species in the same area.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> A marginal note therein signed by Marcos indicates an approval thereof.&nbsp; Neither the Forestry &nbsp;Reform Code nor FAO No. 11 provide for the submission of an application directly to the Office of the President as a proper mode for the issuance of a TLA. Without discounting the breadth and scope of the President’s powers as Chief Executive, the authority of the President with respect to timber licenses is, by the express terms of the Revised Forestry Code, limited to the amendment, modification, replacement or rescission of any contract, concession, permit, license or any other form of privilege granted by said Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>There are several factors that taint this backdoor application for a timber license agreement by Twin Peaks. The forest area covered by the TLA was already the subject of a pre-existing TLA in favor of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ysmael</span>. The Articles of Incorporation of Twin Peaks does not even stipulate that logging was either a principal or secondary purpose of the corporation. Respondents do allege that the Articles was amended prior to the grant in order to accommodate logging as a corporate purpose, yet since respondents have waived their right to present evidence by reason of their resort to demurrer, we cannot consider such allegation as proven.<br><br>Sec. 18(a)(1) of FAO No. 11 requires that an applicant must have a minimum capitalization of P20.00 per cubic meter in cash and an established credit line of P150.00 per cubic meter based on the allowable annual cut. TLA No. 356 allowed Twin Peaks to operate on 26,000 &nbsp;hectares &nbsp;of &nbsp;forest land with an annual allowable cut of 60,000 cubic &nbsp;meters of &nbsp;timber. With such annual allowable cut, Twin<br><br>Peaks, therefore, must have at least P1,200,000.00 in cash as its minimum capitalization, following FAO No. 11. An examination of Twin Peaks’ Articles of Incorporation shows that its paid-up capital was only P312,500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Clearly, Twin Peaks’ paid-up capital is way below the minimum capitalization requirement.<br><br>Moreover, Sec. 18(5) provides that the bidder or applicant shall show evidence of ownership of, or negotiation to acquire, a wood processing plant. However, although TLA No. 356 was issued to Twin Peaks in 1984, it continued to engage the services of at least two sawmills<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> as late as 1988. Four (4) years from the issuance of the license, Twin Peaks remained incapable of processing logs.<br><br>What could have made Twin Peaks feel emboldened to directly request President Marcos for the grant of Timber License Agreement despite the obvious problems relating to its capacity to engage in timber activities? The reasonable assumption is that the official and personal proximity of Juan Tuvera to President Marcos was a key factor, considering that he was the father of Twin Peaks' most substantial stockholder.<br><br>The causes of action against respondents allegedly arose from Juan Tuvera’s abuse of his relationship, influence and connection as Presidential Executive Assistant of then President Marcos. Through Juan Tuvera’s position, the Republic claims that Twin Peaks was able to secure a Timber License Agreement despite its lack of qualification and the absence of a public bidding. On account of the unlawful issuance of a timber license agreement, the natural resources of the country were unlawfully exploited at the expense of the Filipino people. Victor Tuvera, as son of Juan Tuvera and a major stockholder of Twin Peaks, was included as respondent for having substantially benefited from this breach of trust. The circumstance of kinship alone may not be enough to disqualify Victor Tuvera from seeking a timber license agreement. Yet the basic ethical principle of delicadeza should have dissuaded Juan Tuvera from any official or unofficial participation or intervention in behalf of the “request” of Twin Peaks for a timber license.<br><br>Did Juan Tuvera do the honorable thing and keep his distance from Twin Peaks' “request”? Apparently not. Instead, he penned a Memorandum dated 18 July 1984 in his capacity as Presidential Executive Assistant, directed at the Director of Forestry, the official who, under the law, possessed the legal authority to decide whether to grant the timber license agreements after deliberating on the application and its supporting documents. The Memorandum reads in full:<br></span><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Office of the President</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <br>of the Philippines</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <br>Malacanang</span><br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <br><blockquote>18 July 1984<br></blockquote></span></div></div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><blockquote>74-84<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MEMORANDUM to</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>Director Edmundo Cortes</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>Bureau of Forest Development</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I wish to inform you that the President has granted the award to the Twin Peaks Realty Development Corporation, of the concession to manage, operate and develop in accordance with existing policies and regulations half of the timber area in the Province of Quirino covered by TLA No. 87, formerly belonging to the Felipe Ysmael, Jr. &amp; Company and comprising 54,920 hectares, and to export half of the requested 20,000 cubic meters of logs to be gathered from the area.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Herewith is a copy of the letter concering (sic) this matter of Ms. Evelyn F.

If Juan Tuvera were truly interested in preventing any misconception that his own position had nothing to do with the favorable action on the “request” lodged by the company controlled by his son, he would not have prepared or signed the Memorandum at all. Certainly, there were other officials in Malacañang who could have performed that role had the intent of the Memorandum been merely to inform the Director of Forestry of such Presidential action.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Delicadeza</span> is not merely a stentorian term evincing a bygone ethic.

The fact that the principal stockholder of Twin Peaks was his own son establishes his indirect pecuniary interest in the transaction he appears to have intervened in. It may have been possible on the part of Juan Tuvera to prove that he did not persuade, induce or influence the Director of Forestry or any other official in behalf of the timber license agreement of Twin Peaks, but then again, he waived his right to present evidence to acquit himself of such suspicion. Certainly, the circumstances presented by the evidence of the prosecution are sufficient to shift the burden of evidence to Tuvera in establishing that he did not violate the provisions of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act in relation to the Twin Peaks “request.” Unfortunately, having waived his right to present evidence, Juan Tuvera failed to disprove that he failed to act in consonance with his obligations under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>In sum, the backdoor recourse for a hugely priced favor from the government by itself, and more in tandem with other brazen relevant damning circumstances, indicates the impudent abuse of power and the detestable misuse of influence that homologously made the acquisition of ill-gotten wealth a reality. Upon the facts borne out by the evidence for the Republic and guideposts supplied by the governing laws, the Republic has a clear right to the reliefs it seeks.<br><br></span><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-style: italic;">VI</span>.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span></div><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br>If only the Court's outrage were quantifiable in sums of money, respondents are due for significant pecuniary hurt. Instead, the Court is forced to explain in the next few paragraphs why respondents could not be forced to recompensate the Filipino people in appropriate financial terms. The fault lies with those engaged by the government to litigate this case in behalf of the State.<br><br>It bears to the most primitive of reasons that an action for recovery of sum of money must prove the amount sought to be recovered. In the case at bar, the Republic rested its case without presenting any evidence, documentary or testimonial, to establish the amount that should be restituted to the State by reason of the illegal acts committed by the respondents. There is the bare allegation in the complaint that the State is entitled to P48 million by way of actual damages, but no single proof presented as to why the State is entitled to such amount.<br><br>Actual damages must be proven, not presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> The Republic failed to prove damages. It is not enough for the Republic to have established, as it did, the legal travesty that led to the wrongful obtention by Twin Peaks of the TLA. It should have established the degree of injury sustained by the State by reason of such wrongful act.<br><br>We fail to comprehend why the Republic failed to present any proof of actual damages. Was it the inability to obtain the necessary financial documents that would establish the income earned by Twin Peaks during the period it utilized the TLA, despite the presence of the discovery processes? Was it mere indolence or sheer incompetence? Whatever the reason, the lapse is inexcusable, and the injury ultimately conduces to the pain of the Filipino people. If the litigation of this case is indicative of the mindset in the prosecution of ill-gotten wealth cases, it is guaranteed to ensure that those who stole from the people will be laughing on their way to the bank.<br><br>The claim for moral damages deserves short shrift. The claimant in this case is the Republic of the Philippines, a juridical person. We explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Filipinas Broadcasting v.

PNB, et al</span>.&nbsp; to justify the award of moral damages. However, the Court's statement in Mambulao that "a corporation may have a good reputation which, if besmirched, may also be a ground for the award of moral damages" is an <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter dictum</span>.<br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nevertheless, AMEC's claim for moral damages falls under item 7 of Article 2219 of the Civil Code. This provision expressly authorizes the recovery of moral damages in cases of libel, slander or any other form of defamation. Article 2219(7) does not qualify whether the plaintiff is a natural or juridical person. Therefore, a juridical person such as a corporation can validly complain for libel or any other form of defamation and claim for moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></span></blockquote></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As explained, a juridical person is not entitled to moral damages under Article 2217 of the Civil Code. It may avail of moral damages under the analogous cases listed in Article 2219, such as for libel, slander or any other form of defamation. Suffice it to say that the action at bar does not involve any of the analogous cases under Article 2219, and indeed upon an intelligent reading of Article 2219, it is difficult to see how the Republic could sustain any of the injuries contemplated therein. Any lawyer for the Republic who poses a claim for moral damages in behalf of the State stands in risk of serious ridicule.<br><br>However, there is sufficient basis for an award of temperate damages, also sought by the Republic notwithstanding the fact that a claim for both actual and temperate damages is internally inconsistent. Temperate or moderate damages avail when “the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount can not from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The textual language might betray an intent that temperate damages do not avail when the case, by its nature, is susceptible to proof of pecuniary loss; and certainly the Republic could have proved pecuniary loss herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>&nbsp; Still, jurisprudence applying Article 2224 is clear that temperate damages may be awarded even in instances where pecuniary loss could theoretically have been proved with certainty.<br><br>In a host of criminal cases, the Court has awarded temperate damages to the heirs of the victim in cases where the amount of actual damages was not proven due to the inadequacy of the evidence presented by the prosecution.

Notwithstanding the language of Article 2224, a line of jurisprudence has emerged authorizing the award of temperate damages even in cases where the amount of pecuniary loss could have been proven with certainty, if no such adequate proof was presented. The allowance of temperate damages when actual damages were not adequately proven is ultimately a rule drawn from equity, the principle affording relief to those definitely injured who are unable to prove how definite the injury. There is no impediment to apply this doctrine to the case at bar, which involves one of the most daunting and noble undertakings of our young democracy–the recovery of ill-gotten wealth salted away during the Marcos years. If the doctrine can be &nbsp;justified to answer for the unlawful damage to a cargo truck, it is a compounded wrath if it cannot answer for the unlawful exploitation of our forests, to the injury of the Filipino people. The amount of P1,000,000.00 as temperate damages is proper.<br><br>The allowance of temperate damages also paves the way for the award of exemplary damages. Under Article 2234 of the Civil Code,&nbsp; a showing that the plaintiff is entitled to temperate damages allows for the award of exemplary damages. Even as exemplary damages cannot be recovered as a matter of right, the courts are empowered to decide whether or not they should be adjudicated. Ill-gotten wealth cases are hornbook demonstrations where damages by way of example or correction for the public good should be awarded. Fewer causes of action deserve the stigma left by exemplary damages, which “serve as a deterrent against or as a negative incentive to curb socially deleterious actions.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The obtention of the timber license agreement by Twin Peaks through fraudulent and illegal means was highlighted by Juan Tuvera’s abuse of his position as Presidential Executive Assistant.&nbsp; The consequent exploitation of 26 hectares of forest land benefiting all respondents is a grave case of unjust enrichment at the expense of the Filipino people and of the environment which should never be countenanced.&nbsp; Considering the expanse of forest land exploited by respondents, the volume of timber that was necessarily cut by virtue of their abuse and the estimated wealth acquired by respondents through grave abuse of trust and public office, it is only reasonable that petitioner be granted the amount of P1,000,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>The imposition of exemplary damages is a means by which the State, through its judicial arm, can send the clear and unequivocal signal best expressed in the pithy but immutable phrase, “never again.” It is severely unfortunate that the Republic did not exert its best efforts in the full recovery of the actual damages caused by the illegal grant of the Twin Peaks TLA. To the best of our ability, through the appropriate vehicle of exemplary damages, the Court will try &nbsp;to &nbsp;fill &nbsp;in &nbsp;that &nbsp;deficiency. &nbsp;For &nbsp;if &nbsp;there &nbsp;is a lesson that should be learned from the national trauma of the rule of Marcos, it is that kleptocracy cannot pay. As those dark years fade into the backburner of the collective memory, and a new generation emerges without proximate knowledge of how bad it was then, it is useful that the Court serves a reminder here and now.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.
