It added that petitioner also failed to append the several complaints for violation of P.D. No. 1519, the several amended criminal complaints for violation of Rep. Act No. 7875, and the attachments stated in paragraph 3 of the motion to dismiss, which were all material portions of the records and relevant to the petition, in contravention of Section 2, Rule 42 which requires that the petition be accompanied by such other pleadings and material portions of the records as should support the allegations of the petition.<br><br>Likewise, on November 5, 2003, the Court of Appeals denied the motion for reconsideration.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]<br><br></sup></b></b>On December 9, 2003, the petitioner filed a petition for review on certiorari before this Court.<br><br>Assigned by the petitioner as issues are the following:</b></b></b></b><blockquote><center><b><b><b><b>I.<br><br></b></b></b></b></center><b><b><b><b>WHETHER OR NOT IN 1999 AND 2000 IN THE PROVINCE OF ANTIQUE NOBODY COULD BE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED FOR NON-PAYMENT OF MEDICARE CONTRIBUTIONS[.]<br><br></b></b></b></b><center><b><b><b><b>II.<br><br></b></b></b></b></center><b><b><b><b>WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIAL COURT ON ANY GROUND COULD DISMISS AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH IT ORDERED TO AMEND[.]</b></b></b></b><center><b><b><b><b><br>III.<br><br></b></b></b></b></center><b><b><b><b>WHETHER OR NOT A PETITIONER COULD APPEAL HIS CASES WITHOUT WRITTEN CONFORMITY OF THE PROSECUTOR[.]</b></b></b></b><center><b><b><b><b><br>IV.<br><br></b></b></b></b></center><b><b><b><b>WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITION FILED WITH THE COURT OF APPEAL[S] CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RULES OF COURT[.]<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></b></b></b></b></b></b></blockquote><b><b><b><b>The issues for our determination are: (1) Is nonpayment of medicare contribution a criminal offense in Antique in 1999 and 2000?

The Court of Appeals averred that petitioner never gave the required explanation.<br><br>In <i>Musa</i><i> v. Amor</i>,<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></b></b> which also involved the question of no personal service, we said:</b></b></b></b><blockquote><b><b><b><b>... Considering the distance between the Court of Appeals and Donsol, Sorsogon where the petition was posted, clearly, service by registered mail would have entailed considerable time, effort and expense. A written explanation why service was not done personally might have been superfluous.  In any case, as the rule is so worded with the use of "may," signifying permissiveness, a violation thereof gives the court discretion whether or not to consider that paper as not filed. While it is true that procedural rules are necessary to secure an orderly and speedy administration of justice, rigid application of Section 11, Rule 13 may be relaxed in this case in the interest of substantial justice.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></b></b></b></b></b></b></blockquote><b><b><b><b>Conformably with the <i>Musa</i><i> v.

Considering the distance between the Court of Appeals and the Province of Antique where the petition was posted, a written explanation why service was not done personally might have been superfluous.  In the interest of substantial justice, a rigid application of Section 11, Rule 13 could be relaxed in this case.<br><br>Moreover, Section 6, Rule 1 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure states the following:</b></b></b></b><blockquote><b><b><b><b>SEC. 6. <i>Construction</i>. - These Rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding.</b></b></b></b></blockquote><b><b><b><b>Mindful of the aforecited rule, we find the explanation of petitioner acceptable.

Respondents, however, state that there was a violation of Section 2, Rule 42, which<b> </b>requires that the petition be accompanied by such other pleadings and material portions of the records as should support the allegations of the petition.  The Court of Appeals said that the petition did not append the several criminal complaints for violation of Rep. Act No. 7875 and the attachments stated in paragraph 3 of the motion to dismiss.<br><br>Dismissal of appeals purely on technical grounds is frowned upon.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></b></b>  In the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, we may even stay an order of such kind of dismissal, especially in this case where petitioner's appeal appears worthy of the Court of Appeals' full consideration <i>prima facie </i>on the merits.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></b></b>  Here, the Court of Appeals could have easily required the parties to submit additional documents as might have been necessary in the interest of substantial justice.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]<br><br></sup></b></b>In brief, under the circumstances of this case, it was wrong for the Court of Appeals to peremptorily dismiss the petition for failure to explain why registered mail was resorted to, and for failure of the petitioner to attach to the petition other pleadings and material portions of the records.<br><br>Well established is the doctrine that every party litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></b></b><br><br>Finally, on the issues of nonpayment of medicare contributions as a criminal offense and the need for the conformity of the prosecutor to appeal a case, we note that these two issues are  raised as issues before the Court of Appeals.<b><b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></b></b> We shall not preempt the appellate court on these.<b><br><br></b></b></b></b></b><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span><b><b><b><b>, the challenged Resolutions dated July 31, 2002 and November 5, 2003 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
