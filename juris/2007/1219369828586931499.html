During their marriage, Feliciano Sr. and Lorenza acquired a 120-square meter lot located at Poblacion, Mandaon, Masbate, upon which they built their conjugal home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; The subject lot was covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> issued in the name of Feliciano Sr.<br><br>After the death of Lorenza, Feliciano Sr. cohabited with Paz Lachica and lived at the aforesaid house.&nbsp; However, after Lorenza's death, her heirs failed to partition their hereditary shares in their inheritance.<br><br>On February 27, 1960, while Lorenza was cohabiting with Feliciano Sr., Paz Lachica purchased a 192-square meter lot covered by Tax Declaration No. 02115 from the heirs of Juan Rivas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She later sold 40.10 square meters of the property to Isabel L. de Real leaving her with only 151.9 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On July 7, 1965, or two (2) days before he died, Feliciano Sr. married Paz Lachica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; After Feliciano Sr. died, his heirs also failed to partition among themselves their hereditary shares in their inheritance.<br><br>Sometime in 1969, Paz Lachica was issued Tax Declaration No. 4424<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> over the remaining 151.9 square meters of the property covered by Tax Declaration No. 02115.&nbsp; The aforesaid Tax Declaration was later cancelled by Tax Declaration No. 3443-Rev.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On September 10, 1973, Tax Declaration No. 3514<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was issued, effectively canceling Tax Declaration No. 3443-Rev.&nbsp; Also, in said Tax Declaration No. 3514, the area originally covered by Tax Declaration No. 3443-Rev was increased from 151.9 square meters to 336 square meters, and it included the 120-square meter property originally covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151.&nbsp; It also contained an annotation at the back stating "Revised as per request of the owner to include the excess area for taxation purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, Tax Declaration No. 3514 was cancelled by Tax Declaration No. 1558,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which was later cancelled by Tax Declaration No. 1946,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and later cancelled by Tax Declaration No. 2038.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On December 18, 1986, Paz Lachica and herein petitioners, Spouses Charlito Coja and Annie Mesa Coja, executed a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> wherein the former sold the 336-square meter parcel of land covered by Tax Declaration No. 2038 to the latter.&nbsp; Consequently, Tax Declaration No. 4946<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> was issued in the name of petitioners, canceling Tax Declaration No. 2038.<br><br>Sometime in 1987, Charlito Coja filed an application for the issuance of title with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 46, Masbate, Masbate (now Masbate City) docketed as LRC No. N-365.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Luz, being one of the heirs of Feliciano Sr., opposed the application for registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) opposed the application.&nbsp;&nbsp; The OSG alleged, among other things, that the applicant or his predecessors-in- interest had not been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the subject land within the period required by law; and that the documents attached to or alleged in the application do not constitute competent and sufficient evidence of a <i>bona fide</i> acquisition of the land or of an open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation thereof in the concept of an owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the case, Luz died.&nbsp; She was substituted by her spouse, Quinciano Victor, Sr., and her children, Lorna, Antonio, Quinciano Jr., and Susana, all surnamed Victor.<br><br>On November 3, 1989, respondents filed an action for recovery of possession and ownership with damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 3904, against the petitioners and Paz Lachica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents claimed that they are the true and lawful heirs of the Spouses Feliciano Sr. and Lorenza; that Paz Lachica refused to deliver the property to its rightful owners despite repeated demands; that Paz Lachica appropriated the subject property to herself and had the tax declaration transferred to her name; that Paz Lachica sold the property to the Spouses Coja; and that the Spouses Coja failed to deliver the subject property to the rightful heirs despite repeated demands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Upon motion by the plaintiffs, LRC No. N-365 and Civil Case No. 3904 were consolidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In their Answer, defendants therein alleged that Paz Lachica acquired the subject property before her marriage to Feliciano Sr. and that she had been in actual and physical possession of the same for more than fifteen (15) years before she sold the property to the Spouses Coja; that they acquired the property by purchasing it from Paz Lachica; that they are buyers in good faith and for value; and that the property in question was the paraphernal property of Paz Lachica and, therefore, plaintiffs therein have no right and interest over the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The parties failed to settle their respective differences and a joint trial ensued.<br><br>On March 11, 1992, the RTC rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> against the plaintiffs-oppositors and in favor of the defendants-applicants, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, decision is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants-applicants, to wit: <ol> <li>Ordering the dismissal of the complaint in Civil Case No. 3904 with costs against the plaintiffs-oppositors;<br><br></li><li>Declaring the defendants-applicants spouses Charlito Coja and Annie Mesa, the absolute owner of the land subject of their application in L.R.C.

Likewise, on the basis of the evidence adduced, the RTC held that defendants-applicants possess good title proper for registration and confirmation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, plaintiffs-oppositors appealed from the decision to the CA, assigning the following errors:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" align="center" border="0" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">[1]</td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DEFENDANTS-APPLICANTS, SPOUSES CHARLITO COJA AND ANNIE MESA COJA ARE THE TRUE AND LAWFUL OWNERS OF THE LAND SUBJECT OF THEIR APPLICATION.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>[2] </td> <td><div align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE LAND IN QUESTION IS NOT THE CONJUGAL PARTNERSHIP PROPERTY OF THE COUPLE, THE LATE SPOUSES FELICIANO AQUILLO AND LORENZA MANGARIN</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>[3]</td> <td> <div align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT DEFENDANTS-APPLICANTS POSSESS GOOD TITLE, PROPER FOR REGISTRATION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On February 5, 2001, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> reversing and setting aside the decision of the RTC, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision dated March 11, 1992 is hereby <b>REVERSED </b>and <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and a new one entered, as follows: <ol><li>The sale of the property by Paz Lachica to Spouses Charlito Coja and Annie Mesa Coja insofar as the shares of appellants is (sic) concerned is NULLIFIED;<br><br></li><li>Appellees-applicants are ordered to deliver possession of the property originally covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151 to appellants, to the extent of 93.3333 square meters;<br><br></li><li>Appellee-applicants are ordered to pay appellants P300.00 per month as reasonable rent for the use of the property, from the date of filing of the complaint and until possession thereof is restored to appellants;<br><br></li><li>The application for registration of title by Charlito and Annie Coja in L.R.C.

Having been acquired during the marital union of Feliciano Sr. and Lorenza, the subject 120-square meter portion of the property sold by Paz Lachica to the Spouses Coja is presumed to be the conjugal property of Feliciano Sr. and Lorenza.<br><br>The presumption may be rebutted only with strong, clear, categorical and convincing evidence.&nbsp; There must be strict proof of the exclusive ownership of one of the spouses, and the burden of proof rests upon the party asserting it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Petitioners insist that the property subject of the sale was exclusively owned by Paz Lachica having been purchased prior to her marriage with Feliciano Sr.&nbsp; The argument is not supported by evidence. While it may be correct to argue that the 216-square meter portion of the 336-square meter subject of the sale was exclusively owned by Paz Lachica, the same cannot be sustained as to the 120-square meter portion originally covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151.&nbsp; Paz Lachica claims ownership over the property in question on the basis only of a tax declaration issued in her name.&nbsp; But that is Tax Declaration No. 3514 which was belatedly issued in the name of Paz Lachica to include the 120-square meter lot originally covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151.&nbsp; Revision was done upon Paz Lachica's request after the death of Feliciano Sr.&nbsp; The revision of the tax declaration or the issuance of a new one in her name, did not operate and transfer title of the subject property to her.&nbsp; The property remained as one that formed part of the conjugal property of Feliciano Sr. and Lorenza.<br><br>Upon the death of Lorenza, the conjugal partnership was terminated.&nbsp; As a result, one half of the property was automatically reserved in favor of the surviving spouse, Feliciano Sr. as his share in the conjugal partnership.&nbsp; The other half, which is the share of Lorenza, was transmitted to Lorenza's heirs, Feliciano Jr., Luz, and her husband Feliciano Sr., who is entitled to the same share as that of a legitimate child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees <i>in toto</i> with the CA's conclusion:<br><blockquote> x x x.&nbsp; Under Article 996 of the Civil Code, upon the death of Lorenza Mangarin, one-half of said property, or 60 square meters, is transmitted to her heirs, namely: Feliciano Aquillo, Sr., Feliciano Aquillo, Jr., and Luz Aquillo, at 20 square meters each, while the remaining one-half is transmitted to Feliciano Aquillo, Sr.&nbsp; Upon the death of Feliciano Aquillo, Sr., his rights over the property, consisting of the 20 square meter-inheritance from his late wife and his 60 square meter-share in the conjugal partnership, or a total of 80 square meters were transmitted to his heirs, namely: Feliciano Aquillo, Jr., Luz Aquillo, and his widow, Paz Lachica.&nbsp; The surviving spouse is entitled to the same share as that of the legitimate children, to the portion of one-third each or 26.6666 square meters each x x x.&nbsp; Thus, as a result of the death of Feliciano Aquillo, Sr., a regime of co-ownership exists among Feliciano, Jr., Luz Aquillo, and Paz Lachica, with respect to the undivided 80 square meters of the property covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151.<br><br>The 120 square meters less the hereditary share of Paz Lachica which is 26.6666 square meters, or the 93.3333 square meters of the property covered by Tax Declaration No. 1151, belong to the appellants, being the heirs of the late Feliciano Aquillo, Jr. and Luz Aquillo.&nbsp; x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>Considering that Paz Lachica owns only 26.6666 square meters of the 120-square meter property and the remaining 93.3333-square meter portion thereof is owned by the respondents, the former could only validly sell the portion which rightfully belonged to her. However, considering that Paz Lachica, the predecessor-in-interest of the Spouses Coja, was a co-owner of the subject 120-square meter property; and considering further that partition of the property is wanting, this Court is precluded from directing the Spouses Coja to return specific portions of the property to respondents.&nbsp; Noteworthy is the pronouncement on this issue in <i>De Guia v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> citing <i>Hermogena G. Engreso with Spouse Jose Engreso v. Nestoria de la Cruz and Herminio de la Cruz:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><blockquote> It is a basic principle in civil law that before a property owned in common is actually partitioned, all that the co-owner has is an ideal or abstract quota or proportionate share in the entire property.&nbsp; A co-owner has no right to demand a concrete, specific or determinate part of the thing owned in common because until division is effected his right over the thing is represented only by an ideal portion.<br><br>As such, the only effect of an action brought by a co-owner against a co-owner will be to obtain recognition of the co-ownership; the defendant cannot be excluded from a specific portion of the property because as a co-owner he has a right to possess and the plaintiff cannot recover any material or determinate part of the property. x x x.</blockquote>A co-owner may file an action for recovery of possession against a co-owner who takes exclusive possession of the entire co-owned property.&nbsp; However, the only effect of such action is a recognition of the co-ownership.&nbsp; The courts cannot proceed with the actual partitioning of the co-owned property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; In fine, judicial or extrajudicial partition is necessary to effect physical division of the subject 120-square meter property.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated February 5, 2001 in CA-G.R.
