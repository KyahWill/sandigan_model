				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In an action for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forcible entry</span> filed by herein respondents Spouses Medardo Soliven and Florentina Narvasa against herein petitioner Ricardo Imbat and his brother Federico Imbat, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 700 (SF-94), the Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of San Fabian-San Jacinto, Pangasinan rendered judgment, by Decision of March 29, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  in favor of respondents, ordering the brothers Imbat to, among other things, vacate the therein subject two parcels of riceland, one with an area of 9.521 sq.m., and the other with an area of 4,653 sq.m., "located [in] Barangay <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonang</span>, San Fabian, Pangasinan."<br><br>On appeal, Branch 40 of the Dagupan Regional Trial Court (RTC), noting that herein petitioners "merely denied all the allegations in the complaint with counterclaim for damages" without proffering any affirmative defenses, and that "[d]uring the pre-trial conference before the MCTC, both parties <span style="font-weight: bold;">agreed on</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> inter alia</span>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">"identities of . . . the land[s]'</span> subject of the case, affirmed the MCTC's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The MCTC decision became final and executory.  A writ of execution was issued and enforced, but the Imbat brothers re-occupied the questioned premises, drawing the trial court to declare them in contempt.  An alias writ of execution was issued and the two eventually vacated the premises.<br><br>On July 24, 1998, petitioner Ricardo Imbat and his co-petitioner wife filed before the RTC of Dagupan a complaint for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quieting of title</span> against respondents after a similar complaint was dismissed by the MCTC for lack of jurisdiction.  The complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 98-02478-D, alleged as follows:<br><blockquote>3. That the plaintiffs are the absolute owners and in actual possession from the time it was donated by their parents, the following described real property to the exclusion of anyone including the defendants-spouses herein, to wit:<br><blockquote>"A parcel of irrigated Riceland at [B]arangay <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Anonang</span>, San Fabian, Pangasinan containing an area of TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY NINE (10,439) square meters, more or less.  Bounded on the North by Zanja; on the South by Francisco Agsaoay; on the East by J. Corabat; and on the West by Lorenza Ferdamil.  It is declared under Tax Declaration No. 0868 and assessed at P3,230.00 as per the land records of San Fabian, Pangasinan.  The said property is not registered under Act 496 as amended nor under the Spanish Mortgage Law but registerable under Act 3344, as amended."<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>6. That the <span style="font-weight: bold;">defendants are disturbing the plaintiffs</span> in their peaceful possession and absolute ownership over the land in question <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">by attempting to implement a writ of execution issued pursuant to a decision</span> issued which is already become final and executory in an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ejectment case over a certain land, which is <span style="font-weight: bold;">different land</span> herein described; the land defendants bought from spouses Alejandro Suratos and Rufo Gatchalian is located at<span style="font-weight: bold;"> [B]arangay Binday</span>, San Fabian, Pangasinan;</span><br><br>x x x x  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><br>After trial, Branch 41 of the Dagupan RTC found that respondents' claim of ownership of the subject property is anchored on an Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land dated <span style="font-weight: bold;">December 22, 1975</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> executed by the Spouses Rufo Gatchalian and Alejandra Suratos in their favor, possession of which property was taken by respondents until they were dispossessed by the brothers Imbat sometime in May 1994; and that petitioners' claim is anchored on a Deed of Donation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> executed by the brothers Imbat's father, Florentino Imbat, in favor of herein petitioner Ricardo Imbat only on <span style="font-weight: bold;">January 25, 1995 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">during the pendency of the forcible entry case.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>The trial court thus rendered judgment in respondents' favor by Decision of April 12, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants Sps. Medardo Soliven and Florentina Narvasa and against the plaintiffs as follows:<br><br>1). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>2). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Declaring defendants Sps. Medardo Soliven and Florentina Narvasa [sic] the land in question, and quieting their title over the same and removing all clouds thereon.</span><br><br>3). Dismissing all other claims of the plaintiffs for lack of basis.<br><br>4). Ordering the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants the amounts of P20,000.00 as and attorney's fees and P10,000.00 as litigation expenses, and to pay the cost of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals, raising the issue of<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE HONOURABLE COURT A QUO'S DECISION IS IN CONSONANCE WITH THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CASE CONSIDERING THE QUESTIONED <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPERTY WHICH WAS CLAIMED BY THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLEES WAS LOCATED AT BARRIO<span style="font-weight: bold;"> BINDAY</span>,</span> SAN FABIAN, PANGASINAN <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> [AT] BARRIO <span style="font-weight: bold;">ANONANG</span>,</span> SAN FABIAN, PANGASINAN, THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Before the appellate court, petitioners argued in the main that the land claimed to be owned by respondents is located at Barrio Binday, and not at Barrio Anonang, which is where the land subject of the case and which was donated to petitioner Ricardo Imbat by his father Florentino Imbat is located; and that the land located in Anonang was purchased by Florentino Imbat in 1949, taxes for which were religiously paid.<br><br>The appellate court found that the documentary evidence showed that the land in question is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same land subject of the forcible entry case,</span> and that respondents are the owners thereof.   Explained the appellate court:<br><blockquote>. . . [T]he <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land dated December 22, 1975</span> refers to a property situated at Barrio <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonang</span>, San Fabian, Pangasinan. Likewise, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLIVENs' <span style="font-weight: bold;">Declaration of Real Property and the Certification issued by the National Irrigation Administration</span> (NIA)</span> refer to the land located in Barrio <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anonang</span>, San Fabian, Pangasinan.  The <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">"Recibo Ti Panangawat Ti Cuarta Nga Ingatang Ti Daga"</span> to which appellants anchor their claim is no more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just a receipt</span> - an acknowledgment of payment. It does not establish with certainty the particulars of the property involved therein. Among the Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land, the NIA Certification and the "Recibo Ti Panangawat Ti Cuarta Nga Ingatang Ti Daga," <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the first two documents are determinative of the identity of the land</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>After receipt on November 19, 2003 by petitioners of a copy of the appellate court's decision or on December 4, 2003, the 14th day of the 15-day reglementary period to file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal, petitioners filed a motion for extension of time (10 days) to file a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On December 9, 2003, petitioners did file a motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>By Resolution of July 27, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  the appellate court denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration, the filing of a motion for extension of time to file a motion for new trial or reconsideration being prohibited, except in the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 20, 2004, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the July 27, 2004 Resolution of the appellate court which was denied by Resolution of February 28, 2006.<br><br>Hence, the present Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> petitioners faulting the appellate court for<br><ol><li>. . . . AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE HONORABLE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT DESPITE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PROPERTY SOLD BY SPOUSES RUFO GA[T]CHALIAN AND ALEJANDRA SURATOS IS A <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIFFERENT PROPERTY</span></span> AND NOT THE PROPERTY SUBJECT OF THIS CASE.<br><br></li><li>. . . .

They merely focus on their above-quoted assigned errors.<br><br>The records of the case before the Court of Appeals show that in petitioners' August 20, 2004 motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's denial of their motion for reconsideration of its decision affirming that of the trial court, which August 20, 2004 motion partakes of the nature of a proscribed second motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> they proffered that "there was no way for their new counsel to file a motion for reconsideration [of the decision] on time except to file the motion for extension of time to file motion for reconsideration to go over the whole records of the several cases filed in court by both parties against each other,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> hence, the filing of the motion for extension.  The proffered ground is a patent lie, however.  Petitioners-appellants' brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> filed on March 5, 2003 before the appellate court is exhaustive, reflecting that their counsel had had ample opportunity to go over all pertinent records of related cases.<br><br>Technicality aside, on the merits, petitioners' petition miserably fails.<br><br>In its decision in the forcible entry case, the MCTC noted as follows:<br><blockquote>During the scheduled preliminary conference held on January 18, 1995, only the parties and Atty. Fernando Cabrera, plaintiff's counsel appeared.  For failure of Atty. Carlos Taminaya, defendant's counsel to appear on said date and upon motion by Atty. Cabrera, the facts previously stipulated by the parties during the hearing of the motion for issuance of a writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction was adapted as the stipulation facts in the main case particularly on the following points:<br><ol><li>Identities of the parties and of the land subject of this case;<br><br></li><li>The plaintiffs have been in prior possession of said land and it was only sometime in May 1994 that the defendants took over its possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>On appeal, the RTC noted that "[d]uring the pre-trial [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] conference," both parties stipulated on the two above-mentioned facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioners nevertheless insist that the land being claimed by respondents is a different one, that which is located at Barangay Binday.    In support of this position, petitioners rely on a December 8, 1975 <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Recibo Ti Panangawat Ti Cuarta Nga Ingatang Ti Daga</span> executed by above-mentioned Spouses Gatchalian from whom respondents acquired the property in question.<br><br>This <span style="font-style: italic;">Recibo</span> was not offered in evidence during the trial of the case, however.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Nonetheless, respondents creditably explain that there was a mistake in indicating the location of the subject land, the vendors being residents of Binday, a neighboring barangay of Anonang.<br><br>As for the Deed of Absolute Sale â”€ Exhibit "C" which appears to cover the subject land purportedly executed on May 28, 1949 in favor of petitioner Ricardo Imbat's father, respondents objected to its admission on the ground that, among other things, it was not properly identified and, in     any event, it refers to  another  parcel  of  land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>   While petitioners presented the Joint Affidavit dated June 10, 1949 executed by Pantaleon Terre<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>        and  Melchor  Orte<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  stating  that  Pedro Balarbar sold the subject property to<br><br>Florentino Imbat, the affiants were not presented in court, hence, the statements in the affidavit remain hearsay.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED.</span><br><br>Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br>CONCHITA CARPIO MORALES<br>Associate Justice<br><br>WE CONCUR:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga,  </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr. JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit "11," Folder of Exhibits, pp. 24-29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Exhibit "12," <span style="font-style: italic;">id.</span> at 30-31.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Records, pp. 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exhibit "2," Folder of Exhibits, p. 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exhibit "A,"<span style="font-style: italic;"> id</span>. at 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Records, pp. 156-162.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id. </span>at 162.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> CA <span style="font-style: italic;">rollo,</span> p. 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id. </span>at 75-76.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 78-79.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 80-85.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Records, pp. 89-93.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Suarez v.
