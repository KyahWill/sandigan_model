				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The stability of the country’s Torrens system is menaced by the infestation of fake land titles and deeds. Any decision of this Court that breathes life into spurious or inexistent titles all but contributes to the blight. On the contrary, the judicial devotion is towards purging the system of illicit titles, concomitant to our base task as the ultimate citadel of justice and legitimacy.<br><br>These two petitions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> involve properties covered by Original Certificate  of  Title (OCT) No. 994 which in turn encompasses 1,342 hectares of the Maysilo Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The vast tract of land stretches over three (3) cities, comprising an area larger than the sovereign states  of  Monaco  and  the  Vatican.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup> Despite   their   prime  location  within Metropolitan Manila, the properties included in OCT No. 994 have been beset by controversy and sullied by apparent fraud, cloudy titles and shady transfers. It may as well be renamed the “<i>Land of Caveat Emptor.</i>”<br><br>The controversy attending the lands of OCT No. 994 has not eluded this Court. Since 1992, our findings and ruling in <i>MWSS v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> have stood as the Rosetta Stone in deciphering claims emanating from OCT No. 994, as was done in <i>Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and in the Court’s Decision dated 29 November 2005 (2005 Decision) in these cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Yet in the course of resolving these motions for reconsideration came the revelation that OCT No. 994 was lost in translation following <i>MWSS</i>. Certain immutable truths reflected on the face of OCT No. 994 must emerge and gain vitality, even if we ruffle feathers in the process.<br><br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">I.</span><br></center><br>A recapitulation of the facts, which have already been extensively narrated in the 2005 Decision, is in order. For clarity, we narrate separately the antecedent facts in G.R. Nos. 123346 and 134385.<br><br><i>A. G.R. No. 123346, Manotok Realty, Inc. <br>    and Manotok Estate Corporation, vs.<br>    CLT Realty Development Corporation</i><br><br>On 10 August 1992, CLT Realty Development Corporation (CLT) sought to recover from Manotok Realty, Inc. and Manotok Estate Corporation (Manotoks) the possession of Lot 26 of the Maysilo Estate in an action filed before the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 129.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>CLT’s claim was anchored on Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-177013 issued in its name by the Caloocan City Register of Deeds, which title in turn was derived from Estelita Hipolito (Hipolito) by virtue of a Deed of Sale with Real Estate Mortgage dated 10 December 1988.  Hipolito’s title emanated from Jose Dimson’s (Dimson) TCT No. R-15169, a title issued pursuant to an order of the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Caloocan City, Branch 33.  Dimson’s title appears to have been sourced from OCT No. 994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>For their part, the Manotoks challenged the validity of the title relied on by CLT, claiming that Dimson’s title, the proximate source of  CLT’s title, was irregularly issued and, hence, the same and subsequent titles flowing therefrom are likewise void. The Manotoks asserted their ownership over Lot 26 and claimed that they derived it from several awardees and/or vendees of the National Housing Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Manotok title likewise traced as its primary source OCT No. 994 which, on 9 September 1918, was transferred to Alejandro  Ruiz  and  Mariano  Leuterio  who had previously acquired the property on 21 August 1918 by virtue of an “<i>Escritura de Venta</i>” executed by Don Tomas Arguelles and Don Enrique Llopis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  On 3 March 1920, Ruiz and Leuterio sold the property to Francisco Gonzalez who held title thereto until 22 August 1938 when the property was transferred to Jose Leon Gonzalez, Consuelo Susana Gonzalez, Juana Francisca Gonzalez, Maria Clara Gonzalez, Francisco Felipe Gonzalez and Concepcion Maria Gonzalez under TCT No. 35486. The lot was then, per annotation dated 21 November 1946, subdivided into seven (7) parcels each in the name of each of the Gonzalezes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [11]</sup><br><br>The trial court, ruling for CLT, adopted the factual findings and conclusions arrived at by the majority commissioners appointed to resolve the conflict of titles.  It was established that the entire Maysilo Estate was registered under Act No. 496 by virtue of which OCT No. 994 was issued by the Register of Deeds of Rizal;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> that Lot 26 was transferred to CLT by Hipolito whose title was derived from the  Dimson title and that on the basis of the technical descriptions of the property appearing in the Manotok titles, the latter’s property indeed encroached on the property described in CLT’s title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Manotoks appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Their motion for reconsideration having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> they filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court, ascribing error to the appellate court in upholding the trial court’s decision which decided the case on the basis of the majority commissioners’ report and overlooked relevant facts in the minority commissioner’s report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup><br><br><i>B. G.R. No. 134385, Araneta Institute <br>    of Agriculture, Inc. v. Heirs of <br>    Jose B. Dimson, et. al.</i><br><br>On 18 December 1979, Dimson filed with the then CFI of Rizal, Branch 33, Caloocan City a complaint for recovery of possession and damages against Araneta Institute of Agriculture, Inc. (Araneta). Dimson alleged that he was the absolute owner of part of the Maysilo Estate in Malabon covered by TCT No.  R-15169 of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City. Alleging that Araneta had been illegally occupying the land and that the latter refused to vacate the same despite repeated demands, he prayed that Araneta be ordered to vacate the same and remove all improvements thereon and to return full possession thereof to him.  Araneta for its part admitted occupancy of the disputed land by constructing some buildings thereon and subdividing portions thereof in the exercise of its right as absolute owner. He alleged that Dimson’s title to the subject land was void and hence he had no cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The trial court ruled for Dimson in its Decision dated 28 May 1993 with these findings: first, there were inherent technical infirmities or defects in the titles that formed each link in the chain of ownership that culminated in the Manotok title,<i> i.e.,</i> that the technical descriptions in the titles were written in Spanish whereas those in the alleged mother title, OCT No. 994, were in English, which, an abnormal state that deviated from the usual practice in the issuance of titles; and second, it was established procedure to indicate in the certificate of title, whether original or transfer certificate, the date of the original survey of the mother title together with the succeeding date of subdivision or consolidation.  Thus, the absence of the original survey dates of OCT No. 994 on Manotok’s chain of titles, the trial court added, should mean that OCT No.  994 was not the mother title not only because the original survey dates were different but also because the original survey date must always be earlier than the issue date of the original title.  OCT No. 994 was issued on May 3, 1917 which was much ahead of the survey date indicated in the succeeding titles, which is December 22, 1917.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, Araneta  interposed  an  appeal  to  the  Court  of Appeals   which,   on   30   May   1997,   affirmed   the lower  court’s decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  In so holding, the appellate court declared that the title of Araneta to the disputed land is a nullity.  It noted that Dimson’s TCT No. R-15169 was derived from “OCT No. 994 registered on April 19, 1917” and that the same was obtained by Dimson simultaneously with other titles, <i>viz:</i> TCT Nos. 15166, 15167, and 15168 by virtue of the Decision dated October 13, 1977 and Order dated October 18, 1977, in Special Proceedings No. C-732.  It was also pointed out that Araneta’s TCT No. 13574 and 21343 were both derived from “OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917” which was previously “declared null and void by the Supreme Court in <i>Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System v. Court of Appeals.</i>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup><br><br>Araneta then filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court attributing error to the Court of Appeals in failing to recognize that it had a better right of possession over the property than did Dimson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As both petitions involved interrelated challenges against the validity of the parties’ separate titles to portions of the greater Maysilo Estate, they, along with G.R. No. 148767<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>, were consolidated per Resolutions dated 21 April 1999 and 6 March 2002. Also in 2002, the Republic of the Philippines sought and was allowed intervention in these cases.<br><br>On 29 November 2005, the Third Division of the Court rendered the 2005 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, the instant petitions are DENIED and the assailed Decisions and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are hereby AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>. Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </blockquote> The Court acknowledged that the paramount question raised in the petitions is whether the titles issued in the name of Dimson and of CLT are valid.  Noting that this question is one purely of fact, the Court held that the same was beyond its power to determine and so, the factual findings of the trial courts in these cases as affirmed by the Court of Appeals must be accorded the highest degree of respect and not disturbed at all.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court proceeded to discuss the absence of merit in the petitions.  First, particularly with  respect to G.R. No. 123346, the Court upheld the validity of the trial court’s adoption of the commissioners’ majority report as part of the decision inasmuch as the same is allowed by Section 11, Rule 32 of the Rules of Court and that a case of overlapping titles absolutely necessitates the assistance of experts in the field of geodetic engineering who, on account of their experience and expertise, are in a better position to determine which of the contending titles is valid.  For this reason, the Court emphasized,   the   trial   court  may  well  rely  on  their  findings  and conclusions. Second, the Court pointed out that the titles of respondents in all three cases were derived from OCT No. 994 of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City registered on 19 April 1917.   However, because the validity of said mother title was upheld by the Court itself in <i>MWSS</i> and reiterated in <i>Heirs of Gonzaga,</i> the Court chose not to delve anymore into the correctness of the said decisions which had already attained finality and immutability.<br><br>The Manotoks and Araneta duly filed their respective motions for reconsideration. On 5 June 2006, the cases were elevated to the Court <i>en banc</i>, which heard oral arguments on 1 August 2006. The Court formulated the issues for oral argument, thus:<br><br>From the above petitions, the following principal issues are gathered: <blockquote> <center>I.<br></center><br>Which of the Certificates of Title of the contending parties are valid:<br><br>A.     Petitioner’s titles: <ol> <li>Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. 7528, 7762, 8012, 9866, C-17272, 21107, 21485, 26405, 26406, 26407, 33904, 34255, C-35267, 41956, 63268, 55896, T-1214528, 163902 and 165119 in the name of Manotok Realty, Inc., and TCT No.  T-232568 in the name of Manotok Estate Corporation;<br></li><li>TCT Nos. 737 and 13574 in the name of Araneta Institute of Agriculture; and<br></li><li>TCT Nos. T-158373 and T-158374 in the name of Sto. Niño Kapitbahayan Association, Inc. </li></ol> All these titles were derived from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917 in the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City covering Lot 26 of the Maysilo Estate, same city.<br><br>B.     Respondents’ Title: <ol><li> TCT No. T-177013 in the name of CLT Realty Development Corporation;<br></li><li>TCT No. R-15169 in the name of Jose B. Dimson; and<br></li><li>TCT No. T-1770 in the name of CLT Realty Development Corporation/ </li></ol> All  these titles were derived from OCT No. 994 registered earlier, or on April 19, 1917, covering the same Lot No. 26 of the Maysilo Estate.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>Can this Court still overturn at this point its Decision in <i>Metropolitan Water Works and Sewerage Systems (MWSS) v. Court of Appeals</i> (G.R. No. 103558, November 17, 1992) and <i>Heirs of Luis J. Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals</i> (G.R. No. 96259, September 3, 1996) sustaining the validity of OCT No. 994 registered on April 19, 1917 and nullify the same OCT No. 994 registered later, or on May 3, 1917?<br><br><center>III.</center><br><br>How will the Reports of the Department of Justice and the Senate Fact-Finding Committee, not presented in evidence before the trial courts concluding that the valid title is OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917, affect the disposition of these cases?<br><br>Will it be necessary to remand these cases to the trial courts to determine which of the Certificates of Title are valid? If so, which trial court?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </blockquote> A crucial fact emerged during the oral arguments. The Republic, through the Solicitor General,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> strenuously argued that contrary to the supposition reflected in the Advisory, there was, in fact, only one OCT No. 994. <blockquote> x x x In this particular case, it appears that on December 3, 1912, the Court of Land Registration, the Judge Norberto Romualdez presiding, acting on Land Registration Case No.  4429 rendered judgment ordering the GLRO to issue a decree.  Pursuant to this order, the GLRO prepared Decree No.  36455 and issued the same on April 19, 1917 at 9:00 o’clock in the morning, at Manila, Philippines. It may be observed that at the face of the OCT 994 which was then on file at the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan and now kept in the LRA, the following entry can be seen.  Received for transcription at the Office of the Register of Deeds  for the province of Rizal this 3<sup>rd</sup> day of May 1917 at 7:30 a.m. Obviously, April 19, 1917 is not the date of inscription or the date of transcription of the decree into the Original Certificate of Title.  It appears that the transcription of the decree was done on the date it was received by the Register of Deeds of Rizal on May 3, 1917.  There is no other date to speak of. In the records of the Land Registration Authority, there is  only one OCT 994, on its face appears the date of transcript, May 3, 1917. The validity then of all subsequent titles tracing their origin from OCT 994 should be tested in the light of these set of facts. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </blockquote> On the other hand, the counsel for CLT stated during the same oral argument that he had seen a photocopy of an OCT No. 994 that was dated 19 April 1917,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and manifested that he could attach the same to CLT’s memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> At the same time, on even date, the Court directed the Solicitor General and counsel for CLT to submit to the Court “certified true copies of the Original Certificate of Title No. 994 dated May 3 1917 and April 19, 1917, respectively, on or before Friday, August 4, 2006.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In response to this directive, both the Solicitor General and the counsel for CLT submitted their separate “Compliance” to this Court, with their respective copies of OCT No. 994 attached thereto. Both copies of OCT No. 994 submitted by the Solicitor General and CLT indicate on their face that the decree of registration issued on 19 April 1917 was received for transcription at the office of the Register of Deeds for the Province of Rizal on 3 May 1917. Indeed, there is no evident variance between the copies of OCT No. 994 submitted by the OSG and CLT, and CLT admits just as much in its Memorandum dated 3 September 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The claim of the Solicitor General that there is only one OCT No. 994 was duly confirmed though belatedly by CLT itself. Even the <i>ponente</i> of the 2005 Decision has recognized this fact, as indicated in her present Dissenting Opinion. The emergence of such fact, contrary as it is to the crucial predicate underlying the issues presented in the Court’s Advisory, has changed the essence and complexion of the controversy.  The key to grant or deny the motions for reconsideration is the answer to the question:  which is the true date of OCT No. 994, 17 April 1917 or 3 May 1917?<br><br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">II.</span><br></center><br>We turn to the date of OCT No. 994 as reflected in the quoted portion of the certified true copy thereof submitted by the Republic of the Philippines:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <blockquote> Therefore, it is ordered by the Court that said land be registered in accordance with the provisions of the Land Registration Act in the name of said xxx<br><br>‘Witness: the Honorable Norberto Romualdez, Associate Judge of said Court, the 3rd day of December, A.D. nineteen hundred and twelve.<br><br>‘Issued at Manila, P.I., the 19<sup>th</sup> day of April A.D. 1917 at 9:00 A.M.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 240px; text-align: center;">ATTEST: ENRIQUE ALTAVAS<br></div><div style="margin-left: 200px; text-align: center;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Chief of the Land Registration Office of Justice<br></div></div><br><b>Received for transcription at the office of the Register of Deeds for the Province of P.I. this third day of May,</b> nineteen hundred and seventeen at 7:30 A.M. (emphasis supplied) </blockquote> As evident on the face of OCT No. 994, the decree of registration was issued on 19 April 1917, and actually “received for transcription” by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917.  Interestingly,  even  as  CLT  admits that there is only one OCT No. 994, that which the Solicitor General had presented to the Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [33]</sup> it maintains that the OCT should be deemed registered as of the date of issuance of the decree of registration, 19 April 1917, instead of the date it was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917. The argument is based on the theory that it is “the decree of registration [that] produces legal effects,” though it “is entered before the transmittal of the same for transcription at the Register of Deeds.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>This argument marks a radical departure from CLT’s earlier theory that there were two OCTs No. 994, one dated 19 April 1917 and the other 3 May 2007, a theory which was likewise reflected in the Court’s earlier Advisory on the issues prior to the oral argument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Yet the argument smacks of plain sophistry.<br><br>The process involved is what this Court called “the method of giving a paper title.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It is spelled out in detail in Sections 41 and 42 of Act No. 496, otherwise known as the Land Registration Act: <blockquote> SEC. 41. Immediately upon the entry of the decree of registration the clerk <b>shall send a certified copy thereof, under the seal of the court, to the register of deeds for the province, or provinces, or city in which the land lies, and the register of deeds shall transcribe the decree in a book to be- called the 'registration book,' in which a leaf, or leaves, in consecutive order, shall be devoted exclusively to each title. The entry made by the register of deeds in this book in each case shall be the original certificate of title, and shall be signed by him and sealed with the seal of the court.</b> All certificates of title shall be numbered consecutively, beginning with number one. The register of deeds shall in each case make an exact duplicate of the original certificate, including the seal, but putting on it the words 'Owner's duplicate certificate,' and deliver the same to the owner or to his attorney duly authorized. In case of a variance between the owner's duplicate certificate and the original certificate the original shall prevail. The certified copy of the decree of registration shall be filed and numbered by the register of deeds with a reference noted on it to the place of record of the original certificate of title: Provided, however, That when an application includes land lying in more than one province, or one province and the city of Manila, the court shall cause the part lying in each province or in the city of Manila to be described separately by metes and bounds in the decree of registration, and the clerk shall send to the register of deeds for each province, or the city of Manila, as the case may be, a copy of the decree containing a description of the land within that province or city, and the register of deeds shall register the same and issue an owner's duplicate therefor, and thereafter for all matters pertaining to registration under this Act the portion in each province or city shall be treated as a separate parcel of land.<br><br>SEC. 42. <b>The certificate first registered in pursuance of the decree of registration in regard to any parcel of land shall be entitled in the registration book 'Original certificate of title, entered pursuant to decree of the Court of Land Registration, dated at' (stating time and place of entry of decree and the number of case). This certificate shall take effect upon the date of the transcription of the decree.</b> Subsequent certificates relating to the same land shall be in like form, but shall be entitled 'Transfer from number' (the number of the next previous certificate relating to the same land), and also the words 'Originally registered' (date, volume, and page of registration.") </blockquote> With the plain language of the law as mooring, this Court in two vintage and sound rulings made it plain that the original certificate of title is issued on the date the decree of registration is transcribed.  In the first ruling, it was held that there is a marked distinction between the entry of the decree and the entry of the certificate of title; the entry of the decree is made by the chief clerk of the land registration and the entry of the certificate of title is made by the register of deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Such difference is highlighted by Sec. 31 of Act No. 496 as it provides that the certificate of title is issued in pursuance of the decree of registration.  In the second, it was stressed that what stands as the certificate of the title is the transcript of the decree of registration made by the registrar of deeds in the registry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Otherwise stated, what is actually issued by the register of deeds is the certificate of title itself, not the decree of registration, as he is precisely the recipient from the land registration office of the decree for transcription to the certificate as well as the transcriber no less. Since what is now acknowledged as the authentic OCT No. 994 indicates that it was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds of Rizal on 3 May 1917, it is that date that is the date of registration since that was when he was able to transcribe the decree in the registration book, such entry made in the book being the original certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Moreover, it is only after the transcription of the decree by the register of deeds that the certificate of title is to take effect.<br><br>The textbook writers and authorities on Land Registration are unanimous on the matter. The late Commissioner Antonio Noblejas, widely acknowledged as the leading authority on the subject during his time, wrote, thus: <blockquote> Immediately upon the issuance and entry of the decree of registration, the Registrar of Land Titles transcribes the same in the registry book called the “Registration Book” and issues an owner’s duplicate certificate of title to the applicant upon payment by him of the necessary registration fees. <b>The entry made by the Registrar of Land Titles in his registry book is actually the original copy of the original certificate of title</b> and shall be signed by him and sealed with the seal of the Court and of his office. Pursuant to Rep. Act No. 113, the Registrar of Land Titles may now use only the seal of his office, dispensing with the court seal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>Professor Florencio Ponce, who was also once Register of Deeds of Quezon City and Deputy Register of Deeds of Manila, was of the same conviction: <blockquote> A decree of registration is an order issued under the signature of the Commissioner of Land Registration (formerly Chief, G.L.R.O.) in the name of the Judge to the fact that the land described therein is registered in the name of the applicant or oppositor or claimant as the case maybe. <b>When this is transcribed or spread <i>in toto</i> in the registration book and signed by the register of deeds, the page on which the transcription is made become the “original certificate of title,” more commonly called the Torrens title.</b><br><center>xxx</center><br><b>The land becomes a registered land only upon the transcription of the decree in the original registration book by the register of deeds,</b> the date and time of such transcription being set forth in the process and certified to at the foot of each entry or certificate of title.<br><center>xxx<br></center><br>The issuance of the original and owner’s duplicate certificates are basic for the valid existence of the title.

It cannot be so for otherwise, the recent decision of the Court in <i>Alfonso v. Office of the President</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> would simply be wrong. In Alfonso, the Court precisely penalized <i>Alfonso</i>, the former register of deeds of Caloocan because she acquiesced to the change of the date of registration of OCT No. 994, as reflected in several subsequent titles purportedly derived from that mother title, from 3 May 1917 to 19 April 1917. If indeed the difference in dates were “inconsequential,” then it should not have really mattered that Mrs. Alfonso, as found by the Court, had invariably issued certificates of title, reflecting either the 19 April or 3 May date, a circumstance which, the Court concluded, was irregular. But if the Court were to accede to the dissent and agree that it did not really matter whether the date of registration of OCT No. 994 was 3 May or 19 April, then poor Mrs. Alfonso should be spared of the penalty of dismissal from the service which the Court had already affirmed.<br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">III.</span><br></center><br>Even the dissent does not insist, as the 2005 Decision did, that there is an  OCT No. 994 registered or dated 19 April 1917. This new stance squarely contravenes or deviates from the following unequivocal pronouncement in the 2005 Decision: <blockquote> We noted in the beginning of this Decision that the issue in all these three (3) cases involves the validity of the parties' overlapping titles. <b>The titles of the respondents in these cases were derived from OCT No. 994 of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City <u>registered on April 19, 1917</u>. The validity of such mother title has already been upheld by this Court in G.R. No. 103558, <i>MWSS v. Court of Appeals, et al.</i> dated November 17, 1992 earlier cited in the assailed Decisions. Significantly, the ruling in MWSS was reiterated in G.R. No. 96259, <i>Heirs of Luis J. Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals</i> dated September 3, 1996.</b><br><br>We cannot delve anymore into the correctness of the Decision of this Court in MWSS. The said Decision, confirming the validity of OCT No. 994 issued on April 19, 1917 from which the titles of the respondents in the cases at bar were derived, has long become final and executory. Nothing is more settled in law than that once a judgment attains finality it becomes immutable and unalterable.  It  may  no longer be modified in any respect, even if the  modification  is  meant to  correct  what  is  perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </blockquote> This new conclusion likewise differs from what the Court had to say regarding OCT No. 994 “dated April 19, 1917” in the adverted <i>MWSS v.

We make the following relevant references from that decision, presented sequentially:<br><br>(1) “Jose B. Dimson was the registered owner of a parcel land situated in Balintawak, Kalookan City with an area of 213,012 square meters, more or less, and covered by TCT No. C-15167 which was registered on June 8, 1978.

However, the same decision inconsistently refers to it also as OCT No. 994 “registered on April 19, 1917”, “dated April 19, 1917,” and “registered under OCT No. 994 dated April 19, 1917.” Notably, the context of <i>MWSS</i> in making the final citation, “registered under OCT No. 994 dated April 19, 1917,” was to point out that as a result “the subsequent registration of the same land on May 3, 1917 is null and void;” hence, no other conclusion can be reached than that the Court deemed Dimson’s mother title as having been registered on a date earlier than 3 May 1917.<br><br>Since the dissent and even CLT now acknowledge that there is only one OCT No. 994 which was registered by the Registry of Deeds of Rizal on 3 May 1917, the earlier factual finding in <i>MWSS</i> is indefensible. <i>MWSS</i> recognized an OCT No. 994 registered on 19 April 1917, a title that never existed and, even assuming that it did exist, is now acknowledged as spurious.<br><br><i>Gonzaga</i> primarily relied on the ruling of the Court in <i>MWSS </i>upon a finding that the case involved “facts that are exactly the same as those that we have passed and ruled upon in the [<i>MWSS </i>case].”  The title which was affirmed by the Court in <i>Gonzaga</i>, TCT No. C-26806 in the name of Lilia Sevilla, was “a transfer from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 994 which was registered on April 19, 1917 pursuant to Decree No. 36455.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It was further observed by the Court that “on the one hand, [therein] petitioners’ titles indicate original registration to have been made on May 3, 1917, but on the other hand, private respondents’ title indicates original registration to have been made on April 19, 1917.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54] </sup><br><br>It was the title originally registered on 19 April 1917 which was made to prevail in <i>Gonzaga</i>, following <i>MWSS</i>.

Since even the dissent now discounts the existence of the so-called 17 April 1917 OCT No. 994, it should necessarily follow that any title that is sourced from the 17 April 1917 OCT is void. Such conclusion is inescapable whatever questions there may be about the veracity of the 3 May 1917 OCT based on Cadastral Case No. 34.</b><br><br>It would be especially incoherent for the Court to reiterate <i>MWSS</i> and <i>Gonzaga</i> when they effectuated the OCT No. 994 registered on 19 April 1917 and acknowledge at the same time that the same  OCT never existed, the genuine OCT No. 994 being that which was registered on 3 May 1917. We need not go as far as to revive the <i>MWSS</i> or <i>Gonzaga</i> decisions, but certainly we can decline to infuse further validity to their erroneous basic premise that there was an OCT No. 994 registered on 19 April 1917. The dissent proposes that we perpetuate the erroneous premise even as the error is plainly acknowledged, a stance that will not serve the Court well should it prevail.<br><br>Moreover, the two cases should not bind the parties in the petitions now before us. Undisputedly, the two cases involved different parcels of land. The present petitioners could not be bound by the decisions in the two cases, as they were not parties thereto and and their properties were not involved therein. As we very recently reaffirmed, it is basic that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by judgment rendered by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>We can take instruction from the tack previously taken by this Court in dealing with municipalities created by executive orders. Beginning with <i>Pelaez v. Auditor General,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the Court declared as a general principle that the President had no power to create municipalities through executive orders. However, instead of nullifying the creation of all municipalities created in the same manner, the Court only annulled those municipalities whose creation was  specifically  attacked  in the petition filed by then-Vice President Pelaez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  With  respect  to  the  other municipalities which were not annulled in <i>Pelaez</i>, the Court would, in the next few decades, annul only the municipalities which were specifically challenged in petitions raised before the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> However, after the adoption of the Local Government Code of 1991 that gave statutory recognition to the <i>de facto</i> municipalities which had not yet been annulled, the Court started to affirm the legal existence of such municipalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>As in <i>Pelaez</i>, the operative effect of the “doctrines” pronounced in <i>MWSS</i> and <i>Gonzaga</i> can extend only to the parties and properties involved in said cases, even if it can be argued that the rights involving other parties and properties are afflicted with inconsistency as regards the legal rulings therein, similar to the municipalities created which though created by void executive orders were not however annulled. Yet with the emergence of a new fact–the enactment of the Local Government Code vis-à-vis Pelaez, or the present acknowledgment that only the 3 May 1917 OCT No. 994 exists <i>vis-à-vis MWSS</i> and <i>Gonzaga</i>–subsequent rulings would be informed primarily by the new developments, rather than by the previous precedents that were not able to take into account the true or new factual premises.<br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">IV.</span><br></center><br><b>The determinative test to resolve whether the prior decision of this Court should be affirmed or set aside is whether or not the titles invoked by the respondents are valid.

Since the true basic factual predicate concerning OCT No. 994 which is that there is only one such OCT differs from that expressed in the <i>MWSS</i> and <i>Gonzaga</i>  decisions, said rulings have become virtually <i>functus officio</i> except on the basis of the “law of the case” doctrine, and can no longer be relied upon as precedents.</b><br><br>This approach immensely differs from that preferred by the 2005 Decision and the dissenting view, which dwells in the main on the alleged flaws in the titles held by the Manotoks and Araneta, without making a similar inquiry into  the titles held by CLT and the Heirs of Dimson. Since the decision in favor of CLT and the Heirs of Dimson was ultimately grounded on a factual predicate now acknowledged as erroneous, it follows that the primary focus should have been whether the titles held by CLT and the Dimsons are valid and with force and effect.  To that end, we need only examine the titles relied upon by CLT and the Dimsons.<br><br>In the <i>Manotok</i> petition, CLT had originally filed a complaint for annulment of the titles in the name of the Manotoks, alleging that it was the registered owner of Lot 26 of the Maysilo Estate covered by TCT No. T-177013 of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City.

It dwells on the fact that the titles debunked in the <i>MWSS</i> and <i>Gonzaga</i> cases, which find origination from OCT No. 994 dated 3 May 1917, seem to have been derived from Cadastral Case No. 34 also covering the Maysilo Estate. It is in fact the theory of the dissent that there are, in effect, two competing sources of title – the OCT No. 994 dated 3 May 1917 arising from the issuance of Decree No. 36455 in Land Registration Case No. 4429; and OCT No. 994 dated 3 May 1917 based on the Cadastral Survey of Caloocan City in Cadastral Case No. 34. It is further opined that the registration of lands pursuant to Cadastral Case No. 34, even if the date of such registration is 3 May 1917, is void since such registration could not supplant the earlier decision of the land registration court.<br><br>The supposition blatantly runs counter to long-established principles in land cases. Had it been adopted by the Court, the effect would have been to precipitate the utter astonishment of legal scholars, professionals and students alike.<br><br>The reality that cadastral courts may have jurisdiction over lands already registered in ordinary land registration cases was acknowledged by this Court in <i>Pamintuan v. San Agustin.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Such jurisdiction is “limited to the necessary correction of technical errors in the description of the lands, provided such corrections do not impair the substantial rights of the registered owner, and that such jurisdiction cannot operate to deprive a registered owner of his title.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It was further clarified in <i>Timbol v. Diaz</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> that the limited jurisdiction of the cadastral court over such lands  even extends to the determination of “which one of the several conflicting registered titles shall prevail[, as such] power would seem to be necessary for a complete settlement of the title to the land, the express purpose of cadastral proceedings, and must therefore be considered to be within the jurisdiction of the court in such proceedings.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The question raised in <i>Sideco v. Aznar</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> concerned the validity of an order of a cadastral court directing the issuance of new certificates of title  in the name of Sideco and his children, at Sideco’s own  prayer, over   land  previously registered in the name of Crispulo<br><br>Sideco. This Court ruled that such order was valid and did not amount to a readjudication of the title. After the cadastral proceedings therein had been initiated, the chief surveyor had reported to the cadastral court that the land was covered by a decree in a land registration proceeding and registered in the name of Sideco; the surveyor recommended that the title be cancelled and a new one issued in the names of such persons as the court may determine. In ruling that the new titles were valid, the Court stated that “[t]he proceedings did not in any way purport to reexamine the title already issued, or to readjudicate the title of the land. They were precisely predicated on the finality of the title already issued, because it was the registered owner who was asked to express his desire with respect thereto, and the court’s order precisely followed the petition of the registered owner.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The eminent U.P. law professor Francisco Ventura, himself a former Register of Deeds, explains why cadastral courts have jurisdiction to order the issuance of new titles in place of the title issued under voluntary registration proceedings: <blockquote> “Inasmuch as the land is identified in the plan by cadastral number, it is necessary that a new title be issued, giving the lot its cadastral number in accordance with the cadastral survey. This does not mean that the court has the power to alter the decree entered in the previous registration proceeding. The court cannot change or modify the said decree. It does not adjudicate the title anew.  It  simply  deals  with  the  certificate  of title. This is for the </blockquote> convenience of the landowner because it is easier for him to identify his property inasmuch as all the lands brought under the cadastral survey are designated by cadastral numbers.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>What is prohibited in a cadastral proceeding is the registration of land, already issued in the name of a person, in the name of another, divesting the registered owner of the title already issued in his favor, or the making of such changes in the title as to impair his substantial rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Yet such prohibition does not mean that the cadastral court will not have jurisdiction over the action involving the previously registered land, as explained in <i>Pamintuan</i> and <i>Timbol,</i> or that the cadastral court may not issue a new title at all even if it would not impair the rights of the previously registered owner, as emphasized in <i>Sideco</i>. The dissent contents itself with the simplistic conclusion that because there was a cadastral case covering the Maysilo Estate from which the titles emanated, such titles could not have been valid. It is clear that there could be such titles issued, and they would be valid for so long as they do not impair the rights of the original registrant to whom OCT No. 994 dated 3 May 1917 was issued.<br><br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">VI.</span><br></center><br>From these premises, the Court is able to make the following binding conclusions. <i>First,</i> there is only one OCT No. 994. As it appears on the record, that mother title was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917, and that should be the date which should be reckoned as the date of registration of the title. It may also be acknowledged, as appears on the title, that OCT No. 994 resulted from the issuance of the decree of registration on 17 April 1917, although such date cannot be considered as the date of the title or the date when the title took effect.<br><br><i>Second.</i> Any title that traces its source to OCT No. 994 dated 17 April 1917 is void, for such mother title is inexistent. The fact that the Dimson and CLT titles made specific reference to an OCT No. 994 dated 17 April 1917 casts doubt on the validity of such titles since they refer to an inexistent OCT. This error alone is, in fact, sufficient to invalidate the Dimson and CLT claims over the subject property if singular reliance is placed by them on the dates appearing on their respective titles.<br><br><i>Third.</i> The decisions of this Court in <i>MWSS v. Court of Appeals</i> and <i>Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals</i> cannot apply to the cases at bar, especially in regard to their recognition of an OCT No. 994 dated 19 April 1917, a title which we now acknowledge as inexistent. Neither could the conclusions in <i>MWSS</i> or <i>Gonzaga</i> with respect to an OCT No. 994 dated 19 April 1917 bind any other case operating under the  factual setting the same as or similar to that at bar.<br><br>With these conclusions, what then is the proper course of action to take with respect to the pending motions for reconsideration? Considering that CLT and the Dimsons clearly failed to meet the burden of proof reposed in them as plaintiffs in the action for annulment of title and recovery of possession, there is a case to be made for ordering the dismissal of their original complaints before the trial court. However, such solution may not satisfactorily put to rest the controversy surrounding the Maysilo Estate.<br><br>More pertinently, after the instant petitions were filed with this Court, the Republic of the Philippines, through the OSG, had sought to intervene. The Republic did not participate as a party when these cases were still before the trial courts and the Court of Appeals. While the Republic had originally prayed for the grant of the petitions filed by all the petitioners in these consolidated cases, instead it presently seeks of the Court the promulgation of a new ruling upholding the validity of OCT No. 994 issued<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> or registered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> on May 3, 1917.  Rather than suggest whether the petitions be granted or denied, the OSG argues that after a declaration from this Court that it is the 3 May 1917 mother title that is valid, “a remand of this case to the Court of Appeals, to settle which among the private parties derived their titles from the existing OCT 994, is proper”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Notably, both the Manotoks and Araneta are amenable to the remand of the petition, albeit under differing qualifications. The Manotoks submit that there should be a remand to the court of origin, consolidating all the present petitions, and that a full trial be conducted by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> On the other hand, Araneta proposes four (4) options for the Court to consider: (1) the dismissal of the original complaint filed by Dimson; (2) a ruling granting Araneta’s appeal and dismissing Dimson’s complaint, but at the same time remanding the case to a new division of the Court of Appeals for factual determination pursuant to Section 6, Rule 47 of the Rules of Court; (3) the suspension of the resolution of the present motion for reconsideration while the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for factual determination; or (4) the remand of the proceedings to the Court of Appeals for the reception of further evidence, particularly the Senate and DOJ Reports, pursuant to Section 6, Rule 47 of the Rules of Court, and the consequent resolution by the appellate court of the instant petitions.<br><br>The OSG observes that during the oral arguments on the motion for reconsideration, then Chief Justice Panganiban suggested that a remand may be required to determine the status of the original title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Considering that the genuine OCT No. 994 is that issued on/ registered on/dated 3 May 1917, a remand would be appropriate to determine which of the parties, if any, derived valid title from the said genuine OCT No. 994. On the one hand, the appreciation of facts is beyond the province of this Court, since it is not a trier of fact<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> as well as not capacitated to appreciate evidence at the first instance. On the other hand, the Court of Appeals has the competence to engage in that undertaking.<br><br>Under Section 6 of Rule 46, which is applicable to original cases for certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the Court may, whenever necessary to resolve factual issues, delegate the reception of the evidence on such issues to any of its members or to an appropriate court, agency or office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80] </sup>  The delegate need not be the body that rendered the assailed decision.<br><br>The Court of Appeals generally has the authority to review findings of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [81]</sup>  Its conclusions as to findings of fact are generally accorded great respect by this Court. It is a body that is fully capacitated and has a surfeit of experience in appreciating factual matters, including documentary evidence.<br><br>In fact, the Court had actually resorted to referring a factual matter pending before it to the Court of Appeals. In <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>  this Court commissioned the former Thirteenth Division of the Court of Appeals to hear and receive evidence on the controversy, more particularly to determine “the actual area reclaimed by the Republic Real Estate Corporation, and the areas of the Cultural Center Complex which are ‘open spaces’ and/or ‘areas reserved for certain purposes,’ determining in the process the validity of such postulates and the respective measurements of the areas referred to.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The Court of Appeals therein received the evidence of the parties and rendered a “Commissioner’s Report” shortly thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Thus, resort to the Court of Appeals is not a deviant procedure.<br><br>The provisions of Rule 32 should also be considered as governing the grant of authority to the Court of Appeals to receive evidence in the present case. Under Section 2, Rule 32 of the Rules of Court, a court may, <i>motu proprio</i>, direct a reference to a commissioner  when a question of fact, other than upon the pleadings, arises upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of a case, or for carrying a judgment or order into effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85] </sup> The order of reference can be limited exclusively to receive and report evidence only, and the commissioner may likewise rule upon the admissibility of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> The commissioner is likewise mandated to submit a report in writing to the court upon the matters submitted to him by the order of reference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>  In <i>Republic</i>, the commissioner’s report formed the basis of the final adjudication by the Court on the matter. The same result can obtain herein.<br><br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">VII.</span><br></center><br>The OSG likewise adverts to the findings reached in the respective investigations and reports by the Department of Justice and the Philippine Senate, components of the two other co-equal branches of the government. Both the DOJ Report dated 28 August 1997 and the Senate Report dated 25 May 1998 conclude that there is only one (1) OCT No. 994 issued or registered on 3 May 1997. The OSG argues that the contents of both of these reports may be considered as evidence. It also points out, with basis, that these reports may be taken judicial notice of by this Court, following Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court. Indeed, it cannot be disputed that these reports fall within the ambit of “the official acts of the legislative [and] executive… departments.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>It bears noting that the DOJ and Senate Reports were rendered on 28 August 1997 and 25 May 1998 respectively. They were issued some years after the trial courts had promulgated their respective decisions in the Manotok and Araneta cases, and even after the   Court of Appeals  handed  down  its  decision  against the Manotoks which is assailed in its present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In Araneta’s case, the Court of Appeals had first ruled against Araneta in its Decision dated 30 May 1997, or just shortly before the rendition of the DOJ and Senate Reports.<br><br>Since this Court is not a trier of fact, we are not prepared to adopt the findings made by the DOJ and the Senate, or even consider whether these are admissible as evidence, though such questions may be considered by the Court of Appeals upon the initiative of the parties.  The  Court, in the 2005 Decision, refused to take into account the reports on the regrettable premise that they could somehow “override” the judicial decisions earlier arrived at.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The reports cannot conclusively supersede or overturn judicial decisions, but if admissible they may be taken into account as evidence on the same level as the other pieces of evidence submitted by the parties. The fact that they were rendered by the DOJ and the Senate should not, in itself, persuade the courts to accept them without inquiry. The facts and arguments presented in the reports must still undergo judicial scrutiny and analysis, and certainly the courts will have the discretion to accept or reject them.<br><br>There are many factual questions looming over the properties that could only be threshed out in the remand to the Court of Appeals. The Manotoks and Araneta advert to certain factual allegations relating to their titles and backstories to advance their respective positions. Still, if it indeed emerges from the determination of the Court of Appeals on remand that notwithstanding the clear flaws of the title of respondents the titles of petitioners are cut from the same counterfeit cloth, then the Republic of the Philippines, an intervenor in these cases, is armed anyway with any and all appropriate remedies to safeguard the legitimate owners of the properties in question.<br><br><center><span style="font-style: italic;">VIII.</span><br></center><br>The definitive conclusions reached by the Court thus far in these cases are spelled out in Part VI of this Resolution. Said conclusions serve to guide the Court of Appeals in hearing these cases on remand.<br><br>The Court hereby constitutes a Special Division of the Court of Appeals to hear these cases on remand. The Special Division shall be composed of three Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals, namely; Justice Josefina Guevara-Salonga as Chairperson; Justice Lucas Bersamin as Senior Member; and Associate Justice Japar B. Dimaampao as Junior Member.<br><br>The Special Division is tasked to hear and receive evidence, conclude the proceedings and submit to this Court a report on its findings and recommended conclusions within three (3) months from finality of this Resolution.<br><br>In ascertaining which of the conflicting claims of title  should prevail, the Special Division is directed to make the following determinations based on the evidence already on record and such other evidence as may be presented at the proceedings before it, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="i"><li>Which of the contending parties are able to trace back their claims of title to OCT No. 994 dated  3 May 1917?<br><br></li><li>Whether the imputed flaws in the titles of the Manotoks and Araneta, as recounted in the 2005 Decision, are borne by the evidence? Assuming they are, are such flaws sufficient to defeat the claims of title of the Manotoks and Araneta?<br><br></li><li>Whether the factual and legal bases of 1966 Order of Judge Muñoz-Palma and the 1970 Order of Judge Sayo are true and valid. Assuming they are, do these orders establish a superior right to the subject properties in favor of the Dimsons and CLT as opposed to the claims of Araneta and the Manotoks?<br><br></li><li>Whether any of the subject properties had been the subject of expropriation proceedings at any point since the issuance of OCT No. 994 on 3 May 1917, and if so what are those proceedings, what are the titles acquired by the Government and whether any of the parties is able to trace its title to the title acquired by the Government through expropriation.<br><br></li><li>Such other matters necessary and proper in ascertaining which of the conflicting claims of title should prevail.<br></li></ol></blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant cases are hereby REMANDED to the Special Division of the Court of Appeals for further proceedings in accordance with Parts VI, VII and VIII of this Resolution.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Quisumbing,  Austria-Martinez,  Carpio-Morales, Azcuna, Chico-Nazario,   </i> and  <i>Leonardo-De Castro, JJ.,</i> concur. <i><br>Puno, C.J., </i> No part due to relationship to one of the counsels. <br><i>Ynares-Santiago, J.,</i> No part. <br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, J., </i>See my Dissenting Opinion. <i><br>Carpio, J., </i>On leave. <br><i>Corona, J.,</i> See concurring and dissenting opinion. <i><br>Velasco, Jr., J., and Reyes,</i> Joins the dissent of J.

Thus, it became clear to all the Justices that there is only one OCT 994 from which the titles of the Dimson’s heirs and CLT originated.  <b>So why should we remand these cases to the Court of Appeals to determine again whether there are two (2) OCT No. 994?</b>   I repeat, the evidence to prove there is only one (1) OCT 994 had been presented  before  all the Justices of this Court. <b>Why should we close our eyes and disregard completely the <u>truth</u> that there is only one OCT NO. 994?</b> By remanding these  cases to the appellate court to determine  the issue of whether there are indeed two (2) OCT No. 994, we are all deceiving ourselves.

But this plan could not be traced at the depository plans – the Bureau of Lands.</b>   The alleged Subdivision Plan had seven resultant lots covered by individual titles – TCTs Nos. 1368 to 1374 – six of which are in the individual names of Francisco’s children.<br><br>These seven lots were expropriated by the government thru the Homesite and Housing Corporation, after which they were subdivided into 77 lots acquired by the tenants.   The <span style="font-style: italic;">Manotok Corporation</span>s purchased 20 lots from the tenants covered by 20 separate TCTs.<br><br><b><i>The issuance of the Manotok <br>Corporations’   titles suffer fatal <br>irregularities.</i></b><br><br>The Commissioners’ Majority Report and the trial court found numerous irregularities – <b>fatal</b> in character – in the issuance of the <i>Manotok Corporations</i>’ titles, namely: <blockquote><ol><li>The technical descriptions on the titles, TCTs Nos. 4210 and 4211 in the names of Ruiz and Leuterio; and TCTs Nos. 5261 and 35480 in the names of Francisco Gonzales and his 7 children, from where the titles of the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> originated, were inscribed in <b>Spanish</b>.   However, their alleged mother title, OCT No. 994, is in <b>English.</b><br><br></li><li>The date of survey appearing on the said titles (TCTs Nos. 4210, 4211, 5261 and 35486) was <b>December 12, 1917, instead of “September 8-27, October 4-21, November 12-18, 1911” as appearing on OCT no. 994.</b><br><br></li><li>The lots covered by the same titles are <b>not identified by lot numbers.

1368-1374 embracing the lots expropriated, <b>deviated from the mother lot’s tie point</b> (the Bureau of Lands Location Monument No. 1, Caloocan City). <b>This resulted in the shifting of the position of the 7 lots which do not fall inside the boundary of the mother lot.</b></li></ol> </blockquote> Based on these concrete facts, the commissioners’ Majority Report concluded that petitioners <i>Manotok Corporations</i>’ titles overlap that of respondent <i>CLT Realty</i>.   <b>The overlapping is caused by the inherent technical defects on TCT No. 4211</b>  (from which the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> derived their titles) <b>and the questionable circumstances of its issuance,</b> thus: <br> <blockquote><ol start="8"><li>In the light of the foregoing facts, the undersigned Commissioners have come to the following conclusions:<br><br> </li><ol type="a"><li><b>There are inherent technical infirmities or defects on the face of TCT Nos. 4211</b> (also on TCT No. 4210), 5261 and 35486.   <b>The fact that the technical descriptions in TCT Nos. 4211,</b> 5261 and 35486 <b>are written in <u>Spanish</u> while those on the alleged mother title, OCT-994, were already in <u>English</u>, is abnormal and contrary to the usual practice in the issuance of titles.   <u>If OCT-994 is the mother title of TCT Nos. 4211</u>,</b> 5261 and 35486, <b><u>then said titles should also be written in English because OCT-994 is already in English</u>.</b>  <b>It is possible that an ascendant title be written in Spanish and the descendant title in English, the language now officially used, <u>but the reverse is highly improbable and irregular.</u></b><br><br></li><li><b>Also, the fact that the original survey dates of OCT-994</b> (September 8-27, October 4-21 and November 17-18, 1911) <b>are not indicated on the technical descriptions on TCT Nos. 4211, </b>5261 and 35486, <b><u>but an entirely different date, December 22, 1917, is instead indicated, likewise leads to the conclusion that TCT Nos. 4211, 5261 and 35486 could not have been derived from OCT-994.</u>  It is the established procedure to always indicate in the certificate of title, whether original or transfer certificates, the date of the original survey of the mother title together with the succeeding date of subdivision or consolidation.   <u>Thus, in the absence of the original survey dates of OCT-994 on TCT Nos. 4211, 5261 and 35486, then OCT-994 is not the mother title of TCT Nos. 4211, 5261 and 35486, not only because the original survey dates are different but because the date of original survey is always earlier than the date of the issuance of the original title.</u></b>  OCT-994 was issued on May 3, 1917 and this is much ahead of the date of survey indicated on TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 which is December 22, 1917;<br><br></li><li>Granting that the date December 22, 1917 is the date of a subdivision survey leading to the issuance of TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211, <b><u>there are, however, no indications on the face of the titles themselves which show that a verified and approved subdivision of Lot 26 took place.</u>   In subdividing a lot, the resulting parcels are always designated by the lot number of the subdivided lot followed by letters of the alphabet starting from the letter “A” to designate the first resultant lot, etc.,</b> for example, if Lot 26 is subdivided into three (3) lots, these lots will be referred to as Lot 26-A, Lot 26- N and Lot 26-C followed by a survey number such as “Psd-_____” or “(LRC) Psd-_____.”   <b><u>However, the lots on TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 do not contain such descriptions.</u>   <u>In fact, the parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 are not even described by lot number, and this is again technically irregular and defective because the designation of lots by Lot Number was already a practice at that time as exemplified by the technical descriptions of some sub-lots covered by OCT-994, i.e., 23-A, 25-A, 25-D, etc.</u>;</b><br><br></li><li>That <b><u>TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 which allegedly was the result of a subdivision of Lot 26 should not have been issued without a subdivision plan approved by the Director of Lands or the Chief of the General Land Registration Office.</u>   Republic Act No. 496 which took effect on November 6, 1902, particularly Section 58 thereof, provided that the Registry of Deeds shall not enter the transfer certificate to the grantee until a plan of such land showing all the portions or lots into which it has been subdivided, and the technical description of each portion or lot, have been verified and approved by the Director of Lands…’</b> and as corroborated by Section 44, Paragraph 2, and that the plan has been approved by the Chief of the General Land Registration Office, or by the Director of Lands as provided in Section fifty-eight of this Act, the Registry of Deeds may issue new certificates of title for any lot in accordance with said subdivision plan;’<br><br></li><li><b>The absence of a lot number and survey plan number in the technical description inscribed on TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211, and the absence of a subdivision survey plan for Lot 26 at the records of the Bureau of Lands or the Land Registration Authority <u>lead to the conclusion that there was no verified and approved subdivision survey plan of Lot 26, which is a compulsory requirement needed in the issuance of said titles</u>;</b><br><br></li><li><b>Similarly, the absence of plan Psd-21154 from the files of the Bureau of Lands, the official depository of survey plans, <u>is another indication that the titles covered by TCT Nos. 1368 thru 1374 which were derived from TCT No. 4211 are again doubtful and questionable</u>;</b><br><br></li><li>Moreover, <b>the changing of the tie points in the technical descriptions on TCT Nos. 1368 thru 1374 from that of the mother lot’s tie point which is BLLM No. 1,

purpose of tie points and tie lines since the accepted practice is to adopt the mother lot’s tie point in order to fix the location of the parcels of land being surveyed on the earth’s surface.</u></b><br><br></li><li>Based on the foregoing, it is the conclusion of the undersigned Commissioners that defendants’ (Manotok Realty, Inc. and Manotok Estate Corporation) titles <b>overlap</b> portions of plaintiff’s (CLT Realty Development Corporation’s) title, <b>which overlapping is due to the irregular and questionable issuance of TCT Nos. 4211 (also of TCT No. 4210), 5261, 35486, 1368 to 1374.   The inherent technical defects on TCT No. 4211 (from where defendants derived their titles) and TCT No. 4210 which were exhaustively elucidated above, point to the fact that there was no approved subdivision of Lot 26 which served as legal basis for the regular issuance of TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211.</b>   Thus, as between plaintiff’s title, which was derived from regularly issued titles, and defendants’ titles, which were derived from irregularly issued titles, plaintiff’s title which pertains to the entire Lot 26 of the Maysilo Estate should prevail over defendants’ titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></ol></blockquote> Significantly, the above findings and conclusions in the Commissioners’ Majority Report are <b>similar</b> to the findings of the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in <i>Sto. Niño Kapitbahayan Association, Inc. v. CLT Realty Development Corporation</i> (G.R. No. 148767) wherein <b>the titles</b> of <i>CLT Realty,</i> and those of the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> (G.R. No. 123346) and <i>Sto. Niño Association</i> are involved.  These findings and conclusions are discussed lengthily by the trial court in its February 12, 1996 Amended Decision, later <b>affirmed</b> by the Court of Appeals in its Decision dated May 23, 2001 in  CA-G.R. CV No. 52549,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  thus: <blockquote> The conflict stems from the fact that the plaintiff’s (<i>CLT Realty Development Corporation’s</i>) and defendant’s (<i>Sto.

T-158373 and T-158374, both in the name of the defendants, are the latest in a series of titles which descend from TCT No. 4211.</u></b>   A trace of the history of TCT No. 4211 reveals that it was succeeded by TCT No. 5261 which was in turn succeeded by TCT No. 35486.   TCT No. 35486 was allegedly subdivided into seven lots covered by TCT Nos. 1368 to 1374.   One or two of these subdivided lots were the predecessors of the defendants’ titles.<br><br>It behooves this court to address <u><b>the issue of whether or not TCT No. 4211 from which the defendants’ titles were originally derived can validly trace its origin from OCT 994.</b></u><br><br><b><u>There is pervasive evidence that TCT No. 4211 could not have been a true derivative of OCT No. 994.</u></b><br><br>Firstly, <b>the survey dates indicated in OCT No. 994 are September 8-27, October 8-21 and November 17-18, all in the year 1911.</b>  On the other hand, <b>these dates of original survey are conspicuously missing in TCT No. 4211 contrary to established procedure that the original survey dates of the mother title should be indicated in succeeding titles.   Instead, an examination of TCT No. 4211 reveals a different date on its face.   This date, December 22, 1917, could not be an original survey date because it differs from those indicated in the mother title.   Of equal importance is the fact that the date of original survey always comes earlier than the date of the issuance of the mother title.   Since OCT No. 994 was issued on April 19, 1917, it is highly irregular that the original survey was made several months later or only on December 22, 1917.</b><br><br><b>Neither is the Court inclined to consider this date as the date a subdivision survey was made.   The regular procedure is to identify the subdivided lots by their respective survey or lot numbers;</b> on the contrary, <b>no such lot number is found in TCT No. 4211, pointing to the inevitable conclusion that OCT No. 994 was never validly subdivided into smaller lots, of which one of them is covered by TCT No. 4211.</b><br><br>Secondly, <b>the assertion that TCT Nos. 1368 to 1374 which preceded the defendants’ titles were issued pursuant to subdivision plan PSD 21154 is not supported by the evidence.  The Land Management Bureau which handles survey plans has no records of the said PSD 21154.</b>   The Registry of Deeds of Rizal has a copy of the plan but the court finds such possession questionable since the Land Registration Authority which supervises the Registry of Deeds does not have a copy of the same.   <b>The court therefore believes that the issuance of TCT Nos. 1368 to 1374 is attended by a serious irregularity which cannot be ignored as it affects the very validity of the alleged subdivisions of the land covered by TCT No. 35486.</b><br><br>Thirdly, the language of the technical descriptions of the land covered by <b>OCT No. 994 is already in <u>English</u>, while its alleged derivative titles TCT Nos. 4211, 5261 and 35486 are still in <u>Spanish</u>.   This is in direct violation of the practice that the language used in the mother title is adopted by all its derivative titles.   The reversion to Spanish in the derivative titles is highly intriguing and casts a cloud of doubt to the genuineness of such titles.</b><br><br>Fourthly, <b>the tie points used in the mother lot were not adopted by the alleged derivative titles particularly TCT Nos. 1368 to 1374, the immediate predecessors of the defendants’ titles.   The pivotal role of tie points cannot be brushed aside as a change thereof could result to the shifting of positions of the derivative lots in relation to the mother lot. Consequently, overlapping could take place as in fact it did when the defendants’ titles overlapped that of CLT at the northwestern portion of the latter’s property.</b><br><br>Fifthly, the results of laboratory analysis conducted by a Forensic Chemist of the NBI revealed that TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 were estimated to be fifty (50) years old as of March 1993 when the examination was conducted.   Hence, the documents could have been prepared only in 1940 and not in 1918 as appearing on the face of TCT No. 4211.<br><br><b>Based on the foregoing patent irregularities, the court finds the attendance of fraud in the issuance of TCT No. 4211 and all its derivative titles which preceded the defendants’ titles.  Evidently, TCT No. 4211 cannot be validly traced from OCT No. 994.   Being void <i>ab initio</i>, it did not give rise to any transmissible rights with respect to the land purportedly invalid, and resultantly, the defendants, being the holders of the latest derivatives, cannot assert any right of ownership over the lands in question.   ‘The void <i>ab initio</i> land titles issued cannot ripen into private ownership.’</b>  (<i>Republic vs. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>, 209 SCRA 90)<br><br>x x x<br><br>The court’s findings are consistent with a ruling of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR No. 45255 entitled ‘<i>CLT Realty Development Corp. vs. Manotok Realty, Inc., et al.</i>’ promulgated on September 28, 1995, affirming the decision of the other branch of this court ordering the cancellation of TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 which encroached on a specific area of Lot No. 26 of the Maysilo Estate, Caloocan City.

TCT 26539 was consequently cancelled.  <b>The Court observes that the said Deed of Sale and Mortgage was between Jose Ma.

That they did not do so only shows that their belated allegation of denial of due process is a mere afterthought, obviously because the trial court’s Decision was adverse to them.<br><br>It bears stressing that it is well within the power of the trial court to <b>adopt</b> the commissioners’ Majority Report as the basis of its judgment.   The very reason why the commissioners were appointed by the trial court, upon agreement of the parties, was to determine whether there is overlapping of the parties’ titles.  By appointing them based on their background, expertise and experience in the field of geodetic engineering, the contending parties and the trial court <b>concede that their chosen commissioners are in a better position to determine which of the titles were regularly issued. </b>Consequently, the trial court may rely on their findings and conclusions.   Under Section 11, Rule 32 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, the trial court is clearly authorized to “render judgment <b>by adopting,</b> modifying, or rejecting <b>the report (by the commissioners) in whole</b> or in part or it may receive further evidence or may recommit it with instructions.”<br><br>Furthermore, the trial court did not conduct further reception of evidence before deciding the case since not one of the parties asked for it.   The parties themselves <b>opted</b> to submit the case for decision on the bases, among others, of their respective comments on the commissioners’ Reports.   By doing so, they unmistakably impressed upon the trial court that their respective evidence they submitted to the commissioners were complete and ripe for adjudication.   <b>In fact, petitioners themselves specifically prayed that the trial court adopt in its Decision the Minority Report of a single Commissioner, which is favorable to them.</b>   Certainly, under the doctrine of <i>estoppel</i>, petitioners are <b>barred</b> from assailing the trial court’s judgment for being premature since they themselves had asked the said court that it should already decide the case.   They cannot now espouse a posture inconsistent with their conduct below as this is anathema to the orderly administration of justice.<br><br>As aptly stated by the Court of Appeals in its Decision dated September 28, 1995 in CA-G.R.

In fact, petitioners admitted that the commissioners verified the certificates of title and related documents with the proper government agencies and “examined the title records.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>   It bears stressing that these certificates are the <span style="font-weight: bold;">core</span> documents upon which the commissioners based their findings because they contain the <b>necessary facts</b> showing the data of the land in question, namely: the registered owner/s and the person/s to whom the titles were issued or transferred; the technical description and the metes and bounds of the land; the approved survey plans; the date of the original survey of the mother title; voluntary transaction affecting the whole land or part thereof or interest therein; the number of the previous certificate/s of title covering the same land and the fact that it was originally registered; the record number; the number of the original certificate of title; the volume page of the registration book in which the latter is found; and annotation of encumbrances in the certificates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Moreover, <b>it is noteworthy that the findings in the commissioners’ Majority Report are based substantially on the very documents submitted by petitioners themselves in the course of the proceedings.</b>   Clearly, their allegations that they were denied due process and that the Majority Report is defective because it does not cite any “specific evidence” are without merit.<br><br><b><i>The commissioners who rendered the <br>Majority Report did not exceed their <br>authority.</i></b><br><br>The commissioners acted within the scope of their authority. In their Comment on the Majority Report, petitioners did not complain that the commissioners exceeded their mandate.   Likewise, petitioners did not raise such objection in their Memorandum.   Instead, they asked the trial court to approve the Minority Report and render judgment in their favor.   And since petitioners did not present before the trial court the alleged error of the commissioners, the same is <b>deemed waived.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In <i>De la Rama Steamship Co. v. National Development Co.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> this Court held that <b>where, as here, a party fails to file opportunely his objections to the Report of the commissioner or referee, questions relating to the Report cannot be reviewed and he cannot dispute the findings therein or escape the legal consequences flowing therefrom.</b>&nbsp;   In the same vein, we ruled in <i>Santos v. De Guzman and Martinez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> that: <blockquote> <b>By way of emphasis,</b> we now desire to add that if a party desires to challenge the findings of a referee, he <b>must do so by timely and specific exceptions</b> to the referee’s report.   If he fails to make such exceptions and the report is confirmed by the trial judge, he is <b>bound by the findings and cannot be heard to dispute their truthfulness or escape the legal consequences flowing therefrom.</b>   Questions relating to the report of a referee can be <b>reviewed only where the record discloses the exceptions taken thereto.</b>  (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> We reiterate that the commissioners who submitted the Majority Report did not exceed their authority.   They verified and examined the numerous documents and certificates of title of the parties and their predecessors, as well as the corresponding transfer documents and surveys.   Upon examination, these commissioners found “<b>inherent technical defects on TCT No. 4211</b> (from which petitioners <i>Manotok Corporations</i> derived their titles) and <b>TCT No. 4210.”  </b>The said defects, they explained, <b>“point to the fact that there was no approved subdivision of Lot 26 which served as legal basis for the regular issuance of TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211.”</b>   They further found that petitioners’ titles overlap with portions of respondent <i>CLT Realty’s</i> title, explaining that the overlapping <b>“is due to the irregular and questionable issuance of TCT Nos. 4211 (also of TCT No. 4210), 5261, 35486, 1368 to 1374.”</b>   They thus concluded that respondent’s title (pertaining to the entire Lot 26 of the Maysilo Estate), which was derived from regularly issued titles, should prevail over petitioners’ titles, which were derived from those irregularly issued.<br><br>The Commissioners explained their findings and stated their conclusions in their Majority Report pursuant to their mandate to <b>resolve</b> the issue of whether petitioners <i>Manotok Corporations’</i> titles overlap that of <i>CLT Realty</i>. <b>Intrinsically intertwined with such mandate</b> is the commissioners’ <b>duty to state the basis</b> of their findings and conclusions.   This is obviously necessary to enable the trial court, as well as the appellate court in case of appeal, to fully understand the commissioners’ findings and to make proper judgment.   Petitioners very well know that the commissioners’ Reports are still <b>subject to approval by the trial court which has the final say</b> on the matter.  Clearly, the commissioners acted within their authority.<br><br>Considering that petitioners <i>Manotok Corporations</i> were fully accorded due process, their plea that this case be remanded to the trial court for hearing and reception of evidence is unwarranted.<br><br> <center> <b><span style="font-style: italic;">E</span><br><br><i>The magnitude of the land area involved in these <br>cases, as alleged by petitioners, is exaggerated.</i></b></center><br>In their motion for reconsideration, the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> alleged that the Maysilo Estate consists of 1,660 hectares of land located in Malabon, Caloocan City and Quezon City, 1,342 hectares of which are covered by OCT No. 994; and that considering the magnitude of the land area involved, our Decision will prejudice many landowners.<br><br>Likewise, <i>Araneta Institute</i> claimed in its motion for reconsideration that the Decision involves 1,660 hectares of land in Malabon, Caloocan City and Quezon City; and that this case has utmost significance, affecting national interest.   Hence, our Decision should be reconsidered.<br><br>The allegations of the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Araneta Institute</span> that our ruling involves 1,660 hectares of land in Malabon, Caloocan City and Quezon City are exaggerated, to say the least.   The controversy between the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> and <i>CLT Realty</i> involves only 201,288 square meters, or more than 20 hectares only.<br><br>In <i>Araneta Institute v. Heirs of Jose B.

Worse, they have not been raised and passed upon by the trial courts and the three (3) Divisions of the Court of Appeals.  To be sure, they have not been proved by evidence. Justice Tinga’s posture grossly violates the settled rule that no new issues shall be raised for the first time on appeal.  The remand of these cases to the appellate court is an attempt on his part <b>to prolong the litigation</b> and disturb the findings of the said courts sustained by overwhelming evidence.  I reiterate that the titles of <i>Dimson</i> and <i>his heirs</i> and that of  the <span style="font-style: italic;">CLT</span> are valid. On the other hand, the titles of the <i>Manotok Corporations</i> and <i>Araneta Institute</i> are spurious.   These are the findings of the three trial courts and affirmed by the three Divisions of the Court of Appeals.   To litigate these findings once again will entirely change the settled jurisprudence of this Court.  The doctrine that there should be an end to litigation has been seriously disturbed.   <b>This is a sad day for the Court.</b><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> I vote to  <b>DENY</b> the Motions for Reconsideration of the Decision dated November 29, 2005.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>   <b>G.R.

These conditions have not been established here. On the contrary, the petitioner was completely unaware that his testimony in Civil Case No. 1327 was being considered by the trial court in the case then pending before it.

Judge Muro</i>, 236 SCRA 505 (1994), enumerated the requisites for a court to take judicial notice of a certain fact: <blockquote> "Generally speaking, matters of judicial notice have three material requisites: (1) the matter must be one of common and general knowledge; (2) it must be well and authoritatively settled and not doubtful or uncertain; and (3) it must be known to be within the limits of the jurisdiction of the court. The principal guide in determining what facts may be assumed to be judicially known is that of notoriety. Hence, it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced by public records and facts of genera notoriety.<br><br>To say that a court will take judicial notice of a fact is merely another way of saying that the usual form of evidence will be dispensed with if knowledge of the fact can be otherwise acquired. This is because of the court assumes that the matter is so notorious that it will not be disputed. But judicial notice is not judicial knowledge. The mere personal knowledge of the judge is not the judicial knowledge of the court, and he IS not authorized to make his individual knowledge of a fact, not generally or professionally known, the basis of his action. Judicial cognizance is taken only of those matters which are 'commonly' known.<br><br>Things of 'common knowledge' of which courts take judicial notice, may be matters coming to the knowledge of men generally In the course of the orcl1nary experiences of life or they may be matters which are generally accepted by mankind as true and are capable of ready and unquestioned demonstration. Thus, facts which are universally known, and which may be found in encyclopedias, dictionaries or other publications, are judicially noticed, provided they are of such universal notoriety and so generally understood that they may be regarded as forming part of the common knowledge of every person."

Reversing the RTC, this Court declared that the reasonable amount of rent could be determined not by mere judicial  notice, but by supporting evidence:<br><br>. . . A court cannot take judicial notice of a factual matter in controversy. The court may take judicial notice of matters of public knowledge, or which are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions.

issue involving OCT No. 994 is not whether the true date of its
registration was April 19, 1917 or May 3, 1917 but which of these dates
exists in the books of the Land Registration Authority (LRA).<br><br>While
it appears at first glance that there were two different dates of
registration of OCT No. 994 — April 19, 1917 and May 3, 1917 — only one
OCT No. 994 appears in the books of the LRA. This was OCT No. 994
registered on May 3, 1917. <i>There was only one OCT No. 994. And it was registered on May 3, 1917</i>, not on April 19, 1917.<br><br>The voluminous records of these cases show the following material antecedent facts relative to the issuance of OCT No. 994:<br><ol><li>on
December 3, 1912, the Court of First Instance (CFI) of Rizal presided
by Judge Norberto Romualdez, rendered judgment in Land Registration
Case No. 4429 ordering the issuance of a decree of registration;<br><br></li><li>pursuant
thereto, the General Land Registration Office prepared decree no. 36455
and issued the same on April 19, 1917 at 9:00 in the morning in Manila,
Philippine Islands and<br><br></li><li>on May 3, 1917, the Register of
Deeds of the Province of Rizal received decree no. 36455 and had it
transcribed. Thus, the following entries appeared on the first page of
OCT No. 994:<br></li></ol><blockquote><br><i>Witness: the Honorable <u>Norberto Romualdez</u>, Associate, Judge of said Court, the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of December, A.D. nineteen hundred and <u>twelve.</u><br><br>Issued at Manila, P.I., the <u>19<sup>th</sup></u> day of <u>April, A.D. 1917</u> at 9:00 A.M.<br><br>ATTEST: <u>ENRIQUE ALTAVAS</u><br>Chief of the Land Registration Office<br><br>Received for transcription at the Office of the Register of Deeds for the Province <u>of Rizal</u>, this <u>third day of May nineteen hundred and seventeen</u> at <u>7:30 A.M.</u></i><br></blockquote>Clearly
then, May 3, 1917, the date of transcription of the decree of
registration, was the date OCT No. 994 was registered and became
effective. This was in accordance with Sections 41 and 42 of Act No.
496 (The Land Registration Act), the applicable law at the time OCT No.
994 was issued:<br><blockquote>Section 41. Immediately after final
decision by the court directing the registration of any property, the

Six, and he shall forward a certified copy of said decree to the
register of deeds of the province or city in which the property is
situated. <b>The register of deeds shall transcribe the decree in a book to be called the “Registration Book,”</b>
in which a leaf, or leaves, in consecutive order shall be devoted
exclusively to each title. The entry made by the register of deeds in
this book in each case shall be the original certificate of title, and
shall be signed by him and sealed with the seal of the court. All
certificates of title shall be signed by him and sealed with the seal
of the court. All certificates of title shall be numbered
consecutively, beginning with number one. The register of deeds shall
in each case make an exact duplicate of the original certificate,
including the seal, but putting on it the words “owner’s duplicate
certificate,” and deliver the same to the owner, or to his attorney
duly authorized. In case of a variance between the owner’s duplicate
certificate and the original certificate, the original shall prevail.
The certified copy of the decree of registration shall be filed and
numbered by the register of deeds with reference noted on it to the
place of record of the original certificate of title: <i>Provided, however,</i>
That when an application includes land lying in more than one province,
or one province and the city of Manila, the court shall cause the part
lying in each province or in the city of manila to be described
separately by metes and bounds in the decree of registration, and the
clerk shall send to the register of deeds for each province, or the
city of Manila, as the case may be, a copy of the decree containing the
description of the land within that province or city, and the register
of deeds shall register the same and issue an owner’s duplicate
thereof, and thereafter for all matters pertaining to registration
under this Act the portion in each province or city shall be treated as
a separate parcel of land.<br><br>Section 42. The certificate first
registered in pursuance of the decree of registration in regard to any
parcel of land shall be entitled in the registration book, “Original
certificate of title, entered pursuant to decree of the Court of Land
Registration, dated at” (stating the time and place of entry of decree
and the number of case). <b>This certificate shall take effect upon the date of the transcription of the decree.</b>
Subsequent certificates relating to the same land shall be in like
form, but shall be entitled “Transfer from number” (the number of the
next previous certificate relating to the same land), and also the
words “Originally registered” (date, volume, and page of registration).
(emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>April 19, 1917 was the date of
issuance or forwarding of the decree of registration (decree no. 36455)
to the registrar of deeds. It was not the date of transcription of said
decree. The transcription in the registry book by the registrar of
deeds was made on May 3, 1917, the day it was received by the Registrar
of Deeds of the Province of Rizal. There could thus be no other date of
registration but <i>May 3, 1917.</i><br><br>Registration means “<b>recording</b>;
inserting in an official register; enrollment, as registration of
voters; the act of making a list, catalogue, schedule, or register,
particularly of an official character, or of <b>making entries</b> therein.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
In general, it means any entry made in the books of registry, including
both registration in its ordinary and strict senses, and cancellation,
annotation and even the marginal notes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
In its strict sense, it is the entry made in the registry which records
solemnly and permanently the right of ownership and other real rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In its juridical aspect, it <b>is the entry made in a book or public registry of deeds.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4] </sup>
Therefore, the transcription or entry of the decree of registration in
the registration book was what constituted registration, in this case,
on May 3, 1917.<br><br><b>SINCE THE “TWO OCT NO. 994 <br>THEORY” IS FALSE, THE RULING THAT <br>UPHELD THE RESPECTIVE TITLES OF <br>RESPONDENTS HAS NO BASIS</b><br><br>The
“two OCT No. 994 theory” (that is, there were two OCT No. 994s, one
registered on April 19, 1917 which was superior to the other OCT No.
994 registered on May 3, 1917) was the foundation of the November 29,
2005 decision. On that theory rested the ruling that the respective
titles of respondents CLT Realty Development Corporation (CLT) and the
heirs of Jose B. Dimson (heirs of Dimson) as derivatives of OCT No. 994
registered on April 17, 1917<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
should be upheld over that of petitioners. The theory has been proven
false as no OCT No. 994 registered on April 17, 1917 ever existed.<br><br>The
difference between the “two OCT No. 994 theory” and the fact that only
one OCT No. 994 existed is critical and crucial. In judicial
decision-making, theory must give way to reality because a decision
should always be based on facts to which the relevant law shall be
applied.<br><br>Moreover, in these cases, the difference between theory
and reality and the dates April 19, 1917 and May 3, 1917 are
significant as well as decisive. On them hang the conflicting claims
and rights of the contending parties. Indeed, the Court formulated the
Advisory on the issues for oral arguments of these cases on the premise
that there were two OCT No. 994s:<br><blockquote><center>I.<br></center><br>Which of the Certificates of Title of the contending parties are valid?<br><br>A.        <b>Petitioners’ titles:</b><br><ol><li>Transfer

submit that the respective certificates of title of respondents (TCT
No. T-177013 of CLT and TCT No. R-15166 of the heirs of Dimson) could
not have been valid derivative titles of OCT No. 994 registered on May
3, 1917.<br><br>First, CLT and the heirs of Dimson have consistently
claimed that the mother title of their respective certificates of title
was <i>OCT No. 994 registered on April 19, 1917</i>. However, OCT No. 994 registered on April 19, 1917 never existed. It was a fruit of fraud and falsification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, the certificates of title of CLT and the heirs of Dimson had no valid source.<br><br>Neither
CLT nor the heirs of Dimson presented a certified copy (or even any
copy) of the mother title of TCT Nos. T-177013 and TCT No. R-15166. CLT
submitted OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917 and admitted that there
was only one OCT No. 994. It, however, argued that OCT No. 994’s
registration date should be April 19, 1917, the date of issuance of the
decree of registration. This is a complete turnaround from its original
contention that there were two OCT No. 994s, one registered on April
19, 1917 and another registered on May 3, 1917. The Court should not
allow this.<br><br>In the trial courts, CLT and the heirs of Dimson
traced their titles to the spurious OCT No. 994 registered on April 19,
1917. They even underscored this point to show that their mother title
was issued earlier than, and prevailed over, OCT No. 994 registered on
May 3, 1917. They are therefore estopped from claiming otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Respondents
cannot change horses in midstream. A party cannot adopt a new theory or
argument, specially one that is inconsistent with its previous
contention. The Court should not countenance CLT’s act of adopting
inconsistent postures as this would be a mockery of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> This rule applies more strictly in case of appeal. As this Court declared in <i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>The
rule is well-settled that points of law, theories, issues and arguments
not adequately brought to the attention of the lower court need not be
considered by the reviewing court as they cannot be raised for the
first time on appeal, much more in a motion for reconsideration as in
this case, because this would be offensive to the basic rules of fair
play, justice and due process.<br></blockquote>Second, in upholding the
validity of the titles of CLT, heavy reliance is made on the
observations of the trial court and the Court of Appeals focusing on
the alleged technical defects of TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211 (from where
petitioner Manotok Realty, Inc.’s titles originated). To my mind,
however, there are compelling reasons to annul respondent CLT’s title.<br><br>True,
this Court is not a trier of facts, specially if the factual findings

this Court can set aside the procedural barrier to a re-examination of
the facts to resolve the legal issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In
these cases, the trial and appellate courts found (and this Court
adopted the finding in its November 29, 2005 decision) that there are
two OCT No. 994s, registered on April 19, 1917 and May 3, 1917,
respectively. However, such finding has been shown to be manifestly
erroneous.<br><br>TCT No. T-177013 covers Lot 26 of the Maysilo Estate
with an area of 891,547.43 sq. m. It was a transfer from TCT No.
R-17994 issued in the name of Estelita I. Hipolito. On the other hand,
TCT No. R-17994 was a transfer from TCT No. R-15166 in the name of Jose
B. Dimson which, in turn, was supposedly a direct transfer from OCT No.
994 registered on April 19, 1917.<br><br>Annotations at the back of
Hipolito’s title revealed that Hipolito acquired ownership by virtue of
a court order dated October 18, 1977 approving the compromise agreement
which admitted the sale made by Dimson in her favor on September 2,
1976. Dimson supposedly acquired ownership by virtue of the order dated
June 13, 1966 of the CFI of Rizal, Branch 1 in Civil Case No. 4557
awarding him, as his attorney’s fees, 25% of whatever remained of Lots
25-A, 26, 27, 28 and 29 that were undisposed of in the intestate estate
of the decedent Maria de la Concepcion Vidal, one of the registered
owners of the properties covered by OCT No. 994. This order was
confirmed by the CFI of Caloocan in a decision dated October 13, 1977
and order dated October 18, 1977 in SP Case No. C-732.<br><br>However, an examination of the annotation on OCT No. 994, particularly the following entries, showed:<br><blockquote>AP-6665/0-994

on the description of Lot No. 26 in OCT No. 994, it has an area of
891,547.43 sq. m. which corresponds to the total area sold in 1918
pursuant to the above-cited entries. Inasmuch as, at the time the order
of the CFI of Rizal was made on June 13, 1966, no portion of Lot No. 26
remained undisposed of, <i>there was nothing for the heirs of Maria de
la Concepcion Vidal to convey to Dimson. Consequently, Dimson had
nothing to convey to Hipolito who, by logic, could not transmit
anything to CLT.</i><br><br>Moreover, subdivision plan Psd-288152
covering Lot No. 26 of the Maysilo Estate described in Hipolito’s
certificate of title was not approved by the chief of the Registered
Land Division as it appeared to be entirely within Pcs-1828, Psd-5079,
Psd-5080 and Psd-15345 of TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211. How Hipolito was able
to secure TCT No. R-17994 was therefore perplexing, to say the least.<br><br>All
these significant facts were conveniently brushed aside by the trial
and appellate courts. The circumstances called for the need to preserve
and protect the integrity of the Torrens system. However, the trial and
appellate courts simply disregarded them.<br><br><b>CLT’S AND THE HEIRS OF DIMSON’S <br>PREDECESSORS-IN-INTEREST HAD <br>NOTHING TO TRANSFER</b><br><br>As
early as 1918, the entire Lot No. 26 had already been disposed of and
title thereto was transferred to the predecessors-in-interest of
Manotok Realty, Inc. as evidenced by the issuance of TCT Nos. 4210 and
4211. This fact was reflected in the following annotations on OCT No.
994:<br><ol type="a"><li>Ap 6665/0-994 stating that TCT 4210 was issued
on September 9, 1918 in favor of Alejandro Ruiz and Mariano P. Leuterio
canceling OCT No. 994 insofar as portions of Lot No. 26 with areas of
3,052.93 sq. m. and 16,512.50 sq. m., respectively, by virtue of a deed
of sale dated August 29, 1918 and<br><br></li><li>Ap 6665/0-994 stating
that TCT No. 4211 was issued on September 9, 1918 in favor of Alejandro
Ruiz and Mariano P. Leuterio totally canceling OCT No. 994 with regard
to Lot 26 by virtue of a sale dated August 25, 1918 covering the
remaining 871,982 sq. m. of the said lot.<br></li></ol>Clearly,
Dimson’s TCT No. R-15166 had no basis because the property it was
supposed to cover was already covered by TCT Nos. 4210 and 4211.
Moreover, Dimson anchored his right to Lot No. 26 by virtue of the
order dated June 13, 1966 of the CFI of Rizal, Branch 1. He presented
the said order dated June 13, 1966 to the CFI of Caloocan City for
confirmation only after the lapse of 11 years from its issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The
order dated June 13, 1966 was recalled by the CFI of Rizal on August
16, 1966. Thus, his petition for confirmation was invalid on two
grounds: (1) his right to file it had already prescribed and (2) with
the recall of the order dated June 13, 1966, there was no longer
anything to confirm. These fatal defects likewise tainted the heirs of
Dimson’s TCT No. R-15169 because it was issued on the basis of the same
decision dated October 13, 1977 and order dated October 18, 1977 of the
CFI of Caloocan (the same bases for the issuance of TCT No. R-15166).<br><br>The
river cannot rise higher than its source. To reiterate, Dimson’s TCT
Nos. R-15166 and R-15169 had no basis. Since Dimson’s title was the
source of Hipolito’s title and, subsequently, of CLT’s TCT No. 177013,
then CLT’s certificate of title also had no basis. Dimson did not
acquire any portion of Lot Nos. 26 or 25-A (covered by the titles of
Araneta Institute of Agriculture, Inc. [Araneta]). As such, he could
not transfer any portion thereof to Hipolito. In the same vein, having
acquired nothing from Dimson, Hipolito transmitted nothing to CLT.<br><br>Moreover,
the rule is that where two certificates of title are issued to
different persons covering the same parcel of land in whole or in part,
the earlier in date must prevail as between the original parties and,
in case of successive registration where more than one certificate is
issued over the land, the person holding title under the prior
certificate is entitled to the property as against the person who
relies on the second certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
In other words, where more than one certificate is issued in respect of
a particular estate or interest in land, the person claiming under the
prior certificate is entitled to the estate or interest; and that
person is deemed to hold under the prior certificate who is the holder
of, or whose claim is derived directly or indirectly from, the person
who was the holder of the earliest certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>TCT
Nos. 4210 and 4211 preceded Dimson’s TCT No. R-15166 by almost 50 years
while TCT Nos. 737 and 13574 of Araneta were issued 30 years earlier
than Dimson’s TCT No. R-15169. As between the source of Manotok Realty,
Inc. and Manotok Estate Corporation’s titles and that of CLT’s,
therefore, that of the latter prevails. In the same vein, Araneta’s
titles prevail over that of the heirs of Dimson.<br><br><b>THE ALLEGED DEFECTS IN CONNECTION<br>WITH THE ISSUANCE OF TCT NO. 4211<br>WERE INSUFFICIENT TO NULLIFY THE <br>TITLE</b><br><br>The
trial and appellate courts ruled that fraud attended the issuance of
TCT No. 4211 from which petitioner Manotok Realty, Inc. derived its
titles. According to the trial and appellate courts: (1) the dates of
original survey appearing on TCT No. 4211 were different from those
indicated in OCT No. 994; (2) the Bureau of Lands had no copy of
Psd-2115 which was the basis for the issuance of TCTs Nos. 1368 to 1374
which preceded petitioner Manotok Realty, Inc.’s titles and (3) the
technical description of the land appearing on OCT No. 994 was in
English while the derivative titles were still in Spanish and the tie
points in the mother lot were not adopted in the derivative titles.<br><br>However,
the alleged irregularities are not sufficient to nullify TCT No. 4211.
They were mere technical defects which may have been committed in the
preparation thereof. The more important consideration should be whether
or not there was a deviation or change in the area of Lot No. 26 as
described in OCT No. 994 and those described in the derivative TCTs. In
the case of TCT No. 4211, there was no such deviation or change.<br><br>Moreover,
since the titles of respondents CLT and the heirs of Dimson are invalid
for having a non-existent source, the respective titles of petitioners
enjoy the presumption of valid and regular issuance. A review of the
purported defects of these titles should await a proper action, that
is, one that directly attacks their validity.<br><br><b>THE COMMITTEE REPORTS OF THE <br>SENATE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF <br>JUSTICE HAVE PROBATIVE VALUE</b><br><br>This Court already recognized the evidentiary value of the report of the Senate in <i>Alfonso v. Office of the President</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> when it included relevant portions of the report in its factual findings. While <i>Alfonso</i>
involved a disciplinary issue distinct from the issues in these cases,
the facts there were intimately and extensively related to the facts
here as <i>Alfonso</i> showed how OCT No. 994 allegedly registered on April 19, 1917 came about as a product of fraud and falsification.<br><br>Moreover,
the reports of the Senate and the Department of Justice are official
acts of co-equal branches of the government. Under Section 9, Rule 129
of the Rules of Court, it is mandatory for courts to take judicial
notice of these reports.<br><br><b>THERE IS NO NEED TO<br>REMAND THESE CASES</b><br><br>The
discussion on the venue of these cases (should these cases be remanded
to the CA) and the reasons why such venue is the proper one ought to be
commended for its comprehensiveness. However, I submit it is actually
academic and unnecessary. There is no need to remand these cases.<br><br>The discussion is unequivocal:<br><blockquote><b>[The
existence of the so-called 17 April OCT having been discounted], it
should necessarily follow that any title that is sourced from the 17
April 1917 OCT is void. Such conclusion is inescapable whatever
questions there may be about the veracity of the 3 May 1917 OCT….<br><br>The
determinative test to resolve whether the prior decision of this Court
should be affirmed or set aside [is] whether or not the titles invoked
by the respondents are valid. If these titles are sourced from the
so-called OCT No. 994 dated 17 April 1917, then such titles are void or
otherwise should not be recognized by this Court.</b><br></blockquote>As emphasis, the following point is made:<br><blockquote>The
conclusion is really simple. On their faces, none of these three titles
can be accorded recognition simply because the original title commonly
referred to therein never existed. To conclude otherwise would
constitute deliberate disregard of the truth. These titles could be
affirmed only if it can be proven that OCT No. 994 registered on 19
April 1917 had actually existed. CLT and the [Dimsons] were given the
opportunity to submit such proof before this Court, but they did not.
In fact, CLT has specifically manifested that the OCT No. 994 they
concede as true is also the one which the Office of the Solicitor
General submitted as true and that is OCT No. 994 issued on 3 May 1917.<br></blockquote>The
certificates of title of CLT and the heirs of Dimson have no valid
source. They are the bastard offsprings of the “mother of all land
titling scams.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This
Court has the duty to snuff them out, not to perpetuate them. They
should be ordered expunged from the registry books of the Office of the
Registrar of Deeds. Furthermore, the respective complaints filed by CLT
and the heirs of Dimson in the trial courts should be dismissed.<br><br>To
reiterate, the logical consequence of declaring the respective
certificates of title of CLT and the heirs of Dimson void and unworthy
of legal recognition is to order the dismissal of Civil Case Nos.
C-15539 and C-15491 instituted by CLT and Civil Case No. C-8050 filed
by the heirs of Dimson.<br><br>With the dismissal of the complaints, no
controversy remains to be decided and no case need be remanded.
Nonetheless, the ponencia is still not satisfied but asks further:<br><blockquote>xxx what then is the proper course of action to take with respect to these pending motions for reconsideration?<br></blockquote>The esteemed ponente further argues that:<br><blockquote>Considering
that CLT and [the heirs of Dimson] clearly had failed to meet the
burden of proof reposed in them as the plaintiffs in the action for
annulment of title and recovery of possession, there is a case to be
made for ordering the dismissal of their original complaints before the
trial court.<br></blockquote>Yet, more is desired:<br><blockquote>However, such solution may not satisfactorily put to rest the controversy surrounding the Maysilo Estate.<br></blockquote>The
ponencia’s allusion to “the controversy surrounding the Maysilo Estate”
is misleading and without factual and legal basis. After the respective
complaints of CLT and the heirs of Dimson are dismissed, the
controversy surrounding the portions of the Maysilo Estate involved in
these cases will be resolved and terminated. Thus, there will be no
more controversy to speak of.<br><br>Judicial power “includes the duty

Thus, there will be nothing more to remand.<br><br><b>NO DIRECT CHALLENGE TO <br>PETITIONERS’ TITLES REMAINS</b><br><br>In support of the action to remand these cases, the following opinion is rendered:<br><blockquote>More
pertinently, after the present petitions were filed with this Court,
the Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor
General, had sought to intervene. The Republic did not participate as a
party when these cases were still before the trial courts and the Court
of Appeals. While the Republic originally prayed for the grant of the
petitions filed by all the petitioners in these consolidated cases,
instead it presently seeks of the Court the promulgation of a new
ruling upholding the validity of OCT No. 994 issued or registered on [3
May 1917]. Rather than suggest whether the petitions be granted or
denied, the OSG argues that after a declaration from this Court that it
is the 3 May 1917 OCT mother title which is valid, “a remand of this
case to the Court of Appeals, to settle which among the private parties
derived their titles from the existing OCT 994, is proper.”<br><br>Notably, both the <i>Manotok</i> group and <i>Araneta</i> are amenable to the remand of the petition[s], albeit under differing qualifications.<br></blockquote>And the ponencia concludes:<br><blockquote>Considering
the reality that the genuine OCT No. 994 is that
issued/registered/dated 3 May 1917, remand would be appropriate to
determine which of the parties, if any, derived valid title from the
genuine OCT No. 994.<br></blockquote>There is no factual and legal
basis therefor. The annulment of the respective certificates of title
of respondents CLT and the heirs of Dimson terminated the controversies
subject of these cases. It removed the direct challenge raised by
respondents to the respective titles of petitioners.<br><br>Notably,
nowhere did the Republic assail the validity of the respective
certificates of titles of petitioners. It never prayed for the
annulment of their titles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
Otherwise, it would have gone against one of the fundamental principles
of the Torrens system of land registration: a Torrens title is not
subject to collateral attack.<br><br>A certificate of title cannot be changed, altered, modified enlarged or diminished in a collateral proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As a rule, it is irrevocable and indefeasible. <i>A strong presumption exists that it was validly and regularly issued.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The duty of courts is to see to it that this title is maintained and respected unless assailed in a direct proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> A Torrens title cannot be attacked collaterally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [26]</sup> The efficacy and integrity of the Torrens system must be protected at all costs.<br><br>With
the annulment of the respective titles of respondents CLT and the heirs
of Dimson, no direct challenge to the respective titles of petitioners
subsists. The strong presumption of valid and regular issuance of
petitioners’ titles remains. Unless and until directly attacked by a
party that has an actual and direct interest on the annulment of said
titles, that presumption will stand.<br><br>The Court does not have the
panacea for any and all ills allegedly surrounding the Maysilo Estate.
It should be constantly reminded of its own pronouncement in <i> Vera  v. Avelino</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>Let
us not be overly influenced by the plea that for every wrong there is a
remedy, and that the judiciary should stand ready to afford relief.
There are undoubtedly many wrongs the judicature may not correct….<br><br>Let
us likewise disabuse our minds from the notion that the judiciary is
the repository of remedies for all political or social ills….<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The
duty of this Court is to ensure and preserve the integrity of the
Torrens system. That duty must be performed with all due fidelity to
the fundamental principles governing that system.<br><br>Resolving all
controversies, perceived or real, surrounding the Maysilo Estate is a
desirable objective. However, it is simply not within the Court’s
powers to do in these cases. The Court is not enjoined, empowered or
equipped to clean the Augean stables, nor to accomplish the task in a
single day.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the motion for reconsideration of the intervenor Republic of the Philippines.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Black’s Law Dictionary, 4<sup>th</sup> edition, p. 1449.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Po Sun Tun v.

Estoppel is a bar which precludes a person from denying the truth of a
fact which has, in contemplation of law, become settled by the acts and
proceedings of judicial or legislative officers. Or by the act of the
party himself, either by conventional writing or by representations,
express or implied. “Estoppel” is also defined as a preclusion of a
person from asserting a fact, by previous conduct inconsistent
therewith, conduct on his own part or on the part of those under whom
he claims, or by adjudication on his rights, which he cannot be allowed
to call in question. It is a rule of equity as well as a conclusion of
law. The purpose of estoppel is to prevent inconsistency and fraud
resulting in injustice. While estoppel does not make valid the thing
complained of, it closes the mouth of the complainant. It is a doctrine
for the prevention of injustice and is for the protection of those who
have been misled by that which on its face was fair and whose
character, as represented, parties to the deception will not, in the
interest of justice, be heard to deny.
