(Maybank), and the Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental.<br><br>Summons was served on Maybank.&nbsp; On Maybank’s Motion, Branch 55 of the RTC granted it time to file responsive pleading up to August 23, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On August 23, 2001, the last day for Maybank to file responsive pleading, PNB filed a “Motion for Substitution and Motion to Dismiss,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> alleging that Maybank referred the case to it “for handling inasmuch as the properties involved . . . were already transferred to [it] by virtue of a <i>dacion en pago</i> executed by and between the two banks”; and it having acquired a legal interest over the subject properties, it, not Maybank, would be adversely affected by an unfavorable judgment.<br><br>PNB cited Section 19, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court in support of its Motion for Substitution, adding that under the circumstances, it had become an indispensable party under Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In its Motion to Dismiss, PNB raised the absence in the complaint of verification and certification against forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Nimfa filed her Opposition to PNB’s motions.<br><br>Maybank confirmed, in its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> on PNB’s Motion for Substitution, that PNB had acquired legal interest over the properties subject of the petition and thus joined PNB’s prayer for substitution.<br><br>Meanwhile, Nimfa died<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and was substituted by her estate, Intestate Estate represented by her sister, Charito J.

By considering the case as submitted for resolution <u>without giving the parties opportunity to present evidence to support their claims is tantamount to denial of due process.</u><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x x x x<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the above incidents and in conjunction with the ruling of the Supreme Court regarding the need for an adversarial proceeding on the matter of canceling and passing upon property rights, we find that . . . <u>PNB was denied of opportunity to present evidence against the claims of private respondent.</u>&nbsp; This resulted to the cancellation of the mortgage liens to the prejudice of petitioner PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The appellate court accordingly set aside the trial court’s Order of August 15, 2002 and that of October 29, 2002.&nbsp; Thus it disposed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us GRANTING the petition filed in this case and <u>SETTING ASIDE the questioned final orders dated August 15, 2002 and October 29, 2002, without prejudice to the original action being refiled in the proper court.</u>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>SO ORDERED. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> having been denied by Order of August 15, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> petitioner filed the instant Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> for Review on Certiorari, contending that<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE PETITION FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT . . .&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE</span> TO . . . PNB SINCE IT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAILED TO AVAIL OF THE REMEDY OF APPEAL FROM THE ORDER DATED AUGUST 15, 2002</span> THROUGH ITS OWN FAULT OR NEGLIGENCE . . .<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERRED BY HOLDING THAT LACK OF DUE PROCESS IS AN ADDITIONAL GROUND FOR ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENT</span> . . .<br><br></li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERRED BY HOLDING THAT THERE IS LACK OF DUE PROCESS IN THE INSTANT CASE</span> . . . <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>The petition fails.<br><br>Although Section 2 of Rule 47 of the Rules of Court provides that annulment of a final judgment or order of an RTC may be based “only on the grounds of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction,” jurisprudence recognizes as additional ground therefor denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> &nbsp;So <i>Arcelona v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> teaches:<br><blockquote>It is clear then that to set aside a final and executory judgment, there are three remedies available to a litigant:&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court on grounds of fraud, accident, mistake and excusable negligence filed within sixty (60) days from the time petitioner learns of the judgment but not more than six months from the entry thereof; <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, a direct action to annul for a judgment on the ground of extrinsic fraud; and third, a direct action for certiorari or collateral attack to annul a judgment that is void upon its face or void by virtue of its own recitals.&nbsp; Thus,<i> Macabingkil</i> did <u>not preclude the setting aside of a decision that is patently <i>void</i></u> where mere inspection of the judgment is enough to demonstrate its nullity on grounds of want of jurisdiction or <b><u>non-compliance with due process of law.</u></b>&nbsp; [Emphasis in original].&nbsp; This doctrine is recognized in other cases:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“x x x There is no question that a final judgment may be annulled.&nbsp; There are, however, certain requisites which must be established before a judgment can be the subject of an action for annulment.&nbsp; Under the present procedure, aside form the reliefs provided in these two sections (Secs. 1 &amp; 2, Rule 38), there is no other means whereby the defeated party may procure final and executory judgment to be set aside with a view to the renewal of the litigation, unless (a) the judgment is void for want of jurisdiction or for <u>lack of due process of law</u>, or (b) it has been obtained by fraud x x x . [Emphasis omitted.]”<br></blockquote>On the one hand, extrinsic fraud is the ground to annul a voidable judgment; <u>the declaration of nullity of a patently void final judgment, on the other, is based on grounds other than extrinsic fraud.</u>&nbsp; <b>To say, then, that petitioners can avail themselves only of the ground of extrinsic fraud and no other is to fail to appreciate the true meaning and ramifications of annulment/nullity.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The Joint Manifestation of “the parties”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which the trial court &nbsp;noted in its questioned Order of August 15, 2002, submitted for resolution without further oral argument the pending <u>incident</u>, which was <b>PNB’s</b> <u>motion for substitution</u>, <b>not the pending “petition for cancellation of mortgage liens</b> as the trial judge incorrectly read or understood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]<br><br></sup>Section 19 of Rule 3 of Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 19.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Transfer of interest.</i> ? In case of any transfer of interest, the action <b>may</b> be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action. (Emphasis supplied),<br></blockquote>uses the word “may” to denote that the substitution of parties on account of transfer of interest from the original party to another is discretionary.&nbsp; The trial judge’s denial of PNB’s Motion for Substitution may not, under the circumstances, thus be seriously assailed.<br><br>The trial court’s order granting the <u>petition for cancellation</u> even while the therein respondent Maybank had not been given the chance to file an Answer and, therefore, there was yet no joinder of issues, deprived Maybank, predecessor-in-interest of PNB, of due process of law, thus rendering said order void.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Bacolod City Water District v. Labayen</i> where the trial court decided a case after it denied the defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, this Court held:<br><blockquote><div align="center">x x x x<br></div><br>The short circuiting of the procedural process <u>denied the petitioner due process of law.&nbsp; It was not able to allege its defenses in an answer and prove them in a hearing</u>. . . . Over and above every desideratum in litigation is fairness.&nbsp; All doubts should be resolved in favor of fairness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><div align="center">x x x x&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>Petitioner’s argument that PNB could no longer avail of a petition for annulment of judgment due to its failure to appeal the trial court’s Order dated August 15, 2002 fails.&nbsp; For, since the Motion for Substitution of PNB was denied, PNB had no personality to assail the said order.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The trial court’s order being null and void, it may be assailed at any time either collaterally or in a direct action or by resisting the same in any action or proceeding whenever it is invoked, unless barred by laches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; That laches had not set in, there is no doubt.<br><br><i>En passant</i>, one need not be a party to the judgment sought to be annulled.&nbsp; What is essential is that it can prove his allegation that the judgment was obtained by the use of fraud and collusion and it would be adversely affected thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Even where there was no fraud and collusion, however, this Court has allowed parties to file petitions for annulment of judgment to question precisely their non-inclusion as parties to the original case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; </span><i>E.g.,</i> in <i>National Housing Authority v. Evangelista</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> where this Court upheld the annulment of the trial court judgment, <u>at the instance of a person who was not impleaded in the original case</u>, this Court held:<br><blockquote>Petitioner argues that it should not bear the consequence of the trial court’s denial of its motion to include respondent as defendant in Civil Case No. Q-91-10071.&nbsp; True, it was not petitioner’s fault that respondent was not made a party to the case.&nbsp; But likewise, it was not respondent’s fault that he was not given the opportunity to present his side of the story.&nbsp; Whatever prompted the trial court to deny petitioner’s motion to include respondent as defendant is not for the Court to reason why.&nbsp; xxx Be that as it may, the undeniable fact remains – respondent is not a party to Civil Case No. Q-91-10071 and xxx any portion of the trial court ‘s judgment xxx cannot be binding on him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Velasco, Jr., JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> RTC records, pp. 1-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 27.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 28-30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 55-56.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 45, 58.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 58.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 59-62.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 65-66.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 68.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 70-75.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 84-87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 218.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> CA<span style="font-style: italic;"> rollo, </span>pp. 2-20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Penned by Court of Appeals Associate Justice Isaias P.
