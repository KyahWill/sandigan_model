Marcelo (Ombudsman Marcelo) ordered the review of the original complaints against petitioner, et al. which the COA filed with his Office. Acting on the order, Prosecutor Jovito A. Coresis, Jr. (Prosecutor Coresis) reviewed the complaints and found sufficient evidence to conclude that a crime for violation of R.A.

Desierto</span>, petitioner as countersigning director, could not be held criminally liable for relying in good faith upon the actions of his subordinates, which showed no patent nor palpable irregularities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>In its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> to the present petition, the Office of the Ombudsman, through the OSP, maintains that the Sandiganbayan committed no grave abuse of discretion when it denied Redulla's Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It adds that since Redulla, et al. in Criminal Case No. 27853 had been arraigned (on April 15, 2005) and the case had been set for initial presentation of prosecution evidence on November 15, 17, and 18, 2005, the issues in Redulla's petition had been rendered moot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>First, a word on the Office of the Ombudsman's contention that the arraignment of Redulla and his co-accused rendered moot the issues in the present petition.<br><br>An accused does not waive the right to a preliminary investigation if he invokes it before or at the time he enters his plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In the case at bar, Redulla filed his Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause on September 23, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which is akin to a motion for the conduct of preliminary investigation, the purpose of which is to determine the existence of probable cause,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> before he was arraigned on April 15, 2005;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> hence, the above-said contention does not lie.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan's denial of petitioner's Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause is in order. This is in line with this Court's policy of non-interference in the exercise of the Ombudsman's constitutionally mandated powers.<br><blockquote>This Court has almost always adopted, quite aptly, a policy of non-interference in the exercise of the Ombudsman's constitutionally mandated powers. This rule is based not only upon respect for the investigatory and prosecutory powers granted by the Constitution to the Office of the Ombudsman but upon practicality as well. Otherwise, the functions of the courts will be grievously hampered by innumerable petitions . . . with regard to complaints filed before it, in much the same way that the courts would be extremely swamped if they were compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the part of the fiscals, or prosecuting attorneys, each time they decide to file an information in court or dismiss a complaint by a private complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>While there are exceptions to this policy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the case at bar does not fall among the exceptions. It is settled that as long as the Ombudsman's resolution is supported with substantial evidence, it will not be overturned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Prosecutor Coresis' findings, which were approved by the Ombudsman, of the existence of probable cause, were based on an examination of the audit report, including the supporting documents prepared by the COA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Redulla argues, however, as follows:<br><blockquote>. . . First, there is no dispute that respondent Ombudsman and respondent OSP had already found that <span style="font-weight: bold;">no probable cause</span> existed against petitioner. As a result of that finding, the respondent Sandiganbayan had, once before, already ordered that the Information for graft in Criminal Case No. 26305 be withdrawn upon the <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> motion of Prosecutor Pesquera.<br><br>Secondly, what was further "re-reviewed" by Prosecutor Coresis was not the withdrawal of Criminal Case No. 26035, or the Pesquera Memorandum and Tansiongco Memorandum, it was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">re-review of the Linco Memorandum "recommending the filing of criminal Information with the Sandiganbayan."</span> The basis for this apparently is a mere "verbal order" of Ombudsman Marcelo. Indeed, this "procedure" is not supported by any legal basis. In any case, Prosecutor Coresis obviously failed to take into consideration in his Coresis Memorandum the previous filing of Criminal Case No. 26035, by reason of the Linco Memorandum, and its subsequent withdrawal for lack of probable cause, by reason of the Pesquera Memorandum and Tansiongco Memorandum. Moreover, at any time during the "re-review" of the findings of Prosecutor Linco, petitioner was never apprised of the same, nor, worse, given any opportunity to present his side. He could have, at least, availed of remedies available to him under the law to defeat the very filing of the present Information. Petitioner was thus completely denied [of] his right to due process, which cannot be simply brushed off as a harmless procedural lapse since its consequence may well be petitioner's unnecessarily undergoing the rigors of trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>Petitioner's arguments do not mirror the presence of grave abuse of discretion. There was nothing irregular in Ombudsman Marcelo's order to re-review Prosecutor Linco's memorandum, as R.A. No. 6770 &nbsp;or the Ombudsman Act of 1989 places the OSP under the control andsupervision of the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus this Court declared in &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Cruz, Jr. v. People</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><blockquote>. . . Verily, it is discretionary upon the Ombudsman if he will rely mainly on the findings of fact of the investigating prosecutor in making a review of the latter's report and recommendation, as the Ombudsman can very well make his own findings of fact. There is nothing to prevent him from acting one way or the other. As a matter of fact, Section 4, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court provides that "where the investigating assistant fiscal recommends the dismissal of the case but his findings are reversed by the provincial or city fiscal or the chief state prosecutor on the ground that a probable cause exists, the latter may, by himself, file the corresponding information against the respondent or direct any other assistant fiscal or state prosecutor to do so, without conducting another preliminary investigation."<br><br>With more reason may the Ombudsman not be faulted in arriving at a conclusion different from that of the investigating prosecutor on the basis of the same set of facts. It cannot be said that the Ombudsman committed a grave abuse of discretion simply because he opines contrarily to the prosecutor that, under the facts obtaining in the case, there is probable cause to believe that herein petitioner is guilty of the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>Ombudsman Desierto's statement that "[t]he documents adduced in the Expanded Motion for Reinvestigation in C[riminal] C[ase] N[o.] 26035 sufficiently overturned the previous findings of probable cause against the accused therein"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> did not preclude Ombudsman Marcelo from ordering a re-review of the said memorandum because an administrative officer may revoke, repeal or abrogate the acts or previous rulings of his predecessor in office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Redulla's claim that he was denied due process does not avail him. Due process is satisfied when the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their side of the controversy or an opportunity to move for a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The records of the case show that Redulla filed a Counter-Affidavit to the complaints that the COA filed before the Office of the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He also filed an Expanded Motion for Reinvestigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> in relation to the first Information filed, as well as an affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> in support of such motion.<br><br>As for Redulla's claim that he could not be held liable as countersigning director for relying in good faith upon the actions of his subordinates, the same was correctly brushed aside by the Sandiganbayan. As this Court, on a similar claim, held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote>Petitioner's argument that he could not be indicted for violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019, because he acted in good faith when he approved the disbursement voucher, purchase order, invitation to bid and signed the checks after the same had been processed by his subordinates, are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">evidentiary in nature and are matters of defense</span>, the truth of which can be best passed upon after a full-blown trial on the merits. A preliminary investigation is conducted for the purpose of determining whether a crime has been committed, and whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty thereof and should be held for trial. It is not the occasion for full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence; it is for the presentation of such evidence only as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Sandiganbayan <span style="font-style: italic;">rollo</span>, Vol. I, pp. 80-100.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo</span>, p. 23.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[3]</sup> Supra note 1 at 5-9.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[4]</sup> Supra note 2 at 104-107.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[5]</sup> Id. at 105.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[6]</sup> Id. at 108-130.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[7]</sup> Id. at 130.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>[8]</sup> Id. at 142.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>[9]</sup> Id. at 143-145.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[10]</sup> Id. at 146-147.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[11]</sup> Id. at 168.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[12]</sup> Supra note 1 at 1-4.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[13]</sup> Id. at 2-3.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[14]</sup> Id. at 184-197.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[15]</sup> Id. at 189-190.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br>[16]</sup> Id. at 190.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[17]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Diosdado M.
