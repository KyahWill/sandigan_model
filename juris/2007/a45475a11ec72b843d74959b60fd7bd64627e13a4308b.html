Querimit</span>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>A certificate of deposit is defined as a written acknowledgment by a bank or banker of the receipt of a sum of money on deposit which the bank or banker promises to pay to the depositor, to the order of the depositor, or to some other person or his order, whereby the relation of debtor and creditor between the bank and the depositor is created. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>its FSD is not a certificate of deposit since there is nothing in the terms and conditions printed on the passbook evidencing it that can be construed to mean that the bank or banker acknowledges the receipt of a sum of money on deposit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moreover posits that the FSD, unlike a certificate of deposit, is not negotiable or payable to the order of some other person or his order but is "only withdrawable by the depositor or his authorized representative."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's position does not lie.<br><br>As correctly found by the CTA En Banc, a passbook representing an interest earning deposit account issued by a bank qualifies as a certificate of deposit drawing interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>A document to be deemed a certificate of deposit requires no specific form as long as there is some written memorandum that the bank accepted a deposit of a sum of money from a depositor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> What is important and controlling is the nature or meaning conveyed by the passbook and not the particular label or nomenclature attached to it, inasmuch as substance, not form, is paramount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioner's claim, not all certificates of deposit are negotiable. A certificate of deposit may or may not be negotiable as gathered from the use of the conjunction or, instead of and, in its definition. A certificate of deposit may be payable to the depositor, to the order of the depositor, or to some other person or his order.<br><br>In any event, the negotiable character of any and all documents under Section 180 is immaterial for purposes of imposing DST.<br><br>Orders for the payment of sum of money payable at sight or on demand are of course explicitly exempted from the payment of DST. Thus, a regular savings account with a passbook which is withdrawable at any time is not subject to DST, unlike a time deposit which is payable on a fixed maturity date.<br><br>As for petitioner's argument that its FSD is similar to a regular savings deposit because it is evidenced by a passbook,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and that based on the legislative deliberations on the bill which was to become R.A. 9243 which amended Section 180 of the NIRC (which is to a large extent the same as Section 180 of the Tax Code, as amended by R.A. 7660), Congress admitted that deposits evidenced by passbooks which have features akin to time deposits are not subject to DST,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the same does not lie.<br><br>The FSD, like a time deposit, provides for a higher interest rate when the deposit is not withdrawn within the required fixed period; otherwise, it earns interest pertaining to a regular savings deposit. Having a fixed term and the reduction of interest rates in case of pre-termination are essential features of a time deposit. Thus explains the CTA En Banc:<br><blockquote>It is well-settled that certificates of time deposit are subject to the DST and that a certificate of time deposit is but a type of a certificate of deposit drawing interest. Thus, in resolving the issue before Us, it is necessary to determine whether petitioner's Savings Account-Fixed Savings Deposit (SA-FSD) has the same nature and characteristics as a time deposit. In this regard, the findings of fact stated in the assailed Decision [of the CTA Division] are as follows:<br><blockquote>"In this case, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a depositor of a savings deposit-FSD is required to keep the money with the bank for at least thirty (30) days in order to yield a higher interest rate</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Otherwise, the deposit earns interest pertaining only to a regular savings deposit.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The same feature is present in a time deposit. A depositor is allowed to withdraw his time deposit even before its maturity subject to bank charges on its pre[-]termination and the depositor loses his entitlement to earn the interest rate corresponding to the time deposit</span>. Instead, he earns interest pertaining only to a regular savings deposit. Thus, petitioner's argument that the savings deposit-FSD is withdrawable anytime as opposed to a time deposit which has a maturity date, is not tenable. In both cases, the deposit may be withdrawn anytime but the depositor gets to earn a lower rate of interest. The only difference lies on the evidence of deposit, a savings deposit-FSD is evidenced by a passbook, while a time deposit is evidenced by a certificate of time deposit."<br></blockquote>In order for a depositor to earn the agreed higher interest rate in a SA-FSD, the amount of deposit must be maintained for a fixed period. Such being the case, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We agree with the finding that the SA-FSD is a deposit account with a fixed term. Withdrawal before the expiration of said fixed term results in the reduction of the interest rate. Having a fixed term and reduction of interest rate in case of pre-termination are essentially the features of a time deposit</span>. Hence, this Court concurs with the conclusion reached in the assailed Decision that petitioner's SA-FSD and time deposit are substantially the same. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The findings and conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its function, is dedicated exclusively to the consideration of tax problems and has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject, and unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and none has been shown in the present case, deserves respect.<br><br>It bears emphasis that DST is levied on the exercise by persons of certain privileges conferred by law for the creation, revision, or termination of specific legal relationships through the execution of specific instruments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is an excise upon the privilege, opportunity or facility offered at exchanges for the transaction of the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>While tax avoidance schemes and arrangements are not prohibited, tax laws cannot be circumvented in order to evade payment of just taxes. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> To claim that time deposits evidenced by passbooks should not be subject to DST is a clear evasion of the rule on equality and uniformity in taxation that requires the imposition of DST on documents evidencing transactions of the same kind, in this particular case, on all certificates of deposits drawing interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The further amendment of Section 180 of the NIRC and its renumbering as Section 179 by R.A. 9243, which was approved on February 17, 2004, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. Section 180 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, is hereby renumbered as Section 179 and further amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 179. Stamp Tax on All Debt Instruments. — On every original issue of debt instruments, there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of One peso (P1.00) on each Two hundred pesos (P200), or fractional part thereof, of the issue price of any such debt instruments: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> That for such debt instruments with terms of less than one (1) year, the documentary stamp tax to be collected shall be of a proportional amount in accordance with the ratio of its term in number of days to three hundred sixty-five (365) days: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, further</span>, That only one documentary stamp tax shall be imposed on either loan agreement, or promissory notes issued to secure such loan.<br></blockquote>For purposes of this section, the term debt instrument shall mean instruments representing borrowing and lending transactions including but not limited to debentures, certificates of indebtedness, due bills, bonds, loan agreements, including those signed abroad wherein the object of contract is located or used in the Philippines, instruments and securities issued by the government of any of its instrumentalities, deposit substitute debt instruments, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">certificates or other evidences of deposits that are either drawing interest significantly higher than the regular savings deposit taking into consideration the size of the deposit and the risks involved or drawing interest and having a specific maturity date</span>, orders for payment of any sum of money otherwise than at sight or on demand, promissory notes, whether negotiable or non-negotiable, except bank notes issued for circulation." (Underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>does not mean that as proffered, prior to its further amendment on said date, Section 180 of the Tax Code and the NIRC time deposits for which passbooks were issued were exempted from payment of DST.<br><br>If at all, the further amendment was intended to eliminate precisely the scheme used by banks of issuing passbooks to "cloak" its time deposits as regular savings deposits. This is reflected from the following exchanges between Mr. Miguel Andaya of the Bankers Association of the Philippines and Senator Ralph Recto, Senate Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, during the deliberations on Senate Bill No. 2518 which eventually became R.A. 9243:<br><blockquote>MR. MIGUEL ANDAYA (Bankers Association of the Philippines). Just to clarify. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Savings deposit at the present time is not subject to DST.</span><br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. That's right.<br><br>MR. ANDAYA. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Time deposit is subject</span>. I agree with you in principle that if we are going to encourage deposits, whether savings or time...<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. Uh-huh.<br><br>MR. ANDAYA. . .it's questionable whether we should tax it with DST at all, even the question of imposing final withholding tax has been raised as an issue.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. If I had it my way, I'll cut it by half.<br><br>MR. ANDAYA. Yeah, but I guess concerning the constraint of government revenue, even the industry itself right now is not pushing in that direction, but in the long term, when most of us in this room are gone, we hope that DST will disappear from the face of this earth, 'no.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now, I think the move of the DOF to expand the coverage of or to add that phrase, "Other evidence of indebtedness," it just removed ambiguity.</span> When we testified earlier in the House on this very same bull, we did not interpose any objections if only for the sake of avoiding further ambiguity in the implementation of DST on deposits. Because of what has happened so far is, we don't know whether the examiner is gonna come in and say, "This savings deposit is not savings but it's time deposit." So, I think what DOF has done is to eliminate any confusion. They said that a deposit that has a maturity. . .<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. Uh-huh.<br><br>MR. ANDAYA. . . . which is time, in effect, regardless of what form it takes should be subject to DST.<br><br>THE CHAIRMAN. Would that include savings deposit now?<br><br>MR.
