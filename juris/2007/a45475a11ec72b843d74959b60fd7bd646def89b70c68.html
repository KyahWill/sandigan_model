DOMINGO, Filipino, of legal age, married to Corazon A. Domingo, and with residence at No. 34 Dao St., Project 3, Quezon City, Metro Manila.<br><br>Once this decision becomes final and executory, the corresponding decree of registration shall forthwith issue.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </blockquote> Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals, contending that contrary to Domingo's claim that he and his predecessors-in-interest have been in actual, continuous and uninterrupted possession of the lots, Domingo has always been a resident of No. 34 Dao St., Project 3, Quezon City;  that despite Domingo's claim that he has a caretaker overseeing the lots, he could not even give the name of the caretaker; and that Domingo admittedly declared the lots in his name only in 1993.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of June 30, 2005, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the RTC decision and dismissed Domingo's application for registration of land title.<br><br>The appellate court ruled that while Domingo sought judicial confirmation of his imperfect title under the Public Land Act and Section 14 (1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529, "THE PROPERTY REGISTRATION DECREE," he failed to prove that he and his predecessors-in-interest had been in possession and occupation of the lots under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>And the appellate court noted that Domingo failed to present the alleged deed of sale executed by Genoveva<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and "could only prove through his Tax Declaration No. 0298 (new) that his possession in the concept of an owner started only in 1948 (Exhibit 'L,' Records, p. 117)."<br><br>Domingo's Motion for Reconsideration having been denied by the appellate court, the present petition was lodged, faulting the appellate court: <blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> I<br></div><br>. . . x x x x WHEN IT <u>LIMITED CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTERS ESTABLISHED IN THE APPLICATION TO SECTION 48 (B) OF THE PUBLIC LAND ACT AND SECTION 14 (1) OF PD 1529</u>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>. . . x x x WHEN IT <u>HELD THAT PETITIONER IS NOT ENTITLED FOR REGISTRATION OF TITLE</u> OVER THE SUBJECT LAND, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD CLEARLY ESTABLISHED HIS ENTITLEMENT [TO] REGISTRATION OF TITLE OVER THE LAND UNDER SECTION 14 (1) AND (4) OF PD 1529.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> Domingo's present counsel argues that assuming that Domingo failed to establish his possession from June 12, 1945 or earlier in accordance with Section 14(1) of P.D.

DOMINGO" contained in the Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping which forms part of the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  Nonetheless, the counsel presented a certified true copy of Domingo's death certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> showing that he died on March 9, 1996 (during the pendency of his application before the RTC as earlier stated).<br><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Section 14 (1) of P.D. No. 1529 provides: <blockquote> Sec. 14. Who may apply. - The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><br>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and <u>occupation</u> <u>of</u> <u>alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> To thus be entitled to registration of a land, the applicant must prove that (a) the land applied for forms part of the disposable and alienable agricultural lands of the public domain; and (b) he has been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the same under a <i>bona fide</i> claim of ownership either since time immemorial or since June 12, 1945.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>All lands not otherwise appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State, and unless it has been shown that they have been reclassified by the State as alienable or disposable to a private person, they remain part of the inalienable public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>To prove that a land is alienable, an applicant must conclusively establish the existence of a positive act of the government, such as a presidential proclamation or an executive order, or administrative action, investigation reports of the Bureau of Lands investigator or a legislative act or statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>While petitioner presented a document denominated as "2<sup>nd</sup> Indorsement"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [33]</sup> issued by Land Management Inspector Amadeo Mediran that the lots are "within the alienable and disposable zone under Project No. 3 LSC-3113 issued on April 5, 1978 as certified by the Director of the Forest Development," the genuineness of the document cannot be ascertained, it being a mere photocopy.  Besides, the truth of its contents cannot be ascertained, Mediran having failed to take the witness stand to identify and testify thereon.<br><br>In fine, Domingo failed to adduce incontrovertible evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> showing that the lots have been declared alienable.  They are thus presumed to belong to the public domain, beyond the commerce of man, and are not susceptible of private appropriation and acquisitive prescription.<br><br>But even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the lots are alienable, Domingo failed to comply with the requirement on the period of possession.  While he alleged in his petition that he bought the lots from Genoveva in 1948, he failed, as the appellate court correctly noted, to adduce the deed of sale executed for the purpose, or to explain the reason behind the failure and to present sufficient evidence to prove the fact of sale.<br><br>Again, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the lots were indeed sold to him by Genoveva, Domingo failed to adduce proof that Genoveva, from whom he seeks to tack his possession, acquired registrable title over them on June 12, 1945 or earlier. Under the same assumption, Domingo's claim that he has been in actual, continuous, adverse and open possession of the lots in the concept of an owner since 1948 is a conclusion of law which must be substantiated with proof of specific acts of ownership and factual evidence of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>An examination of the tax receipts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> presented by Domingo shows that they are of recent vintage, the earliest being dated January 8, 1993.<br><br>Tax Declaration Nos. 0298, GR-019-0884, and GR-019-0885,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which appear to have been issued in <u>1947</u> [<i>sic</i>], <u>1964</u>, and <u>1968</u>, respectively, contain the declaration "Filed under Presidential Decree No. 464" below the title "Declaration of Real Property."  P.D. No. 464, "The Real Property Tax Code," took effect, however, only on June 1, <u>1974</u>.   Specifically with respect to the first tax declaration, it even shows that Domingo subscribed and swore to it on August 1, 1947 at which time he had not bought the lot yet, in 1948 by his claim.<br><br>A note on Domingo's death during the pendency of his application at the RTC.  Indeed, the records do not show that his death on March 9, 1996 was brought to the RTC's attention, which is not in accordance with Sections 16 and 17, Rule 3 of the <u>1994</u> Rules of Court, <i>viz</i>: <blockquote> SEC. 16.  <i>Duty of attorney upon death, incapacity, or incompetency of party.</i> - Whenever a party to a pending case dies, becomes incapacitated or incompetent, it shall <u>be the duty of his attorney to inform the court promptly of such death</u>, incapacity or incompetency, and to give the name and residence of his executor, administrator, guardian or other legal representative.  (Italics in the original;  underscoring supplied)<br><br>SEC.  17.  <i>Death of party.</i> - After a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the <u>court shall order, upon proper notice, the legal representative of the deceased to appear and to be substituted for the deceased, within a period of thirty (30) days, or within such time as may be granted</u>.  If the legal representative fails to appear within said time, the court may order the opposing party to procure the appointment of a legal representative of the deceased within a time to be specified by the court, and the representative shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the interest of the deceased.  The court charges involved in procuring such appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs. The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint guardian ad litem for the minor heirs.  (Italics in the original;  underscoring supplied) </blockquote> When a party dies in an action that survives and no order is issued by the court for the appearance of the legal representative or of the heirs of the deceased in substitution of the deceased, and as a matter of fact no substitution has ever been effected, the proceedings held by the court without such legal representatives or heirs and the judgment rendered after such trial are null and void because the court acquired no jurisdiction over the <u>person</u> of the legal representative or of the heirs upon whom the trial and judgment would be binding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Unlike, however, jurisdiction over the subject matter which is conferred by law, jurisdiction over the person of the parties to the case may, however, be waived either expressly or impliedly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the case at bar, the surviving heirs voluntarily submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of this Court, albeit belatedly, by participating in the present petition.<br><br>Under the now amended Section 16, Rule 3 of the <u>1997</u> Rules of Court, failure of a counsel to comply with the provision thereof is a ground for disciplinary action, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span> <blockquote> SEC.  16.  <i>Death of party; duty of counsel. </i>- Whenever a party to a pending action dies, and the claim is not thereby extinguished, it shall be the <u>duty of his counsel to inform the court within thirty (30) days after such death</u> of the fact thereof, and to give the name and address of his legal representative or representatives.  <u>Failure of counsel to comply with this duty shall be a ground for disciplinary action</u>.<br><br>The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the minor heirs.<br><br>The court shall forthwith order said legal representative or representatives to appear and be substituted within a period of thirty (30) days from notice.<br><br>If no legal representative is named by the counsel for the deceased party, or if the one so named shall fail to appear within the specified period, the court may order the opposing party, within a specified time, to procure the appointment of an executor or administrator for the estate of the deceased and the latter shall immediately appear for and on behalf of the deceased. The court charges in procuring such appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs.  (Italics in the original;  underscoring supplied) </blockquote> The failure of Domingo's former counsel, Atty. Irineo A. Anarna of No. 4 Madlansacay St., Poblacion Lilang 4118 Cavite, to comply with the immediately quoted provisions of the Rules, is compounded by his misrepresentation, before the CA, that Domingo was well and alive when he stated in his Motion to Withdraw Appearance as Counsel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated July 8, <u>2004</u> that the "motion for withdrawal [was] conformed to by Mrs. Rosemarie Manlapit Zamora, <u>representative of the applicant</u> as shown by her signature . . . and that Mrs. Rosemarie Zamora also undertakes to personally seek the <u>conformity of the Applicant</u>" (Underscoring supplied); and by his retaining of the name of Domingo in the title of his pleadings before the appellate court.<br><br>Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides that "a lawyer owes candor, fairness and good faith to the court."  Rule 10.01 likewise provides that "a lawyer shall do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the court to be mislead by any artifice."  And Rule 10.03 provides that "a lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice."<br><br>This Court thus takes this occasion to warn Atty. Anarna that a repetition of a similar violation of the Rules of Court and the Code of Professional Responsibility will be dealt with strictly.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is, in light of the foregoing discussion, <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Let a copy of this Decision be furnished Atty. Irineo A. Anarna of No. 4 Madlansacay St., Poblacion Lilang, 4118 Cavite.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga,</i> and <i>Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, pp. 1-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 12-16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 17-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 23.
