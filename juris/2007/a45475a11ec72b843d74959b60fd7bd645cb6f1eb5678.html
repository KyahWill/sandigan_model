				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Challenged via petition for certiorari is the Quezon City Regional Trial Court’s Resolution dated April 17, 1996 dismissing the Complaint of Public Interest Center, Inc., Laureano T. Angeles and Jocelyn P. Celestino (petitioners) in Civil Case No. Q-95-25597, and Order dated June 18, 1996, denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The antecedent facts, as culled from the records of the case, are as follows:<br><br>On February 9, 1976, respondent National Power Corporation (NPC) entered into a contract (the Contract) with respondent Westinghouse Electric S.A. (WESA), an affiliate or subsidiary of respondent Westinghouse Electric Corporation (WESTINGHOUSE), whereby WESA undertook to construct in favor of the NPC a 620-megawatt nuclear power plant at Morong, Bataan and to supply equipment, machineries and services therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>WESA subsequently executed a deed of assignment transferring all its rights and responsibilities in the Contract to its construction arm-agent, respondent Westinghouse International Projects Company (WIPCO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In 1986, President Corazon Aquino issued Executive Order (E.O.) No. 55, which was later amended by E.O. No. 98, transferring ownership of the already constructed power plant, which had become known as the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (BNPP), its equipment, materials and facilities, records and uranium fuel, to the National Government or its duly constituted agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> &nbsp;Pursuant to E.O. No. 55, as amended, the National Government assumed all remaining foreign and local obligations incurred by the NPC in financing the construction of the BNPP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In 1988, the Aquino administration instituted a complaint against WESTINGHOUSE in New Jersey, U.S.A. Westinghouse later filed an arbitration case in Geneva, Switzerland.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On September 27, 1995, President Fidel Ramos authorized the following government officials as members of a Government Panel to conduct exploratory discussions with WESTINGHOUSE for the possible settlement of pending legal proceedings: Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Antonio T.

Pangcog, and Counsel Mark Augenblick.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Subsequently or on October 4, 1995, President Ramos issued E.O. No. 265, which amended E.O. No. 315 dated January 1, 1988, creating the Presidential Committee on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant (PC-BNPP Committee).<br><br>E.O. No. 265 provided that the PC-BNPP Committee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> “shall be the coordinating and policy-making body on the BNPP, including policies arising from negotiations for a fair commercial settlement of all pending legal claims that will provide a substantial net benefit to the country,” which “shall submit its recommendations on BNPP-related policies to the President for approval.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On October 11, 1995, the PC-BNPP Committee issued a “RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE ESSENTIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARRIVED AT BY THE GOVERNMENT PANEL AND WESTINGHOUSE REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE EXPLORATORY DISCUSSIONS FROM SEPTEMBER 29, 1995 TO OCTOBER 9, 1995 FOR A COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT OF THE BNPP CONTROVERSY AND FAVORABLY RECOMMENDING APPROVAL THEREOF TO HIS EXCELLENCY, THE PRESIDENT,” the salient points of which Resolution follow:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>NOTING that after a series of talks which started on September 29, 1995, the government panel and Westinghouse representatives (Mr. Briskman and Mr. Robert Gross) on October 9,1995, eventually <u>agreed in principle on a settlement involving a package of more than $100 MILLION</u>, consisting of the following:<br><blockquote>(1) $40 Million in cash (transferable by wire to a bank account specified by the Republic)<br><br>(2) Two (2) newly manufactured 501-F Econopac combustion turbines, FOB Houston, at 160 MW each or a total of 320 MW valued at $30 Million each, or a total of $60 Million<br><br>(3) Relinquishment by Westinghouse of the right to recover more than $200,000 in attorney’s fees previously awarded by the New Jersey court.<br></blockquote>NOTING that in exchange for the foregoing cash and utilities, <u>the parties would secure a dismissal with prejudice of the pending lawsuits, appeals and arbitration</u> between the Republic and National Power Corporation, on one hand, and Westinghouse, its affiliates and Burns &amp; Roe, on the other hand, involving the BNPP controversy and that the Republic would direct National Power Corporation and other government agencies to lift the ban against Westinghouse equipment and technology;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>OBSERVING that the present offer of Westinghouse of $40 Million in cash plus two (2) 501-F’s worth $60 Million represents the highest cash offer (since its $10 Million cash offer in 1992) and the most advantageous in kind offer (no discount/rebate component or any corresponding obligation on the side of the Republic);<br><br>HAVING IN MIND the uncertainty of the results of the arbitration, the possibility that some of Westinghouse’s counterclaims may partly offset any recovery, the prospect that even a favorable arbitration award could be limited to the $40 million cap under the original BNPP contract and that even if the government eventually wins the appeal of the New Jersey verdict, substantial costs would have to be incurred to pursue a new trial, which result is also uncertain;<br><br>RECOGNIZING that the present offer of Westinghouse will result in greater net economic benefits to the Republic than any previous settlement offer;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED that PC-BNPP, with the endorsement of the Republic’s lawyers and negotiating panel, <u>adopts the foregoing essential terms of the settlement agreement and respectfully recommends to His Excellency, President Fidel V.

(Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners’ Motion for Reconsideration of public respondent’s Resolution dismissing their complaint having been denied by the other assailed Order of June 18, 1996, they filed the present Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus With Application for A Writ Of Preliminary Injunction And Prayer For A Temporary Restraining Order directly with this Court in view of the “transcendental importance” of the issues involved.<br><br>Petitioners contend that in dismissing their Amended Complaint, public respondent abdicated its constitutional duty to exercise judicial review over the validity of the BNPP Contract, the loan contracts, and the 1995 Settlement Agreement.<br><br>Petitioners further contend that, contrary to the finding of public respondent, petitioners did not commit forum-shopping since there is no identity of parties and causes of action in the instant case and in the complaint filed before the Manila RTC.<br><br>Finally, petitioners contend that they have sufficiently established that the injury caused to them by the contracts are “actual, direct and immediate” to thus clothe them with standing.<br><br>The Solicitor General and WIPCO, opposing the petition, argue that no grave abuse of discretion attended the issuance by public respondent of the assailed resolutions considering that, among other things, petitioners are guilty of forum-shopping; petitioners have no legal standing; and the propriety of entering into a settlement agreement involves a political question and is not subject to judicial review.<br><br>The issues then are:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Whether petitioners have legal standing;<br><br>(2) Whether petitioners are engaged in forum-shopping;<br><br>(3) Whether the validity of the Contract and the contracts of loan entered into by the Republic and NPC with foreign banks to finance the construction of the BNPP, and the propriety of entering into a Settlement Agreement are subject to judicial review;

Zamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> this Court defined legal standing as follows:<br><blockquote>“Legal standing” or <i>locus standi</i> has been defined as <b>a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged</b>. The term “interest” means a material interest, an interest in issue affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. <b>The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges “such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.”</b> (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In public suits, the plaintiff, representing the general public, asserts a "public right" in assailing an allegedly illegal official action.&nbsp; The plaintiff may be a person who is affected no differently from any other person, and could be suing as a “stranger,” or as a “citizen” or “taxpayer.”&nbsp; To invest him with <i>locus standi</i>, the plaintiff has to adequately show that he is entitled to judicial protection and has a sufficient interest in the vindication of the asserted public right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the case of taxpayers’ suits, the party suing as a taxpayer must prove that he has sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation. &nbsp;Thus, taxpayers have been allowed to sue where there is a claim that public funds are illegally disbursed or that public money is being deflected to any improper purpose, or that public funds are wasted through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>More particularly, the taxpayer must establish that he has a personal and substantial interest in the case and that he has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of its enforcement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> or that he stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the case, or is entitled to the avails of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioners’ allegations in their Amended Complaint that the loan contracts entered into by the Republic and NPC are serviced or paid through a disbursement of public funds are not disputed by respondents, hence, they are invested with personality to institute the same.<br><br><i><u>Forum-Shopping</u></i><br><br>Forum shopping exists when, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than by appeal or <i>certiorari</i>) in another, or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>As explained by this <i>Court in First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals</i>, forum-shopping exists where the elements of litis pendentia are present, and where a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in the other. Thus, there is forum-shopping when, between an action pending before this Court and another one, there exist: "a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions, b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts, and c) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the other action, will, regardless of which party is successful amount to res judicata in the action under consideration; said requisites also constitutive of the requisites for auter action pendant or lis pendens." . . . [W]here a litigant sues the same party against whom another action or actions for the alleged violation of the same right and the enforcement of the same relief is/are still pending, the defense of litis pendentia in one case is a bar to the others; and, a final judgment in one would constitute res judicata and thus would cause the dismissal of the rest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>In determining whether forum shopping exists, it is important to consider the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different <i>fora</i> upon the same issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the present case, it is evident that, <i>vis a vis</i> the above-mentioned complaint filed in Manila, there exists identity of parties or interests represented, as well as identity of rights or causes of action and reliefs sought.<br><br>Thus, the first complaint which was instituted before the Manila RTC by the Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, et al. as taxpayers’ suit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>“Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc., et al. v.

Subsequently the plaintiff in that action made a motion for summary judgment on the first count alone, and defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. We have examined the briefs and affidavits submitted to the trial court on those motions, and it appears therefrom that the matter of the alleged invalidity of the affiliation agreement for alleged noncompliance with N.J.S.A. 40:2-29 and 40:50-6 was argued to the court. <u>The judgment of the court denied plaintiff's motion and granted those of defendants</u>.

Certification against forum shopping. – The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) <b>if he should <u>thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report</u> that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.</b><br><br><b>Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided upon motion and after hearing.</b>&nbsp; The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions.&nbsp; If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Granted that petitioners were initially unaware of the existence of the first set of cases, albeit their counsel was one of the petitioners therein, such fact was already brought to their attention during the hearing of their application for a temporary restraining order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> conducted after the filing of their Complaint. &nbsp;When petitioners subsequently filed their Amended Complaint, however, they failed to report the pendency of the petition for mandamus before the appellate court bearing on the dismissal by the Manila RTC of the complaint filed by the Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Public respondent’s dismissal of the Amended Complaint on the ground of forum shopping is thus in order.<br><br>This leaves it unnecessary to pass on the rest of the issues.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioners.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Tinga, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr.,  JJ., </span>concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio, J., </span>no part, member of Govt. and mentioned on pages 2 &amp; 3.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> pp. &nbsp;128, 160.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 129.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at &nbsp;230-231;&nbsp; Section 1, E.O. 55 as amended.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 231;&nbsp; Section 2, E.O. 55 as amended.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 132.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Now Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> p. 146.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The BNPP Committee shall be composed of the Secretary of Energy as Chairman, the Secretary of Finance as Vice-Chairman, and as members, the Secretary of Budget and Management, Secretary of Trade and Industry, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Solicitor General, President of the NPC and President of the Philippine National Oil Company &nbsp;(Sec. 2, E.O.
