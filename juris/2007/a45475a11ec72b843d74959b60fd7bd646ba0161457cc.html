The  Mandaluyong property was levied upon on July 9, 1981<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and sold in a public auction to petitioner as the highest bidder on October 4, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> No redemption was made; hence, petitioner consolidated her title to the property.  The final certificate of sale was issued on November 15, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Subsequently,  TCT No. (450666)-1702 was cancelled and a new certificate of title, TCT No. 242, was issued in her name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TCT No. 242 contained the liens annotated in TCT No. (450666)-1702, including a mortgage in favor of FGU Insurance Corporation (FGU) dated December 3, 1976<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and the April 22, 1977 writ of preliminary attachment (relative to Civil Case No. R-82-5792).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on March 4, 1986, the Manila RTC decided Civil Case No. R-82-5792 in favor of private respondents.  A writ of execution was then issued in their favor. To satisfy the Mendozas' judgment obligation, the Mandaluyong property was again levied upon and sold to private respondents as winning bidders in a public auction held on May 8, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The corresponding certificate of sale was issued to them on December 20, 1990<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and annotated on TCT No. 242.<br><br>On January 3, 1992, private respondents filed a motion in Civil Case No. R-82-5792 for the issuance of a final deed of sale, cancellation of TCT No. 242 and the issuance of a new title in their names.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The Manila RTC  granted the motion and ordered the cancellation of TCT No. 242 and the issuance of a new title in the names of private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, the Register of Deeds of Mandaluyong City, on February 6, 1992, cancelled TCT No. 242/T-2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and issued TCT No. 10107 in the names of private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  TCT No. 10107 also contained liens previously annotated on TCT No. (450666)-1702, including the mortgage in favor of FGU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioner appealed the August 30, 1994 order of the Manila RTC to the CA but the appellate court dismissed it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On May 15, 1995, petitioner filed this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Petitioner contends that the Manila RTC had no jurisdiction to order the cancellation of petitioner's title and issue a new one in the names of private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On July 12, 2001, this Court promulgated <span style="font-style: italic;">Looyuko et al. v. Court of Appeals</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  There, both petitioner and private respondents assailed the validity of the foreclosure proceedings which had been initiated in the meantime by FGU on the basis of the mortgage to it (FGU).  The mortgage was annotated on TCT No. (450666)-1702 and carried over to both TCT Nos. 242 and 10107. Both petitioner and private respondents charged that FGU's failure to implead them as parties nullified the foreclosure on the mortgage of the Mandaluyong property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Looyuko</span>, we upheld the validity of the foreclosure proceedings and declared that FGU held a lien superior to those of petitioner and private respondents. FGU had the mortgage annotated in its favor on December 3, 1976.  On the other hand, private respondents and petitioner were declared "prevailing parties" in their respective complaints against the Mendozas in 1980 (CFI Iloilo) and in 1986 (RTC Manila).  Hence, the effects of the 1988 execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in FGU's favor retroacted to 1976 when the mortgage was annotated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>FGU was indeed the rightful transferee of the Mandaluyong property, however, we recognize that petitioner and private respondents, as judgment creditors and junior lien holders, also had interests in the lot, though subordinate to that of FGU. When they purchased the same Mandaluyong property in separate public auctions, petitioner and private respondents acquired it subject to the encumbrances annotated on the TCT.  In effect, they acquired not the property itself but the equity of redemption. For this reason, we ordered the cancellation of private respondents' TCT No. 10107<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and the issuance of a new one in the name of FGU, subject to the equity of redemption of petitioner and private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Azcuna, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Court of Appeals and Judge Mariano N. de la Cruz, in his capacity as presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 22, were impleaded as respondents.

The mortgage was annotated on TCT No. (450666)-1702 on December 3, 1976.
