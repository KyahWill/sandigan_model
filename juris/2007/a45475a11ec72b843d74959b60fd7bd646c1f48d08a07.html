Palisoc), Chief of the Station Drug Enforcement Unit of the Malate Police, conducted on April 7, 2002 a surveillance in the Malate area to verify the report of the informant.<br><br>On April 11, 2002, SPO2 Manzano and PO1 Rivera reported to P/Insp. Palisoc that "Demet," whose real name is Herminio Buenaventura and a resident of 270 Daang Bakal St., Mandaluyong City, was indeed selling marijuana.<br><br>A buy-bust operation was thus scheduled on April 13, 2002. Two teams which were organized for the purpose prepared marked money in the total amount of P2,400 representing the cost of one brick of marijuana.  The money consisted of four P500 bills and four P100 bills, each of which was marked with "RP" on the left portion thereof.<br><br>The teams proceeded to the Mandaluyong Police Station to coordinate with the local police, after which they repaired to their target location at Daang Bakal St.<br><br>P/Insp. Palisoc, together with the informant, went to the house at 270 Daang Bakal St.  The other team members took strategic positions in the vicinity.<br><br>On seeing appellant in front of the house, P/Insp. Palisoc and the informant approached him. The informant then introduced appellant to P/Insp. Palisoc as the person interested to buy the "stuff."<br><br>On appellant's invitation, P/Insp. Palisoc and the informant went inside the house where appellant asked for the payment.<br><br>P/Insp. Palisoc thus gave the marked P2,400 to appellant who then took out one brick of marijuana from a black traveling bag which he gave to P/Insp. Palisoc, asking the latter to sniff it.<br><br>Convinced by its smell and texture that the brick was marijuana, P/Insp. Palisoc placed one hand inside his pocket and beeped his cellular phone which served as his pre-arranged signal to the other members of the teams.<br><br>P/Insp. Palisoc thereafter introduced himself as a police officer and arrested appellant.  The other members of the teams repaired to appellant's house, introduced themselves as police officers, and searched the premises where they recovered the black traveling bag which contained nine (9) bricks of marijuana.<br><br>After apprising appellant of his constitutional rights, the policemen searched his person from whom they recovered the marked P2,400.<br><br>The marijuana bricks were subjected to laboratory examination by Forensic Chemist Judycel A. Macapagal, the result of which is reflected in her report as follows:<br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>One (1) black travel[l]ing bag with markings "PS-9 HRB April 13, 2002" containing ten (10) bricks of suspected Marijuana fruiting tops with the following markings and recorded net weights:  <br></blockquote><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A  (HB-BB) - 879.488 grams</div></td><td><div align="justify">F (HB 5) - 918.844 grams</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">B   (HB 1) - 915.478 grams</div></td><td><div align="justify">G (HB 6) -  897.190 grams</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">C  (HB 2) - 771.174 grams</div></td><td><div align="justify">H (HB 7) -  893.382 grams</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">D  (HB 3) - 911.105 grams</div></td><td><div align="justify">I (HB 8) - 846.262 grams</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">E  (HB 4) - 914.801 grams</div></td><td><div align="justify">J (HB 9) - 809.622 grams</div></td></tr></tbody></table>                                                    TOTAL NET WEIGHT = 8,757.346 grams<br><blockquote>PURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:<br><br>To determine the presence of prohibited or regulated drug. x x x<br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated <u>specimen gave POSITIVE results to the tests for Marijuana, a prohibited drug</u>. x x x<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Specimen A through J contain Marijuana, a prohibited drug. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Upon the other hand, the defense proffered the following version:<br><br>On April 13, 2002, while one Rogelio delos Santos (Delos Santos) and barangay kagawad Edgar Ignacio (Ignacio) were conversing by the roadside of Daang Bakal St., they noticed a van and a sedan parked along the road.   Two men alighted from the van and approached them, asking them if they know a Demet Buenaventura.  Answering in the affirmative, Ignacio pointed to appellant who happened to be walking along the street on his way to the barangay hall.  The two men from the van thereafter approached appellant and asked him if he was Demet Buenaventura to which he answered in the affirmative.  Appellant was at once handcuffed and brought inside the van.<br><br>While inside the van, appellant asked the policemen inside why he was being arrested. One of them answered that someone pointed to him as an owner of marijuana, which appellant denied, he telling them that they could go to his house to prove that he had none.   The policemen thus repaired to his house.<br><br>Upon reaching appellant's house, the policemen knocked at the door but nobody answered, prompting one of the policemen to kick the door open after which all of them went inside.  Three of the policemen went upstairs, but after five to seven minutes, they went down empty-handed.<br><br>The policemen all left appellant's house and returned to the van.  Soon after they went inside the van, two men arrived carrying a black bag which they placed on the front seat.  One of the men in the van then pointed to appellant as the owner of the bag, which appellant denied.<br><br>Appellant was then blindfolded and his cellular phone, wallet and belt were taken from him. Afterwards, they all went to Precinct 9 of WPD Manila where he was detained.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of June 10, 2004, Branch 209 of the RTC of Mandaluyong City found appellant guilty of both charges, it holding that as between the straightforward and positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the bare and negative testimony of appellant, the former indubitably deserve greater weight and credence.<br><br>Before the Court of Appeals to which appellant assailed the trial court's decision, he raised the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT;<br><br></li><li><u>WHETHER OR NOT THE POLICE OFFICERS STATIONED IN MALATE HAS JURISDICTION TO ARREST ACCUSED APPELLANT IN MANDALUYONG WITHOUT WARRANT OF ARREST</u>.<br><br></li><li><u>WHETHER OR NOT THE ARREST OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT CONDUCTED WITHOUT WARRANT OF ARREST IS VALID</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of November 22, 2005, the appellate court affirmed that of the trial court in this wise:<br><blockquote>A perusal of the records show that <u>appellant failed to move for the quashal of the information</u> filed against him. Instead, he submitted himself before the Court, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of not guilty, gave his testimony in open court and presented the testimonies of other witnesses to corroborate his version of what happened. Appellant <u>cannot, therefore be permitted to raise such issue before this Court as there was a clear waiver of his objection to the validity of his arrest</u>.<br><br>The arrest made on appellant is valid notwithstanding the absence of a warrant of arrest.

Appellant sold and delivered the marijuana to P/Insp. Palisoc posing as buyer. It was seized and identified as a prohibited drug and subsequently presented as evidence.

The accused (appellant) even testified that it was the first time that he met the police officers and he was unaware of any reason as to why these police officers who arrested him would fabricate charges against him. Likewise, appellant has not filed and has no intention of filing any criminal or administrative case against the police officers.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Appellant was likewise charged of violation of Section 8 of RA 6425, as amended or illegal possession of prohibited drugs.

Considering the following testimony of P/Insp. Palisoc:<br><center><br>x x x x<br></center><blockquote>Q:  How did you know that that person who was there in front of the house was the subject of your operation?<br>A:  The subject was pointed to me by the Informant.

Palisoc, which was corroborated by the other members of the buy-bust teams, satisfactorily proves that a lawful buy-bust operation was conducted and that appellant is guilty of illegal sale of marijuana.<br><br>As to <b>illegal possession</b> of marijuana, <i>Abuan v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> enumerates its elements as follows:<br><blockquote>(a) the accused is in possession of the regulated drugs;<br><br>(b) the accused is fully and consciously aware of being in possession of the regulated drug; and<br><br>(c) the accused has no legal authority to possess the regulated drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>On the kind of possession and its evidentiary value, the same case of <i>Abuan</i> teaches:<br><blockquote>. . . Possession may be actual or constructive. In order to establish the constructive possession, the People must prove that petitioner had <u>dominion or control on either the substance or the premises where found</u>. The State must prove the adequate nexus between the accused and the prohibited substance. <u>Possession of dangerous drugs constitutes prima facie evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i> sufficient to convict an accused</u> in the absence of any satisfactory explanation of such possession. The burden of evidence is shifted to petitioner to explain the absence of <i>animus possidendi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The bricks of marijuana with a total weight of 7,877.858 grams were found in appellant's house over which he naturally had dominion and control.  The bricks were recovered from the bag from where he had earlier taken the one which he sold to poseur-buyer P/Insp. Palisoc.<br><br>Appellant, nevertheless, assails the validity of his arrest and the search on his person and his house at the time of his arrest.  <i>Apropos</i> is the following pronouncement in <i>People v. Bagsit</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x It is long settled that where the accused, by his voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the court, as shown by the counsel-assisted plea he entered during the arraignment and his active participation in the trial thereafter, voluntarily waives his constitutional protection against illegal arrests and searches. We have consistently ruled that any objection concerning the issuance or service of a warrant or a procedure in the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction over the person of the accused must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>As correctly observed by the appellate court, appellant failed to move for the quashal of the informations filed against him.  He instead submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court.  With the assistance of counsel, he entered a not guilty plea, and presented evidence in his defense. He thus clearly waived his objection to the validity of his arrest.<br><br>In any event, the warrantless arrest of appellant is justified under Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful</i>. - A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense.<br></blockquote>In another vein, appellant draws attention to the non-compliance by the apprehending police authorities with the following provision of R.A.  9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 21.</span> <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - <u>The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs</u>, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)  The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, <u>physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof</u>,   (Underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>The buy-bust operation took place on April 13, 2002 before R.A. 9165 took effect on July 4, 2002.  The above-quoted provision of R.A. 9165 does not thus apply to the case.  Necessarily, since the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency or PDEA was not yet established at the time, the provision calling for it to take charge and have custody of illegal drugs does not apply.<br><br>As for the arresting officers' conduct of the buy-bust operation outside their jurisdiction, the same may not be seriously questioned, they having coordinated with the Mandaluyong Police as shown by the Coordination Form<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> accomplished by the members of the Malate Police Station Drug Enforcement Unit.<br><br>Respecting appellant's claim that he was not informed of his constitutional rights at the time of his arrest, the same cannot prevail over P/Insp. Palisoc's following testimony:<br><blockquote>Q:  So what did you do as the poseur-buyer and the person who arrested him appears in this case [?] [<i>sic</i>]<br><br>A:  I apprised him his rights.<br><br>Q:  What were the rights that you appraised him?<br><br>A:  I told him that "you have the right to remain silent. Whatever you say will be used against you . . . You have the right to counsel of your own choice."<br><br>Q:  After informing of his rights what else did you and your companions do?<br><br>A:  He was searched by my man, Manzano. And Manzano was able to recover and the utilized the buy bust money [<i>sic</i>].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>P/Insp. Palisoc's declaration was corroborated by the other members of the apprehending teams who, in their Joint Affidavit of Apprehension,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> declared:<br><blockquote>That suspect HERMINIO BUENAVENTURA y RECTO was apprised of his Constitution Rights under the law which he understands and inform[ed of] the charges imputed against him but opted to remain silent. That subsequently he was brought to the WPD, Malate Police Station (PS9), Station Drug Enforcement Unit for investigation and proper disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>On appellant's claim that the bricks of marijuana were planted, the Court is unconvinced.  Frame-up is a defense that has been invariably viewed with disfavor, it being easily concocted and is a common standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>   Absent clear and convincing evidence of a frame-up, as in the present case, it must be rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Finally, given appellant's following testimony that he was not aware of any reason why the police officers would fabricate charges against him and  had no intention of filing administrative charges against the arresting officers, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>FISCAL TOBIAS: I am asking him if he is aware of any reason why these persons who apprehended him  should fabricate charges against him?<br><br>A :  None, Sir.<br><br>FISCAL TOBIAS: You don't know of any reason. If indeed your    allegation that you were not caught in possession of the drugs subject matter of the information as well as the allegation about the fact that you allegedly sold some marijuana to the poseur buyer in this case Police Inspector Roberto Palisoc, Jr. did you make any move  to charge these persons about this fabrication that they made against you?<br><br>ATTY. ARIAS  : Hypothetical, Your Honor.<br><br>A  :  No, Sir.<br><br>Q  :  You did not file any charges against these persons despite the gravity of the offense that they have fabricated against you?<br><br>A  :  No, Sir.<br><br>Q  :  Up to now?<br><br>A  :  Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q  :  Are you not intending to file any case against these persons who had deprived you of your liberty?<br><br>A  :  I don't have any intention to file a charge against them.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by the apprehending officers must remain.<br><br>On to the penalty to be imposed.  The unauthorized <u>sale</u> of 750 grams or more of marijuana carries with it the penalty of <b><i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death</b> and a fine ranging from Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000).  The unauthorized <u>possession</u> of 750 grams or more of marijuana carries the same penalty.<br><br>The trial court imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each of the offenses since neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances attended their commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The appellate court affirmed the penalty imposed.<br><br>In light of the enactment of R.A. No. 9346<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, the Court finds it unnecessary to still discuss the presence or absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances. The imposition of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is thus in order as is the amount of fines.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.<br><br>Costs against appellant, Herminio Buenaventura y Recto.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga,</i> and <i>Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 630-641.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Court of Appeals (CA) <i>rollo</i>, p. 35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 120-130.
