				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court for review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01387 which affirmed <i>in toto</i> the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 95, Quezon City (Special Criminal Court) in Criminal Case No. Q-94-58657-58 convicting appellant Roque G. Garalde<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention.<br><br>On September 9, 1994, Roque G. Garalde and Alma Tan Garalde were charged with Violation of Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition), as amended, before the RTC of Quezon City, Branch 79.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The case was docketed as Crim. Case No. Q-94-58657.  The accusatory portion of the Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 20<sup>th</sup> day of August 1994, in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in their possession and under their custody and control the following, to wit:  1) two (2) M16 rifles, one of which bearing serial no. RP146697 and the other has a defaced serial number; 2) two (2) rifle grenades; and 3) one hundred twenty five (125) rounds of ammunitions of M16 rifle, without first having obtained the proper license therefor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>They were also charged with kidnapping and serious illegal detention together with Kil Patrick Ibero and several unidentified persons before the same court, docketed as Crim. Case No. Q-94-58658. The accusatory portion of the Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about August 9, 1994 in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring together, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there by means of force, violence against and intimidation of person and at gunpoint, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously    kidnap, carry away and detain Paolo Bellosillo (13 years old), John Bellosillo (8 years old), and Niño Bellosillo (11 years old), who are minors, and Dianita Bebita, Janidy Dumagpi and Antonio Paquera against their will and consent, thus depriving them of their liberty, for the purpose of extorting ransom for their release, which, after payment thereof in the amount of P410,000.00 and two sets of jewelry, the kidnapped victims were released, and the accused divided the ransom money among themselves, to the damage and prejudice of the afore-named victims.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Alma Tan Garalde and Kil Patrick Ibero were tried before Branch 79 and were subsequently convicted.  Their conviction was affirmed <i>in toto</i> by this Court on December 14, 2000 in G.R. No. 128622.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant Garalde was tried separately, inasmuch as when he was arrested, the trial of the case against his co-accused was almost finished. He pleaded "not guilty" when arraigned, and the prosecution presented its evidence.  However, in view of the subsequent conviction of accused Alma Tan Garalde and Kil Patrick Ibero on December 27, 1996, Roque Garalde moved for the inhibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of Judge Godofredo Legaspi on the ground that he had already pre-judged the case. The presiding judge thus voluntarily inhibited<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> himself. The case was then re-raffled to Branch 95 of the Quezon City RTC. The presentation of the prosecution's evidence resumed.<br><center><br><b>The Case for the Prosecution</b><br></center><br>The prosecution presented the following witnesses: Dianita Bebita, Kathryn Bellosillo, Paolo Bellosillo, Supt. Michael Ray Aquino and SPO1 Berlin Cayabat.  The evidence for the People is summed up as follows:<br><br>At around 6:30 a.m. on August 9, 1994, Paolo (13 years old), Niï¿½o (11 years old) and John (8 years old), all surnamed Bellosillo, together with their <i>yayas</i> Dianita Bebita and Janilyn Dumagpi, and driver Antonio Paquera, left the Bellosillo residence at No. 45 Scout Limbaga Street, Quezon City on board a Toyota Lite Ace Van.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The children were on their way to school at the Ateneo de Manila University.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Not far from the Bellosillo residence, a taxicab hit the right front portion of the van.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Three men alighted from the taxi and approached the van.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  As Dianita opened the door, the men immediately went inside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  The appellant took the wheel and ordered Paquera to go to the middle seat, uttering "<i>Pasensya na kayo kailangan namin ang pera. Kaya ba ng amo ninyo ang</i> 10 million?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>   The appellant instructed Kil Patrick to blindfold the victims with masking tapes. Somebody said, "<i>Patahimikin mo nga iyan at bigyan mo ng spray</i>." All the victims felt dizzy afterwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  After three hours of travel, the group arrived at a"safehouse".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  The captives were asked to get off the van and were led to a room inside the house.<br><br>Meantime, that same day (August 9, 1994), Kathryn Bellosillo, the mother of Paul and John and Niño's aunt, was taking care of her daughter Mary Grace who was confined at a hospital. Between 6:45 and 7:00 a.m., she received a phone call from her brother-in-law Sonny Boy. He told her that a man had called the house and said something like, "<i>Hawak namin ang anak ninyo</i>."  Sonny Boy instructed her to call the principal of Ateneo.<br><br>Kathryn did as instructed and inquired if the boys (Bellosillo children) were in school, and she was told that they did not hear the early morning mass. She then requested the principal to keep the matter to himself, and to personally check if the boys were in their respective classrooms. After she was told that the boys were not there, Kathryn immediately went home, called her husband and told him what happened.  Her husband told her not to panic, and that he would call General Panfilo Lacson, then the head of Presidential Anti-Crime Commission (PACC).  A surveillance team was formed to assist the Bellosillos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the evening of August 9, 1994, a man called up the Bellosillo residence and looked for Sonny Boy.  Since he was not home, Kathryn volunteered to talk to the kidnappers.  The caller told her that all they needed was money. When Kathryn said that they did not have that amount, the caller replied, "<i>Pag hindi n'yo binigay ang pera, sasampulan namin kayo. Papatayin namin yoong driver, tapos yoong dalawang yaya, tapos yoong mga bata</i>."  A certain Mang Ernesto further made two or three calls a day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Kathryn told the kidnappers that the family could only raise P410,000.00 cash, plus jewelry valued at P80,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On August 11, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Janilyn Dumagpi was released to give a voice tape, where the Bellosillo children were heard pleading that money be given to their kidnappers so that they could be released.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Most of the victims were detained from August 9-18, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Dianita was released in the early morning of August 16, 1994.  She blindfolded herself and boarded a car together with other companions (which included the appellant). She was dropped off at the Labor Hospital in Katipunan Avenue, Quezon City. She removed her blindfold, and took a cab to the Bellosillo residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Dianita recalled that the men who were guarding them were armed with short and long firearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Food was brought in during the late afternoons, and the victims' blindfolds were removed only after five days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  She testified that she saw the appellant several times during their captivity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>At around 7:00 a.m. that day, "Mang Ernesto" had called the Bellosillo residence and instructed Kathryn to have <i>Yaya</i> Dianita deliver the ransom money to the East Avenue Hospital using their Lite Ace van.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The money and jewelry were placed in an envelope, which was then given to Dianita.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As instructed, Dianita drove the van to the East Avenue Medical Center. She parked inside the compound and left the engine running, moved to the backseat, put on a blindfold, and covered herself with a sweater.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  After a while, Dianita heard the door of the van being opened, and she asked "<i>Kayo na ba iyan?</i>" The kidnappers answered in the affirmative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  The group asked if the money was inside the van, and when they heard the positive response, the men boarded the van.  As the van started to move, the appellant took the envelope.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  The group continued to travel until they reached a "quiet place." Three men alighted, then the van moved again and eventually stopped at Novaliches. The rest of the group left, and instructed Dianita to wait as they would bring the children.  Dianita stayed inside the van and waited, but the children were not brought to her.  She then called the Bellosillo residence, and she was told to wait for their driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  One of the kidnappers called the Bellosillos to say, "<i>Hindi pa namin pwedeng isoli ang mga bata kasi kailangang siguraduhin namin na hindi kayo nag</i>-report <i>sa mga pulis.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The children, together with Paquera, were finally released on August 18, 1994, two days after the ransom money was given. The captives were dropped off at the highway in Novaliches; they took a cab and reached the Bellosillo residence at about 4:30 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The children told Kathryn, "Mommy, don't report the incident to the police because they know where we go to school. And they said that "<i>Pag nahuli kami ay pasasabugin namin ang bahay n'yo</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Paolo Bellosillo testified that he saw the appellant on the following occasions: on the day they were kidnapped before he took the driver's seat and before they were blindfolded;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> when the appellant interviewed him about his family, their jobs and the amount they were earning;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> when he was awakened by someone who was pulling his right foot;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> when his tummy was aching;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and one afternoon, while he was lying down and he was able to see through his blindfold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Meantime, PACC operatives led by Supt. Michael Ray Aquino had been conducting surveillance operations. His group saw the actual pay-off, but since the children were not released at the time, the culprits could not be immediately arrested. The PACC agents were later able to apprehend Nelson Lopez, Kil Patrick Ibero and Alma Tan Garalde, whom the victims positively identified as the culprits. The three were subsequently charged.  The appellant, however, was apprehended only on April 26, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><center><br><b>The Case for the Appellant</b><br></center><br>The appellant opted not to testify. He instead presented Police Major Wilfredo Reyes, then the Chief for Intelligence of Task Force Habagat, and was likewise one of the team leaders in the surveillance operations conducted during the negotiation phase and the payoff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  Reyes testified that he did not encounter the name of the appellant during the surveillance operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  The witness also testified that he was informed through radio that the actual payoff was made inside the UP Diliman Compound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><center><br><b>The Ruling of the RTC</b><br></center><br>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated September 22, 1998, the trial court acquitted the appellant in Crim. Case No. Q-94-58657 for illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions, but convicted him of kidnapping and serious illegal detention in Crim. Case No. Q- 94-58658.    The <i>fallo</i> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in the following:<br><ol><li>In Crim. Case No. Q-94-58657, for failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused on the ground that the firearms and ammunitions (Exhs. "F" to "J-2") are inadmissible in evidence, the Court finds the accused Roque Garalde y Gadbilao, NOT GUILTY of the offense of Violation of PD 1866, as amended by RA 8294 or for illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions and hereby ACQUITS him; and<br><br></li><li>In Crim. Case No. Q-94-58658, the Court finds the accused, Roque Garalde y Gadbilao, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention for the purpose of extorting ransom (kidnapping for ransom) defined in and penalized by Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH.  He is hereby ordered to return to Mrs. Kathryn Bellosillo the amount of P490,000.00 with legal rate of interest computed from the filing of the Information until fully paid and to indemnify the parents of the three (3) Bellosillo children the amounts of P500,000.00, as exemplary damages; and P500,000.00 as moral damages; and Dianita Bebita the amounts of P100,000.00, as exemplary damages; and P100,000.00, as moral damages; and to pay the amount of P50,000.00, as attorney's fees.<br></li></ol>The accused is ordered to pay the costs.<br><br>The firearms and ammunitions (Exhs "F" to "J-2") are hereby forfeited in favor of the government.  The Branch Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to safely deliver or cause the safe delivery of the firearms and ammunitions to the Philippine National Police for proper disposition.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC gave credence to the testimony of Paolo, who positively identified the appellant as one of the abductors.  According to the trial court, "minors do not usually fabricate stories." The trial court also relied on Dianita's testimony. On Major Reyes' testimony that the appellant's name never came up during the operations, the trial court held that this was not sufficient to belie the prosecution's evidence. It pointed out that the witness could not remember all the facts of the case; he was not involved in the actual operation; and he had been detained at the Quezon City jail on drug-related charges.  The court further found that since the testimony of Janilyn Dumagpi would be "merely corroborative and that the decisions of the courts are based not on the number of witnesses presented but on the quality of [their] testimonies," the fact that she was not presented did not affect the case for the prosecution.<br><br>On the charge of violating Section 1, P.D. No. 1866 as amended by Rep. Act No. 8294, the trial court opined that one of the witnesses for the application of the search warrant had no personal knowledge that firearms and ammunitions were stored in the house where they were found.  Even if the accused did not file any motion to quash the search warrant, the court was not precluded from determining its validity. Thus, on the ground that the requirements for the issuance of the search warrant were not strictly complied with, the trial court ruled that the firearms and ammunitions seized were inadmissible in evidence.<br><center><br><b>The Case on Appeal</b><br></center><br>On appeal before the CA, appellant raised the following errors:<br><blockquote>THE TRAIL (SIC) COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT RELYING PRIMARILY ON THE TESTIMONIES OF TWO PROSECUTION WITNESSES WHOSE TESTIMONIES ARE INCONSISTENT, INCREDULOUS AND REPLETE WITH INFIRMITIES.<br><br>THE ACCUSED WAS DEPRIVED OF COMPETENT REPRESENTATION DURING THE TRIAL PROPER AND HENCE, WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT UP A PROPER AND VIABLE DEFENSE WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO A VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>On November 29, 2005, the CA affirmed <i>in toto</i> the trial court's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The CA found the testimonies of Paolo Bellosillo and Dianita Bebita categorical, credible and straightforward. The inconsistencies pointed out by appellant were inconsequential, and did not affect the basic elements of the crime charged. The fact that the deciding judge was only a substitute one did not affect the conclusion of the trial court; a substitute judge can examine and evaluate the evidence already presented by the simple expedient of going over the transcripts of the testimonies of witnesses.<br><br>The appellate court likewise found unmeritorious the appellant's allegation that he was deprived of his right to due process upon the judge's failure to issue compulsory processes to guarantee the availability of the witnesses; the records show that subpoenas were issued as prayed for by the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  Lastly, the appellate court concluded that the appellant was duly accorded the opportunity to testify on his behalf, but opted not to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><center><br><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We affirm the appellant's conviction for kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>It is an established rule that factual findings of the trial court, including its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the probative weight thereof, as well as the conclusions of the trial court based on its factual findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect, especially if affirmed by the CA.  Unless it is shown that the trial court has overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated certain facts and circumstances which if considered would have altered the outcome of the case, appellate courts are bound by the findings of facts of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witnesses Paolo Bellosillo and Dianita Bebita positively identified the appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.

On the contrary, minor inconsistencies may even serve to strengthen the credibility of witnesses as they negate any suspicion that their testimonies are fabricated or rehearsed.  Even the  most candid of witnesses commit mistakes and make confused and inconsistent statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>  As held in <i>People v.

Witnesses cannot be expected to recollect with exactitude every minute detail of an event.  This is especially true when the witnesses testify as to facts which transpired in rapid succession, attended by flurry and excitement.  The testimony of each witness should not be expected to be identical to and coinciding with each other.  It is enough that the principal points covered by their testimonies are established although they do not dovetail in all details — which would even prove well-rehearsed and studied declarations ...<br></blockquote>Appellant further points out that the deciding judge was only a substitute judge; by the time the case was re-raffled to the deciding judge, Paolo and Dianita had already finished their testimonies, hence, the deciding judge was not able to observe their demeanor and deportment in court to be able to sufficiently gauge their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>This, too, is bereft of merit. The fact that the judge who penned the decision was not the judge who heard the testimonies of the witnesses is not enough reason to overturn the findings of fact of the trial court on their credibility. Though ideally a judge should hear all the testimonies personally, at times the reality is that a different judge might pen the decision because the predecessor judge has retired, died or has been reassigned.  In this situation, it cannot be assumed that the findings of fact of the judge who took over the case are not reliable and do not deserve the respect of the appellate courts.  Besides, the judge who did not hear the testimonies personally can always rely on the transcripts of stenographic notes taken during the trial. Such dependence does not violate substantive and procedural due process.  Indeed, the correctness of the decision is not impaired by the fact alone that the writer only took over from a colleague who had earlier presided at trial, unless there is a showing of grave abuse of discretion in the appreciation of factual findings reached by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Lastly, appellant claims that he was deprived of the opportunity to present a proper defense which is tantamount to a violation of his right to due process, as shown by the following: (1) he was deprived of effective and competent legal representation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (2) he was denied of his right to have compulsory processes to guarantee the availability of witnesses and the production of evidence on his behalf;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and (3) he was not sufficiently apprised of the consequences of his refusal to testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>We reiterate the following findings of the appellate court: the trial court judge issued two subpoenas to Nelson Lopez but the latter refused to sign; hence, a warrant for his arrest was issued; another subpoena was issued against Serapio Moresca but the same could not be served, thus, a bench warrant was issued against him; as to the subpoenas issued to Janidy Dumagpi and Antonio Paquero, the same remained unserved because they could not be located.  In view of the foregoing, the trial court indeed well performed its duties to issue the corresponding compulsory processes to compel appellant's witnesses to attend the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the appellant was duly accorded the opportunity to testify on his behalf.  The appellant was informed (by the judge and his own counsel) that in view of his refusal to testify on his behalf, the case would be decided based on the evidence submitted by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Yet, appellant still refused to testify.  Although the appellant's silence and refusal to testify cannot be construed as evidence of guilt, this Court has consistently held that the fact that an accused never testified in his defense even in the face of accusations against him goes against the principle that "the first impulse of an innocent man when accused of wrongdoing is to express his innocence at the first opportune time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, reads:<br><blockquote>ART. 267. <i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention</i>. — Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death:<br><ol><li>If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than three days.<br><br></li><li>If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.<br><br></li><li>If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained, or if threats to kill him shall have been made.<br><br></li><li>If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, except when the accused is any of the parents, female, or a public officer.<br></li></ol>The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.<br><br>When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed.<br></blockquote>Thus, for the accused to be convicted of kidnapping, the prosecution is burdened to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime: (a) the offender is a private individual; (b) he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (c) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (d) in the commission of the offense any of the following circumstances is present: (1) the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than three days; (2) it is committed by simulating public authority; (3) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or (4) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.  If the victim of kidnapping and serious illegal detention is a minor, the duration of his detention is immaterial. Likewise, if the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained for the purpose of extorting ransom, the duration of his detention is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>All of the above elements are attendant in the instant case:  appellant is a private individual who, along with his cohorts, kidnapped the three Bellosillos, the driver and the yayas on August 9, 1994 by taking control of their vehicle and detaining them in a secluded place; three of the five kidnap victims were minors; ransom was demanded from the family of the Bellosillo children; and the victims were detained for nine (9) days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>To warrant the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention for ransom, the prosecution must prove the following beyond reasonable doubt: (a) intent on the part of the accused to deprive the victim of his liberty; (b) actual deprivation of the victim of his liberty; and (c) motive of the accused, which is ransom for the victim or other person for the release of the victim.  The purpose of the offender in extorting ransom is a qualifying circumstance which may be proven by his words and overt acts before, during and after the kidnapping and detention of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Clearly, appellant demanded ransom in exchange for the liberty of the victims, and, in fact received the same. The CA did not therefore err in affirming the trial court's imposition of the penalty of death.  However, in view of the enactment of Republic Act (RA) No. 9346 on June 24, 2006 prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty of reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole should instead be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In a criminal case, an appeal to the Supreme Court throws the whole case open for review, and it becomes the duty of the Court to correct such errors as may be found in the appealed judgment, whether they are made the subject of assignment of error or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>  Hence, a review of the civil liabilities of the appellant, as found by the trial court and affirmed by the CA, is proper.<br><br>Appellant initially demanded P10,000,000.00 as ransom, but the Bellosillos were able to raise only P410,000.00 cash and P80,000.00 worth of jewelries. This ransom was actually received by the kidnappers.  The trial court thus properly awarded P490,000.00 as actual damages, plus legal interest from the filing of the information until full payment.<br><br>Under Article 2219 (5) of the New Civil Code, moral damages may be recovered in cases of illegal or arbitrary detention or arrest. It has been established that the appellant and his cohorts intentionally bumped the victims' vehicle; they forcibly entered the van; brought the victims to a safehouse; blindfolded them with packaging tapes; threatened them; and demanded ransom in exchange for the victims' freedom. The victims therefore suffered physical and psychological trauma because of their ordeal.  There is thus sufficient basis for the award of moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Considering that the Bellosillo children were minors at the time of the commission of the offense, moral damages amounting to P600,000.00 instead of P500,000.00 is proper, and another P100,000.00 for Dianita Bebita.<br><br>It is an established rule that an aggravating circumstance, whether ordinary or qualifying, entitles the offended party to exemplary damages within the meaning of Article 2230 of the New Civil Code.  There being a demand for ransom in this case, and by way of example or correction, the three (3) Bellosillo children and Dianita Bebita shall receive P100,000.00 each as award for exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>In view of the previous conviction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> of Kil Patrick Ibero as principal and Alma Tan Garalde as accomplice, they shall be held jointly and severally liable with appellant, with respect to the actual, moral and exemplary damages awarded in accordance with the provisions of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>  However, as accomplice, Alma Tan Garalde shall be solidarily liable only with respect to one-half of the total amount of damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>We, however, deem it proper to delete the P50,000.00 awarded by the trial court as and by way of attorney's fees, in view of its failure to state in the body of the decision the legal basis therefor.  The power of courts to grant damages and attorney's fees demands factual, legal and equitable justification, and cannot be left to speculation or conjecture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the Decision dated November 29, 2005 of the Court of Appeals finding appellant Roque G.
