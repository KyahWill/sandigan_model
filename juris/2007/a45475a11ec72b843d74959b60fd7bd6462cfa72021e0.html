				<BR><STRONG>CORONA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative case is a result of the audit conducted by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) of the books of account of Atty. Romulo V. Paredes, former clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court, Bangued, Abra, Branch 2, who compulsorily retired on July 18, 2003.  Because of the discrepancies discovered, a financial audit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> was also made on the books of account of Dennis S. Benedito and Samson T. Sanchez, the former and incumbent officers-in-charge/clerks of court, respectively, of the same court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The OCA, in its memorandum dated July 7, 2005, had the following findings: (1) there was a shortage of P34,000 in the fiduciary fund; (2) withdrawal slips bore only the signature of the clerk of court (without the corresponding signature of the Executive Judge Charito B. Gonzales or Presiding Judge Corpus B. Alzate)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and (3) University of the Philippines Law Center official receipts were issued for the different funds instead of Supreme Court receipts.<br><br>The OCA made the following recommendations:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OFFICE, OCA be DIRECTED</span>  to:<br><br><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">DEDUCT</span> the amount of <span style="font-weight: bold;">P34,000.00</span> from the retirement benefits of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Atty.

ALZATE be DIRECTED to EXPLAIN why he allowed </span>Mr. Sanchez to be the lone signatory of Fiduciary Fund Savings Account No. 1031-0015-32 with the LBP-Bangued, Abra Branch when he was the Executive Judge; and<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Executive Judge CHARITO B.

No. 8962146) for Criminal Case No. 1689 [(People) vs. Oandasan] was deposited on January 19, 1996.  It was first withdrawn on 6 August 1997 and again on 11 January 2002.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx                      xxx                      xxx<br></div><br></li><li>Collection of <span style="font-weight: bold;">P24,000.00</span> on 16 December 1998 (per O.R. No. 8051911) for Criminal Case No. 274 [(People) vs. Carlito Purisima] was deposited on the same day.  It was withdrawn for the first time on 26 March 2001 and again on 20 December 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Regarding the amount of P10,000, Paredes explained that the first withdrawal was made without a court order during the incumbency of former clerk of court Manuel T. Belarmino (who compulsorily retired on January 1, 2002) whom he replaced on August 27, 1997.  The second withdrawal, on the other hand, was supported by a court order dated January 3, 2002 and acknowledgement receipt dated January 11, 2002.<br><br>With respect to the amount of P24,000, Paredes stated that he authorized the first withdrawal and it was valid.  However, the second withdrawal was caused by his cash clerk at that time, Edgardo Balido (who retired on August 31, 2003), whom he entrusted with money collections, withdrawals and deposits.<br><br>The OCA found Paredes liable for simple neglect of duty.  It declared that Paredes could have easily discovered the erroneous first withdrawal of P10,000 had he thoroughly checked the supporting documents of the August 1997 fiduciary fund report <span style="font-style: italic;">which he signed</span>. According to the OCA, Paredes could not exculpate himself by pointing to his cash clerk and the trust and confidence he reposed on the latter. As the accountable officer and custodian of his court's funds, it was his duty to ensure the legitimacy of every financial transaction within his responsibility.<br><br>Thus, the OCA recommended that a fine in the amount of P5,000 be imposed on Paredes for simple neglect of duty and that he be ordered to restitute the total amount of P34,000 to be deducted from his retirement benefits.<br><br>We agree with the OCA's recommendations.<br><br>Public office is a public trust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  Those charged with the dispensation of justice, from the justices and judges to the lowliest clerks, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Not only must their conduct at all times be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, it must be beyond suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Clerks of court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties and premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> As such, they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard and physical plant manager thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, they are liable for any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of such funds and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Paredes was remiss in the performance of his duties as clerk of court with regard to financial concerns.  He should have corrected the mistake of his predecessor but he did not.  Likewise, the trust he reposed on his subordinate was not a valid defense.  It was his duty to see to it that his subordinates performed their functions properly.  These incidents clearly proved his neglect of duty.<br><br>His failure to properly supervise and manage the financial transactions in his court constituted simple neglect of duty.  Simple neglect of duty has been defined as the failure of an employee to give attention to a task expected of him and signifies a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Under Rule IV, Section 52(B) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, it is a less grave offense which carries a penalty of one month and one day to six months suspension for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Considering that Paredes compulsorily retired from the service on July 18, 2003, his penalty shall be, in lieu of suspension, a fine in the amount of P5,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Given that it was his first offense and following the Court's ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">In Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit Conducted in the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Koronadal City,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we deem this amount reasonable.<br><br>The Court cannot countenance neglect of duty for even simple neglect of duty lessens the people's confidence in the judiciary and ultimately in the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The other recommendations of the OCA with respect to acting clerk of court Sanchez, Presiding Judge Alzate and Executive Judge Gonzales are also well-taken.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> Atty. Romulo V. Paredes, former clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court of Bangued, Abra, Branch 2,  is hereby found <span style="font-weight: bold;">GUILTY</span> of simple neglect of duty. He is ordered to pay a <span style="font-weight: bold;">FINE</span> of P5,000, to be deducted from his retirement benefits. The amount of P34,000 shall also be deducted from his retirement benefits and remitted to Land Bank of the Philippines savings account no. 1031-0015-32 of the Regional Trial Court, Bangued, Abra, Branch 2.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Samson T.
