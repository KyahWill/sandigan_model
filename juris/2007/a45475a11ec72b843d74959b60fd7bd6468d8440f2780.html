Petitioner's May 9, 2005 Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> having been denied by Resolution of September 26, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> petitioner filed the present petition.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>Petitioner's remedy to challenge the appellate court's decision and resolution was to file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 on or before October 20, 2005 or 15 days after he received a copy of the appellate court's resolution on October 5, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>denying his motion for reconsideration.  Instead, petitioner chose to file the present petition under Rule 65 only on December 2, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> a good 58 days after he received the said resolution.<br><br><i>Certiorari</i> cannot be used as a substitute for lost appeal.  <i>Certiorari</i> lies only when there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.  Why the question being raised by petitioner, <i>i.e.</i>, whether the appellate court committed grave abuse of discretion, could not have been raised on appeal, no reason therefor has been advanced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>While this Court, in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the Rules of Court and in the interest of justice, has the discretion to treat a petition for <i>certiorari</i> as having been filed under Rule 45, especially if filed within the reglementary period under said Rule, it finds nothing in the present case to warrant a liberal application of the Rules, no justification having been proffered, as just stated, why the petition was filed beyond the reglementary period,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> especially considering that it is substantially just a replication of the petition earlier filed before the appellate court.<br><br>Technicality aside, the petition fails just the same.<br><br>The relevant provision of R.A. 8294 reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1.   Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1.  <i>Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition or Possession of Firearms or Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition</i>. " x x x.<br><br>"The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period and a fine of Thirty thousand pesos (P30,000) shall be imposed if the firearm is classified as high powered firearm which includes those with bores bigger in diameter than .38 caliber and 9 millimeter such as caliber .40, .41, .44, .45 and also lesser calibered firearms but considered powerful such as caliber .357 and caliber .22 center-fire magnum and other firearms with firing capability of full automatic and by burst of two or three:  <u><i>Provided, however,</i> That no other crime was committed by the person arrested.</u><br><br>"If homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.<br><br>"If the violation of this Section is in furtherance of or incident to, or in connection with the crime of rebellion or insurrection, sedition, or attempted coup d'etat, such violation shall be absorbed as an element of the crime of rebellion, or insurrection, sedition, or attempted coup d'etat.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The crux of the controversy lies in the interpretation of the underscored proviso. Petitioner, citing <i>Agote v. Lorenzo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <i>People v. Ladjaalam</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and other similar cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> contends that the mere filing of an information for gun ban violation against him necessarily bars his prosecution for illegal possession of firearm.  The Solicitor General contends otherwise on the basis of <i>Margarejo v. Hon. Escoses</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and <i>People v. Valdez</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In <i>Agote</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  this Court affirmed the accused's conviction for gun ban violation but exonerated him of the illegal possession of firearm charge because it "cannot but set aside petitioner's conviction in Criminal Case No. 96-149820 for illegal possession of firearm since another crime was <u>committed at the same time</u>, <i>i.e.</i>, violation of COMELEC Resolution No. 2826 or the Gun Ban."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  <i>Agote</i> is based on <i>Ladjaalam</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> where this Court held:<br><blockquote>x x x A simple reading [of RA 8294] shows that <u>if an unlicensed firearm is used in the commission of any crime, there can be no separate offense of simple illegal possession of firearms</u>.  Hence, if the "other crime" is murder or homicide, <u>illegal possession of firearms becomes merely an aggravating circumstance</u>, not a separate offense.  Since direct assault with multiple attempted homicide was committed in this case, appellant can no longer be held liable for illegal possession of firearms.<br><br>Moreover, penal laws are construed liberally in favor of the accused.  In this case, the plain meaning of RA 8294's simple language is most favorable to herein appellant.  Verily, no other interpretation is justified, for the language of the new law demonstrates the legislative intent to favor the accused.  Accordingly, appellant cannot be convicted of two separate offenses of illegal possession of firearms and direct assault with attempted homicide. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x The law is clear: the accused can be convicted of simple illegal possession of firearms, provided that "no other crime was committed by the person arrested."  If the intention of the law in the second paragraph were to refer only to homicide and murder, it should have expressly said so, as it did in the third paragraph.  Verily, where the law does not distinguish, neither should we.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>The law is indeed clear.  The accused can be convicted of illegal possession of firearms, provided no other crime was <u>committed</u> by the person arrested.  The word "committed" taken in its ordinary sense, and in light of the Constitutional presumption of innocence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> necessarily implies a prior determination of guilt by final conviction resulting from successful prosecution or voluntary admission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's reliance on <i>Agote, Ladjaalam, Evangelista, Garcia, Pangilinan, Almeida,</i> and <i>Bernal</i> is, therefore, misplaced.  In each one of these cases, the accused were exonerated of illegal possession of firearms because of their commission, <u>as shown by their conviction</u>, of some other crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  In the present case, however, petitioner has only been <u>accused of committing</u> a violation of the COMELEC gun ban.  As accusation is not synonymous with guilt, there is yet no showing that petitioner did in fact commit the other crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Consequently, the proviso does not yet apply.<br><br>More applicable is <i>Margarejo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> where, as stated earlier, this Court  affirmed the denial of a motion to quash an information for illegal possession of firearm on the ground that "the other offense charged [<i>i.e.</i>, violation of gun ban] x x x is not one of those enumerated under R.A. 8294 x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> in consonance with the earlier pronouncement in <i>Valdez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> that "all pending cases involving illegal possession of firearm should continue to be prosecuted and tried if no other crimes expressly indicated in Republic Act No. 8294 are involved x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In sum, when the other offense involved is one of those enumerated under R.A. 8294, any information for illegal possession of firearm should be quashed because the illegal possession of firearm would have to be tried together with such other offense, either considered as an aggravating circumstance in murder or homicide,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or absorbed as an element of rebellion, insurrection, sedition or attempted <i>coup d'etat</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  Conversely, when the other offense involved is not one of those enumerated under R.A. 8294, then the separate case for illegal possession of firearm should continue to be prosecuted.<br><br>Finally, as a general rule, the remedy of an accused from the denial of his motion to quash is for him to go to trial on the merits, and if an adverse decision is rendered, to appeal therefrom in the manner authorized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  Although the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> may be availed of in case there is a grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the appellate court correctly dismissed the petition as that vitiating error is not attendant in the present case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Carpio, Tinga,</i> and <i>Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Quisumbing, (Chairperson),</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>CA <i>rollo</i> at 99-103.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup><i>Id</i>. at 149.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>Rules and Regulations on: (A) Bearing, Carrying or Transporting Firearms or Other Deadly Weapons; (B) Security Personnel or Bodyguards; (C) Bearing Arms By Any Member of Security or Police Organization of Government Agencies and Other Similar Organization; (D) Organization or Maintenance of Reaction Forces During the Election Period in Connection with the May 10, 2004, Synchronized National and Local Elections.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> An Act Amending the Provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as Amended, entitled "CODIFYING THE LAWS ON ILLEGAL/UNLAWFUL POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE, DEALING IN, ACQUISITION OR DISTRIBUTION OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITIONS, OR EXPLOSIVES OR INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF FIREARMS, AMMUNITIONS OR EXPLOSIVES AND IMPOSING STIFFER PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN VIOLATIONS THEREOF AND FOR RELEVANT PURPOSES."
