Standards of due process; requirements of notice.-<br><blockquote>I. For termination of employment based on just causes as defined in Article 282 of the Code:<br><br>(a) A written notice served on the employee specifying the ground or grounds for termination, and giving to said employee reasonable opportunity within which to explain his side;<br><br>(b) A hearing or conference during which the employee concerned, with the assistance of counsel if the employee so desires, is given opportunity to respond to the charge, present his evidence or rebut the evidence presented against him; and<br><br>(c) A written notice of termination served on the employee indicating that upon due consideration of all the circumstances, grounds have been established to justify his termination xxx.</blockquote>It is the view of PLDT that in the dismissal of employees for strike-related violence, it is sufficient to merely declare the latter to have lost their employment without having to comply with any procedure for their termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>PLDT is mistaken. &nbsp;Art. 277 (b) in relation to Art. 264 (a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and (e)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> recognizes the right to due process of all workers, without distinction as to the cause of their termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> &nbsp;Where no distinction is given, none is construed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> &nbsp;Hence, the foregoing standards of due process apply to the termination of employment of Suico, et al. even if the cause therefor was their supposed involvement &nbsp;in &nbsp;strike-related &nbsp;violence &nbsp;prohibited &nbsp;under &nbsp;Art. &nbsp;264 (a) &nbsp;and (e).<br><br>Moreover, the procedure for termination prescribed under Art. 277(b) and Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V is supplemented by existing company policy. &nbsp;Art. 277(b) &nbsp;provides that the procedure for termination prescribed therein is without prejudice to the adoption by the employer of company policy on the matter, provided this conforms with the guidelines set by the DOLE such as Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V. &nbsp;This is consistent with the established principle that employers are allowed, under the broad concept of management prerogative, to adopt company policies that regulate all aspects of personnel administration including the dismissal and recall of workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Company policies or practices are binding on the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> &nbsp;Some can ripen into an obligation on the part of the employer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> such as those which confer benefits on employees <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> or regulate the procedures and requirements for their termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> &nbsp;Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company</span> (BLTB) <span style="font-style: italic;">v.

No. 163793, while it is true that Systems Practice No. 94-016 relates to administrative cases, PLDT failed to prove that a termination proceeding arising from strike-related violence is not an administrative case. &nbsp;If by administrative case, PLDT refers to cases arising from violation of company rules and regulations, then the proceedings against Suico, et al. were of that nature for the notices sent to said employees accused them not just of breach of Art. 264 of the Labor Code but also of behavior prejudicial to company operations and violative of the company code of conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> &nbsp;The termination proceedings against Suico, et al. were therefore administrative in nature, subject to the requirements of Systems Practice No. 94-016.<br><br>To repeat, the requirements of due process by which to test the &nbsp;validity of the procedure adopted by PLDT in dismissing Suico, et al. are&nbsp; those embodied in Art. 277 (b) of the Labor Code, Rule XXII of the Implementing Rules of Book V and&nbsp; Systems Practice No. 94-016.<br><br>Apparently, PLDT complied with the two-notice requirement of due process. &nbsp;The first notices sent to Suico, et al. set out in detail the nature and circumstances of the violations imputed to them, required them to explain their side and expressly warned them of the possibility of their dismissal should their explanation be found wanting.&nbsp; The last notices informed Suico, et al. of the decision to terminate their employment and cited the evidence upon which the decision was based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; These two notices would have sufficed had it not been for the existence of Systems Practice No. 94-016.&nbsp; Under Systems Practice No. 94-016, PLDT granted its employee the alternative of either filing a written answer to the charges or requesting for opportunity to be heard and defend himself with the assistance of his counsel or union representative, if he so desires.<br><br>Suico, et al. exercised their option under Systems Practice No. 94-016 by requesting that a formal hearing be conducted and that they be given copies of sworn statements and other pertinent documents to enable them to prepare for the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> &nbsp;This option is part of their right to due process.&nbsp; PLDT is bound to comply with the Systems Practice.<br><br>Yet, instead of respecting the option exercised by Suico, et al., PLDT in G.R. No. 146762 arbitrarily disregarded the same and insisted that Suico, et al. submit their written answers first before their request for formal hearing can be entertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> &nbsp;In G.R. No. 153584 and G.R. No. 163793, PLDT straightaway declared Mariano and Borje to have waived the right to be heard and, based on the available evidence, decided the cases against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> &nbsp;Clearly, such refusal by PLDT to conduct a hearing was unreasonable and arbitrary as it defeated the exercise by Suico, et al. of an option which, by virtue of Systems Practice No. 94-016, was a component of their right to due process. &nbsp;The impairment of their option constituted an impairment of their right to due process.<br><br>All told, the procedure adopted by PLDT in dismissing Suico, et al. fell short of the requirements of due process.<br><br>It should be emphasized, however, that, consistent with our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Agabon</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the procedural deficiency in the dismissal of Suico, et al. did not affect the validity or effectivity of the dismissal as the substantive bases thereof &nbsp;were never put in issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> &nbsp;Thus, the April 12, 2002 CA Decision in G.R. No. 163793 was erroneous as it declared the dismissal of Borje illegal merely for failure of PLDT to observe due process. &nbsp;The CA should have affirmed the validity of the dismissal of Borje and awarded him nominal damages for the impairment of his statutory right to due process.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span>&nbsp; the petitions in G.R.
