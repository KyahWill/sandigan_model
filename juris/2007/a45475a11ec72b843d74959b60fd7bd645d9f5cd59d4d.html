The property is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 160988.<br><br>Sometime in 1993, some 44 farmers who occupied portions of the property filed petitions in the DAR, seeking to be declared as owners- beneficiaries. On December 20, 1994, the DAR issued a Notice of Coverage under the CARP over the property.&nbsp; For his part, respondent, in behalf of the co-owners, filed an Application for Exclusion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in the form of a letter dated May 10, 1995, through Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer (PARO) Durante L. Ubeda. To substantiate his request to exclude their landholding from CARP coverage under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms</span> ruling, respondent declared that their property had been exclusively used for livestock-raising for several years prior to June 15, 1988. According to the applicants, they had 400 heads of cattle, 5 horses, and 25 carabaos in the landholding and -<br><blockquote>Our private landholding has been devoted and actually used for cattle and/or&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;livestock raising, together with raising of carabaos, and horses continuously from the time it was owned by our predecessors-in-interest, Emiterio Florido, and even when we acquired title over the property in 1979, we continually devoted and actually used the said landholding for cattle raising from 1979 up to the present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>On May 10, 1995, the Provincial Task Force on Exclusion led by Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) Belen T.

Dalugdug dated July 18, 1995, requesting for a reinvestigation of the Report of PARO Ubeda. This request was reiterated in an August 11, 1995 letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> where the applicants requested, for the first time, the exclusion of another parcel of land - 22.2639 ha and covered by TCT No. T-11948 - which is contiguous to the 349.9996-ha lot covered by their earlier application.<br><br>On August 14, 1995, the Regional Director issued an Order affirming the findings and recommendation of PARO Ubeda. &nbsp;Respondent and his co-owners appealed the order to the DAR Secretary on August 28, 1995. They argued that the properties have been devoted to livestock-raising even prior to 1977. Thus, the landholdings should be excluded from CARP coverage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> &nbsp;They further argued that for purposes of determining the area for exclusion under A.O. No. 9, the entire number of livestock should be credited in applying the ratio of one head to one hectare. Considering that the landholdings totaled only 370 ha and there are 429 heads of livestock, they have more than complied with A.O. No. 9, Series of 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On March 15, 1996, the DAR issued an Order suspending the processing and issuance of Certificates of Land Ownership Awards to the farmers-beneficiaries of the landholding covered by TCT No. 160988 pending the resolution of the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On October 7, 1996, the DAR issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> partially granting the application for exclusion. It held that, in accordance with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms</span> ruling and A.O. No. 9, private agricultural lands are considered excluded from the CARP if already devoted to livestock, poultry, and swine-raising as of June 15, 1988. According to the DAR, this means that the livestock must have been in the area at the time the law took effect. &nbsp;Since the Certificates of Ownership of Large Cattle were issued only on May 12 to 29, 1995, only those livestock which are seven years of age or more can be presumed to be within the area as of June 15, 1988. Consequently, following the animal to land ratio provided in A.O. No. 9 for 134 cattle and 28 horses and carabaos, only 162 ha should be exempted from CARP coverage.<br><br>The DAR also ruled that additional exemptions include 12.50 ha for infrastructure (following the ratio 21 heads for every 1.7815 ha) and 45 ha for retention of nine landowners, for a total of 219.50 ha. The dispositive portion of the Order reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, Order is hereby issued:<br><ol><li>GRANTING the instant application for exclusion/exemption from CARP coverage pursuant to Administrative Order No. 09 Series [o]f 1993 but only with respect to a total of TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT FIFTY (219.50) hectares. The remainder of ONE HUNDRED THIRTY POINT FOUR NINE NINE SIX (130.4996) hectares are hereby placed under CARP coverage;</li><li>Directing the MARO/PARO concerned to cause the survey of the entire area for purposes of segregating the areas which are covered from those which are excluded.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 15, 1996, the applicants appealed the order to the OP via an Appeal with Prayer for Status Quo/Stay of Execution.&nbsp; The case was docketed as OP Case No. 98-D-8316.<br><br>On April 13, 1998, the President, through then Deputy Executive Secretary Renato C. Corona (now a member of the Court), rendered a decision dismissing the appeal for lack of merit, as follows:<br><blockquote>The language of DAR Administrative Order No. 09 appears to be quite explicit: "Private agricultural lands or portions thereof exclusively, directly and actually used for livestock, poultry and swine raising as of 15 June 1988 shall be excluded from the coverage of CARP."&nbsp; By simple reading, it is obvious that the livestock, poultry and swine, in order to be included in the computation of the area to be exempted from CARP coverage, should have been existing in the area sought to be exempted at the time of the effectivity of RA 6657, which is June 15, 1988.&nbsp; Thus, in ascertaining the animal/land ratio, the age of the cattle should be reckoned with.&nbsp; From the certification of the Municipal Treasurer of San Andres, Quezon, it appears that only 134 of the 434 cattles are found to be at least seven years of age.&nbsp; Accordingly, only 162 hectares (134 for the cattle and 28 for the horses and carabaos) are exempted from CARP coverage following the one hectare per one head of cattle ratio provided under the same administrative order.&nbsp; This, of course, does not include the retention area of the appellants-landowners and the area reserved for the infrastructures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent and his co-owners filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated May 21, 1998 of the decision. In an Order dated September 15, 1998 signed by the then Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora, by authority of the President, the appeal was denied for being devoid of substantial merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>However, on October 5, 1998, then Chief Presidential Legal Adviser Harriet Demetriou submitted the following Memorandum to the President:<br><blockquote>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For total exemption:</span><br><br>Administrative Order No. 9 provides that the maximum ratio in determining areas to be exempted is one head to one hectare "regardless of age."<br><br>Hence, if Administrative Order No. 9 does not distinguish, neither should we.<br><br>The use of age as a reference when not so required is arbitrary and very dangerous because it would then variably depend on the arbitrary decision of the DAR on when to conduct an inspection, and this is no fault of the landowner.&nbsp; Thus, the more recent the inspection is made, the higher the age requirement will be just to reckon the animals' existence from 15 June 1988.&nbsp; The ultimate result is that an owner will never be able to augment his herd, or replace lost or deceased livestock, after 1988, which is absurd and an undue limitation of property rights.<br><br>The arbitrary use of age to determine the number of head of livestock as of 15 June 1988 is based on an unwieldy theory that the business of raising livestock involves a fixed number of head of livestock.&nbsp; At any rate, Mr. Uy's land admittedly has always been devoted to livestock.&nbsp; Therefore, there should be no apprehension that the land was merely converted to circumvent the application of the CARL.&nbsp; Hence, in the absence of collusion or intent to circumvent the law, the number of heads of livestock should be counted as of the date of inspection.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>Finally, we would like to inform the following that the dispute is pending resolution before the Office of the President to which the case was elevated.&nbsp; Hence, the case also merits the opinion of Hon.

Autea, issued an Order denying the October 19, 1998 second motion for reconsideration for being a prohibited pleading and for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Citing Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership v.

Consequently, the appellate court declared that in order to determine the area for exclusion, the counting of livestock should be, as stated in the administrative order, "regardless of age" during actual inspection. &nbsp;The appellate court concluded that all 434 heads of cattle present in the subject property should have been considered in determining the exempt area used for livestock raising.<br><br>On June 21, 2004, the DAR, represented by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the appellate court's amended decision. It reiterated that the pronouncement by this Court that "the law only requires that for exemption of CARP to apply, the subject landholding should be devoted to cattle-raising as of June 15, 1988" is not entirely correct, for the law requires that it be <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusively, directly and actually used for livestock as of June 15, 1988</span>. Under A.O. No. 9, Series of 1993, two conditions must be established:  <br><blockquote>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">1)</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">It must be shown that the subject landholding wa<span style="font-weight: bold;">s EXCLUSIVELY, DIRECTLY AND ACTUALLY</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">used for livestock, poultry or swine on or before June 15, 1988; and</span></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>2)</td><td> <div align="justify">The farm must satisfy the ratios of land to livestock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>It must be shown that the entire landholding, and not just portions of it, should be devoted to livestock raising.&nbsp; The words "regardless of age" in the order should be interpreted to mean only those heads of cattle existing as of June 15, 1988.&nbsp; Accordingly, the ratio of land to livestock should be based on <span style="font-weight: bold;">those livestock found existing in the landholding at the time R.A. No. 6657 took effect on June 15, 1988.</span> This is consistent with the intent of the law to prevent fraudulent declaration of areas actually, directly and exclusively used for livestock as well as to protect the rights of agrarian beneficiaries therein.<br><br>It was not proven that the entire landholding was exclusively used for livestock as of June 15, 1988.&nbsp; In fact, the ocular inspection of the property conducted by the Provincial Task Force on Exclusion reported that about 20 ha were planted with coconuts.&nbsp; It also revealed that the topography is flat and undulated, and that 44 farmers-beneficiaries occupied portions of the said landholding.&nbsp; On these bases alone, it is hard to imagine how the said landholding could have been "exclusively, directly and actually used for livestock as of June 15, 1988."<br><br>Moreover, out of the 434 heads of cattle found in the subject landholding as of May 1995, only 134 heads of cattle and 28 horses and carabaos could have been present in the subject landholding. This is based on the finding that only 134 heads of cattle were 7 years and older, and, consequently, were the only ones that could have existed as of June 15, 1988. Hence, they could not be made as basis for the computation of the areas qualified for exclusion, for to do so would clearly violate the first condition that the heads of cattle must be in existence as of June 15, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The appellate court was not persuaded and resolved to deny, for lack of merit, the motion for the reconsideration of its amended decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The DAR, now the petitioner, filed the instant petition for review, alleging that the appellate court erred as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div>IT GAVE DUE COURSE AND GRANTED RESPONDENTï¿½S [DR.

No. 9, Series of 1993 should be reckoned from June 15, 1988, or from the date of inspection.<br><br>On the first issue, petitioner claims that, under the OP Rules of Procedure, specifically the second paragraph of Section 7, A.O. No. 18, Series of 1987, only one motion for reconsideration is allowed except in meritorious cases. &nbsp;Hence, the period to file the petition for review had already expired 15 days after the denial of the first motion for reconsideration. &nbsp;Petitioner insists that the filing of the second motion for reconsideration is of no consequence since the OP had already concluded that the case was "not exceptionally meritorious to justify additional motions for reconsiderations."<br><br>On the second issue, petitioner contends that in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms</span> case, the entire property therein was devoted to livestock and poultry prior to June 15, 1988; in the present case, only a minimal portion of the property involved is so devoted. &nbsp;It further insists that the report of the Task Force on Exclusion revealed that 20 ha are planted with coconut trees while undetermined portions are occupied by 44 farmers-beneficiaries. &nbsp;Thus, the 20 ha planted with coconuts were not intended for cattle grazing, neither do they serve the purpose of shade and fodder for the bovines. &nbsp;The presence of farmers-beneficiaries who tend to the trees indicates that respondent is also engaged in the coconut industry, belying the fact that the entire 349.9996 ha is exclusively devoted to livestock-raising. Petitioner further claims that <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms</span> was a corporation engaged in the livestock and poultry business even before 1988. On the other hand, respondent did not present any business permit or articles of incorporation to prove that the entire 349.9996 ha is devoted to the livestock business.<br><br>Petitioner further avers that it had received reports that A.O. No. 9 was issued to prescribe the rules for exclusion of the land used for livestock production. Petitioner posits that the order is curative in nature and retroactive in application; and the phrase "regardless of age" refers to heads of cattle in the year 1988 and not during actual inspection. &nbsp;Petitioner argues that if the phrase were to be given any other meaning, landowners could easily fill their land with livestock and apply for exemption, defeating the purpose of agrarian reform. &nbsp;Thus, during actual inspection, the headcount should be based on the existence of the animals in 1988 through available records; if there be none, then the tallying must be done according to the age of the animals alive at that time.<br><br>By way of Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> respondent maintains that Section 7 of A.O. No. 18, Series of 1987 does not totally rule out a second motion for reconsideration; the governing principle in the resolution of the case is its merits. Citing a plethora of cases, he avers that substantial justice should overrule rules of procedure. Respondent further points out that even his predecessor-in-interest was engaged in the business of livestock raising on the landholding. This livestock business was evident during the ocular inspection of the Task Force on Exclusion. &nbsp;Contrary to petitioner's claim, he <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> have a business permit, and the absence of the articles of incorporation is irrelevant because no corporate personality is involved here.<br><br>Respondent further asserts that the 20 ha planted with coconut trees is a minimal part of the 349.9996 ha. &nbsp;The diminutive size of the area is in keeping with the purpose of providing shade to the animals and the young leaves used as fodder when grasses are scarce during dry weather.&nbsp; Respondent also asserts that the DAR interpretation of the phrase "regardless of age" referring to the year 1988 is an "amendment under the guise of interpretation." He emphasized that since the law does not distinguish, petitioner should not distinguish. He argues that the DAR interpretation falls short of acceptability even on practical considerations, because in the business of raising livestock, the inventory is never fixed at any given time especially for long periods, i.e., seven years. It constantly changes either due to natural causes prevalent in the business or the interplay of market forces or the peace and order condition within the area.<br><br>The petition is partially granted.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Land Car, Inc. v.

Hence, "where the circumstances of a case do not show an intent on the part of the movant merely to delay the proceedings, our Court has refused to characterize the motion as simply pro forma." x x x<br><br>We note finally that because the doctrine relating to <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma </span>motions for reconsideration impacts upon the reality and substance of the statutory right of appeal, that doctrine should be applied reasonably, rather than literally. The right to appeal, where it exists, is an important and valuable right. Public policy would be better served by according the appellate court an effective opportunity to review the decision of the trial court on the merits, rather than by aborting the right to appeal by a literal application of the procedural rules relating to<span style="font-style: italic;"> pro forma</span> motions for reconsideration.<br></blockquote>Respondent certainly did not intend to delay the proceedings here; in fact, it would adversely affect his cause if he were to delay his appeal to the regular courts because he would certainly lose vast tracts of land which are integral elements of his trade. &nbsp;In this case, not only was a second motion for reconsideration allowed by the OP rules, more importantly, the OP decision and the order denying the first motion for reconsideration failed to provide its basis in law. The ends of justice would have been served if the OP decision did more than copy the DAR order and turned toward the important issues presented before it.<br><br>In any event, even if we considered the second motion for reconsideration as <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> or not "exceptionally meritorious," the argument of petitioner would still be untenable. It is settled that rules of procedure are, as a matter of course, construed liberally in proceedings before administrative bodies. Thus, technical rules of procedure imposed in judicial proceedings are unavailing in cases before administrative bodies. &nbsp;Administrative bodies are not bound by the technical niceties of law and procedure and the rules obtaining in the courts of law. &nbsp;Rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very rigid and technical manner, as they are used only to help secure and not to override substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>It bears stressing that the threshold substantive issue is the validity and implementation of DAR Administrative Order No. 9, Series of 1993 on the respondent's landholding of more or less 472 ha in light of the ruling of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Department of Agrarian Reform v. Sutton,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> where DAR Administrative Order No. 9, Series of 1993 was declared unconstitutional.<br><blockquote>The fundamental rule in administrative law is that, <span style="font-style: italic;">to be valid, administrative rules and regulations</span> must be issued by authority of law and <span style="font-style: italic;">must not contravene the provisions of the Constitution</span>. The rule-making power of an administrative agency may not be used to abridge the authority given to it by Congress or by the Constitution. <span style="font-style: italic;">Nor can it be used&nbsp; to enlarge the power of the administrative agency beyond the scope intended. Constitutional and statutory provisions control with respect to what rules and regulations may be promulgated by administrative agencies and the scope of their regulations.</span><br><br>In the case at bar, we find that the impugned A.O. is invalid as it contravenes the Constitution. The A.O. sought to regulate livestock farms by including them in the coverage of agrarian reform and prescribing a maximum retention limit for their ownership. However, <span style="font-style: italic;">the deliberations of the 1987 Constitutional Commission show a clear intent to exclude, inter alia, all lands exclusively devoted to livestock, swine and poultry-raising. </span>The Court clarified in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms</span> case that livestock, swine and poultry-raising are industrial activities and do not fall within the definition of "agriculture" or "agricultural activity." The raising of livestock, swine and poultry is different from crop or tree farming. It is an industrial, not an agricultural, activity. A great portion of the investment in this enterprise is in the form of industrial fixed assets, such as: animal housing structures and facilities, drainage, waterers and blowers, feedmill with grinders, mixers, conveyors, exhausts and generators, extensive warehousing facilities for feeds and other supplies, anti-pollution equipment like bio-gas and digester plants augmented by lagoons and concrete ponds, deepwells, elevated water tanks, pumphouses, sprayers, and other technological appurtenances.<br><br>Clearly, petitioner <span style="font-style: italic;">DAR has no power to regulate livestock farms which have been exempted by the Constitution from the coverage of agrarian reform</span>. It has exceeded its power in issuing the assailed A.O.<br><br>The subsequent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Natalia Realty, Inc. v. DAR</span> reiterated our ruling in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms</span> case. In Natalia Realty, the Court held that industrial, commercial and residential lands are not covered by the CARL. We stressed anew that<span style="font-style: italic;"> while Section 4 of R.A. No. 6657 provides that the CARL shall cover all public and private agricultural lands, the term "agricultural land" does not include lands classified as mineral, forest, residential, commercial or industrial.</span> Thus, in Natalia Realty, even portions of the Antipolo Hills Subdivision, which are <span style="font-style: italic;">arable yet still undeveloped,</span> could not be considered as agricultural lands subject to agrarian reform as these lots were already classified as residential lands.<br><br>A similar logical deduction should be followed in the case at bar. Lands devoted to raising of livestock, poultry and swine have been classified as industrial, not agricultural, lands and thus exempt from agrarian reform. Petitioner DAR argues that, in issuing the impugned A.O. it was seeking to address the reports it has received that some unscrupulous landowners have been converting their agricultural lands to livestock farms to avoid their coverage by the agrarian reform. Again, we find neither merit nor logic in this contention. The <span style="font-style: italic;">undesirable scenario which petitioner seeks to prevent with the issuance of the A.O. clearly does not apply in this case.</span> Respondents' family acquired their landholdings as early as 1948. They have long been in the business of breeding cattle in Masbate which is popularly known as the cattle-breeding capital of the Philippines. Petitioner DAR does not dispute this fact. Indeed, there is no evidence on record that respondents have just recently engaged in or converted to the business of breeding cattle after the enactment of the CARL that may lead one to suspect that respondents intended to evade its coverage. It must be stressed that what the CARL prohibits is the <span style="font-style: italic;">conversion of agricultural lands for non-agricultural purposes after the effectivity of the CARL. There has been no change of business interest in the case of respondents.</span><br><br>Moreover, it is a fundamental rule of statutory construction that the reenactment of a statute by Congress without substantial change is an implied legislative approval and adoption of the previous law. On the other hand, by making a new law, Congress seeks to supersede an earlier one. In the case at bar, after the passage of the 1988 CARL, Congress enacted R.A. No. 7881 which amended certain provisions of the CARL. Specifically, the <span style="font-style: italic;">new law changed the definition of the terms "agricultural activity" and "commercial farming" by dropping from its coverage lands that are devoted to commercial livestock, poultry and swine-raising</span>. <span style="font-style: italic;">With this significant modification, Congress clearly sought to align the provisions of our agrarian laws with the intent of the 1987 Constitutional Commission to exclude livestock farms from the coverage of agrarian reform.</span><br><br>In sum, it is doctrinal that rules of administrative bodies must be in harmony with the provisions of the Constitution. They cannot amend or extend the Constitution. To be valid, they must conform to and be consistent with the Constitution. In case of conflict between an administrative order and the provisions of the Constitution, the latter prevails. The assailed A.O. of petitioner DAR was properly stricken down as unconstitutional as it enlarges the coverage of agrarian reform beyond the scope intended by the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>The Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> of MARO Babalcon clearly declared that 346 ha are used for grazing of the 429 heads of livestock; and indicated that the density required on commercial farming as far as the number of livestock is concerned was satisfied. &nbsp;This was confirmed in the DAR Order stating that the land has been devoted to livestock-raising since its acquisition in 1979, and that the 20 ha planted with coconut trees are simultaneously used as pasture land. These facts are borne by the records and undisputed by the parties. The courts generally accord great respect, if not finality, to factual findings of administrative agencies because of their special knowledge and expertise over matters falling under their jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>It is not uncommon for an enormous landholding to be intermittently planted with trees, and this would not necessarily detract it from the purpose of livestock farming and be immediately considered as an agricultural land. &nbsp;It would be surprising if there were no trees on the land. &nbsp;Also, petitioner did not adduce any proof to show that the coconut trees were planted by respondent and used for agricultural business or were already existing when the land was purchased in 1979. In the present case, the area planted with coconut trees bears an insignificant value to the area used for the cattle and other livestock-raising, including the infrastructure needed for the business. &nbsp;There can be no presumption, other than that the "coconut area" is indeed used for shade and to augment the supply of fodder during the warm months; any other use would be only be incidental to livestock farming. The substantial quantity of livestock heads could only mean that respondent is engaged in farming for this purpose. The single conclusion gathered here is that the land is entirely devoted to livestock farming and exempted from the CARP.<br><br>This Court's ruling in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Farms </span>case and <span style="font-style: italic;">Natalia Realty, Inc. v.
