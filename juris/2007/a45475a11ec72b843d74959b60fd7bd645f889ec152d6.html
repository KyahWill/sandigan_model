				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a Complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 94-70655 for replevin and damages filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch XVIII, by respondent BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc. (BPI) against petitioners Rodelio and Alicia Poltan, BPI alleged that on 11 November 1991, the petitioners obtained a loan evidenced by a promissory note<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> from Mantrade Development Corporation (Mantrade) secured by a chattel mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> over a 1-unit Nissan Sentra Motor Vehicle, more particularly described as follows:<br><br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="31%">ONE (1) </td> <td width="69%">N.

The petitioners defaulted in complying with the terms and conditions of the promissory note and chattel mortgage when they failed to pay five consecutive monthly installments which fell due on 15 January 1994 up to 15 May 1994. BPI demanded<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> from the petitioners the whole balance of the promissory note in the amount of P286,540.06, including accrued interest, or to return to BPI the possession of the motor vehicle for the purpose of foreclosure in accordance with the undertaking stated in the chattel mortgage. Petitioners failed and refused to heed said demand. It is specifically provided in the promissory note and chattel mortgage that failure to pay any installment when due shall make the subsequent installments and the entire balance of the obligation due and payable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> BPI, in its complaint, further prayed for the award of attorney's fees, liquidated damages and other expenses incurred in connection with the petitioners' failure to pay their balance on the loan.<br><br>In their Answer to the Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the petitioners did not deny that they purchased the vehicle from Mantrade on installment and the same loan was subsequently assigned to BPI. They disclosed that BPI required them to obtain a motor vehicle insurance policy from FGU Insurance Corporation (FGU Insurance). They had been religiously paying the monthly installments on the vehicle until it figured in an accident where it became a total wreck. Under the terms of the insurance policy from FGU Insurance, the vehicle had to be replaced or its value paid to them. Due to the failure and refusal of FGU Insurance to replace the vehicle or pay its value, the petitioners stopped the payment of the monthly installment.<br><br>On the date agreed upon by the parties for the pre-trial of the case, the petitioners failed to appear. Upon motion of BPI, the petitioners were declared as in default and BPI was allowed to present its evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which the trial court granted in its Order, dated 27 February 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> When the pre-trial conference was terminated, the trial court set the case for hearing on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> BPI then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings contending that the answer of the petitioners failed to tender an issue and admitted the material allegations in the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This was opposed by the petitioners who argued that though they did not specifically deny their outstanding obligation, the amount due was in the form of damages that must be proven by competent and admissible evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated 14 June 1995, the trial court granted the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by BPI and held:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendants to pay, jointly and    severally, the plaintiff the sum of P286,540.06 with penalty charges thereon for late payment at the rate of 36% per annum from May 28, 1994, until fully paid, and attorney's fees in the sum of P10,000.00, plus the costs of this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals. In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated 19 May 1997, the Court of Appeals acted favorably on the appeal of the petitioners, set aside the RTC Decision and remanded the case to the trial court for trial on the merits.<br><br>On remand, the schedules of hearing of the case as set by the trial court were postponed for several times. The hearing was finally set on 10 January 2000. Again, petitioners, as well as their counsel, failed to appear despite due notice and without just cause. Thus, BPI was allowed to present its evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> on 10 January 2000. The trial court then rendered its Decision on 6 April 2000 and held -<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, the plaintiff the sum of P286,340.00 with penalty charges thereon for late payment at the rate of 36% per annum from May 20, 1994, until fully paid, and attorney's fees in an amount equivalent to 25% of the sum due, plus the costs of this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved by the Decision, petitioners again appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In a Decision, dated 30 June 2004, the Court of Appeals denied the appeal and affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> the Decision of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition filed by the petitioners where they raise the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol><li>WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITIONERS HAD BEEN UNJUSTLY DEPRIVED BY THE TRIAL COURT <span style="font-style: italic;">A QUO</span> AND THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL AND SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS OF LAW WHEN THE TRIAL COURT, MOVED BY AN UNFAIR ATTITUDE OF DISCRIMINATION AND UNFAIRNESS, SUDDENLY ALLOWED THE BPI TO PRESENT EVIDENCE EX PARTE ON JANUARY 11, 2000 - THUS, TOTALLY ELIMINATING THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE PETITIONERS POLTAN TO BE HEARD - SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR FORMER LAWYER ATTY.

At the hearing scheduled on 10 January 2000 where the petitioners were absent and where BPI was allowed to present evidence<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex-parte</span>, both parties were given notice that the hearing of the case was scheduled on that date. Specifically, the petitioners were notified through their representative Rizaldy Impi of the scheduled hearing on 10 January 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This notwithstanding, the petitioners failed to appear. Lest it be forgotten, the case was previously decided based on judgment on the pleadings and the same was elevated to the Court of Appeals which resolved to remand the case to the trial court for further hearing. After the remand of the case, the same was initially set for hearing on 25 January 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This was postponed upon motion of the counsel of the petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> who moved that the same be reset to 22 February 1999 which the trial court granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The petitioners were <span style="font-style: italic;">again</span> absent on the latter date and they were notified that the hearing was reset to 19 April 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The hearing scheduled on 19 April 1999 was again reset to 17 May 1999 upon their motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  Upon agreement of both parties, the hearing scheduled on 17 May 1999 was reset to 5 July 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  Similarly, both parties again agreed to reset the scheduled hearing of 5 July 1999 to 23 August 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  Then again, the 23 August 1999 schedule was reset to 11 October 1999, likewise, upon agreement of both parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> All these negate the claim of denial of due process. The petitioners were given more than ample opportunity to be heard through counsel. The claim of denial of due process is clearly without basis. What the fundamental law prohibits is total absence of opportunity to be heard. When a party has been afforded opportunity to present his side, he cannot feign denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Admittedly, there was a hearing conducted without the presence of the petitioners on 10 January 2000, and BPI was allowed to present evidence<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex-parte</span>. BPI adduced in evidence the following:<br><blockquote>EXHIBIT A &amp; B - Promissory Note and Chattel Mortgage<br><br>A-1 - Signature of the defendants;<br><br>A-3 - Acceleration clause to prove the obligation;<br><br>A-4 - Stipulation on Attorney's fees;<br><br>C - Deed of Assignment;<br><br>D - Demand Letter;<br><br>E - Statement of Account to prove the obligation of the defendants as of the time of the filing of this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Relative to the fourth and fifth issues raised by the petitioners on the matter of whether the counsel of BPI had adequate authority to represent BPI at the time of the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> presentation of evidence in view of the earlier withdrawal of the said counsel, while it may be true that the counsel of BPI filed before the trial court a notice of withdrawal of appearance on 27 December 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the same was not acted upon by the trial court. Instead, the withdrawal of appearance of BPI's counsel was "approved and noted on 31 January 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Therefore, undoubtedly, when the said former counsel of BPI conducted the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> presentation of evidence on 11 January 2000, he still had authority to do so.<br><br>Anent the sixth issue relating to the contract signed by the petitioners being in the nature of a contract of adhesion, the accepted rule is that a contract of adhesion is not <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> inefficacious.<br><br>A contract of adhesion is defined as one in which one of the parties imposes a ready-made form of contract, which the other party may accept or reject, but which the latter cannot modify. One party prepares the stipulation in the contract, while the other party merely affixes his signature or his "adhesion" thereto, giving no room for negotiation and depriving the latter of the opportunity to bargain on equal footing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Contracts of adhesion wherein one party imposes a ready-made form of contract on the other are not entirely prohibited. The one who adheres to the contract is in reality free to reject it entirely; if he adheres, he gives his consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> A contract of adhesion is just as binding as ordinary contracts. It is true that this Court had, on occasion, struck down such contracts as being assailable when the weaker party is left with no choice by the dominant bargaining party and is thus completely deprived of the opportunity to bargain effectively. Nevertheless, contracts of adhesion are not prohibited even as the courts remain careful in scrutinizing the factual circumstances underlying each case to determine the respective claims of contending parties on their efficacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The petitioners failed to show that they were under duress or forced to sign the loan documents. They were presumed to have signed the assailed documents with full knowledge of their import.<br><br>As held in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee v. Court of Appeals,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> it is presumed that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The natural presumption is that one does not sign a document without first informing himself of its contents and consequences. The petitioners obtained a loan evidenced by a promissory note. They admit that they obtained the loan and the due execution of the promissory note. They also admit the due execution of the chattel mortgage and the deed of assignment in favor of BPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>We also resolve the seventh issue raised by petitioners in the negative. The petitioners failed to show any provision in the insurance policy or mortgage contract providing that the loss of the mortgaged vehicle extinguishes their principal obligation to BPI.  Similarly, the petitioners' contention that their obligation had been extinguished because of the provision in the contract that the proceeds of the insurance policy is for the benefit of the mortgagee is, likewise, unacceptable.<br><br>As very well expressed by the Court of Appeals, while it is true that the proceeds from the insurance policy over the mortgaged chattel is for the benefit of BPI,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> this will result in partial or full satisfaction of the obligation only if the insurer pays the mortgagee, BPI, or if the insurance proceeds were paid to BPI. In the case at bar, upon the loss of the vehicle due to total wreck, the petitioners filed a claim under the insurance policy, collected and received the proceeds thereof,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> but did not settle their obligation with BPI which remained outstanding despite the loss of the vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Upon the views we have laid, we find that the obligation of the petitioners has been adequately proven, and that it has not been extinguished.<br><br>We now hew to the issue of the award of damages.<br><br>The trial court, in conformity with the terms of the promissory note, awarded to BPI the amount of P286,340.00 with penalty charges thereon for late payment at the rate of 36% per annum from May 20, 1994, until fully paid, and attorney's fees in an amount equivalent to 25% of the amount due, plus the costs of this suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This award was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In certain cases, a stipulated penalty may be reduced by the courts. This is sanctioned by Article 1229 of the Civil Code, which states:<br><blockquote>Art. 1229. The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable.<br></blockquote>Equity dictates that we review the amounts of the award, considering the excessive interest rate and the too onerous penalty and the resulting excessive attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>We underscore the pronouncement of this Court in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ruiz v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> regarding interest rates:<br><blockquote>We affirm the ruling of the appellate court, striking down as invalid the 10% compounded monthly interest, the 10% surcharge per month stipulated in the promissory notes dated May 23, 1995 and December 1, 1995, and the 1% compounded monthly interest stipulated in the promissory note dated April 21, 1995. The legal rate of interest of 12% per annum shall apply after the maturity dates of the notes until full payment of the entire amount due. Also, the only permissible rate of surcharge is 1% per month, without compounding. We also uphold the award of the appellate court of attorney's fees, the amount of which having been reasonably reduced from the stipulated 25% (in the March 22, 1995 promissory note) and 10% (in the other three promissory notes) of the entire amount due, to a fixed amount of P50,000.00. However, we equitably reduce the 3% per month or 36% per annum interest present in all four (4) promissory notes to 1% per month or 12% per annum interest.<br><br>The foregoing rates of interests and surcharges are in accord with <span style="font-style: italic;">Medel vs. Court of Appeals</span> [299 SCRA 481], Garcia vs. Court of Appeals [167 SCRA 815], <span style="font-style: italic;">Bautista vs. Pilar Development Corporation </span>[312 SCRA 611], and the recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Spouses Solangon vs. Salazar</span> G.R. No. 125944, 29 June 2001]. This Court invalidated a stipulated 5.5% per month or 66% per annum interest on a P500,000.00 loan in Medel and a 6% per month or 72% per annum interest on a P60,000.00 loan in <span style="font-style: italic;">Solangon</span> for being excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable and exorbitant. In both cases, we reduced the interest rate to 12% per annum. We held that while the Usury Law has been suspended by Central Bank Circular No. 905, s. 1982, effective on January 1, 1983, and parties to a loan agreement have been given wide latitude to agree on any interest rate, still stipulated interest rates are illegal if they are unconscionable. Nothing in the said circular grants lenders carte blanche authority to raise interest rates to levels which will either enslave their borrowers or lead to a hemorrhaging of their assets. On the other hand, in B<span style="font-style: italic;">autista vs. Pilar Development Corp</span>., this Court upheld the validity of a 21% per annum interest on a P142,326.43 loan, and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia vs. Court of Appeals,</span> sustained the agreement of the parties to a 24% per annum interest on an P8,649,250.00 loan. It is on the basis of these cases that we reduce the 36% per annum interest to 12%. An interest of 12% per annum is deemed fair and reasonable. While it is true that this Court invalidated a much higher interest rate of 66% per annum in <span style="font-style: italic;">Medel </span>and 72% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Solangon </span>it has sustained the validity of a much lower interest rate of 21% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bautista </span>and 24% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia</span>. We still find the 36% per annum interest rate in the case at bar to be substantially greater than those upheld by this Court in the two (2) aforecited cases.<br></blockquote>The courts shall reduce equitably liquidated damages,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> whether intended as an indemnity or a penalty, if they are iniquitous or unconscionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The question of whether a penalty is reasonable or iniquitous is addressed to the sound discretion of the courts. To be considered in fixing the amount of penalty are factors such as - but not limited to - the type, extent and purpose of the penalty; the nature of the obligation; the mode of the breach and its consequences; the supervening realities; the standing and relationship of the parties; and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Applying settled jurisprudence in this case, we find that the interest stipulated upon by the parties in the promissory note at the rate of 36% is iniquitous and unconscionable.  Consequently, an interest of 12% per annum and an attorney's fees of P50,000.00 is deemed reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> premises considered, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 30 June 2004, affirming the Decision of trial court, dated 14 June 1995, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> with the modification that the interest rate be reduced to 12% per annum from 24 May 1994 until fully paid, and the award of attorney's fees be reduced to P50,000.00.
