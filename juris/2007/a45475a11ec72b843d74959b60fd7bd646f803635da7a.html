TCT No. T-12368 emanated from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. I-3423 which was issued on January 11, 1936 based on a homestead patent issued on December 18, 1935. On the other hand, TCT No. T-65348 was derived from TCT No. T-36200-A which cancelled OCT No. I-2965.&nbsp; OCT No. I-2965 was issued on May 27, 1935 on the basis of a homestead patent issued on June 27, 1935.<br><br>Subsequently, the 7.8262-hectare lot covered by TCT No. T-12368 was transferred to and registered in the name of petitioner Vic A.

Giving credence to petitioner Taguinod's contention that she and petitioner Aguila are the direct heirs of the original patentees or homesteaders of the subject lots, and pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 141 or the Public Land Act, the OP held that the subject lots are exempt from the coverage of PD 27, citing <i>Alita v.

It pointed out that it was only on August 13, 1959 or after 24 years from the issuance of the homestead patent that OCT No. I-3423 was cancelled and TCT No. T-12368 was issued in the name of Salud Aguila.&nbsp; But petitioner Aguila never adduced evidence on how and under what circumstances landowner Salud Aguila acquired the property, and whether she was indeed a compulsory heir of the original homestead patentee.<br><br>Likewise, the CA found that petitioner Taguinod never adduced evidence to prove that the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348, which she claimed she inherited from her biological mother, was inherited from the original homestead patentee of whom she and her biological mother are direct compulsory heirs.&nbsp; Moreover, the appellate court pointed out that while it is true that the Office of the Register of Deeds of Isabela was burned on December 4, 1976, still, petitioner Taguinod could have easily secured a certified true copy of the homestead patent from the Bureau of Lands or a certified true copy of the Owner's Duplicate of said title under the name of her biological mother or the original patentee as owner of said property.&nbsp; Petitioner Taguinod did not do so.&nbsp; Furthermore, the CA found that the records belie petitioner Taguinod's claims as TCT No. T-65348 in the name of Salud Aguila did not show any encumbrance or lien.&nbsp; In fact, the CA found that petitioner Taguinod never showed any evidence that she indeed redeemed or repurchased the subject lot from Salud Aguila.<br><br><i>In fine,</i> the CA concluded that the only evidence on record was that the subject lots were covered by homestead patents, but no shred of evidence on record showed who the patentees were and that petitioners are the direct compulsory heirs of the original patentees in order to preclude the subject lots from the coverage of the OLT program pursuant to PD 27.<br><br>Unconvinced, petitioners interposed a Motion for Reconsideration and Manifestation to Terminate Services of Counsel of Record<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of said Decision where they terminated and changed their counsel <i>de officio</i> on the ground of lack of communication and concern over the instant case, and in seeking reconsideration, they contended, <i>inter alia</i>, that the homestead patentees of the subject lots were Salud Aguila, their adoptive mother, and Patrocinia Alvarez, the biological mother of petitioner Taguinod.<br><br>Finding no merit in petitioners' plea for recall of the assailed Decision, it was rejected through the assailed August 7, 2002 CA Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Thus, this petition is before us.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Issues</b><br></div><br>Petitioners present the following issues for consideration: <blockquote><ol type="A"> <li>The Honorable Court of Appeals acted in gross violation of the well entrenched jurisprudential principle that <u>factual findings of <i>quasi-judicial</i> bodies or tribunals are binding on the appellate court if based on substantial evidence</u> when it reversed and set aside the decision of the Office of the President and when it affirmed the Order of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform dated January 6, 1993 on ground [sic] that petitioners allegedly failed to prove by substantial evidence that:&nbsp;

Thus, it is the appellate court which must determine if substantial evidence is extant on record to support the findings of fact of the quasi-judicial bodies.&nbsp; Such review is however guided by the long-settled doctrine that factual findings of administrative officials and agencies who have acquired expertise in the performance of their official duties and the exercise of their primary jurisdiction are generally accorded not only respect but at times, even finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>A close review of the DAR's findings of fact, starting from the August 3, 1990 PARO Order, the August 21, 1991 Order of the DAR Region 02 Regional Director, and the September 28, 1992 and January 6, 1993 Orders of the DAR Secretary vis-à-vis the January 1, 1995 Decision of the OP, however reveals a glaring disparity in the findings of fact.&nbsp; This is a clear exception to the rule that findings of fact of the quasi-judicial body are generally maintained.&nbsp; In view of the conspicuous divergence in the findings of fact, the CA is duty bound to review and ascertain which of said findings are duly supported by substantial evidence.<br><br><b>No substantial evidence to show ownership through homestead patent</b><br><br>Settled in this jurisdiction is the rule that the rights of a holder of a homestead patent are superior over the rights of the tenants guaranteed by the Agrarian Reform Law, as enunciated in <i>Alita</i>: <blockquote> We agree with the petitioners in saying that P.D. 27 decreeing the emancipation of tenants from the bondage of the soil and transferring to them ownership of the land they till is a sweeping social legislation, a remedial measure promulgated pursuant to the social justice precepts of the Constitution.&nbsp; However, such contention cannot be invoked to defeat the very purpose of the enactment of the Public Land Act or Commonwealth Act No. 141.&nbsp; Thus, <blockquote> "The Homestead Act has been enacted for the welfare and protection of the poor.&nbsp; The law gives a needy citizen a piece of land where he may build a modest house for himself and family and plant what is necessary for subsistence and for the satisfaction of life's other needs.&nbsp; The right of the citizens to their homes and to the things necessary for their subsistence is as vital as the right to life itself.&nbsp; They have a right to live with a certain degree of comfort as x x x human beings, and the State which looks after the welfare of the people's happiness is under a duty to safeguard the satisfaction of this vital right."&nbsp; (Patricio v. Bayog, 112 SCRA 45)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </blockquote></blockquote> It is therefore incumbent upon petitioners to identify substantial evidence on record to support the OP's finding that their lots are excluded from the coverage of Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.<br><br>A comparison of the findings of fact of the OP and CA in relation to the evidence extant on record leads the Court to conclude that the findings of the OP are not propped up by substantial evidence.<br><br>The OP held that TCT No. T-90872 in the name of petitioner Aguila was issued cancelling TCT No. T-12368 in the name of Salud Aguila, which came from OCT No. I-3423, being a derivative of OCT No. I-2423.&nbsp; Such finding was not borne out by the records.<br><br>OCT No. I-2423 was issued on December 18, 1935 based on a homestead patent.&nbsp; If that was the original title over the 7.8262-hectare lot, then why was there a need to have another title, OCT No. I-3423, issued on January 11, 1936?&nbsp; Why was OCT No. I-3423 not indicated in the most recent TCT No. T-90872?<br><br>If Salud Aguila was the original homestead patentee, as now alleged by petitioners, why was there a need to cancel OCT No. I-2423 issued on December 18, 1935 and have TCT No. T-12368 issued on August 13, 1959, also in her name?&nbsp; This is incongruous to say the least.&nbsp; No explanation was given.&nbsp; We agree with the CA that OCT No. I-2423 was cancelled when Salud Aguila acquired the subject property on August 13, 1959 or 24 years after the issuance of the OCT.<br><br>In fact, as aptly put by private respondents, petitioners never averred before the DAR and OP that Salud Aguila was the original homestead patentee of OCT No. I-2423 and that petitioner Aguila is a direct compulsory heir of the homestead patentee to whom OCT No. I-2423 was issued.&nbsp; Without any substantial evidence that would show that petitioner Aguila or Salud Aguila was entitled to the exemption pursuant to the homestead laws, the lot now covered by TCT No. T-90872 is indubitably under the coverage of the OLT of the government pursuant to PD 27.<br><br>Anent the 2.6234-hectare lot covered by TCT No. T-65348, the OP held that it was issued on March 1, 1973 in the name of Salud Aguila pursuant to a deed of absolute sale between Salud Aguila and petitioner Taguinod, cancelling TCT No. T-36200-A in the name of petitioner Taguinod.&nbsp; TCT No. T-36200-A is allegedly the derivative of OCT No. I-2965 issued on June 27, 1935 pursuant to a homestead patent.&nbsp; This finding of fact by the OP, while based on the records, does not support the conclusion that petitioner Taguinod is entitled to protection by the homestead laws.<br><br>Verily, the records do not show who the original homestead patentee was and whether petitioner Taguinod is a direct compulsory heir of the homestead patentee.&nbsp; Petitioners contend that the original patentee was one Patrocinia Alvarez, the biological mother of petitioner Taguinod.&nbsp; This again was not borne out by the records.<br><br>While petitioners presented a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Lands Management Bureau on April 19, 1993, purportedly attesting that Lot No. 655 (lot covered by TCT No. T-65348 is a portion of Lot No. 655) was covered by Homestead Application No. 112012 and issued a patent on June 3, 1935 in the name of Patrocinia Alvarez, still, it will not afford relief to petitioner Taguinod as there were no other available records of said pre-World War II patent application.&nbsp; Her position is untenable for the following reasons:<br><br>First, she is not the owner on record of the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348, which is in the name of landowner Salud Aguila.<br><br>Second, if indeed it was mortgaged to landowner Salud Aguila through a <i>pacto de retro</i> contract of sale, the mortgage encumbrance was not reflected in TCT No. T-65348.<br><br>Third, no deed of such alleged mortgage was presented.<br><br>Fourth, her alleged ownership pursuant to a <i>pacto de retro</i> sale is belied by the evidence on record that the transfer of the subject lot to Salud Aguila was through an absolute deed of sale as borne by the certification in Tax Declaration No. 13081 under the name of Salud Aguila.&nbsp; The certification in Tax Declaration No. 13081 attests, thus: <blockquote> Transferred by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale of a portion of the whole lot executed by Josephine A. Taguinod in favor of Salud A. de Aguila and ratified before Emilio R. Gombao-Notary Public as per Do. No. 18 Page No. 5, Book 8; Series of 1971.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 240px;">SGD.

Transfer of ownership after October 21, 1972, except to the actual tenant-farmer tiller.&nbsp; If transferred to him, the cost should be that prescribed by Presidential Decree No. 27.<br><br>Moreover, the DAR Secretary likewise issued MC No. 8, series of 1974, dated April 1, 1974, which repealed or modified MC Nos. 2 and 2-A, and other circulars or memoranda inconsistent with it, pertinently providing that: <blockquote> 4. No act shall be done to undermine or subvert the intent and provisions of Presidential Decrees, Letters of Instructions, Memoranda and Directives, such as the following and/or similar acts:<br><br>x x x x <blockquote> f)&nbsp;<b>Transferring ownership to tenanted rice and/or corn lands after October 21, 1972, except to the actual tenant-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farmers or tillers</b> but in strict conformity to the provisions of &nbsp; Presidential Decree No. 27 and the requirements of the DAR.</blockquote> </blockquote></blockquote> Based on the above provisos, it is indubitable that the transfer by Salud Aguila of the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-90872 (<i>vice</i> TCT No. T-12368) was clearly in violation of the above cited Memoranda.&nbsp; Consequently, the transfer is null and void, and the ownership reverts to Salud Aguila.<br><br>On the other hand, the acquisition by Salud Aguila, through an absolute sale of the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-36200-A for which TCT No. T-65348 was subsequently issued on March 15, 1973 in her name, was made sometime in 1971, per certification in Tax Declaration No. 13081.&nbsp; Consequently, landowner Salud Aguila was the owner of the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348 when PD 27 was issued.&nbsp; Clearly then, from the foregoing facts, Salud Aguila was the owner of record of the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348 when the OLT pursuant to PD 27 was implemented.&nbsp; And, as discussed above, no substantial evidence was presented except petitioner Taguinod's bare allegations that she had redeemed or repurchased the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348; therefore, it is Salud Aguila who owns the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348.<br><br>Further, even granting <i>arguendo</i> that the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-65348 had been repurchased or redeemed by petitioner Taguinod, such transfer is likewise null and void for being similarly violative of DAR MC Nos. 2 and 2-A, series of 1973, and MC No. 8, series of 1974.<br><br>Thus, the DAR Regional Director and DAR Secretary correctly ruled that the alleged and apparent transfers of the subject lots to petitioners were null and void for violation of the pertinent DAR MCs in order to evade, undermine, and circumvent the intent of PD 27 and pertinent statutory and administrative issuances related to it.<br><br><b>Salud Aguila not entitled to retention rights over the subject lots</b><br><br>The next question to answer is whether landowner Salud Aguila is entitled to retention under PD 27.&nbsp; The DAR Regional Director held so, but this was reversed by the DAR Secretary.<br><br>The DAR Secretary took cognizance of the Certification presented by private respondents from the Municipal Assessor of Santiago, Isabela regarding Salud Aguila's ownership of a total of 13 landholdings, including the subject lots covered by TCT Nos. T-90872 and T-65348, with the corresponding copies of Tax Declarations covering said properties.&nbsp; This fact was never contested by petitioners, and it unquestionably shows that Salud Aguila cannot be granted retention over the subject lots pursuant to LOI No. 474 dated October 21, 1976.<br><br>LOI No. 474 mandates the DAR Secretary to "undertake to place under the Land Transfer Program of the Government pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27, all tenanted rice/corn lands with areas of seven (7) hectares or less belonging to landowners who own other agricultural lands of more than seven (7) hectares in aggregate areas or lands used for residential, commercial, industrial or other urban purposes from which they derive adequate income to support themselves and their families."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Considering her other eleven (11) landholdings and the application of LOI No. 474, we agree with the DAR Secretary and CA's holding that Salud Aguila is not entitled to retention over the subject lots.<br><br>Moreover, considering the seemingly simulated transfers made by Salud Aguila over the subject properties, we agree with the DAR Secretary and CA that these were done to circumvent the intent and application of PD 27 and the OLT of the Government.&nbsp; We cannot give our imprimatur to said transfers in the light of the clear intent of the law to emancipate the tenants from the bondage of the land they are cultivating, giving desirable benefits to the tenant-farmers cultivating their own land.<br><br>Premised on said grounds, the third issue on petitioners' right to retention over the subject lots is answered in the negative as they are not the owners, and consequently are not small landowners who are accorded the right of retention.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition for lack of merit, and <b>AFFIRM <i>IN TOTO</i></b> the August 31, 2001 Decision in CA-G.R.
