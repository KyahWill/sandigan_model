				<BR><BR>On October 21, 1988, petitioner, Vicente S. Almario (Almario), was hired by respondent, Philippine Airlines, Inc.

Pilots who are less than fifty-seven (57) years of age provided they have previously qualified in any company's turbo-jet aircraft shall be permitted to occupy any position in the company's turbo-jet fleet.<br></blockquote><u>The reason why pilots who are 57 years of age are no longer qualified to bid for a higher position is because <b>they have only three (3) years left before the mandatory retirement age [of 60]</b> and to send them to training at that age, <b>PAL would no longer be able to recover whatever training expenses it will have to incur.</b></u><br><br>Simply put, the foregoing provision clearly and unequivocally recognizes the prohibitive training cost principle such that it will take a period of at least three (3) years before PAL could recover from the training expenses it incurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of October 25, 2000, Branch 147 of the Makati RTC, finding no provision in the CBA between PAL and ALPAP stipulating that a pilot who underwent a training course for the position of A-300 First Officer must serve PAL for at least three years failing which he should reimburse the training expenses, rendered judgment in favor of Almario.<br><br>The trial court denied Almario's claim for moral damages, however.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; It denied too Almario's claim for the monetary equivalent of his family trip pass benefits (worth US$49,824), it holding that the same had been forfeited as he did not avail of them within one year from the date of his separation.<br><br>Thus the trial court disposed:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of defendant Vicente Almario and against the plaintiff:<br><br>1-Dismissing the plaintiff's complaint; 2-Ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendant:<br><blockquote> a-the amount of P312,425.00 as actual damages with legal interest from the filing of the counterclaim; <br>b-the amount of P500,000.00 as exemplary damages; <br>c-the amount of P150,000.00 as attorney's fees; <br>d-the costs of the suit.<br></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal by both parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court of Appeals, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated March 31, 2005, reversed the trial court's decision.&nbsp; It found Almario liable under the CBA between PAL and ALPAP and, in any event, <u>under Article 22 of the Civil Code. </u> Thus it disposed:<br><blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE.</b> In lieu thereof, a new judgment is hereby<b> ENTERED,</b> as follows:&nbsp; (a) Appellee Vicente Almario is hereby ordered to <u>pay appellant Philippine Airlines, Inc. the sum of Five Hundred Fifty Nine Thousand, Seven Hundred [T]hirty Nine &amp; 9/100 Pesos (P559, 739.90)</u> with six percent (6%) interest as above- computed; and (b) the <u>award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees in favor of appellee is hereby <b>DELETED</b>.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup> (Emphasis in the original;&nbsp; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>His Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Almario filed the instant Petition for Certiorari [<i>sic</i>] (Under Rule 45),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> raising the following issues:<br><ol type="A"><li>Whether the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in <u> interpreting the Collective Bargaining Agreement</u> between Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL) and the Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) as an ordinary civil law contract applying ordinary contract law principles<u>which is contrary to the ruling of the Supreme Court in <i>Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing- United Workers of the Philippines</i></u> <u>(SMTFM-UWP) v. NLRC</u> and, therefore, <u>erroneously reading into the CBA a clause that was not agreed to during the negotiation and not expressly stated in the CBA;</u><br><br></li><li>Whether the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in <u>holding that Article 22 of the Civil Code can be applied to recover training</u> costs which were never agreed to nor included as reimbursable expenses under the CBA;<br><br></li><li>Whether the availing by petitioner of a required training is a legal ground justifying the entitlement to a benefit and therefore, negating claims of unjust enrichment;<br><br></li><li>Whether the failure of private respondent to honor and provide the Family Trip Pass Benefit in the equivalent amount of US$ 49,824.00 which petitioner and his family were not able to avail of within the one (1) year from date of separation due to the actions of PAL amounts to unjust enrichment;<br><br></li><li>Whether or not respondent is liable for malicious prosecution[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol>Almario insists on the absence of any written contract or explicit provision in the CBA obliging him to reimburse the costs incurred by PAL for his training.&nbsp; And he argues:<br><blockquote> [T]here can be no unjust enrichment because petitioner was entitled to the benefit of training when his bid was accepted, and x x x PAL did not suffer any injury because the failure to include a reimbursement provision in the CBA was freely entered into by the negotiating parties;<br><br><center> x x x x </center><br>It is not disputed that the petitioner merely entered a bid for a higher position, and that when he was accepted based on seniority and qualification, the position was awarded to him.&nbsp; It is also not disputed that petitioner [had] not asked, requested, or demanded for the training.&nbsp; It came when his bid was accepted by PAL;<br><br>Because the training was provided when the bid was accepted, the acceptance of the bid was the basis and legal ground for the training;<br><br>Therefore, since there is a legal ground for the entitlement of the training, contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals, there can be no unjust enrichment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> The petition fails.<br><br>As reflected in the above-enumerated issues raised by Almario, he cites the case of <i> Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing-United Workers of the Philippines (SMTFM-UWP) v. NLRC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Manggagawa)</i> in support of his claim that the appellate court erred in interpreting the CBA as an ordinary civil law contract and in reading into it "a clause that was not agreed to during the negotiation and not expressly stated in the CBA."<br><br>On the contrary, the ruling in Manggagawa supports PAL's position.&nbsp; Thus this Court held:<br><blockquote> The CBA is the law between the contracting parties — the collective bargaining representative and the employer-company.&nbsp; Compliance with a CBA is mandated by the expressed policy to give protection to labor.&nbsp; In the same vein, <u> CBA provisions should be "construed liberally rather than narrowly and technically, and the courts must <b>place a practical and realistic construction upon it,</b> giving due consideration to the <b>context in which it is negotiated and purpose which it is intended to serve.</b></u>"&nbsp; This is founded on the dictum that a CBA is not an ordinary contract but one impressed with public interest.&nbsp; It goes without saying, however, that <u><b>only provisions embodied in the CBA should be so interpreted and complied with.</b></u>&nbsp; Where a proposal raised by a contracting party does not find print in the CBA, it is not a part thereof and the proponent has no claim whatsoever to its implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </blockquote> In N.S. Case No. 11-506-87, "<i>In re Labor Dispute at the Philippine Airlines, Inc.</i>," the Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), passing on the failure of PAL and ALPAP to agree on the terms and conditions for the renewal of their CBA which expired on December 31, 1987 and construing Section 1 of Article XXIII of the 1985-1987 CBA, held:<br><blockquote> <blockquote> <center> x x x x </center><br><u>Section 1, Article XXIII of the 1985-1987 CBA provides:</u><br><br>Pilots fifty-five (55) years of age or over who have not previously qualified in any Company turbo-jet aircraft shall not be permitted to bid into the Company's turbo-jet operations.&nbsp; Pilots fifty-five (55) years of age or over who have previously qualified in the company's turbo-jet operations may be by-passed at Company option, however, any such pilot shall be paid the by-pass pay effective upon the date a junior pilot starts to occupy the bidded position.<br><br>x x x PAL x x x proposed to amend the provision in this wise:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The compulsory retirement age for all pilots is sixty (60) years</span>.&nbsp; Pilots who reach the age of fifty-five (55) years and over without having previously qualified in any Company turbo-jet aircraft shall not&nbsp; be permitted to occupy any position in the Company's turbo-jet fleet.&nbsp; Pilots fifty-four (54) years of age and over are ineligible for promotion to any position in Group I.&nbsp; Pilots reaching the age of fifty-five (55) shall be frozen in the position they currently occupy at that time and shall be ineligible for any further movement to any other positions.<br></blockquote><u>PAL's contention is basically <b>premised on prohibitive training costs.&nbsp; The return on this investment in the form of the pilot promoted is allegedly five (5) years.</b></u> Considering the pilot's age, the chances of full recovery [are] asserted to be quite slim.<br><br>ALPAP opposed the proposal and argued that the training cost is offset by the pilot's maturity, expertise and experience.<br><br>By way of compromise, <u>we rule that a pilot should remain in the position where he is upon reaching age fifty-seven (57), irrespective of whether or not he has previously qualified in the Company's turbo-jet operations.&nbsp; The<b> rationale</b> behind this is that a pilot who will be compulsorily retired at age sixty (60) should no longer be burdened with training for a new position. </u> But <u>if a pilot is only at age fifty- five (55),</u> and promotional positions are available, he should still be considered and promoted if qualified, provided he has previously qualified in any company turbo-jet aircraft.&nbsp; In the latter case, the <b><u>prohibitive training costs are more than offset by the maturity, expertise, and experience of the pilot. </u></b> <blockquote> <u>Thus, the provision on age limit should now read:</u><br><br>Pilots fifty-seven (57) years of age shall be frozen in their positions.&nbsp; Pilots fifty-five (55) [sic] years of age provided they have previously qualified in any company turbo-jet aircraft shall be permitted to occupy any position in the company's turbo-jet fleet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>The above-quoted provision of Section 1 of Article XXIII of the 1985-1987 CBA, <u> as construed by the DOLE Secretary,</u> was substantially incorporated in the 1991-1994 CBA between PAL and ALPAP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote> Pilots fifty-seven (57) years of age shall be frozen in their position.

Hence, with the maturity, expertise, and experience he gained from the training course, he was expected to serve PAL for at least three years to offset "the prohibitive costs" thereof.<br><br>The pertinent provision of the CBA and its rationale aside, contrary to Almario's claim, Article 22 of the Civil Code which reads:<br><blockquote> Art. 22.&nbsp; Every person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him,</blockquote>applies.<br><br>This provision on unjust enrichment recognizes the principle that one may not enrich himself at the expense of another.&nbsp;
