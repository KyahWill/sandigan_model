				<BR><STRONG>CORONA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for disbarment and suspension<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against respondent Atty. Arsenio C. Villalon, Jr. by Pablo R. Olivares and/or Olivares Realty Corporation for violation of Rule 12.02, Canon 12 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the rule on forum shopping.<br><br>In his complaint, Olivares alleged that respondent's client, Sarah Divina Morales Al-Rasheed, repeatedly sued him for violations of the lease contract which they executed over a commercial apartment in Olivares Building in Parañaque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In 1993, Al-Rasheed filed an action for damages and prohibition with prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction in the Regional Trial Court of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The case was dismissed for improper venue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Six years later, on July 1, 1999, Al-Rasheed filed an action for breach of contract with damages in the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque, Branch 274. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The case, docketed as Civil Case No. 99-0233, was dismissed for failure to prosecute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Al-Rasheed, through counsel Atty. Villalon, sought a review of the order dismissing Civil Case No. 99-0233 but the Court of Appeals did not give due course to her appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The subsequent petition for review on certiorari filed in the Supreme Court was likewise denied. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On January 29, 2004, Al-Rasheed re-filed the 1999 suit in the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque, Branch 274<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> where it was docketed as Civil Case No. 0J-04-009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It was dismissed on the grounds of<span style="font-style: italic;"> res judicata</span> and prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that he was only performing his legal obligation as a lawyer to protect and prosecute the interests of his client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He denied that he was forum shopping as his client, in her certificate of non-forum shopping,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> disclosed the two previous cases involving the same cause of action which had been filed and dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Respondent further claims he could not refuse his client's request to file a new case because Al-Rasheed was the "oppressed party" in the transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>This Court referred the complaint, together with respondent's comment, to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the IBP found that respondent assisted Al-Rasheed in repeatedly suing Olivares for the same cause of action and subject matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It opined that respondent should have noted that the 1999 case was dismissed for lack of interest to prosecute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, such dismissal had the effect of an adjudication on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The CBD recommended the suspension of respondent for six months with a warning that any similar infraction in the future would be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The IBP adopted and approved the findings of the CBD that respondent violated Rule 12.02, Canon 12 of the Code of Professional Responsibility as well as the proscription on forum shopping. It, however, modified the recommended penalty to reprimand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>We adopt the findings of the IBP except its recommendation as to the penalty.<br><br>All lawyers must bear in mind that their oaths are neither mere words nor an empty formality. When they take their oath as lawyers, they dedicate their lives to the pursuit of justice. They accept the sacred trust to uphold the laws of the land. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As the first Canon of the Code of Professional Responsibility states, "[a] lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  Moreover, according to the lawyer's oath they took, lawyers should "not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid nor consent to the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>With all this in mind, respondent should have refrained from filing the second complaint against Olivares. He ought to have known that the previous dismissal was with prejudice since it had the effect of an adjudication on the merits. There was no excuse not to know this elementary principle of procedural law.<br><br>The facts of this case reveal that Atty. Villalon purposely filed the second complaint.  Respondent appealed the 1999 case to the Court of Appeals and subsequently to this Court. Both actions were dismissed for lack of merit, not on mere technicality. The certificate of non-forum shopping attached to the 2004 complaint disclosed that Al-Rasheed previously sued Olivares for violating their lease contract. As if such disclosure was a sufficient justification, Atty. Villalon unapologetically reproduced his 1999<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> arguments and assertions in the 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> complaint. Respondent obviously knew the law and tried to go around it. This Court therefore concludes that respondent willfully violated Rule 12.02, Canon 12 which provides that:<br><blockquote>A lawyer shall not file multiple actions arising from the same cause.<br></blockquote>Furthermore, he violated Rule 10.03, Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:<br><blockquote>A lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice.<br></blockquote>A lawyer's fidelity to his client must not be pursued at the expense of truth and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Lawyers have the duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. Filing multiple actions constitutes an abuse of the Court's processes. It constitutes improper conduct that tends to impede, obstruct and degrade justice. Those who file multiple or repetitive actions subject themselves to disciplinary action for incompetence or willful violation of their duties as attorneys to act with all good fidelity to the courts, and to maintain only such actions that appear to be just and consistent with truth and honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Everything considered, this Court finds that a reprimand is insufficient and rules instead that CBD's recommendation for a six-month suspension from the practice of law to be more commensurate to the violation committed.  However, in view of respondent's death on September 27, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the penalty can no longer be imposed on him.  This development has, in effect, rendered this disciplinary case moot and academic.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Azcuna, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Dated February 18, 2004.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (Vol. I), pp. 1-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id., pp. 35-39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. p. 41.
