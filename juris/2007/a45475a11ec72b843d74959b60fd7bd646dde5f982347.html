After the canvass of votes, Cundangan was proclaimed as the duly elected <i>Punong Barangay</i>.<br><br>On July 23, 2002, Chua filed an election protest which impugned the results of the canvass in all the 19 precincts of said <i>barangay</i>.<br><br>After the revision proceedings were concluded, the trial court rendered a Decision dated September 26, 2003, affirming the proclamation of Cundangan.<br><br>Unsatisfied with the decision of the trial court, Chua filed on October 14, 2003, an appeal with the COMELEC First Division.  In its Resolution dated October 25, 2005, the COMELEC First Division reversed the trial court's Decision dated September 26, 2003, and accordingly declared Chua as the duly elected <i>Punong Barangay</i> of <i>Barangay </i>Sumilang, Pasig City.<br><br>On November 2, 2005, Cundangan moved for a reconsideration of the said Resolution.

But as correctly explained by Chua, there was no error in the number of uncontested ballots stated in the impugned COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> Resolution because it accounted for only 17 precincts, unlike in the COMELEC First Division Resolution and the trial court's Decision which accounted for 19 precincts.  The COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> excluded from its count the ballots in two precincts, namely, 505A/506A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and 510A,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> after it had determined that a number of ballots in said precincts were tampered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><i>As for the second ground</i>, Cundangan alleges that the COMELEC erred when it invalidated 87 ballots in his favor for being WBOP; 19 ballots in his favor for being WBTP; and 4 ballots in his favor for being marked ballots.<br><br>Cundangan argues that the aforementioned 87 ballots were not WBOP considering that each of them bears a distinctive handwriting and does not appear to be objectionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  For his part, Chua insists that the said ballots were WBOP, pointing out that his revisors had been able to identify the said ballots to have been clearly written by only one hand during the revision proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8] </sup> <i> Citing Erni v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Chua likewise avers that evidence <i>aliunde</i> is not necessary for the COMELEC to determine whether the questioned ballots were written by one hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Arguing that the aforesaid 19 ballots were not WBTP, Cundangan cites Section 211 (22)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the Omnibus Election Code and <i>Ong v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in which we ruled that "the appearance of print and script writings in a single ballot does not necessarily imply that two persons wrote the ballot.  The strokes of print and script handwriting would naturally differ but would not automatically mean that two persons prepared the same . . . . In the absence of any deliberate intention to put an identification mark, the ballots must not be rejected."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Chua counters by saying that his revisors identified that the questioned ballots had been written by two persons during the revision proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  He likewise cites Section 211 (23)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the Omnibus Election Code and<i> Protacio v. De Leon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> in which we invalidated a ballot for having been written by two hands, because the writing of the names of some of the candidates therein bore distinct and marked dissimilarities from the rest of the handwritings used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>As to the four ballots<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which were considered marked, Cundangan contends that the COMELEC's ruling below was erroneous.<br><br><table ï¿½="" width="75%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%"><div align="center">PRECINCT NO.</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="center">EXHIBIT NO.</div></td> <td width="60%"><div align="center">RULING</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>510A </td> <td style="text-align: left;">C-47 (1 ballot)</td> <td><p align="justify">The name "Boboy Benito" which was written and repeated in lines 1 to 7 for <i>Kagawads</i>, is a distinguishing mark meant to identify the voter.</p> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>510A-1/512-A</td> <td style="text-align: left;">C-24 and C-25 (2 ballots)</td> <td> <p align="justify">The name "Oyit Santos" written in lines 2-7 for<i> Kagawads</i> and the word "BO" serves as an identification mark.</p> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>521-A/522-A </td> <td style="text-align: left;">C-29 (1 ballot)</td> <td><p align="justify">The word "Boyer Quijano" written in big letters in such a way that it occupies lines 1 to 7 for <i>Kagawads</i> is evidently intended to identify or mark this ballot.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>Cundangan contends that the above ballots are not marked ballots because writing the name of a candidate in big bold letters spanning several lines merely signifies desistance from voting for other candidates and was only for emphasis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Chua, for his part, maintains that the said ballots were marked and adds that the face of the ballot itself contains a caution to the voter not to place any distinguishing mark that will invalidate the ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>We hold that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> did not abuse its discretion in invalidating all of the aforesaid contested ballots.  In <i>Idulza v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> we ruled that where the factual findings of a division of the COMELEC, as affirmed by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, are supported by substantial evidence, they are beyond the ken of review by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  In the present petition, we have more reason to respect the findings of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> with regard to the questioned ballots, considering that the same is consistent not only with the findings of the COMELEC First Division, but also those of the trial court.<br><br>It must be stressed that the appreciation of contested ballots and election documents involves a question of fact best left to the determination of the COMELEC, a specialized agency tasked with the supervision of elections all over the country.  It is the constitutional commission vested with the exclusive original jurisdiction over election contests involving regional, provincial and city officials, as well as appellate jurisdiction over election protests involving elective municipal and <i>barangay</i> officials.  Consequently, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion or any jurisdictional infirmity or error of law, the factual findings, conclusions, rulings and decisions rendered by the said Commission on matters falling within its competence shall not be interfered with by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It is worth pointing out that the invalidation of the four above-mentioned marked ballots is in accord with our ruling in <i>Ong v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in which we held that big bold letters that occupy all the spaces for the specific position should be invalidated, inasmuch as this evinces an evident intent to mark the ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><i>Anent the third ground</i>, Cundangan argues that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> gravely abused its discretion when it validated allegedly invalid ballots in favor of Chua as follows:  (1) 89 ballots because they were WBOP; and (2) four ballots because the same were marked ballots.  Cundangan likewise assails the alleged validation of two claimed ballots counted in favor of Chua.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As for the 89 ballots allegedly WBOP, Cundangan argues that the same are WBOP because upon perusal of the ballots, the handwritings on these ballots are clearly identical.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>As for the four allegedly marked ballots, he contends that the same are indeed marked ballots, considering that the words <i>papag, bangus,</i> and<i> kalabasa</i> were written amidst the names of different candidates for <i>Kagawads</i>, and that the said words are irrelevant, impertinent and unnecessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  He further argues that writing these irrelevant words or expressions after or amidst the names of candidates voids the ballot for being marked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  He adds that a ballot bearing an irrelevant epithet after the name of a candidate should also be invalidated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Cundangan likewise assails the alleged validation of two ballots which Chua had claimed.  He said that the two ballots should not have been considered in Chua's favor, because a perusal of both ballots would show that his name was more clearly written than that of Chua.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>For his part, Chua argues that the said ballots were validated by COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, because they are valid ballots in the first place, there being no grounds to invalidate them.  He likewise points out that Cundangan even admitted in his petition that the COMELEC has the required expertise and authority for determining the validity of votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In our view, the validity of the questioned ballots should be upheld.  As found after the scrutiny of the COMELEC, the 89 contested ballots could not have been WBOP, considering that there were differences in how particular letters in each of the said ballots were written.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  The four ballots are likewise not marked ballots because the mere presence of the words <i>papag, kalabasa</i> and <i>bangus</i> in the said ballots does not instantaneously make them marked ballots.  For the said ballots to be considered marked ballots, it must clearly appear that the said words were deliberately placed thereon to serve as identification marks.  In this case, there was no showing of the said malicious intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The COMELEC likewise correctly counted the two claimed ballots in favor of Chua by reason of the neighborhood rule, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> considering that the name of Chua was written on the first space for <i>Kagawads</i> and that the space for <i>Punong Barangay</i> was left blank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36] </sup><br><br><i>Anent the final ground,</i> we find that Cundangan's allegation, that the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> did not squarely rule on the issue regarding the existence of spurious and fake ballots that were found during the revision of ballots in the trial court, is clearly without basis.  As explicitly stated in the assailed COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> Resolution, the ballot boxes of Precincts Nos. 498A/500A, 505A/506A, 507A/507A1, 510A, and 510A1/512A1 contained some tampered ballots; while the ballot box of Precinct No. 503A/504A does not contain any tampered, fake or spurious ballots, or ballots with forged Board of Election Inspector initials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.
