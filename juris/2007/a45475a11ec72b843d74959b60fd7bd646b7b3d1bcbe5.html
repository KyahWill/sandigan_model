				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> seeks to set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 54465<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and its resolution denying reconsideration.<br><br>In the evening of May 8, 1999, Edgardo D. Cabrrera, Gerardo R. Gorrospe and Dorotea T. Hiyas, intelligence agents of the Bureau of Immigration (BI), saw respondent Samuel A. Jardin, chief of the BI's Law and Intelligence Division, with three unidentified male companions, including a Japanese national who arrived on board a flight from Osaka, Japan, at the arrival area of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Cabrrera noticed that the Japanese national's fifth finger on the left hand was missing. This aroused his suspicion, mutilation being a common practice among members of the Yakuza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Hence, the BI agents closely watched respondent and his companions.<br><br>After identifying the Japanese national as Mizutani Ryoichiro, an alien declared undesirable in 1999 and prohibited from entering the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  they immediately apprehended him and sent him back to Japan pursuant to an exclusion order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The following day, the BI agents filed a spot report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (relating the previous night's incident) with the chief of intelligence of the BI stationed in NAIA. Acting immigration officer Jude C. Hinolan, in his memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> confirmed the spot report and relayed the service of the exclusion order on the airline and the consequent deportation of Ryoichiro.<br><br>On May 14, 1999, petitioner Rufus Rodriguez, immigration commissioner at that time, ordered associate commissioner Ma. Luisa Ylagan-Cortez to investigate the allegations contained in the spot report of the agents and Hinolan's memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Accordingly, Ylagan-Cortez ordered respondent to file his sworn explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Respondent denied the allegations against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He averred that his relatives requested his assistance in welcoming a niece's fiancé, Mizutani Ryoichiro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Although he was aware that a Mizutani Ryoichiro had been declared an undesirable alien, he was informed that the blacklisted Ryoichiro was born in 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> while his niece told him that her fiancé was in his fifties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Furthermore, respondent reasoned that   the   accusations  against   Ryoichiro   were   unfounded  because neither a conviction nor a police report linking Ryoichiro to the Yakuza was ever presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On June 4, 1999, Ylagan-Cortez, as acting immigration commissioner,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> ordered the preventive suspension of respondent for 90 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The administrative case against respondent was then referred to petitioner Alan Roullo Yap, an associate commissioner at that time, for formal investigation and reception of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Respondent moved for the suspension of proceedings and reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but petitioner Yap denied his motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On July 8, 1999, respondent sought the review of the June 4, 1999 order by the Secretary of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Despite the lapse of his preventive suspension on September 4, 1999 and pending the resolution of his appeal with the Secretary of Justice, respondent filed a special civil action for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> with the CA, assailing   the June 4, 1999 order. On November 19, 1999, the appellate court nullified the order and directed petitioners to reinstate respondent to his position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Petitioners' motion for reconsideration was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On February 21, 2000, petitioners in their official capacities filed this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They contended that the CA erred in granting respondent's petition for certiorari and in annulling the June 4, 1999 order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On June 15, 2002, respondent moved to declare the petition moot. He averred that petitioner Rodriguez had in the meantime been replaced by Andrea D. Domingo as immigration commissioner while petitioner Yap had been appointed to the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Despite the lapse of 30 days, no substitution was effected pursuant to Section 17, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <span style="font-style: italic;">Death or separation of a party who is a public officer.</span> — When a public officer is a party in an action in his official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action may be continued and maintained by or against his successor if within thirty (30) days after the successor takes office or such time as may be granted by the court, it is satisfactorily shown to the court by any party that there is a substantial need for continuing or maintaining it and that the successor adopts or continues or threatens to continue or adopt the action of his predecessor. Before a substitution is made, the party or officer affected, unless expressly assenting thereto, shall be given reasonable notice of the application therefor and accorded an opportunity to be heard.</blockquote>On April 30, 2003, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) manifested that Andrea D. Domingo had indeed been appointed the new immigration commissioner replacing petitioner Rodriguez. The OSG also stated that Commissioner Domingo was not adopting the position of her predecessor, petitioner Rodriguez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Despite serious misgivings, we agree with respondent but purely on technicality.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that failure to make a substitution pursuant to Section 17, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court is a ground for the dismissal of an action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> For the valid substitution of a public officer who has sued or has been sued in his or her official capacity, the following requisites must be satisfied:<br><blockquote><ol><li>satisfactory proof by any party that there is substantial need for continuing or maintaining the action;<br><br></li><li>the successor adopts or continues or threatens to adopt or continue the acts of his or her predecessor;<br><br></li><li>the substitution must be effected within 30 days after the successor assumes office or within the time granted by the court; and,<br><br></li><li>notice of the application to the other party.</li></ol></blockquote>Here, petitioner Rodriguez's successor categorically expressed her lack of interest in pursuing this appeal, hence, the failure to effect a substitution.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Azcuna, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Garcia, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The records also refer to respondent as Samuel A.M.
