Appellant Pedro Esguerra even testified that he does not know how appellees were able to secure a title over the lot in question and that they never sold Lot No. 3593 to Virginia Trinidad since it is part of the whole lot of 23,489 square meters.  The said testimony is a mere conclusion on the part of appellants.  On the other hand, the evidence shows that appellees acquired title over the subject property by virtue of a deed of sale executed by their father Eulalio Trinidad in their favor.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[T]hey failed to establish that appellees' acquisition of the certificate of title is fraudulent.  In fact, in their two complaints, appellants acknowledged that appellees observed and took the initial procedural steps in the registration of the land, thus ruling out fraud in the acquisition of the certificate of title. . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals,  are final, conclusive and binding on this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which is not a trier of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> hence, bereft of function under Rule 45 to examine and weigh the probative value of the evidence presented,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> its jurisdiction being limited only to the review and revision of errors of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  Albeit there are exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> to this rule, the cases at bar do not fall thereunder, there being no showing that the trial and appellate courts overlooked matters which, if considered, would alter their outcome.<br><br>Under the Torrens System, an OCT enjoys a presumption of validity, which correlatively carries a strong presumption that the provisions of the law governing the registration of land which led to its issuance have been duly followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  Fraud being a serious charge, it must be supported by clear and convincing proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proof, however.<br><br>On the questioned interpretation and application by the appellate court of Article 1542 of the Civil Code reading:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the sale of real estate, made for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lump sum</span> and not at the rate of a certain sum for a unit of measure or number, there shall be no increase or decrease of the price, although there be a greater or less areas or number than that stated in the contract.</span><br><br>The same rule shall be applied when two or more immovables are sold for a single price; but if, besides mentioning the boundaries, which is indispensable in every conveyance of real estate, its area or number should be designated in the contract, the vendor shall be bound to deliver all that is included within said boundaries, even when it exceeds the area or number specified in the contract; and, should he not be able to do so, he shall suffer a reduction in the price, in proportion to what is lacking in the area or number, unless the contract is rescinded because the vendee does not accede to the failure to deliver what has been stipulated. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>while petitioners admittedly sold Lot No. 3591 to the Trinidad spouses, they contend that what they sold were only 5,000 square meters and not 6,268 square meters, and thus claim the excess of 1,268 square meters.<br><br>In sales involving real estate, the parties may choose between two types of pricing agreement: a unit price contract wherein the purchase price is determined by way of reference to a stated rate per unit area (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.,</span> P1,000 per square meter), or a lump sum contract which states a full purchase price for an immovable the area of which may be declared based on an estimate or where both the area and boundaries are stated (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., P1 million for 1,000 square meters, etc.).  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Rudolf Lietz, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  the Court discussed the distinction:<br><blockquote>. . . In a unit price contract, the statement of area of immovable is not conclusive and the price may be reduced or increased depending on the area actually delivered.  If the vendor delivers less than the area agreed upon, the vendee may oblige the vendor to deliver all that may be stated in the contract or demand for the proportionate reduction of the purchase price if delivery is not possible.  If the vendor delivers more than the area stated in the contract, the vendee has the option to accept only the amount agreed upon or to accept the whole area, provided he pays for the additional area at the contract rate.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the case where the area of the immovable is stated in the contract based on an estimate, the actual area delivered may not measure up exactly with the area stated in the contract.  According to Article 1542 of the Civil Code, in the sale of real estate, made for a lump sum and not at the rate of a certain sum for a unit of measure or number, there shall be no increase or decrease of the price, although there be a greater or less areas or number than that stated in the contract. . . .<br><br>x x x x<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where both the area and the boundaries of the immovable are declared, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the area covered within the boundaries of the immovable prevails </span>over the stated area.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> In cases of conflict between areas and boundaries, it is the latter which should prevail.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What really defines a piece of ground is</span> not the area, calculated with more or less certainty, mentioned in its description, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">the boundaries therein laid down</span>, as enclosing the land and indicating its limits</span>.  In a contract of sale of land in a mass, it is well established that the specific boundaries stated in the contract must control over any statement with respect to the area contained within its boundaries.  It is not of vital consequence that a deed or contract of sale of land should disclose the area with mathematical accuracy.  It is sufficient if its extent is objectively indicated with sufficient precision to enable one to identify it.  An error as to the superficial area is immaterial.  Thus, the obligation of the vendor is to deliver everything within the boundaries, inasmuch as it is the entirety thereof that distinguishes the determinate object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The courts below correctly characterized the sale of Lot No. 3591 as one involving a lump sum contract.  The <span style="font-style: italic;">Bilihan ng Lupa</span> shows that the parties agreed on the purchase price of P1,000.00 on a predetermined, albeit unsurveyed, area of 5,000 square meters and not on a particular rate per unit area.  As noted by the Court of Appeals, the identity of the realty was sufficiently described as riceland:<br><blockquote>It is clear from the afore-quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">Bilihan ng Lupa</span> that what appellants sold to Eulalio was the "<span style="font-style: italic;">bahaging palayan</span>."  Though measured as 5,000 square meters, more or less, such measurement is only an approximation, and not an exact measurement.  Moreover, we take note of the fact that the said deed of sale mentioned the boundaries covering the whole area of 33,489 square meters, including the "<span style="font-style: italic;">bahaging palayan</span>."  Had appellants intended to sell only a portion of the "<span style="font-style: italic;">bahaging palayan</span>," they could have stated the specific area in the deed of sale and not the entire "<span style="font-style: italic;">bahaging palayan</span>" . . . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, under Article 1542, what is controlling is the entire land included within the boundaries, regardless of whether the real area should be greater or smaller than that recited in the deed.  This is particularly true since the area of the land in OCT No. 0-6498 was described in the deed as "<span style="font-style: italic;">humigit kumulang,</span>" that is, more or less.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>A caveat is in order, however.  The use of "more or less" or similar words in designating quantity covers only a reasonable excess or deficiency.  A vendee of land sold in gross or with the description "more or less" with reference to its area does not thereby <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> take all risk of quantity in the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Numerical data are not of course the sole gauge of unreasonableness of the excess or deficiency in area.  Courts must consider a host of other factors.  In one case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court found substantial discrepancy in area due to contemporaneous circumstances.  Citing change in the physical nature of the property, it was therein established that the excess area at the southern portion was a product of reclamation, which explained why the land's technical description in the deed of sale indicated the seashore as its southern boundary, hence, the inclusion of the reclaimed area was declared unreasonable.<br><br>In OCT No. 0-6498, the increase by a fourth of a fraction of the area indicated in the deed of sale cannot be considered as an unreasonable excess.  Most importantly, the circumstances attendant to the inclusion of the excess area bare nothing atypical or significant to hint at unreasonableness.  It must be noted that the land was not yet technically surveyed at the time of the sale.  As vendors who themselves executed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bilihan ng Lupa,</span> petitioners may rightly be presumed to have acquired a good estimate of the value and area of the <span style="font-style: italic;">bahaging palayan.</span><br><br>As for the last assigned error, the appellate court, in finding that the complaints were time-barred, noted that when the complaints were filed in 1994, more than 27 years had elapsed from the issuance of OCT  No. 0-3631 and more than 20 years from the issuance of OCT No. 0-6498.  The prescriptive period of one (1) year had thus set in.<br><br>Petitioners' reliance on <span style="font-style: italic;">Agne v. Director of Lands</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> is misplaced since the cancellation of title was predicated not on the ground of fraud but on want of jurisdiction.  Even assuming that petitioners' actions are in the nature of a suit for quieting of title, which is imprescriptible, the actions still necessarily fail since petitioners failed to establish the existence of fraud.<br><br>A word on Republic Act No. 7160<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which was raised by petitioners in their petition.  It expressly requires the parties to undergo a conciliation process under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Katarungang Pambarangay</span>, as a precondition to filing a complaint in court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> non-compliance with this condition precedent does not prevent a court of competent jurisdiction from exercising its power of adjudication over a case unless the defendants object thereto.  The objection should be seasonably made before the court first taking cognizance of the complaint, and must be raised in the Answer or in such other pleading allowed under the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>While petitioners admittedly failed to comply with the requirement of barangay conciliation, they assert that respondents waived such objection when they failed to raise it in their Answer.  Contrary to petitioners' claim, however, the records reveal that respondents raised their objection in their Amended Answers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> filed in both cases.<br><br>IN FINE, it is a fundamental principle in land registration that a certificate of title serves as evidence of an indefeasible and incontrovertible title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears therein.  Such indefeasibility commences after the lapse or expiration of one year from the date of entry of the decree of registration when all persons are considered to have a constructive notice of the title to the property.  After the lapse of one year, therefore, title to the property can no longer be contested. This system was so effected in order to quiet title to land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> DENIED</span>.
