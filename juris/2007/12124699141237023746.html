				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondents, spouses Eva Marie Ronquillo (Eva Marie) and Noel Benedicto (Noel) Ronquillo (the Ronquillo spouses or the spouses), had not been blessed with a child despite several years of marriage. They thus consulted petitioner, Dr. Concepcion Ilao-Oreta (Dr. Ilao-Oreta), an obstetrician-gynecologist-consultant at the St. Luke's Medical Center where she was, at the time material to the case, the chief of the Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Section.<br><br>Upon Dr. Ilao-Oreta's advice, Eva Marie agreed to undergo a laparoscopic procedure whereby a laparascope would be inserted through the patient's abdominal wall to get a direct view of her internal reproductive organ in order to determine the real cause of her infertility.<br><br>The procedure was scheduled on April 5, 1999 at 2:00 p.m., to be performed by Dr. Ilao-Oreta.&nbsp; At around 7:00 a.m. of said date, Eva Marie, accompanied by her husband Noel, checked in at the St. Luke's Medical Center and underwent pre-operative procedures including the administration of intravenous fluid and enema.<br><br>Dr. Ilao-Oreta did not arrive at the scheduled time for the procedure, however, and no prior notice of its cancellation was received. It turned out that the doctor was on a return flight from Hawaii to, and arrived at 10:00 p.m. of April 5, 1999 in, Manila.<br><br>On May 18, 1999, the Ronquillo spouses filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; against Dr. Ilao-Oreta and the St. Luke's Medical Center for breach of professional and service contract and for damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Batangas City. They prayed for the award of actual damages including alleged loss of income of Noel while accompanying his wife to the hospital, moral damages, exemplary damages, the costs of litigation, attorney's fees, and other available reliefs and remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In her Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Dr. Ilao-Oreta gave her side of the case as follows:&nbsp; She went on a honeymoon to Hawaii and was scheduled to leave Hawaii at 3:00 p.m. of April 4, 1999 for Manila. Aware that her trip from Hawaii to Manila would take about 12 hours, inclusive of a stop-over at the Narita Airport in Japan, she estimated that she would arrive in Manila in the early morning of April 5, 1999.&nbsp; She thus believed in utmost good faith that she would be back in Manila in time for the scheduled conduct of the laparoscopic procedure.&nbsp; She failed to consider the time difference between Hawaii and the Philippines, however.<br><br>In its Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the St. Luke's Medical Center contended that the spouses have no cause of action against it since it performed the pre-operative procedures without delay, and any cause of action they have would be against Dr. Ilao-Oreta.<br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of March 9, 2001, Branch 84 of the Batangas RTC, finding that the failure of the doctor to arrive on time was not intentional, awarded Eva Marie only actual damages in the total amount of P9,939 and costs of suit.

So <i>Premiere Development Bank v.

In his testimony, the witness affirmed that Panacor incurred losses, specifically, in terms of training and seminars, leasehold acquisition, procurement of vehicles and office equipment without, however, adducing receipts to substantiate the same.&nbsp; The documentary evidence marked as Exhibit "W," which was an ordinary private writing allegedly itemizing the capital expenditures and losses from the failed operation of Panacor, was not testified to by any witness to ascertain the veracity of its content.&nbsp; Although the lower court fixed the sum of P4,520,000.00 as the total expenditures incurred by Panacor, it failed to show how and in what manner the same were substantiated by the claimant with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; Hence, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the claim for actual damages should be received with extreme caution since it is only based on bare assertion without support from independent evidence</span>.&nbsp; Premiere's failure to prove actual expenditure consequently conduces to a failure of its claim.&nbsp; In determining actual damages, the court cannot rely on mere assertions, speculations, conjectures or guesswork but must depend on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable regarding the actual amount of loss</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp;
