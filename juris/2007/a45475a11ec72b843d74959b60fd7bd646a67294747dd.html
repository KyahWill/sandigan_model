				<BR><STRONG>NACHURA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Petitioners Romeo P. Gerochi, <span style="font-style: italic;">Katulong Ng Bayan </span>(KB), and Environmentalist Consumers Network, Inc. (ECN) (petitioners), come before this Court in this original action praying that Section 34 of Republic Act (RA) 9136, otherwise known as the "Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001" (EPIRA), imposing the Universal Charge,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Rule 18 of the Rules and Regulations (IRR)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which seeks to implement the said imposition, be declared unconstitutional. Petitioners also pray that the Universal Charge imposed upon the consumers be refunded and that a preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order (TRO) be issued directing the respondents to refrain from implementing, charging, and collecting the said charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  The assailed provision of law reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 34. <span style="font-style: italic;">Universal Charge</span>. – Within one (1) year from the effectivity of this Act, a universal charge to be determined, fixed and approved by the ERC, shall be imposed on all electricity end-users for the following purposes:<br><br>(a) Payment for the stranded debts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in excess of the amount assumed by the National Government and stranded contract costs of NPC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and as well as qualified stranded contract costs of distribution utilities resulting from the restructuring of the industry;<br><br>(b) Missionary electrification;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>(c) The equalization of the taxes and royalties applied to indigenous or renewable sources of energy vis-à-vis imported energy fuels;<br><br>(d)  An environmental charge equivalent to one-fourth of one centavo per kilowatt-hour (P0.0025/kWh), which shall accrue to an environmental fund to be used solely for watershed rehabilitation and management. Said fund shall be managed by NPC under existing arrangements; and<br><br>(e)  A charge to account for all forms of cross-subsidies for a period not exceeding three (3) years.<br></blockquote><blockquote>The universal charge shall be a non-bypassable charge which shall be passed on and collected from all end-users on a monthly basis by the distribution utilities. Collections by the distribution utilities and the TRANSCO in any given month shall be remitted to the PSALM Corp. on or before the fifteenth (15th) of the succeeding month, net of any amount due to the distribution utility. Any end-user or self-generating entity not connected to a distribution utility shall remit its corresponding universal charge directly to the TRANSCO.  The PSALM Corp., as administrator of the fund, shall create a Special Trust Fund which shall be disbursed only for the purposes specified herein in an open and transparent manner. All amount collected for the universal charge shall be distributed to the respective beneficiaries within a reasonable period to be provided by the ERC.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><i style="font-weight: bold;">The Facts</i><br></div><br>Congress enacted the EPIRA on June 8, 2001; on June 26, 2001, it took effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On April 5, 2002, respondent National Power Corporation-Strategic Power Utilities Group<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (NPC-SPUG) filed with respondent Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) a petition for the availment from the Universal Charge of its share for Missionary Electrification, docketed as ERC Case No. 2002-165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On May 7, 2002, NPC filed another petition with ERC, docketed as ERC Case No. 2002-194, praying that the proposed share from the Universal Charge for the Environmental charge of P0.0025 per kilowatt-hour (/kWh), or a total of P119,488,847.59, be approved for withdrawal from the Special Trust   Fund   (STF)  managed   by   respondent   Power  Sector  Assets   and<br><br>Liabilities Management Group (PSALM)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for the rehabilitation and management of watershed areas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On December 20, 2002, the ERC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in ERC Case No. 2002-165 provisionally approving the computed amount of P0.0168/kWh as the share of the NPC-SPUG from the Universal Charge for Missionary Electrification and authorizing the National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO) and Distribution Utilities to collect the same from its end-users on a monthly basis.<br><br>On June 26, 2003, the ERC rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  (for ERC Case No. 2002-165) modifying its Order of December 20, 2002, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the provisional authority granted to petitioner National Power Corporation-Strategic Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG) in the Order dated December 20, 2002 is hereby modified to the effect that an additional amount of P0.0205 per kilowatt-hour should be added to the P0.0168 per kilowatt-hour provisionally authorized by the Commission in the said Order. Accordingly, a total amount of P0.0373 per kilowatt-hour is hereby APPROVED for withdrawal from the Special Trust Fund managed by PSALM as its share from the Universal Charge for Missionary Electrification (UC-ME) effective on the following billing cycles:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) June 26-July 25, 2003 for National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO); and<br><br>(b) July 2003 for Distribution Utilities (Dus).<br></div><br>Relative thereto, TRANSCO and Dus are directed to collect the UC-ME in the amount of P0.0373 per kilowatt-hour and remit the same to PSALM on or before the 15th day of the succeeding month.<br><br>In the meantime, NPC-SPUG is directed to submit, not later than April 30, 2004, a detailed report to include Audited Financial Statements and physical status (percentage of completion) of the projects using the prescribed format.<br><br>Let copies of this Order be furnished petitioner NPC-SPUG and all distribution utilities (Dus).<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote>On August 13, 2003, NPC-SPUG filed a Motion for Reconsideration asking the ERC, among others,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to set aside the above-mentioned Decision, which the ERC granted in its Order dated October 7, 2003, disposing:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the "Motion for Reconsideration" filed by petitioner National Power Corporation-Small Power Utilities Group (NPC-SPUG) is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated June 26, 2003 is hereby modified accordingly.<br><br>Relative thereto, NPC-SPUG is directed to submit a quarterly report on the following:<br><ol type="1"><li>Projects for CY 2002 undertaken;<br></li><li>Location<br></li><li>Actual amount utilized to complete the project;<br></li><li>Period of completion;<br></li><li>Start of Operation; and<br></li><li>Explanation of the reallocation of UC-ME funds, if any.<br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, on April 2, 2003, ERC decided ERC Case No. 2002-194, authorizing the NPC to draw up to P70,000,000.00 from PSALM for its 2003 Watershed Rehabilitation Budget subject to the availability of funds for the Environmental Fund component of the Universal Charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On the basis of the said ERC decisions, respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) charged  petitioner  Romeo P. Gerochi  and  all other<br><br>end-users with the Universal Charge as reflected in their respective electric bills starting from the month of July 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Hence, this original action.<br><br>Petitioners submit that the assailed provision of law and its IRR which sought to implement the same are unconstitutional on the following grounds:<br><blockquote>1) The universal charge provided for under Sec. 34 of the EPIRA and sought to be implemented under Sec. 2, Rule 18 of the IRR of the said law is a tax which is to be collected from all electric end-users and self-generating entities. The power to tax is strictly a legislative function and as such, the delegation of said power to any executive or administrative agency like the ERC is unconstitutional, giving the same unlimited authority. The assailed provision clearly provides that the Universal Charge is to be determined, fixed and approved by the ERC, hence leaving to the latter complete discretionary legislative authority.<br><br>2) The ERC is also empowered to approve and determine where the funds collected should be used.<br><br>3) The imposition of the Universal Charge on all end-users is oppressive and confiscatory and amounts to taxation without representation as the consumers were not given a chance to be heard and represented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners contend that the Universal Charge has the characteristics of a tax and is collected to fund the operations of the NPC.  They argue that the cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> invoked by the respondents clearly show the regulatory purpose of the charges imposed therein, which is not so in the case at bench. In said cases, the respective funds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> were created in order to balance and stabilize the prices of oil and sugar, and to act as buffer to counteract the changes and adjustments in prices, peso    devaluation, and other variables which cannot be adequately and timely monitored by the legislature.  Thus, there was a need to delegate powers to administrative bodies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Petitioners posit that the Universal Charge is imposed not for a similar purpose.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent PSALM through the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC) contends that unlike a tax which is imposed to provide income for public purposes, such as support of the government, administration of the law, or payment of public expenses, the assailed Universal Charge is levied for a specific regulatory purpose, which is to ensure the viability of the country's electric power industry. Thus, it is exacted by the State in the exercise of its inherent police power. On this premise, PSALM submits that there is no undue delegation of legislative power to the ERC since the latter merely exercises a limited authority or discretion as to the execution and implementation of the provisions of the EPIRA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondents Department of Energy (DOE), ERC, and NPC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), share the same view that the Universal Charge is not a tax because it is levied for a specific regulatory purpose, which is to ensure the viability of the country's electric power industry, and is, therefore, an exaction in the exercise of the State's police power. Respondents further contend that said Universal Charge does not possess the essential characteristics of a tax, that its imposition would redound to the benefit of the electric power industry and not to the public, and that its rate is uniformly levied on electricity end-users, unlike a tax which is imposed based on the individual taxpayer's ability to pay. Moreover, respondents deny that there is undue delegation of legislative power to the ERC since the EPIRA sets forth sufficient determinable standards which would guide the ERC in the exercise of the powers granted to it. Lastly, respondents argue that the imposition of the Universal Charge is not oppressive and confiscatory since it is an exercise of the police power of the State and it complies with the requirements of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On its part, respondent PECO argues that it is duty-bound to collect and remit the amount pertaining to the Missionary Electrification and Environmental Fund components of the Universal Charge, pursuant to Sec. 34 of the EPIRA and the    Decisions in ERC Case Nos. 2002-194 and 2002-165.  Otherwise, PECO could be held liable under Sec. 46<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the EPIRA, which imposes fines and penalties for any violation of its provisions or its IRR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><center><br><i><b>The Issues</b></i><br></center><br>The ultimate issues in the case at bar are:<br><blockquote>1) Whether or not, the Universal Charge imposed under Sec. 34 of the EPIRA is a tax; and<br><br>2) Whether or not there is undue delegation of legislative power to tax on the part of the ERC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Before we discuss the issues, the Court shall first deal with an obvious procedural lapse.<br><br>Petitioners filed before us an original action particularly denominated as a Complaint assailing the constitutionality of Sec. 34 of the EPIRA imposing the Universal Charge and Rule 18 of the EPIRA's IRR. No doubt, petitioners have <span style="font-style: italic;">locus standi</span>. They impugn the constitutionality of Sec. 34 of the EPIRA because they sustained a direct injury as a result of the imposition of the Universal Charge as reflected in their electric bills.<br><br>However, petitioners violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts when they filed this "Complaint" directly with us.  Furthermore, the Complaint is bereft of any allegation of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the ERC or any of the public respondents, in order for the Court to consider it as a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>or prohibition.<br><br>Article VIII, Section 5(1) and (2) of the 1987 Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> categorically provides that:<br><br>SECTION 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Exercise <span style="font-style: italic;">original jurisdiction</span> over cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and ove<span style="font-style: italic;">r petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and habeas corpus.</span></li><li>Review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on <span style="font-style: italic;">appeal or certiorari, </span>as the law or the rules of court may provide, final judgments and orders of lower courts in:<br></li></ol><blockquote>(a) All cases in which the<span style="font-style: italic;"> constitutionality or validity</span> of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question.<br></blockquote></blockquote>But this Court's jurisdiction to issue writs of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, prohibition, <span style="font-style: italic;">mandamus, quo warranto, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span>, while concurrent with that of the regional trial courts    and the Court of Appeals, does not give litigants unrestrained freedom of choice of forum from which to seek such relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It has long been established that this Court will not entertain direct resort to it unless the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts, or where exceptional and compelling circumstances justify availment of a remedy within and call for the exercise of our primary jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This circumstance alone warrants the outright dismissal of the present action.<br><br>This procedural infirmity notwithstanding, we opt to resolve the constitutional issue raised herein.  We are aware that if the constitutionality of Sec. 34 of the EPIRA is not resolved now, the issue will certainly resurface in the near future, resulting in a repeat of this litigation, and probably involving the same parties. In the public interest and to avoid unnecessary delay, this Court renders its ruling now.<br><br>The instant complaint is bereft of merit.<br><center><br><b><i>The First Issue</i></b><br></center><br>To resolve the first issue, it is necessary to distinguish the State's power of taxation from the police power.<br><br>The power to tax is an incident of sovereignty and is unlimited in its range, acknowledging in its very nature no limits, so that security against its abuse is to be found only in the responsibility of the legislature which imposes the tax on the constituency that is to pay it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It is based on the principle that taxes are the lifeblood of the government, and their prompt and certain availability is an imperious need.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, the theory behind the exercise of the power to tax emanates from necessity; without taxes, government cannot fulfill its mandate of promoting the general welfare and well-being of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, police power is the power of the state to promote public welfare by restraining and regulating the use of liberty and property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is the most pervasive, the least limitable, and the most demanding of the three fundamental powers of the State. The justification is found in the Latin maxims <span style="font-style: italic;">salus populi est suprema lex </span>(the welfare of the people is the supreme law) and <span style="font-style: italic;">sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</span> (so use your property as not to injure the property of others). As an inherent attribute of sovereignty which virtually extends to all public needs, police power grants a wide panoply of instruments through which the State, as<span style="font-style: italic;"> parens patriae, </span>gives effect to a host of its regulatory powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  We have held that the power to "regulate" means the power to protect, foster, promote, preserve, and control, with due regard for the interests, first and foremost, of the public, then of the utility and of its patrons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The conservative and pivotal distinction between these two powers rests in the purpose for which the charge is made.  If generation of revenue is the primary purpose and regulation is merely incidental, the imposition is a tax; but if regulation is the primary purpose, the fact that revenue is incidentally raised does not make the imposition a tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In exacting the assailed Universal Charge through Sec. 34 of the EPIRA, the State's police power, particularly its regulatory dimension, is invoked. Such can be deduced from Sec. 34 which enumerates the purposes for which the Universal Charge is imposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and which can be amply discerned as regulatory in character.  The EPIRA resonates such regulatory purposes, thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2.   Declaration of Policy. – It is hereby declared the policy of the State:<br><br>(a) To ensure and accelerate the total electrification of the country;<br>(b) To ensure the quality, reliability, security and affordability of the supply of electric power;<br>(c) To ensure transparent and reasonable prices of electricity in a regime of free and fair competition and full public accountability to achieve greater operational and economic efficiency and enhance the competitiveness of Philippine products in the global market;<br>(d) To enhance the inflow of private capital and broaden the ownership base of the power generation, transmission and distribution sectors;<br>(e) To ensure fair and non-discriminatory treatment of public and private sector entities in the process of restructuring the electric power industry;<br>(f) To protect the public interest as it is affected by the rates and services of electric utilities and other providers of electric power;<br>(g) To assure socially and environmentally compatible energy sources and infrastructure;<br>(h) To promote the utilization of indigenous and new and renewable energy resources in power generation in order to reduce    dependence on imported energy;<br>(i) To provide for an orderly and transparent privatization of the assets and liabilities of the National Power Corporation (NPC);<br>(j) To establish a strong and purely independent regulatory body and system to ensure consumer protection and enhance the competitive operation of the electricity market; and<br>(k) To encourage the efficient use of energy and other modalities of demand side management.<br></blockquote>From the aforementioned purposes, it can be gleaned that the assailed Universal Charge is not a tax, but an exaction in the exercise of the State's police power. Public welfare is surely promoted.<br><br>Moreover, it is a well-established doctrine that the taxing power may be used as an implement of police power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">Valmonte v. Energy Regulatory Board, et al</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and in Gaston v. Republic Planters Bank,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> this Court held that the Oil Price Stabilization Fund (OPSF) and the Sugar Stabilization Fund (SSF) were exactions made in the exercise of the police power.  The doctrine was reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Osmeña v. Orbos</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> with respect to the OPSF.  Thus, we disagree with petitioners that the instant case is different from the aforementioned cases.  With the Universal Charge, a Special Trust Fund (STF) is also created under the administration of PSALM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  The STF has some notable characteristics similar to the OPSF and the SSF, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>.:<br><blockquote>1) In the implementation of stranded cost recovery, the ERC shall conduct a review to determine whether there is under-recovery or over recovery and adjust (true-up) the level of the stranded cost recovery charge. In case of an over-recovery, the ERC shall ensure that any excess amount shall be remitted to the STF. A separate account shall be created for these amounts which shall be held in trust for any future claims of distribution utilities for stranded cost recovery. At the end of the stranded cost recovery period, any remaining amount in this account shall be used to reduce the electricity rates to the end-users.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>2) With respect to the assailed Universal Charge, if the total amount collected for the same is greater than the actual availments against it, the PSALM shall retain the balance within the STF to pay for periods where a shortfall occurs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>3) Upon expiration of the term of PSALM, the administration of the STF shall be transferred to the DOF or any of the DOF attached agencies as designated by the DOF Secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>The OSG is in point when it asseverates:<br><blockquote>Evidently, the establishment and maintenance of the Special Trust Fund, under the last paragraph of Section 34, R.A. No. 9136, is well within the pervasive and non-waivable power and responsibility of the government to secure the physical and economic survival and well-being of the community, that comprehensive sovereign authority we designate as the police power of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>This feature of the Universal Charge further boosts the position that the same is an exaction imposed primarily in pursuit of the State's police objectives. The STF reasonably serves and assures the attainment and perpetuity of the purposes for which the Universal Charge is imposed, i.e., to ensure the viability of the country's electric power industry.<br><center><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Second Issue</span><br></center><br>The principle of separation of powers ordains that each of the three branches of government has exclusive cognizance of and is supreme in matters falling within its own constitutionally allocated sphere. A logical corollary to the doctrine of separation of powers is the principle of non-delegation of powers, as expressed in the Latin maxim <span style="font-style: italic;">potestas delegata non delegari potest</span> (what has been delegated cannot be delegated). This is based on the ethical principle that such delegated power constitutes not only a right but a duty to be performed by the delegate through the instrumentality of his own judgment and not through the intervening mind of another. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the face of the increasing complexity of modern life, delegation of legislative power to various specialized administrative agencies is allowed as an exception to this principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Given the volume and variety of interactions in today's society, it is doubtful if the legislature can promulgate laws that will deal adequately with and respond promptly to the minutiae of everyday life.  Hence, the need to delegate to administrative bodies - the principal agencies tasked to execute laws in their specialized fields - the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to implement a given statute and effectuate its policies. All that is required for the valid exercise of this power of subordinate legislation is that the regulation be germane to the objects and purposes of the law and that the regulation be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by the law. These requirements are denominated as the completeness test and the sufficient standard test.<br><br>Under the first test, the law must be complete in all its terms and conditions when it leaves the legislature such that when it reaches the delegate, the only thing he will have to do is to enforce it. The second test mandates adequate guidelines or limitations in the law to determine the boundaries of the delegate's authority and prevent the delegation from running riot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that the EPIRA, read and appreciated in its entirety, in relation to Sec. 34 thereof, is complete in all its essential terms and conditions, and that it contains sufficient standards.<br><br>Although Sec. 34 of the EPIRA merely provides that "within one (1) year from the effectivity thereof, a Universal Charge to be determined, fixed and approved by the ERC, shall be imposed on all electricity end-users," and therefore, does not state the specific amount to be paid as Universal Charge, the amount nevertheless is made certain by the legislative parameters provided in the law itself.  For one, Sec. 43(b)(ii) of the EPIRA provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 43.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Functions of the ERC.</span> – The ERC shall promote competition, encourage market development, ensure customer choice and penalize abuse of market power in the restructured electricity industry. In appropriate cases, the ERC is authorized to issue cease and desist order after due notice and hearing. Towards this end, it shall be responsible for the following key functions in the restructured industry:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b)  Within six (6) months from the effectivity of this Act, promulgate and enforce, in accordance with law, a National Grid Code and a Distribution Code which shall include, but not limited to the following:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(ii) Financial  capability  standards  for   the  generating companies, the TRANSCO, distribution utilities and suppliers: Provided, That in the formulation of the financial capability standards, the nature and function of the entity shall be considered: Provided, further, That such standards are set to ensure that the electric power industry participants meet the minimum financial standards to protect the public interest. Determine, fix, and approve, after due notice and public hearings the universal charge, to be imposed on all electricity end-users pursuant to Section 34 hereof;<br></blockquote>Moreover, contrary to the petitioners' contention, the ERC does not enjoy a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of the Universal Charge.  Sec. 51(d) and (e) of the EPIRA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> clearly provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 51.  Powers. – The PSALM Corp. shall, in the performance of its functions and for the attainment of its objective, have the following powers:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(d) To calculate the amount of the stranded debts and stranded contract costs of NPC which <span style="font-weight: bold;">shall form the basis for ERC in the determination of the universal charge;</span><br><br>(e)   To liquidate the NPC stranded contract costs, utilizing the proceeds from sales and other property contributed to it, including the proceeds from the universal charge.<br></blockquote>Thus, the law is complete and passes the first test for valid delegation of legislative power.<br><br>As to the second test, this Court had, in the past, accepted as sufficient standards the following: "interest of law and order;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> "adequate and efficient instruction;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> "public interest;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> "justice and equity;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> "public convenience and welfare;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> "simplicity, economy and efficiency;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> "standardization and regulation of medical education;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> and "fair and equitable employment practices."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>   Provisions of the EPIRA such as, among others, "to ensure the total electrification of the country and the quality, reliability, security and affordability of the supply of electric power"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and "watershed rehabilitation and management"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> meet the requirements for valid delegation, as they provide the limitations on the ERC's power to formulate the IRR. These are sufficient standards.<br><br>It may be noted that this is not the first time that the ERC's conferred powers were challenged. In<span style="font-style: italic;"> Freedom from Debt Coalition v. Energy Regulatory Commission</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court had occasion to say:<br><blockquote>In determining the extent of powers possessed by the ERC, the provisions of the EPIRA must not be read in separate parts. Rather, the law must be read in its entirety, because a statute is passed as a whole, and is animated by one general purpose and intent. Its meaning cannot to be extracted from any single part thereof but from a general consideration of the statute as a whole. Considering the intent of Congress in enacting the EPIRA and reading the statute in its entirety, it is plain to see that the law has expanded the jurisdiction of the regulatory body, the ERC in this case, to enable the latter to implement the reforms sought to be accomplished by the EPIRA. When the legislators decided to broaden the jurisdiction of the ERC, they did not intend to abolish or reduce the powers already conferred upon ERC's predecessors. To sustain the view that the ERC possesses only the powers and functions listed under Section 43 of the EPIRA is to frustrate the objectives of the law.<br></blockquote>In his Concurring and Dissenting Opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> in the same case, then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice, Reynato S. Puno described the immensity of police power in relation to the delegation of powers to the ERC and its regulatory functions over electric power as a vital public utility, to wit:<br><blockquote>Over the years, however, the range of police power was no longer limited to the preservation of public health, safety and morals, which used to be the primary social interests in earlier times. <span style="font-style: italic;">Police power now requires the State to "assume an affirmative duty to eliminate the excesses and injustices that are the concomitants of an unrestrained industrial economy." Police power is now exerted "to further the public welfare " a concept as vast as the good of society itself." Hence, "police power is but another name for the governmental authority to further the welfare of society that is the basic end of all government."</span> When police power is delegated to administrative bodies with regulatory functions, its exercise should be given a wide latitude. Police power takes on an even broader dimension in developing countries such as ours, where the State must take a more active role in balancing the many conflicting interests in society. The Questioned Order was issued by the ERC, acting as an agent of the State in the exercise of police power. We should have exceptionally good grounds to curtail its exercise. This approach is more compelling in the field of rate-regulation of electric power rates. <span style="font-style: italic;">Electric power generation and distribution is a traditional instrument of economic growth that affects not only a few but the entire nation. It is an important factor in encouraging investment and promoting business. The engines of progress may come to a screeching halt if the delivery of electric power is impaired. Billions of pesos would be lost as a result of power outages or unreliable electric power services.</span> The State thru the ERC should be able to exercise its police power with great flexibility, when the need arises.<br></blockquote>This was reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms v. Energy Regulatory Commission</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> where the Court held that the ERC, as regulator, should have sufficient power to respond in real time to changes wrought by multifarious factors affecting public utilities.<br><br>From the foregoing disquisitions, we therefore hold that there is no undue delegation of legislative power to the ERC.<br><br>Petitioners failed to pursue in their Memorandum the contention in the Complaint that the imposition of the Universal Charge on all end-users is oppressive and confiscatory, and amounts to taxation without representation. Hence, such contention is deemed waived or abandoned per Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of August 3, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Moreover, the determination of whether or not a tax is excessive, oppressive or confiscatory is an issue which essentially involves questions of fact, and thus, this Court is precluded from reviewing the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>As a penultimate statement, it may be well to recall what this Court said of EPIRA:<br><blockquote>One of the landmark pieces of legislation enacted by Congress in recent years is the EPIRA. It established a new policy, legal structure and regulatory framework for the electric power industry. The new thrust is to tap private capital for the expansion and improvement of the industry as the large government debt and the highly capital-intensive character of the industry itself have long been acknowledged as the critical constraints to the program. To attract private investment, largely foreign, the jaded structure of the industry had to be addressed. While the generation and transmission sectors were centralized and monopolistic, the distribution side was fragmented with over 130 utilities, mostly small and uneconomic. The pervasive flaws have caused a low utilization of existing generation capacity; extremely high and uncompetitive power rates; poor quality of service to consumers; dismal to forgettable performance of the government power sector; high system losses; and an inability to develop a clear strategy for overcoming these shortcomings<br><br>Thus, the EPIRA provides a framework for the restructuring of the industry, including the privatization of the assets of the National Power Corporation (NPC), the transition to a competitive structure, and the delineation of the roles of various government agencies and the private entities. The law ordains the division of the industry into four (4) distinct sectors,    namely:    generation,   transmission,   distribution  and supply. Corollarily, the NPC generating plants have to privatized and its transmission business spun off and privatized thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br></blockquote>Finally, every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality, and to justify its nullification, there must be a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution and not one that is doubtful, speculative, or argumentative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Indubitably, petitioners failed to overcome this presumption in favor of the EPIRA.
