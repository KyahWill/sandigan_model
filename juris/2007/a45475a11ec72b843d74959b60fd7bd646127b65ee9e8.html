De Leon</span>, decided on 10 September 2002, respondents are the registered owners of a parcel of land.&nbsp; They voluntarily offered the subject property for sale to the government pursuant to Republic Act No. 6657. Unable to agree on the valuation of the property offered by the DAR, respondents filed a petition with the RTC (acting as a Special Agrarian Court) to fix the just compensation of the property.&nbsp; In due time, the RTC rendered judgment fixing the compensation of the property.&nbsp; Before the Court of Appeals, the DAR and LBP filed separate petitions.&nbsp; The DAR filed a Petition for Review of the decision of the RTC which was assigned to the Special 3rd Division of the appellate court.&nbsp; LBP, on the other hand, raised the case on appeal to the Court of Appeals by way of ordinary appeal.&nbsp; The same was assigned to the 4th Division of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The petition of the DAR was given due course.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Court of Appeals dismissed LBP's ordinary appeal on the ground that the same was erroneous.&nbsp; LBP filed a petition for review before this Court.&nbsp; In Land Bank, we explained:<br><blockquote>A petition for review, not an ordinary appeal, is the proper procedure in effecting an appeal from decisions of the Regional Trial Courts acting as Special Agrarian Courts in cases involving the determination of just compensation to the landowners concerned.&nbsp; Section 60 of RA 6657 clearly and categorically states that the said mode of appeal should be adopted.&nbsp; There is no room for a contrary interpretation.&nbsp; Where the law is clear and categorical, there is no room for construction, but only application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>LBP filed a Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; In a Resolution of this Court dated 20 March 2003, this Court emphasized the prospective application of the Decision dated 10 September 2002.<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration dated October 16, 2002 and the supplement to the motion for reconsideration dated November 11, 2002 are PARTIALLY GRANTED.&nbsp; While we clarify that the Decision of this Court dated September 10, 2002 stands, our ruling therein that a petition for review is the correct mode of appeal from decisions of Special Agrarian Courts <span style="font-weight: bold;">shall apply only to cases appealed after the finality of this Resolution.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>Essentially therefore, the rule is that a decision of the RTC acting as a Special Agrarian Court should be brought to the Court of Appeals via a Petition for Review.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals will no longer entertain ordinary appeals thereon.&nbsp; However, this rule applies only after the finality of the Resolution of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Land Bank of the Philippines v. De Leon</span> dated 20 March 2003.<br><br>In this case, the Court of Appeals correctly ruled when it gave due course to the appeal of LBP.&nbsp; LBP's Notice of Appeal was filed on 27 December 2001.&nbsp; This was given due course by the RTC in an Order dated 15 May 2002.&nbsp; LBP's appeal was, thus, perfected <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> this Court's Resolution in the aforementioned <span style="font-style: italic;">Land Bank of the Philippines v.

SP No. 74879 was based on technicality, that is, for failure on the part of the DAR to state material dates required by the rules.&nbsp; Having been dismissed based on a technicality and not on the merits, the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> does not apply.&nbsp;

The pleadings on record will fully support this adjudication.&nbsp; We have painstakingly gone over all of LBP's representations and arguments, and we found that the material and decisive facts are hardly disputable.&nbsp; From another perspective, due consideration should also be given to AFC and HPI for having voluntarily offered to sell their properties, a clear indication of AFC and HPI's willingness to participate in the agrarian reform program of the government.&nbsp; In turn, they must be given compensation that is <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">timely</span>.&nbsp; Records indicate that the case has been dragging on for more than ten years now without the landowners having been fully compensated.&nbsp; We cannot countenance such a glaring indifference to AFC and HPI's rights as land owners - they should be afforded all that is just and due them.&nbsp; To be sure, they deserve nothing less than full compensation to give effect to their substantive rights.<br><br>While eminent domain lies as one of the inherent powers of the state, there is no requirement that it undertake a prolonged procedure, or that the payment of the private owner be protracted as far as practicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>It is not controverted that this case started way back on 12 October 1995, when AFC and HPI voluntarily offered to sell the properties to the DAR.&nbsp; In view of the failure of the parties to agree on the valuation of the properties, the Complaint for Determination of Just Compensation was filed before the DARAB on 14 February 1997.&nbsp; Despite the lapse of more than three years from the filing of the complaint, the DARAB failed to render a decision on the valuation of the land.&nbsp; Meantime, the titles over the properties of AFC and HPI had already been cancelled and in their place a new certificate of title was issued in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, even as far back as 9 December 1996.&nbsp; A period of almost 10 years has lapsed.&nbsp; For this reason, there is no dispute that this case has truly languished for a long period of time, the delay being mainly attributable to both official inaction and indecision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> particularly on the determination of the amount of just compensation, to the detriment of AFC and HPI, which to date, have yet to be fully compensated for the properties which are already in the hands of farmer-beneficiaries, who, due to the lapse of time, may have already converted or sold the land awarded to them.<br><br>Verily, these two cases could have been disposed with dispatch were it not for LBP's counsel causing unnecessary delay.&nbsp; At the inception of this case, DARAB, an agency of the DAR which was commissioned by law to determine just compensation, sat on the cases for three years, which was the reason that AFC and HPI filed the cases before the RTC.&nbsp; We underscore the pronouncement of the RTC that "the delay by DARAB in the determination of just compensation could only mean the reluctance of the Department of Agrarian Reform and the Land Bank of the Philippines to pay the claim of just compensation by corporate landowners."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>To allow the taking of landowners' properties, and to leave them empty-handed while government withholds compensation is undoubtedly oppressive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>It is in light of the foregoing that this Court will now undertake the final resolution of the present controversy which, as already elucidated, is within the power of this Court to do.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The concept of just compensation embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also the payment of the land within a reasonable time from its taking.&nbsp;

The word "just" is used to intensify the meaning of the word "compensation" to convey the idea that the equivalent to be rendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The two main issues, thus, for determination of this Court are the date of the taking of the property and the amount of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>First, it is settled that the property was taken on 9 December 1996, when a Certificate of Title was issued in favor of the Republic of the Philippines, and the Certificates of Title of AFC and HPI were cancelled.&nbsp; The farmer-beneficiaries themselves took possession of the subject properties on 2 January 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Second, on payment of just compensation, we have previously held:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eminent domain is an inherent power of the State that enables it to forcibly acquire private lands intended for public use upon payment of just compensation to the owner.</span>&nbsp; Obviously, there is no need to expropriate where the owner is willing to sell under terms also acceptable to the purchaser, in which case an ordinary deed of sale may be agreed upon by the parties.&nbsp; It is only where the owner is unwilling to sell, or cannot accept the price or other conditions offered by the vendee, that the power of eminent domain will come into play to assert the paramount authority of the State over the interests of the property owner.&nbsp; Private rights must then yield to the irresistible demands of the public interest on the time-honored justification, as in the case of the police power, that the welfare of the people is the supreme law.<br><br>But for all its primacy and urgency, the power of expropriation is by no means absolute (as indeed no power is absolute).&nbsp; The limitation is found in the constitutional injunction that "private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation" and in the abundant jurisprudence that has evolved from the interpretation of this principle.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Basically, the requirements for a proper exercise of the power are:&nbsp; (1) public use and (2) just compensation.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote>Section 57 of Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 57.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Special Jurisdiction.</span> - The Special Agrarian Courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act.&nbsp; The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act.<br><br>The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision.</blockquote>To implement the provisions of Republic Act No. 6657, Rule XIII, Section 11 of the DARAB Rules of Procedure, provides:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Land Valuation and Preliminary Determination and Payment of Just Compensation. -</span> The decision of the Adjudicator on land valuation and preliminary determination and payment of just compensation shall not be appealable to the Board but shall be brought directly to the Regional Trial Courts designated as Special Agrarian Courts within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the notice thereof.&nbsp; Any party shall be entitled to only one motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>The next question now crops up, who shall determine just compensation?&nbsp; It is now settled that the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the RTC acting as Special Agrarian Court.&nbsp; The same cannot be lodged with administrative agencies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and may not be usurped by any other branch or official of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>We now come to the issue of just compensation.<br><br>LBP argues that the trial court's valuation of the subject landholdings has incorporated irrelevant and/or immaterial factors such as the schedule of market values given by the City Assessor of Tagum, the comparative sales of adjacent lands and the commissioners' report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, which is particularly relevant, providing as it does the guideposts for the determination of just compensation, reads, as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 17.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Determination of Just Compensation.</span> - In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered.&nbsp; The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farm-workers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></blockquote>The RTC provided the following elucidation in its assailed decision:<br><blockquote>The recommendation of the Commissioners- Report for a value of P85.00 per sq.m. or P850,000.00 per hectare (sic) is founded on evidence.&nbsp; The schedule of market values of the City of Tagum as per its 1993 and 1994 Revision of Assessment and Property Classification (Exhibit "J-6" and "CC-6") give the lowest value for residential land at P100/sq.m. for 4th class residential land in 1993.&nbsp; In 1994, it gave the lowest value of P80.00/sq.m. for barangay residential lot.&nbsp; It appears that certain portions of the land in question have been classified as Medium Industrial District (Exhibit "J-4" and "CC-4").&nbsp; The lowest value as for industrial land, 3<sup>rd</sup> class in a barangay is P130.00 sq.m.&nbsp; The average of these figures, using the lowest values in Exhibit "6" and "CC-6" yields the figure of P103.33 which is even higher by 22.2% than that recommended by the Commissioners.&nbsp; It is even of judicial notice that assessments made by local governments are much lower than real market value.&nbsp; Likewise, the value of the improvements thereon, not even considered in the average of P103.33.&nbsp; If considered, this will necessarily result in a higher average value.<br><br>In said Appraisal Report, mention has been made on "improvements," and our Supreme Court in Republic vs. Gonzales, 50 O.G. 2461, decreed the rule, as follows:<br><blockquote>If such improvements are permanent in character, consisting of good paved road, playgrounds, water system, sewerage and general leveling of the land suitable for residential lots together with electric installations and buildings, the same are important factors to consider in determining the value of the land.&nbsp; The original cost of such improvements may be considered, with due regard to the corresponding depreciation.&nbsp; (Davao vs. Dacudao, L-3741, May 8, 1952).</blockquote>Note should be taken that in said Appraisal Report, permanent improvements on plaintiffs' lands have been introduced and found existing,<span style="font-style: italic;"> e.g.,</span> all weather-road network, airstrip, pier, irrigation system, packing houses, among others, wherein substantial amount of capital funding have been invested in putting them up.<br><br>This Court, however, notes that the comparative sales (Exhibits "A" to "F") referred to in the Appraisal Report are sales made after the taking of the land in 1996.&nbsp; However, in the offer of evidence, the plaintiff offered additional comparative sales of adjacent land from late 1995 to early 1997, ranging from a high of P580.00/sq.meter in September 1996 (Exhibit "L-4" for plaintiff Apo and "EE-4" for plaintiff Hijo) to a low of P146.02/sq.meter in October 1997 (Exhibits "L-2" and "EE-2").&nbsp; The other sales in 1996 were in January 1996 for P530.00/sq.meter ( Exhs. "L-3" and "EE-3") and in December 1996 for P148.64/sq.meter (Exhs. "L-2" and "EE-1").&nbsp; On the other hand, the sale in December 1995 (Exhs. "L-5" and "EE-5") was made for P530.00/sq.meter."&nbsp; The average selling price based on the foregoing transaction is P386.93/sq.meter.&nbsp; The same is even higher by around 350% than the recommended value of P85.00, as per the Commissioners' Report.<br><br>The Cuervo Appraisal Report, on the other hand, gave a value of P84.53/sq. meter based on the Capitalized Income Approach.&nbsp; The said approach considered only the use of the land and the income generated from such use.<br><br>The just compensation for the parcels of land under consideration, taking into account the Schedule of Market Values given by the City Assessor of Tagum (Exhs. "J-6" for Apo "CC-6" for Hijo), the comparative sales covering adjacent lands at the time of taking of subject land, the Cuervo Report, and the Appraisal Report is hereby fixed at P103.33/sq.meter.<br><br>The valuation given by Cuervo and the Appraisal Report of P84.53 and P85.00, respectively, in this Court's judgment, is the minimum value of the subject landholdings and definitely cannot in anyway be the price at which plaintiffs APO and/or HIJO might be willing to sell, considering that the parcels of land adjacent thereto were sold at much higher prices, specifically from a low of P146.02/sq.meter to a high of P580.00.&nbsp; The average of the lowest value under the 1993 and 1994 Revision of Assessment and Property Classification (Exhibits "J-6" and "CC-6") were already at P103.33/sq.meter, even without considering the improvements introduced on the subject landholdings.<br><br>Moreover, the Commission made the findings that "portions of the land subject of th(e) report may x x x increase to P330.00/sq.meter, specifically th(e) strips of land surrounding the provincial roads" and made the conclusion that "(c)learly, the value recommended by th(e) Commission, which is only about P85.00/sq.meter is way below the x x x assessed values, which effectively was fixed (as early as) 1994 or earlier than the Voluntary Offer to Sell of the above plaintiffs' properties."&nbsp; In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the said assessed values are presumed to be prevailing [in] December 1996, the time of taking of plaintiffs' landholdings.&nbsp; The Commission further stated that the average of the said "assessed values as submitted by the City Assessor of Tagum City (is) P265.00/sq.meter."&nbsp; This Court, therefore, finds it unfair that the just compensation for the subject landholdings should only be fixed at P85.00/sq.meter.<br><br>It is similarly true, however, that the determination of just compensation cannot be made to the prejudice of defendants or the government for that matter.<br><br>Thus, the selling price of P580.00/sq. meter nor the average selling price of P386.93/sq. meter or the average assessed value of P265.00/sq. meter cannot be said to be the value at which defendants might be willing to buy the subject landholdings.<br><br>This Court, therefore, finds the price of P103.33/sq. meter for the subject landholdings fair and reasonable for all the parties.&nbsp; Said value is even lower than the lowest selling price of P148.64 for sale of adjacent land at the time of the taking of the subject landholdings [in] December 1996.&nbsp; It approximates, however, the average of the lowest values under the 1993 and 1994 Revision of Assessment and Property Clarification (Exhs. "J-6" and "CC-6") of P103.33.&nbsp; The said figure will further increase, if the Court will further consider the improvements introduced by plaintiffs, which should be the case.&nbsp; Moreover, the said value of P103.33/sq. meter is more realistic as it does not depart from the government recognized values as specified in the 1993 and 1994 Revised Assessment and Property Classification of Tagum City.&nbsp; This Court finds the evidence of the plaintiffs sufficient and preponderant to establish the value of P103.33/sq. meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote>The trial court further rationalized its award thus:<br><blockquote>It may be admitted that plaintiffs' properties are agricultural; however, it is simply beyond dispute that in going about the task of appraising real properties, as in the instant cases, "all the facts as to the condition of the property and its surroundings, its improvements and capabilities, may be shown and considered in estimating its value."&nbsp; (Manila Railroad Company vs. Velasquez, 32 Phil. 287, 314).&nbsp; It is undeniable that plaintiffs' agricultural lands as borne out from the records hereof, and remaining unrebutted, shows that all weather-roads network, airstrip, pier, irrigation system, packing houses, and among numerous other improvements are permanently in place and not just a measly, but substantial amounts investments have been infused.&nbsp; To exclude these permanent improvements in rendering its valuation of said properties would certainly be less than fair. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The plaintiffs' agricultural properties are just a stone's throw from the residential and/or industrial sections of Tagum City, a fact defendants-DAR and LBP should never ignore.&nbsp; The market value of the property (plus the consequential damages less consequential benefits) is determined by such factors as the value of like properties, its actual or potential use, its size, shape and location as enunciated in B.H. Berkenkotter &amp; Co. vs. Court of Appeals, 216 SCRA 584 (1992).&nbsp; To follow Defendants-DAR and LBP logic, therefore, would in effect restrict and delimit the broad judicial prerogatives of this Court in determining and fixing just compensation of properties taken by the State.<br><br>Proceedings before the Panel of Commissioners revealed that permanent improvements as mentioned above exist inside the lands subject of this complaints.&nbsp; It was also established during the trial proper upon reception of the evidence of the plaintiffs which clearly revealed the character, use and valuation of the lands surrounding the properties involved in these cases, indicating the strategic location of the properties subject of these cases.&nbsp; The findings being that surrounding properties have been classified as residential, commercial or industrial.&nbsp; And yet defendant-LBP refused to acknowledge the factual basis of the findings of the Panel of Commissioners and insisted on its guideline in determining just compensation. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote>In arriving at its valuation of the subject properties, the RTC conducted a thorough and meticulous examination of all determining factors. It did not rely merely on the report of Commissioners nor on the Cuervo appraiser's report.&nbsp; It took into consideration the schedule of market values of the City of Tagum per its 1993 and 1994 Revision of Assessment and Property Clasisification, value of the permanent improvements thereon, as well as comparative sales of adjacent lands from early 1995 to early 1997, among other factors.<br><br>Contrary to LBP's claim, the above factors are neither irrelevant nor immaterial. &nbsp;When the trial court arrived at the valuation of a landowner's property taking into account its nature as irrigated land, location along the highway, market value, assessor's value and the volume and value of its produce, such valuation is considered in accordance with Republic Act No. 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Even the Commissioners' report which the trial court took into consideration may not be dismissed as irrelevant. &nbsp;In the first place the trial court acting as a special agrarian court is authorized to appoint commissioners to assist in the determination of just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> &nbsp;In this case the Commissioners' report was submitted only after ocular inspections were conducted on the landholdings to give them a better idea of their real value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Conspicuously, the trial court did not merely rely solely on the appraisal report submitted by the Commissioners. &nbsp;The trial court conducted hearings for the purpose of receiving the parties' evidence.<br><br>Clearly evident from the records of this case is that in the proceedings before the Commission constituted by the RTC of Tagum City, Branch 2, to fix the just compensation for the properties, the LBP and the DAR were given all the opportunities to justify their stances.&nbsp; Thus:<br><blockquote>[T]he Commission set another hearing on February 23, 2001 at 9:00 a.m. at the Function Room, Marbella mansion, Rizal Street, Davao City, to give the LBP the opportunity to present evidence.&nbsp; The LBP counsels, Attys.
