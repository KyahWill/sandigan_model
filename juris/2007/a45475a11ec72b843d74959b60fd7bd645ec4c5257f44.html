The legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by use of such words as are found in the statute. <span style="font-style: italic;">Verba legis non est recedendum</span>, or from the words of a statute there should be no departure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; </blockquote>The word “report” has a definite and unambiguous meaning which is clearly different from “examination.” A report, as a noun, may be defined as “something that gives information” or&nbsp; “a usually detailed account or statement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> On the other hand, an examination is “a search, investigation or scrutiny.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>This Court cannot look for or impose&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;another meaning on the term “report” or to construe it as synonymous with “examination.” From the words used in Section 30, it is clear that RA 7653 no longer requires that an examination be made before the MB can issue a closure order. We cannot make it a requirement in the absence of legal basis.<br><br>Indeed, the court may consider the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;spirit and reason of the statute, where a literal meaning would lead to absurdity, contradiction, injustice, or would defeat the clear purpose of the lawmakers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; However, these problems are not present here.&nbsp; Using the literal meaning of “report” does not lead to absurdity, contradiction or injustice.&nbsp; Neither does it defeat the intent of the legislators.&nbsp; The purpose of the law is to make the closure of a bank summary and expeditious in order to protect public interest.&nbsp; This is also why prior notice and hearing are no longer required before a bank can be closed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <br><br>Laying down the requisites for the closure of a bank under the law is the prerogative of the legislature and what its wisdom dictates.&nbsp; The lawmakers could have easily retained the word “examination” (and in the process also preserved the jurisprudence attached to it) but they did not and instead opted to use the word “report.”&nbsp; The insistence on an examination is not sanctioned by RA 7653 and we would be guilty of judicial legislation were we to make it a requirement when such is not supported by the language of the law.<br><br>What is being raised here as grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondents was the lack of an examination and not the supposed arbitrariness with which the conclusions of the director of the Department of Rural Banks Supervision and Examination Sector had been reached in the report which became the basis of Resolution No. 105.<br><br>The absence of an examination before the closure of RBSM did not mean that there was no basis for the closure order.&nbsp; Needless to say, the decision of the MB and BSP, like any other administrative body, must have something to support itself and its findings of fact must be supported by substantial evidence. But it is clear under RA 7653 that the basis need not arise from an examination as required in the old law.<br><br>We thus rule that the MB had sufficient basis to arrive at a sound conclusion that there were grounds that would justify RBSM’s closure.&nbsp; It relied on the report of Mr. Domo-ong, the head of the supervising or examining department, with the findings that: (1) RBSM was unable to pay its liabilities as they became due in the ordinary course of business and (2) that it could not continue in business without incurring probable losses to its depositors and creditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The report was a 50-page memorandum detailing the facts supporting those grounds, an extensive chronology of events revealing the multitude of problems which faced RBSM and the recommendations based on those findings.<br><br>In short, MB and BSP complied with all the requirements of RA 7653. By relying on a report before placing a bank under receivership, the MB and BSP did not only follow the letter of the law, they&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;were also faithful to its spirit, which was to act expeditiously.&nbsp; Accordingly, the issuance of Resolution No. 105 was untainted with arbitrariness.<br><br>Having dispensed with the issue&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;decisive of this case, it becomes unnecessary to resolve the other minor issues raised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
