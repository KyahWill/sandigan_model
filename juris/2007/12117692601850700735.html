				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Per Resolution dated May 16, 2005, the Court treated the Memorandum filed by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) dated January 24, 2004 as administrative complaints against Judge Jesus S. dela Peña, (Judge dela Peña), Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 62, Oslob, Cebu, also formerly Assisting Judge, RTC Branch 56, Mandaue City; and Judge Augustine A. Vestil, (Judge Vestil), RTC Branch 56, Mandaue City, for the irregularities and procedural lapses in the conduct of trial in connection with their handling of Civil Case No. MAN-3855, a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, entitled, “<i>Mary Ann T. Castro-Roa v. Rocky Rommel D. Roa</i>” (<i>Roa</i> case).<br><br>Mary Ann T. Castro-Roa (Castro-Roa), an Assistant City Prosecutor in Cebu,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of her marriage to Rocky Rommel D. Roa (Rocky) before the RTC, Mandaue City, on June 5, 2000.&nbsp; The case was raffled to Branch 56 presided by Judge Vestil, but it was Assisting Judge dela Peña who took cognizance of the case.&nbsp; Rocky filed his Answer with Counterclaim on August 10, 2000 and the pre-trial was terminated on December 11, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Castro-Roa testified on January 29, 2001 despite the absence of Rocky.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; In her cross-examination on February 26, 2001, Rocky’s counsel, Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) lawyer Atty.

Emeline Bullecer-Cabahug issued a “<i>Constancia</i>,” submitting the Motion for Resolution “considering that the Presiding Judge was in Manila on official business.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; In his Order dated March 10, 2004, Judge Vestil granted the Motion noting that Rocky and his counsel were served a copy of the Motion yet they filed no comment or opposition thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In its Memorandum dated January 24, 2004, the OCA stated that it agrees with the CA’s findings that there were “<i>very apparent fatal irregularities</i>” in the handling of the Roa case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to wit: there was no proof that the parties were given notice for the April 10, 2001 hearing; the Minutes of the April 10, 2001 hearing was not in the records, and it was not explained why it was reset to April 24, 2001; the Minutes of April 24, 2001 merely states that petitioner formally offered her exhibits, and that for failure of the defense counsel to appear, the cross-examination was deemed waived, then on the same day, a Decision was prepared and signed by Judge dela Peña; there was no transcript of stenographic notes (TSN) of the April 24, 2001 proceedings, neither was there proof on record to show that Castro-Roa formally offered her exhibits; and no notice of hearing or any order for the April 24, 2001 setting was issued to show that Rocky was given a chance to present his evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The OCA, in addition, noted that Judge dela Peña dispensed with the requirement of certification from the OSG to show that there was no collusion among the parties, even though such was a requirement at the time.&nbsp; As to Judge Vestil, the OCA found that there was no proof that Rocky was served a copy of Castro-Roa’s Motion and records show that the Order setting the hearing of the Motion, on February 6, 2004 was received by Rocky only on February 12, 2004; despite this, Judge Vestil stated in his March 10, 2004 Order that Rocky and his counsel, who had withdrawn in 2001, were served a copy of the said motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In Compliance with the Court’s Resolution dated May 16, 2005, Judges dela Peña and Vestil filed their respective comments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In his Comment dated June 27, 2005, Judge dela Peña averred the following: He was designated as Assisting Presiding Judge of Branch 56, Mandaue City which had a load of 700 cases, in addition to his assignment as RTC Judge of Branch 62, Oslob, Cebu.&nbsp; In view of an impending transfer to another branch and in his desire to expedite the cases he was handling, he instructed his legal researcher “to get the facts” of the pending cases, one of which was the <i>Roa</i> case.&nbsp; Rocky was given chances to cross-examine Castro-Roa’s witness as well as to present his evidence.&nbsp; Rocky however failed to appear, while his lawyer Atty. Maninang refused to conduct cross-examination, saying that he was not able to confer with his client.&nbsp; Atty. Maninang was notified of all the hearings, since his office is adjacent to the court, and notice to him should be considered as notice to his client.&nbsp; The court proceeded with the case with the active participation of the Assistant City Prosecutor who represented the State.&nbsp; Due to Atty. Maninang’s failure to cross-examine and present evidence for his client, the court considered Rocky to have waived his right over the same.&nbsp; If Rocky had objections to the ruling of the court, he should have filed a motion for reconsideration, but he did not.&nbsp; Finally, the Minutes and Orders may have only been misfiled, which lapse was beyond Judge dela Peña’s control, since he had already assumed his post in Bogo in the last week of May 2001.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</span></sup><br><br>He prays that he be extended compassion by the Court since he acted in good faith, observed and applied proper procedure, rendered the judgment honestly, speedily and fairly, and was uncomplainingly obedient to the additional assignments given him by the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Judge dela Peña submitted a Supplemental Comment dated June 30, 2005 with an Affidavit executed by Rocky on June 28, 2005.&nbsp; Rocky attested that he was properly notified of all hearings, and that in the morning of April 24, 2001, he called up his lawyer and told him that he was waiving his right to present his evidence and that he was submitting the case for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In his Third Indorsement, Judge Vestil submitted the following comment: he never participated in the trial of the <i>Roa</i> case and his only participation was in the resolution of the Motion to Dismiss Petition filed by Castro-Roa; he granted the Motion four months after it was filed and only after Rocky had been allowed ample time to oppose the same; Rocky, as well as his counsel despite his withdrawal, was given notice of the hearing as well as the Order granting the Motion; while it is true that it was only on February 12, 2004 when Rocky received the notice of hearing set for February 6, 2004, still it was incumbent upon Rocky to exert efforts to verify the status of the said Motion from the time of such actual receipt; to date, however, no pleading was filed by Rocky in response to said Motion; absolutely no damage was done to Rocky as regards his counterclaim for the custody of the children, since the same can be threshed out in a separate proceeding; also, with the granting of the Motion, there was a restoration of the marital bonds between the Roas which had been severed by the Decision of Judge dela Peña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In Compliance with the Court’s Resolution dated August 22, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the OCA submitted its Memorandum dated September 11, 2006, with the following findings and recommendations:<br><blockquote>Undeniably, respondent Judge dela Peña failed to observe the requirements of prior notice and hearing before rendering the decision in Civil Case No. MAN-3855, essentially depriving Rocky of his right to due process.<br><br><i>Firstly</i>, there was an Order setting the case for hearing on April 10, 2001.&nbsp; Yet, there was nothing to show on record that the parties were properly notified thereof.&nbsp; Neither was there a Minutes of the hearing.<br><br><i>Secondly</i>, there was a Minutes of the hearing on April 24, 2001 suggesting that a Notice of Hearing on that date was sent to, and received by, the parties, as there was a notation on the Minutes declaring that (1) Rocky waived his right to cross-examine an adverse witness for his failure to appear, and (2) Castro-Roa formally offered her exhibits.&nbsp; However, no such notice or Order setting the case for hearing on April 24, 2001, much less any proof of receipt thereof by the parties was attached to the records.<br><br>All told, the manner by which the April 24, 2001 Decision was rendered was dubious.&nbsp; As Rocky was merely declared to have waived his right to cross-examine the witness for the adverse party, the next step that respondent Judge dela Peña should have taken was to set the case for the reception of Rocky’s evidence.&nbsp; He did not.&nbsp; He opted instead to decide the case in clear violation of Section 5, Rule 30 of the Revised Rules of Court, mandating the grant of opportunity for the defendant to adduce evidence.<br><br>Respondent Judge dela Peña’s attempt at exculpation all the more proves his administrative culpability.&nbsp; He admitted deciding the case hastily to free himself from going back to Branch 56 after having been designated as acting presiding judge of Branch 61 in Bogo, Cebu.&nbsp; Curiously, the administrative order designating him as such was issued on May 8, 2001 and he received a copy thereof on the third week of May 2001, or almost one (1) month after he rendered the Decision in Civil Case No. MAN-3855 on April 24, 2001.&nbsp; Hence, the haste with which he decided the case could not have been precipitated by his transfer to another court given the sufficiency of time left for him to complete the proceedings thereof before he eventually transferred to Branch 61.&nbsp; That he was informed of such designation in March 2001 was not sufficient justification to dispense with an integral component of the trial such as the presentation of evidence by the defendant.<br><br>The manner by which respondent Judge Vestil proceeded upon the Motion to Dismiss Petition was likewise suspect.&nbsp; Knowing that Rocky received the Notice of Hearing of February 6, 2004 on February 12, 2004 only, or six (6) days after that scheduled hearing, respondent Judge dela Peña went on to issue an Order on March 10, 2004 dismissing the petition without a hearing.&nbsp; It did not matter to him that Section 6, Rule 15 of the 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure mandates that “(n)o written motion set for hearing shall be acted upon by the court without proof of service thereof.”<br><br>Respondent Judge Vestil blamed Rocky for not exerting efforts to verify the status of the motion from the time he belatedly received the notice of hearing, conveniently forgetting that he himself was also absent during the scheduled hearing on February 6, 2004, which should have resulted in its cancellation and resetting.&nbsp; However, by taking it upon herself to submit the motion for resolution through a “Constancia,” Atty. Cabahug confirmed a deliberate effort to resolve the motion in Castro-Roa’s favor.&nbsp; Without a doubt, the action was highly irregular because it overstepped the regular functions of a clerk of clerk of court [sic], which are administrative in nature.&nbsp; The function to declare a motion submitted for resolution is of judicial character, and can only be exercised by the judge.&nbsp; Neither can it be delegated to his/her clerk of court.&nbsp; In this case, respondent Judge Vestil injudiciously approved, albeit impliedly, the action taken by his clerk of court when he resolved the motion a little over a month after Atty. Cabahug speciously submitted the same for resolution without anymore setting it for hearing.<br><br>Respondent Judges dela Peña and Vestil’s disregard of the basic requirements of notice and hearing was too flagrant to be ignored.&nbsp; Having accepted an exalted position as members of the judiciary, they owe to the public and to the courts over which they preside to maintain professional competence at all times and to have the basic rules at the palm of their hands.&nbsp; They, however, failed to live up to the standards.&nbsp; Unfamiliarity with the Rules of Court is a sign of incompetence.&nbsp; To disregard the law when one has become familiar with it is worse because bad faith comes in.<br><br>Gross ignorance of the law or procedure is considered a serious charge under Section 8(9) of Rule 140, as amended, of the Rules [of] Court, for which a penalty ranging from a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00 to suspension or dismissal may be imposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The OCA then recommended that:<br><blockquote><ol><li>[B]oth Judge Jesus S. dela Peña, Regional Trial Court, Branch 22, Oslob, Cebu and Judge Agustin [sic] A. Vestil, Regional Trial Court Branch 56, Mandaue City be FOUND administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law or procedure;<br><br></li><li>Judges dela Peña and Vestil be FINED each in the amount of P21,000.00, with a warning that a repetition of a similar act or infraction will be dealt with more severely; and<br><br></li><li>Atty.

Castro-Roa vs. Rocky Rommel D. Roa</i>, for resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The Court, in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated June 13, 2007, considered the case submitted for resolution, in view of the Manifestation of Judge dela Peña that he is submitting herein case for resolution on the basis of the pleadings already filed; and the failure of Judge Vestil to file any manifestation within the period given in the Court’s Resolution dated February 7, 2007, despite due notice.<br><br><center><b>The Court’s Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Court is in full accord with the findings of the OCA but not as to the recommended penalty insofar as Judge dela Peña is concerned.<br><br><b><u>Liability of Judge dela Peña</u>:</b><br><br>Judge dela Peña is guilty of gross ignorance of the law or procedure tantamount to grave abuse of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; He completely disregarded the basic provisions of the Rules of Court.<br><br>After the direct testimony and cross-examination of Castro-Roa’s witness on March 26, 2001, Judge dela Peña issued an Order setting the case for hearing on April 10, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; How it was moved to April 24, 2001 is not in the records.&nbsp; As observed by the CA, the Minutes of the April 10, 2001 hearing was not in the records and there was no explanation why the hearing was reset to April 24, 2001.<br><br>The Minutes of the hearing held on April 24, 2001, shows that Castro-Roa on that day formally offered her exhibits and, for failure of the defense counsel to appear, Judge dela Peña considered Rocky to have waived his cross-examination of Castro-Roa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; As found by the CA, there were no transcripts of stenographic notes of the hearing conducted on April 24, 2001; neither was there any proof to show that Castro-Roa formally offered her exhibits.<br><br>Judge dela Peña flagrantly violated the basic order of trial provided for in Section 5, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, which provides that after the plaintiff has adduced evidence in support of his complaint, the defendant (in this case, Rocky) shall then adduce evidence in support of his defense and his counterclaim.<br><br>It is very glaring that Judge dela Peña scandalously acted with such alarming undue haste in rendering a decision in favor of Castro-Roa on the same day that the latter purportedly offered her exhibits, without first affording Rocky the opportunity to present his own evidence; and, as noted by the OCA, without requiring the submission of the certification of the OSG as to whether he was objecting to or was in agreement with the petition, as then required in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In his Comments, Judge dela Peña could only say that it was Rocky’s failure to cross-examine Castro-Roa’s witnesses and present his own witnesses “for the reason that the lawyer has not conferred with his client [Rocky] despite his advice to him which prompt[ed] the court to consider respondent [Rocky] to have waived the cross-examination and the possible presentation of his evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; However, Judge dela Peña failed to show that there was a previous notice or warning given to Rocky that the presentation of the latter’s evidence shall take place on the very same day, April 24, 2001, after the presentation of Castro-Roa’s evidence.&nbsp; This would have justified the declaration of Judge dela Peña that Rocky had waived the presentation of his evidence.<br><br>In an attempt to show that Rocky was fully aware of all the hearings and that it was his wish to submit the case for decision on April 24, 2001, Judge dela Peña submitted to the Court an Affidavit executed by Rocky on June 28, 2005 wherein Rocky stated that he was notified of all the settings of the case and that in the morning of April 24, 2001, he called his lawyer to tell him that he was waiving his right to present evidence and that he was submitting the case for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Rocky’s affidavit does not hold water.&nbsp; It has no probative value, as it was executed only in 2005 <b>after the CA had pointed out in its Decision the irregularities committed by Judge dela Peña in the hasty rendition of the Decision in favor of Castro-Roa; and after the present administrative case was instituted</b>.&nbsp; Evidently, it is self-serving.<br><br>More importantly, said affidavit is absolutely inconsistent with the Minutes of April 24, 2001 and the Comments of Judge dela Peña.&nbsp; The Minutes show that Rocky’s counsel failed to appear on April 24, 2001 and on that basis Judge dela Peña not only deemed it as waiver of Rocky’s right to cross-examine, but also forthwith rendered a Decision against Rocky.&nbsp; And even if indeed Rocky told his lawyer in the morning of April 24, 2001 that he was waiving his right to present evidence and that he was submitting the case for decision, the Minutes show that Rocky’s counsel, Atty. Noel Maninang, was not present at the hearing held on April 24, 2001.&nbsp; There is no showing how Rocky’s counsel conveyed to Judge dela Peña that Rocky was waiving his right to present evidence and he was submitting the case for decision.<br><br>Judge dela Peña relies heavily on the admission of Rocky in his Affidavit that he had not been appearing during the presentation of Castro-Roa’s evidence despite due notice.&nbsp; To conclude that Rocky was not interested in pursuing the case is not accurate.&nbsp; As Rocky stated in his Affidavit:<br><blockquote>x x x In all the aforesaid proceedings, although I was properly notified and fully aware of, <b>I did not appear by reason of financial constraints</b>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>That I appealed the case in the Court of Appeals, but <b>I thought it wise to no longer pursue the case, again due to lack of funds</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Rocky’s Affidavit does not justify the act of Judge dela Peña in rendering judgment without giving Rocky an opportunity to present his own evidence.&nbsp; It is well to emphasize that Judge dela Peña’s Comment and the Minutes of April 24, 2001, show that it was not on the basis of any manifestation from Rocky’s counsel that he is no longer interested in pursuing the case, that Judge dela Peña rendered his premature decision.&nbsp; Rather, it was mainly because of Rocky and his counsel’s failure to appear on April 24, 2001 which Judge dela Peña deemed as waiver of Rocky’s right to cross-examine.&nbsp; At that time, Judge dela Peña had no knowledge about the “lack of interest” of Rocky in pursuing the case because such assertion was made only in the Affidavit executed in 2005 or four years after the April 24, 2001 hearing.&nbsp; Instead of scheduling the case for reception of defense evidence, as provided for in Section 5, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court, Judge dela Peña issued the decision on the same day that Castro-Roa terminated the presentation of her evidence.<br><br>Moreover, the allegation of Judge dela Peña that he decided this case immediately in anticipation of an information he received that he would be designated as acting presiding judge of another court does not exculpate him from liability.&nbsp; As aptly observed by the OCA, it was not sufficient justification to dispense with the presentation of evidence by Rocky, as defendant, and outrightly render a decision in favor of Castro-Roa on the same day.<br><br>A judge should observe the usual and traditional mode of adjudication which requires that he should hear both sides with patience and understanding to keep the risk of reaching an unjust decision at a minimum.&nbsp; A judge must neither sacrifice for expediency’s sake the fundamental requirements of due process nor forget that he must conscientiously endeavor each time to seek the truth, to know and aptly apply the law, and to dispose of the controversy objectively and impartially.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; This is especially so since marriage, which is the subject of the case before Judge dela Peña, is legally inviolable; thus, it is protected from dissolution at the whim of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>True is the principle that an administrative case is not the proper remedy for alleged errors committed by a judge in deciding a case where a judicial remedy exists.&nbsp; But in <i>Roxas v.
