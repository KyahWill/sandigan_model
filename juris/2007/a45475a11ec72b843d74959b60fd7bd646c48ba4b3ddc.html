Lacsa (respondent), then <i>Punong Barangay</i> of Bacolod, Juban, Sorsogon, with grave threats, oppression, grave misconduct, and abuse of authority.<br><br>On the directive of the then vice mayor of the Municipality of Juban in his capacity as presiding officer of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan,</span> respondent filed his Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>A Special Investigating Committee (SIC) created by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan</span> to investigate the case found sufficient evidence for the preventive suspension of respondent.  The <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan</span> thus passed a resolution recommending his preventive suspension.<br><br>Acting on the recommendation, the mayor slapped a two-month preventive suspension against respondent on January 7, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The SIC later submitted its report finding respondent guilty of oppression, grave misconduct, and abuse of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  On March 7, 2005, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Bayan</span> issued Resolution No. 12-2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> adopting the SIC Report.  By the same resolution, respondent was removed from office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On March 8, 2005, the mayor issued Executive Order No. 8, Series of 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> implementing Resolution No. 12-2005 of the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Sangguniang Bayan</span> and installing Florencio H.

Teresa Guab-Fragata.  The case was docketed as Special Civil Action No. 2005-7513.<br><br>By Decision of October 24, 2005, Branch 53 of the RTC of Sorsogon granted respondent's petition and accordingly nullified the mayor's executive order.  Thus the trial court ruled:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>[Respondent] is entitled to be informed and have a copy of the decision rendered by the Sangguniang Bayan of Juban, Sorsogon pursuant to Section 66 of R.A. 7160, for him to seek the remedies afforded by law, if he so desires.  x x x  [He] received Executive Order No. 8 and attached thereto is Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 12-2005, on the same day, March 8, 2005.  It appears that the . . . Sangguniang Bayan furnished [him] with a copy of the said resolution not to afford him his remedies on appeal in violation of Section 66 7160, but to execute said resolution hastily . . . in utmost disregard of [his] constitutional right to due process.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pursuant to Section 67 of R.A. 7160, [he] has thirty (30) days from receipt of the said resolution to file an appeal.  [He] was not afforded the opportunity to elevate Resolution No. 12-2005 on appeal.</span><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Considering the foregoing findings . . .<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the municipal mayor gravely abused her discretion,</span> amounting to lack of jurisdiction in issuing and executing Executive Order No. 8 . . .<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>The trial court thus disposed:<br><br>Wherefore, premises considered, this court grants the petition for certiorari and orders the following:<br><ol type="1"><li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">annulment and setting aside of Executive Order No. 8</span> dated March 8, 2005 issued by the Municipal Mayor;<br><br></li><li>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reinstatement</span> of . . . <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ramon H.

They fault the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><ol type="1"><li>. . . in holding that the Sangguniang Bayan of Juban, Sorsogon, furnished respondent with a copy of its Resolution No. 12-2005, not to afford him his remedy of appeal, but to execute the said resolution hastily in violation of Section 66 of R.A. 7160.<br><br></li><li>. . . in holding that the respondent Municipal Mayor issued Executive Order No. 8 in "utmost" disregard of respondent's right to due process, as pursuant to Section 67 of R.A. 7160, he has thirty days from receipt of the aforesaid resolution to file an appeal.<br><br></li><li> . . . in holding that the municipal mayor, in promptly executing Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 12-2005, committed "grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction."<br><br></li><li>The court <i>a quo </i>erred even more when it restored to respondent, through a writ of execution, the right of administrative appeal which he had abandoned and lost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></li></ol>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>The pertinent provision of R.A. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code, reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 61(c) - A complaint against any <span style="font-weight: bold;">elective <span style="text-decoration: underline;">barangay </span>official</span> shall be filed before the sangguniang panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan concerned whose <span style="font-weight: bold;">decision shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">final and executory.</span>"</span>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The "final and executory" phrase used in the immediately-quoted provision was construed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza v. Laxina, Sr</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to be "immediately executory," albeit the respondent may appeal the adverse decision to the proper office.  Thus this Court declared:<br><blockquote>Sections 61 and 67 of the Local Government Code, provide:<br><blockquote>Section 61. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Form and Filing of Administrative Complaints.</span>  A verified complaint against any erring local elective official shall be prepared as follows:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) A complaint against any elective barangay official shall be filed before the <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang panlungsod</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang bayan</span> concerned whose <span style="font-style: italic;">decision shall be final and executory</span>, (Italics supplied)<br><br>Sec. 67.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Administrative Appeals.</span> - Decisions in administrative cases may, within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof, be appealed to the following:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) the Office of the President, in the case of decisions of the <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang panlalawigan</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang panlungsod</span> of highly urbanized cities and independent component cities.<br><br>Decisions of the Office of the President shall be final and executory.<br></blockquote>In interpreting the foregoing provisions, the trial court did not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consider Section 68 of the same code </span>which provides:<br><blockquote>An appeal shall not prevent a decision from being final and executory.  The respondent shall be considered as having been placed under preventive suspension during the pendency of an appeal in the event that he wins such appeal.  In the event that the appeal results in exoneration, he shall be paid his salary and other such emoluments during the pendency of the appeal.<br></blockquote>Obviously, the said Code does not preclude the taking of an appeal.  On the contrary, it specifically allows a party to appeal to the Office of the President.  The [phrase] "final and executory" x x x in Sections 67 and 68, respectively, of the Local Government Code, are not, as erroneously ruled by the trial court, indicative of the appropriate mode of relief from the decision of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sanggunian </span>concerned.  These phrases simply mean that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the administrative appeals will not prevent the enforcement of the decisions.  The decision is <span style="font-weight: bold;">immediately executory</span> </span>but the respondent may nevertheless appeal the adverse decision to the Office of the President or to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sangguniang Panlalawigan</span>, as the case may be.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The conditions that would afford respondent to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court as he did file one before the RTC - that a tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law - are not here present.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
