Tuguegarao Branch, would like to appeal to your good end as <u>we are asking apologies for all offenses and distractions committed</u> by us against our Branch Head. We humbly acknowledge our faults. "<i>Hindi nga po naming maubos maisip kung bakit at paano naming nagawa yun sa kabila ng lahat ng kabutihang nagawa sa amin ng aming boss." Ayon nga sa kasabihan, "Ang pagsisisi ay laging nasa huli".

But then, we still seek for your further consideration and advice. PLEASE GIVE US ANOTHER CHANCE, SIR, to prove that we are sincere and to show how deeply sorry we are for all inconveniences we have done. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sana man lang, kahit ito na ang pamasko niyo sa amin.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Emphasis and italics in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Noting that Arlyn et al. had not responded to the charge of rumor-mongering, the HRDD gave them an extension of time to comply. They accordingly replied:<br><blockquote>While it is true that we did not answer the first memo sent to us, we likewise deny that such act was an admission of the offense charged to us. Please be known that during the period of five (5) days given to us to explain our side, <u>we approached Ma'am Cecil [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] and earnestly talked to her begging forgiveness for all offenses we've done</u>. The conversation we've had was very emotional and touchy. We cried deeply as we asked for another chance to show how sorry we were with deepest desires to work with her once again.<br><br>To this, <u>Ma'am Cecil [sic] recognized our sincerity and she readily forgave us</u>. It shocked us that she was able to get through with our faults despite our shortcomings. We really appreciate our boss who has a big soft heart. We then planned to start anew. Days passed and we noticed she forgot all about the issue. There's no sign of remorse in her anymore. She really has forgiven us we know. That's why, we decided not to answer the memo any longer since we have thought the problem is already over. <u>Whether we failed to comply in your first memo, our apologies.</u>     x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The HRDD likewise required Arlyn, along with her similarly charged co- employees, to explain within five days why appropriate sanction should not be imposed upon them for dishonesty, given their admission thereof during the conduct of the internal audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Arlyn's explanation reads:<br><blockquote>My admission to my participation to the misdeed was <u>deliberately made</u> during the Auditors' visit to Tug. branch simply because I would like <u>to put an end to that form of Dishonesty which we have gradually committed,</u> for one would not put a blame on the person who initiated the proposal but I would consider the wrong doing a collective responsibility of the group. It is with much regret, however, because <u>I have succumb [sic]/or gave in to such fraudulent move.</u><br><br>I love my work and the company I work with. I'm already on my 8 years working with the co. but I have not been involved on any act of dishonesty nor have been complained of administratively or otherwise. Moreover, the money pooled by us turned out to be a petty cash fund were [sic] we could borrow for emergency purposes. <u>I'm willing to return whatever amount I have benefited. I acknowledge and deeply apologized for that said shortcomings</u>. I know that with that misdeed, it has affected my integrity, which I have taken cared [sic] of a number of years. The complaint of the Branch Head was already discussed with the staff and the said problem has already been given a solution and the staff swore that they would never commit the same mistakes again. I'm also grateful to our Branch Head for having a big heart that despite the act we've done to her she still forgave us.<br><br>All I request for the company is to give me one more chance to make up for the things I have done and to proved [sic] that I'm still worthy to work in this company. Once again, I beg for the company's understanding and compassion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Arlyn et al. were soon informed about the conduct of a formal hearing of the charges on February 7, 2003 during which they could be assisted by counsel and present additional evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The records show that on the scheduled hearing on February 7, 2003, SICI employees were interviewed. There is no showing, however, if Arlyn et al. attended the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Arlyn et al. were later terminated effective March 31, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Arlyn and Elsie subsequently filed separate complaints for illegal dismissal against respondent SICI and its President-co-respondent Ernesto T. Echaus. The complaints were consolidated. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>By Decision of October 27, 2003, Executive Labor Arbiter Salvador V. Reyes found that Arlyn and Elsie were <u>illegally dismissed</u> and <u>accordingly ordered their reinstatement to their former positions,</u> without loss of seniority rights,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and the award to them of full backwages and other benefits they normally enjoyed under existing company policy, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>SICI later manifested that it opted to adopt payroll reinstatement for Arlyn and Elsie pending appeal which the Labor Arbiter approved on December 10, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> by respondents, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated September 27, 2004, <b>reversed</b> the Labor Arbiter's decision and declared valid the termination of Arlyn and Elsie's services on the grounds of loss of trust and confidence and dishonesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Arlyn and Elsie's Joint Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> having been denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> by the NLRC, Arlyn filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Court of Appeals which, by Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated August 25, 2005, it denied.<br><br>Hence, Arlyn's present Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> positing that the appellate court gravely erred<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>. . . [IN] RUL[ING] <u>THAT PETITIONER IS NOT AN ORDINARY RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEE</u> [SO] THAT SHE COULD BE DISMISSED FOR LOSS OF TRUST AND CONFIDENCE.<br><br></li><li>. . . IN <u>METING THE PENALTY OF DISMISSAL</u> TO HEREIN PETITIONER GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF MONEY ALLEGEDLY MISAPPROPRIATED WAS NEVER ESTABLISHED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</li></ol></blockquote>Arlyn also raises in her present petition the lack of "further" investigation "despite [her] insistent denial of the charge,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and the lack of opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses whose statements were submitted by Celia to prove her charge of rumor-mongering.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, Arlyn complains that after the NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision, respondents"unilaterally discontinued [her] reinstatement pending appeal contrary to prevailing laws and jurisprudence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> She thus prays that this Court "order respondent to pay the benefits due [her] from September 2004 [when after the NLRC declared her dismissal valid, respondents discontinued her reinstatement] up to [the] present pursuant to Art. 223 of the Labor Code and existing jurisprudence, pending resolution" of the present petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Arlyn's claim that she is an ordinary rank-and-file employee, hence, she cannot be dismissed for loss of trust and confidence does not lie. The observation of the Court of Appeals that "[h]er work is of such nature as to require a substantial amount of trust and confidence on the part of x x x her employer"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> is well-taken in light of her following functions, as enumerated by the NLRC:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Batches, collates and encode[s] policies, endorsements and official receipts;<br><br></li><li>Generates printed production, collection, statistical and receivable reports for submission to the Head Office;<br><br></li><li>Reconciles and finalizes production and collection reports;<br><br></li><li>Maintains the computer hardware and software; and<br><br></li><li>Performs other related functions as may be assigned to her by her superior from time to time, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>which functions "required the use of judgment and discretion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Arlyn of course incorrectly assumes that mere rank-and-file employees cannot be dismissed on the ground of loss of confidence. Jurisprudence holds otherwise albeit it requires "a higher proof of involvement" in the questioned acts.<br><blockquote>As a general rule, employers are allowed a wide latitude of discretion in terminating the employment of managerial personnel or those who, while not of similar rank, perform functions which by their nature require the employer's full trust and confidence. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required. It is sufficient that there is some basis for loss of confidence, such as when the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee concerned is responsible for the purported misconduct, and the nature of his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position. This must be distinguished from <u>the case of ordinary rank-and-file employees, whose termination on the basis of these same grounds requires a <b>higher proof of involvement</b> in the events in question</u>; mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not suffice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Even assuming that Arlyn may be considered a rank and file employee, sufficient evidence of her involvement in the dishonest scheme of SICI's accountant and cashier who were also charged and found guilty exists. Not only was her participation established by the internal audit conducted; the cashier identified her as part of the scheme,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and she herself admitted her involvement. Her claim that she merely received money from the cashier and the accountant without knowledge of its illegal source<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> is contradicted by her subsequent statement of January 7, 2003 submitted to the HRDD owning up to having participated in the scheme.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>But even assuming further that Arlyn may not be dismissed for loss of confidence, she can, on the ground of fraud or betrayal of trust, following Article 282 of the Labor Code which provides that:<br><blockquote>An employer may terminate an employee for any of the following causes:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) <b>Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative</b>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) <b>Other causes analogous to the foregoing</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Arlyn's argument that "Even granting that there was withdrawal from the [Branch Head's] commissions, [SICI] was not even prejudiced financially [and] its income was not diminished [as the withdrawn amounts were not] diverted from its coffers"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> fails. <i>Etcuban, Jr. v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> instructs that:<br><blockquote>"x x x Whether or not the respondent was financially prejudiced is <u>immaterial</u>. Also, what matters is not the amount involved, be it paltry or gargantuan; rather the <u>fraudulent scheme in which the petitioner was involved, which constitutes a clear betrayal of trust and confidence.</u>" x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As for Arlyn's claim that she was denied due process and her admission was improvidently obtained,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the records of the case show otherwise. In addition to the conduct of an internal audit during which she was heard, the requirements of twin-notice and hearing were complied with.<br><br>Respecting Arlyn's claim that she was denied a chance to cross-examine Celia's witnesses who executed statements substantiating the charge of rumor-mongering, Arlyn's joint statements which she and her co-employees executed admitting the truth of the said charge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> rendered it unnecessary to cross-examine the witnesses.<br><br>As for the propriety of dismissal as a penalty in light of Arlyn's eight years of service during which, so she claims, she committed no infraction, the doctrines established in <i>Salvador v. Philippine Mining Service Corp.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>To be sure, length of service is taken into consideration in imposing the penalty to be meted an erring employee. However, the case at bar involves <u>dishonesty</u> and pilferage by petitioner which resulted in respondent's loss of confidence in him. Unlike other just causes for dismissal, <u>trust in an employee, once lost is difficult, if not impossible, to regain</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>and in <i>Flores v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>The fact that petitioner worked for private respondent for twenty-one (21) years, if it is to be considered at all, should be taken against him. <u>The infraction that he committed, vis-à-vis his long years of service with the company, reflects a regrettable <span style="font-weight: bold;">lack of loyalty</span></u>. Loyalty that he should have strengthened instead of betrayed. <u>If an employee's length of service is to be regarded as a justifying circumstance in moderating the penalty of dismissal, it will actually become a prize for disloyalty</u>, perverting the meaning of social justice and undermining the efforts of labor to cleanse its ranks of all undesirables.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>apply.<br><br>Finally, on Arlyn's claim that respondents "unilaterally withheld [her] payroll reinstatement" after the NLRC reversed on September 27, 2004 the Labor Arbiter's decision, Article 223, paragraph 6 of the Labor Code provides that the decision of the NLRC on appeals from decisions of the Labor Arbiter "shall become final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties." The 2002 New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC provided:<br><blockquote>RULE VII<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>SECTION 14. FINALITY OF DECISION OF THE COMMISSION AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT. — (a) Finality of the Decisions, Resolutions or Orders of the Commission.

EFFECT OF FILING OF PETITION FOR CERTIORARI ON EXECUTION. — A petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court shall not stay the execution of the assailed decision unless a temporary restraining order is issued by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, Arlyn received the September 27, 2004 NLRC decision on October 25, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and the January 31, 2005 NLRC Resolution denying her Motion for Reconsideration on February 23, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> There is no showing that the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order to enjoin the execution of the NLRC decision, as affirmed by its Resolution of January 31, 2005.<br><br>If above-quoted paragraph (a) of Section 14 of Rule VII of the 2002 NLRC New Rules of Procedure were followed, the decision of the NLRC would have become final and executory on March 7, 2005, ten (10) calendar days from February 25, 2005. The NLRC, however, issued on June 16, 2005 a Notice of Entry of Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> stating that the NLRC Resolution of January 31, 2005 became final and executory on April 16, 2005, apparently following the above-quoted last paragraph of Section 14 of Rule VII. No objection having been raised by any of the parties to the declaration in the Notice of Entry of Judgment of the date of finality of the NLRC January 31, 2005 Resolution, Arlyn's payroll reinstatement ended on April 16, 2005. It goes without saying that since this Court is sustaining the NLRC decision, no issue of payroll reinstatement may be considered at all after April 16, 2005.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is, in light of the foregoing discussions, <b>DENIED</b> and the questioned decision of the court <i>a quo</i> is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> in that respondent Standard Insurance Co., Inc. is ordered to pay the salaries due petitioner, Arlyn Bago, from the time her payroll reinstatement was withheld after the promulgation on September 27, 2004 of the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission until April 16, 2005 when it became final and executory.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> NLRC records, Vol. I, pp. 41, 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 102-104. <i><u>Vide</u></i> handwritten statements, id. at 117-119, 124-129.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 134.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 56-60.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 52-53, 71.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 54.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 67.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 61, 71. <u>Vide</u> handwritten admissions, id. at 117-119, 124-129.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 63.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 68.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 75-76.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 1, 15; NLRC records, Vol. II, pp. 1, 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 158.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 158-159.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 315-316; <i>rollo,</i> pp. 521-523. <i><u>Vide</u></i> Labor Code, Article 223 (third paragraph):<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div>In any event, the decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal.

NLRC, 356 Phil. 811, 816 (1998).<br><br>On the first issue, we find and so hold that the decision of the NLRC had become final and executory when PPI filed its Petition for Certiorari in the CA. PPI received a copy of the NLRC Decision on July 11, 2003 and filed the Motion for Reconsideration thereof on July 18, 2003, which motion was denied on September 30, 2003. Under Rule VII [sic], Section 2 [sic] of the NLRC Omnibus Rules of Procedure [sic], the decision of the NLRC becomes final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the same. PPI received a copy of the NLRC decision on November 30, 2003; hence, such decision became final and executory on December 3, 2003. Nonetheless, the Court ruled in <i>St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC</i> that, although the 10-day period for finality of the NLRC decision may have elapsed as contemplated in the last paragraph of Section 223 of the Labor Code, the CA may still take cognizance of and resolve a petition for certiorari for the nullification of the decision of the NLRC on jurisdictional and due process considerations.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> This rule has been substantially incorporated in the NLRC 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure which became effective on January 6, 2006, thus:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">RULE XI<br></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Section 10.
