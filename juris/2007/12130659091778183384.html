This law, dated January 16, 1981, states:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, Presidential Decree No. 605<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> prohibits the issuance by the courts of restraining orders or injunctions in cases involving concessions, licenses, and other permits issued by administrative officials or bodies for the exploitation, development and utilization of natural resources of the country;<br><br>WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to adopt a similar prohibition against the issuance of such restraining orders or injunctions in other areas of activity equally critical to the economic development effort of the nation, in order not to disrupt or hamper the pursuit of essential government projects;<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution, do hereby decree and order as follows:<br><br>Section 1.&nbsp; <b>No court in the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any </b>restraining order, <b>preliminary injunction</b>, or preliminary mandatory injunction <b>in any case, dispute or controversy involving an infrastructure project</b>, or a mining, fishery, forest or other natural resource development project <b>of the government</b>, or any public utility operated by the government, including among others[,] public utilities for the transport of goods or commodities, stevedoring and arrastre contracts, <b>to prohibit any person or persons, entity or governmental official from proceeding with,</b> <b>or continuing the execution or implementation of any such project, </b>or the operation of such public utility, <b>or pursuing any lawful activity necessary for such execution, implementation or operation.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>PD 1818 proscribes the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in any case involving an infrastructure project of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The aim of the prohibition, as expressed in its second whereas clause, is to prevent delay in the implementation or execution of government infrastructure projects (particularly through the use of provisional remedies) to the detriment of the greater good since it disrupts the pursuit of essential government projects and frustrates the economic development effort of the nation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that the collection of toll fees is not an infrastructure project of the government. He cites the definition of "infrastructure projects" we used in <i>Republic v. Silerio</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><blockquote>The term "infrastructure projects" means "construction, improvement and rehabilitation of roads, and bridges, railways, airports, seaports, communication facilities, irrigation, flood control and drainage, water supply and sewage systems, shore protection, power facilities, national buildings, school buildings, hospital buildings, and other related construction projects that form part of the government capital investment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>He contends that the MCTEP does not involve the construction of a road since the Coastal Road already existed since the early 1980s and UMPC merely upgraded it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; He also asserts that since the project was financed by a foreign group, it does not "form part of the government capital investment" that makes it a government infrastructure project as contemplated by PD 1818.<br><br>Respondents counter that the Coastal Road was repaired, rehabilitated and upgraded by UMPC, and thus falls under infrastructure projects as defined.&nbsp; Furthermore, the collection of toll fees is necessary to the execution and implementation of the MCTEP because part of the fees collected, after meeting the operation and maintenance expenses of the expressway, is used by UMPC to pay the commercial loans it incurred to finance the project. Therefore, if collection is enjoined, not only will the operation and maintenance of the Coastal Road be affected but the construction and completion of the other components of the project will also be disrupted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>According to UMPC, the obligations of public respondents under the TOA undeniably show that the MCTEP is an infrastructure project that forms part of the government's capital investment. They are obliged to finance the acquisition of lands needed for the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The TOA also provides that the government of the Philippines owns the toll expressways comprising the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The CA held that the MCTEP is a government project considering that the government, through the TRB, is one of the contracting parties of the TOA.&nbsp; It is an infrastructure project because it involves the construction, design, operation and maintenance of the expressways. The collection of toll fees is an activity necessary for the execution, implementation or operation of this infrastructure project of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>We agree.<br><br>The definition of infrastructure projects specifically includes the improvement and rehabilitation of roads and not just its construction.&nbsp; Accordingly, even if the Coastal Road was merely upgraded and not constructed from scratch, it is still covered by the definition.&nbsp; Moreover, PD 1818 itself states that any person, entity or governmental official cannot be prohibited from continuing the execution or implementation of such project or pursuing any lawful activity necessary for such execution or implementation. Undeniably, the collection of toll fees is part of the execution or implementation of the MCTEP as agreed upon in the TOA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The TOA is valid since it has not been nullified. Thus it is a legitimate source of rights and obligations. It has the force and effect of law between the contracting parties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and is entitled to recognition by this Court. The MCTEP is an infrastructure project of the government forming part of the government capital investment considering that under the TOA, the government owns the expressways comprising the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Next, petitioner argues that PD 1818 does not extend to injunctions or restraining orders against administrative acts in controversies involving facts or the exercise of discretion in technical cases.<br><blockquote>In a spate of cases, this Court declared that although [PD 1818] prohibits any court from issuing injunctions in cases involving infrastructure projects, the prohibition extends only to the issuance of injunctions or restraining orders against administrative acts in controversies involving facts or the exercise of discretion in technical cases. On issues clearly outside this dimension and involving questions of law, this Court declared that courts could not be prevented from exercising their power to restrain or prohibit administrative acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>It is founded on the principle that to allow the courts to determine such matters would disturb the smooth functioning of the administrative machinery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Considering the co-equal status of the three branches of government, courts may not tread into matters requiring the exercise of discretion of a functionary or office in the executive and legislative branches, unless it is clearly shown that the government official or office concerned abused his or its discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious, arbitrary and whimsical exercise of power. The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, as not to act at all in contemplation of law or where power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Futhermore,<br><blockquote>xxx courts, as a rule, refuse to interfere with proceedings undertaken by administrative bodies or officials in the exercise of administrative functions. This is so because such bodies are generally better equipped technically to decide administrative questions and that non-legal factors, such as government policy on the matter, are usually involved in the decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>The imposition of toll fees, fixing the amount thereof and its proper collection are technical matters public respondents are surely more knowledgeable about than the courts.&nbsp; This is clear from the powers and duties conferred on them by their charters.<br><br>Under Section 5 (k), PD 1084, PEA is authorized to collect tolls:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5.&nbsp; Powers and functions of [PEA]. â€• [PEA] shall, in carrying out the purposes for which it is created, have the following powers and functions:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; xxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br></div> <table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">k.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">To issue such regulations as may be necessary for the proper use by private parties of any or all of the highways, roads, utilities, buildings and/or any of its properties and to impose or collect fees or tolls for their use provided that all receipts by [PEA] from fees, tolls and other charges are automatically appropriated for its use.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Under Section 3 of PD 1112, the TRB was tasked to supervise the collection of toll fees:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3.&nbsp; Powers and Duties of the [TRB].&nbsp; The [TRB] shall have in addition to its general powers of administration the following powers and duties:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; xxx<br></div><br> <table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">d.</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Issue, modify and promulgate from time to time the rates of toll that will be charged the direct users of toll facilities and upon notice and hearing, to approve or disapprove petitions for the increase thereof. xxxx</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In <i>Padua v. Hon. Ranada,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><i> </i>we stated:<br><blockquote>The TRB, as the agency assigned to supervise the collection of toll fees and the operation of toll facilities, has the necessary expertise, training and skills to judiciously decide matters of this kind. As may be gleaned from the petition, the main thrust of petitioner Zialcita's argument is that the provisional toll rate adjustments are exorbitant, oppressive, onerous and unconscionable. This is obviously a question of fact requiring knowledge of the formula used and the factors considered in determining the assailed rates. Definitely, this task is within the province of the TRB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>The arguments petitioner advances to show that public respondents committed grave abuse of discretion already go into the validity of the TOA itself or its terms, which was the subject of the main case in the court below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; The issue that we are tackling here -- the propriety of the issuance of an injunction -- merely involves the collection of toll fees in the Coastal Road. Petitioner also claims that there were irregularities committed by the respondents. While it is true that PD 1818 was not intended to shield irregularities committed by administrative agencies from judicial scrutiny,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> petitioner has not proven the supposed anomalies and they remain as mere unsubstantiated claims. These factual issues were not passed upon by the courts below and we decline to resolve them now considering that we are not a trier of facts. In any event, as a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Consequently, there is no showing that public respondents abused their discretion in imposing and collecting the toll fees. These are provided for in the TOA which, as mentioned earlier, remains valid since it has not been declared invalid by any court. Also, the presumption that official duty was performed regularly has not been overturned.<br><br>We now rule on the motion to cite in contempt filed by petitioner against UMPC and its counsel, Castillo and Poblador Law Offices, particularly Atty. Napoleon J. Poblador and Atty. Manuel Joseph R. Bretaña III. Petitioner alleges that they should be cited for contempt for misrepresenting to the Court in their memorandum dated November 17, 2000 that UEM and MARA were still the stockholders of UMPC when in fact the Coastal Road Corporation (CRC) had already bought their shares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; UMPC stated:<br><blockquote>87.&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner's malicious assertions, the Republic of the Philippines and public respondent PEA selected private respondent (<b>then represented by its stockholders MARA and UEM</b>) based on established guidelines of the national government on joint venture agreements between government agencies and the private sector. xxx Private respondent, therefore, could only assume, as it reasonably assumed, that these government agencies performed their functions in accordance with law and only after scrutinizing the qualifications of private respondent's stockholders - UEM and MARA.<br><br>88.&nbsp; Private respondent is more than qualified to be the joint venture partner of public respondent PEA based on the track record of its aforementioned stockholders.<br>&nbsp;<table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">88.1 </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">MARA is an instrumentality or corporate agency of the Malaysian government.

It has an authorized capital stock of RM500,000,000 or approximately P5,000,000,000.00. It is one of Malaysia's largest engineering, design and construction groups with direct and indirect interests in five (5) publicly listed companies on the KLSE. xxxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In their comment on the motion, Attys. Poblador and Bretaña stated that they had nothing to do with the sale of UEM and MARA of their 283,744 shares in UMPC as other law firms, namely, Castillo Laman Tan Pantaleon &amp; San Jose Law Offices representing UEM and Sycip Salazar Hernandez &amp; Gatmaitan Law Offices representing CRC were involved. The sale was approved by the TRB on November 18, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>We do not think that UMPC and its counsels should be sanctioned for contempt.<br><br>Counsels can be held in contempt of court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> for making false statements in the pleadings they file<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> tending to mislead the Court and to degrade the administration of justice. We cannot see any deliberate falsehood or misrepresentation in the aforequoted statements of Attys. Poblador and Bretaña. On the contrary, they truthfully indicated that UEM and MARA were the former stockholders of UMPC.&nbsp; This is the clear import of the phrase "then represented by its stockholders MARA and UEM." This also implied that they had been replaced as such. Besides, the ownership structure of UMPC as a party in this case was never material to the issue for resolution which is the issuance of a writ of injunction for the collection of toll fees. Hence, the Court was not deceived in any way.<br><br>Petitioner also insists that they be cited in contempt for showing disrespect and resorting to offensive language against RTC Judge Guadiz, Jr. when they stated:<br><blockquote>Despite the obvious legality of the project, petitioner, either by sheer arrogance or a malicious refusal to acknowledge the truth - that the [MCTEP] and the imposition of toll fees for the use of the Coastal Road are legal and above board - initiated what is no more than a nuisance suit and secured from an <b>insufficiently-informed judge</b> an illegal writ of preliminary injunction which public respondent, the Honorable [CA], subsequently reversed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Attys. Poblador and Bretaña, in their defense, countered that there was nothing insulting or disparaging in describing someone as "insufficiently informed." This was not intemperate language amounting to vilification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>They are correct. In criticizing a judge's decision, the test is whether it is done in good faith:<br><blockquote>While the Court recognizes a litigant's right to criticize judges and justices in the performance of their functions, "it is the cardinal condition of all such criticism that it shall be <i>bona fide</i> and shall not spill over the walls of decency and propriety. A wide chasm exists between fair criticism, on the one hand, and abuse and slander of courts and the judges (or justices) thereof, on the other. Intemperate and unfair criticism is a gross violation of the duty of respect to courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>We cannot say that the use of the adjective "insufficiently-informed" is disrespectful, abusive or slanderous. Besides,<br><blockquote>[it] is well settled that the power to punish a person in contempt of court is inherent in all courts to preserve order in judicial proceedings and to uphold the due administration of justice. Judges however are enjoined to exercise such power judiciously and sparingly, with utmost restraint, and with the end in view of utilizing the same for correction and preservation of the dignity of the court, and not for retaliation or vindictiveness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>Therefore, we deny petitioner's motion to cite in contempt for lack of merit.<br><br>In sum, PD 1818 prohibits the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the collection of toll fees for the use of the Coastal Road. None of the exceptions to this proscription is applicable here.&nbsp; The collection of toll fees for R-1 Expressway, one of the components of the MCTEP, is an activity necessary for the execution of a government infrastructure project covered by the protective mantle of PD 1818.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that the MCTEP was identified by the government as an "urgent necessity to support the rapid development of the Calabarzon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> area, particularly the province of Cavite."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Accordingly, no preliminary injunction can be issued enjoining or preventing its implementation. We need not go into a discussion of whether petitioner was able to prove the requisites for its issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>To emphasize, we have limited ourselves to the issue of propriety of the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. We are not resolving the substantive issues presented such as the validity of the TOA.&nbsp; We leave this to the RTC for resolution after trial on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED.</b> The July 28, 1998 decision and September 23, 1998 resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
