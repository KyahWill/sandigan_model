Ssangyong reiterated its request for the facilitation of the L/C's opening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Ssangyong later, through its Manila Office, sent a letter, on June 26, 2000, to the Treasury Group of Sanyo Seiki that it was looking forward to receiving the L/C details and a cable copy thereof that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Ssangyong sent a separate letter of the same date to Sanyo Seiki requesting for the opening of the L/C covering payment of the first 100MT not later than June 28, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Similar letters were transmitted by Ssangyong Manila Office on June 27, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; On June 28, 2000, Ssangyong sent another facsimile letter to MCC stating that its principal in Korea was already in a difficult situation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> because of the failure of Sanyo Seiki and MCC to open the L/C's.<br><br>The following day, June 29, 2000, Ssangyong received, by fax, a letter signed by Chan, requesting an extension of time to open the L/C because MCC's credit line with the bank had been fully availed of in connection with another transaction, and MCC was waiting for an additional credit line.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> On the same date, Ssangyong replied, requesting that it be informed of the date when the L/C would be opened, preferably at the earliest possible time, since its Steel Team 2 in Korea was having problems and Ssangyong was incurring warehousing costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> To maintain their good business relationship and to support MCC in its financial predicament, Ssangyong offered to negotiate with its steel manufacturer, POSCO, another US$20/MT discount on the price of the stainless steel ordered. This was intimated in Ssangyong's June&nbsp; 30, 2000 letter to MCC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On July 6, 2000, another follow-up letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> for the opening of the L/C was sent by Ssangyong to MCC.<br><br>However, despite Ssangyong's letters, MCC failed to open a letter of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, on August 15, 2000, Ssangyong, through counsel, wrote Sanyo Seiki that if the L/C's were not opened, Ssangyong would be compelled to cancel the contract and hold MCC liable for damages for breach thereof amounting to US$96,132.18, inclusive of warehouse expenses, related interests and charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Later, <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice Nos. <b>ST2-POSTS080-1</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and <b>ST2-POSTS080-2</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated August 16, 2000 were issued by Ssangyong and sent via fax to MCC. The invoices slightly varied the terms of the earlier <i>pro forma</i> invoices (ST2-POSTSO401, ST2-POSTS0401-1 and ST2-POSTS0401-2), in that the quantity was now officially <b>100MT</b> per invoice and the price was reduced to <b>US$1,700.00</b> per MT. As can be gleaned from the photocopies of the said August 16, 2000 invoices submitted to the court, they both bear the conformity signature of MCC Manager Chan.<br><br>On August 17, 2000, MCC finally opened an L/C with PCIBank for US$170,000.00 covering payment for 100MT of stainless steel coil under <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Pro Forma</i><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Invoice No. </span><b style="text-decoration: underline;">ST2-POSTS080-2</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The goods covered by the said invoice were then shipped to and received by MCC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>MCC then faxed to Ssangyong a letter dated August 22, 2000 signed by Chan, requesting for a price adjustment of the order stated in <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice No. <b>ST2-POSTS080-1</b>, considering that the prevailing price of steel at that time was US$1,500.00/MT, and that MCC lost a lot of money due to a recent strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Ssangyong rejected the request, and, on August 23, 2000, sent a demand letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> to Chan for the opening of the second and last L/C of US$170,000.00 with a warning that, if the said L/C was not opened by MCC on August 26, 2000, Ssangyong would be constrained to cancel the contract and hold MCC liable for US$64,066.99 (representing cost difference, warehousing expenses, interests and charges as of August 15, 2000) and other damages for breach.&nbsp; Chan failed to reply.<br><br>Exasperated, Ssangyong through counsel wrote a letter to MCC, on September 11, 2000, canceling the sales contract under <b>ST2-POSTS0401-1</b>/<b>ST2-POSTS0401-2</b>, and demanding payment of US$97,317.37 representing losses, warehousing expenses, interests and charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Ssangyong then filed, on November 16, 2001, a civil action for damages due to breach of contract against defendants MCC, Sanyo Seiki and Gregory Chan before the Regional Trial Court of Makati City. In its complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Ssangyong alleged that defendants breached their contract when they refused to open the L/C in the amount of US$170,000.00 for the remaining 100MT of steel under <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice Nos. <b>ST2-POSTS0401-1 </b>and <b>ST2-POSTS0401-2</b>.<br><br>After Ssangyong rested its case, defendants filed a Demurrer to Evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> alleging that Ssangyong failed to present the original copies of the <i>pro forma</i> invoices on which the civil action was based. In an Order dated April 24, 2003, the court denied the demurrer, ruling that the documentary evidence presented had already been admitted in the December 16, 2002 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and their admissibility finds support in Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8792, otherwise known as the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000. Considering that both testimonial and documentary evidence tended to substantiate the material allegations in the complaint, Ssangyong's evidence sufficed for purposes of a prima<i> </i>facie<i> </i>case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> on March 24, 2004, in favor of Ssangyong. The trial court ruled that when plaintiff agreed to sell and defendants agreed to buy the 220MT of steel products for the price of US$1,860 per MT, the contract was perfected. The subject transaction was evidenced by <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice Nos. <b>ST2-POSTS0401-1 </b>and <b>ST2-POSTS0401-2</b>, which were later amended only in terms of reduction of volume as well as the price per MT, following <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice Nos. <b>ST2-POSTS080-1</b> and <b>ST2-POSTS080-2</b>. The RTC, however, excluded Sanyo Seiki from liability for lack of competent evidence. The <i>fallo </i>of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, Judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants MCC Industrial Sales Corporation and Gregory Chan, to pay plaintiff, jointly and severally the following:<br><br>1) Actual damages of US$93,493.87 representing the outstanding principal claim plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum from March 30, 2001.<br><br>2) Attorney's fees in the sum of P50,000.00 plus P2,000.00 per counsel's appearance in court, the same being deemed just and equitable considering that by reason of defendants' breach of their obligation under the subject contract, plaintiff was constrained to litigate to enforce its rights and recover for the damages it sustained, and therefore had to engage the services of a lawyer.<br><br>3) Costs of suit.<br><br>No award of exemplary damages for lack of sufficient basis.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>On April 22, 2004, MCC and Chan, through their counsel of record, Atty. Eladio B. Samson, filed their Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> On June 8, 2004, the law office of Castillo Zamora &amp; Poblador entered its appearance as their collaborating counsel.<br><br>In their Appeal Brief filed on March 9, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> MCC and Chan raised before the CA the following errors of the RTC:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> PLAINLY ERRED IN FINDING THAT APPELLANTS VIOLATED THEIR CONTRACT WITH APPELLEE<br><br><ol type="A"><li>THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> PLAINLY ERRED IN FINDING THAT APPELLANTS AGREED TO PURCHASE 200 METRIC TONS OF STEEL PRODUCTS FROM APPELLEE, INSTEAD OF ONLY 100 METRIC TONS.<br></li></ol><blockquote><ol><li>THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> PLAINLY ERRED IN ADMITTING IN EVIDENCE THE <i>PRO FORMA</i> INVOICES WITH REFERENCE NOS.

The appellate court ruled, among others, that <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice Nos. <b>ST2-POSTS0401-1 </b>and <b>ST2-POSTS0401-2 </b>(Exhibits "E", "E-1" and "F") were admissible in evidence, although they were mere facsimile printouts of MCC's steel orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The dispositive portion of the appellate court's decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court holds:<br><br>(1) The award of actual damages, with interest, attorney's fees and costs ordered by the lower court is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>(2) Appellant Gregory Chan is hereby ABSOLVED from any liability.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>A copy of the said Decision was received by MCC's and Chan's principal counsel, Atty. Eladio B. Samson, on September 14, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Their collaborating counsel, Castillo Zamora &amp; Poblador,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> likewise, received a copy of the CA decision on September 19, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>On <b>October 4, 2005</b>, Castillo Zamora &amp; Poblador, on behalf of MCC, filed a motion for reconsideration of the said decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Ssangyong opposed the motion contending that the decision of the CA had become final and executory on account of the failure of MCC to file the said motion within the reglementary period.&nbsp; The appellate court resolved, on November 22, 2005, to deny the motion on its merits,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> without, however, ruling on the procedural issue raised.<br><br>Aggrieved, MCC filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><i> </i>before this Court, imputing the following errors to the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A LEGAL QUESTION NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH JURISPRUDENCE AND SANCTIONED A DEPARTURE FROM THE USUAL AND ACCEPTED COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BY REVERSING THE COURT <i>A QUO'</i>S DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINT IN CIVIL CASE NO. 02-124 CONSIDERING THAT:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN SUSTAINING THE ADMISSIBILITY IN EVIDENCE OF THE PRO-FORMA INVOICES WITH REFERENCE NOS. ST2-POSTSO401-1 AND ST2-POSTSO401-2, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SAME WERE MERE PHOTOCOPIES OF FACSIMILE PRINTOUTS.<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT, EVEN ASSUMING PETITIONER BREACHED THE SUPPOSED CONTRACT, THE FACT IS THAT PETITIONER FAILED TO PROVE THAT IT SUFFERED ANY DAMAGES AND THE AMOUNT THEREOF.<br><br></li><li>THE AWARD OF ACTUAL DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT OF US$93,493.87 IS SIMPLY UNCONSCIONABLE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST REDUCED, IF NOT DELETED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote>In its Comment, Ssangyong sought the dismissal of the petition, raising the following arguments: that the CA decision dated 15 August 2005 is already final and executory, because MCC's motion for reconsideration was filed beyond the reglementary period of 15 days from receipt of a copy thereof, and that, in any case, it was a <i>pro forma</i> motion; that MCC breached the contract for the purchase of the steel products when it failed to open the required letter of credit; that the printout copies and/or photocopies of facsimile or telecopy transmissions were properly admitted by the trial court because they are considered original documents under R.A. No. 8792; and that MCC is liable for actual damages and attorney's fees because of its breach, thus, compelling Ssangyong to litigate.<br><br>The principal issues that this Court is called upon to resolve are the following:<br><br>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the CA decision dated 15 August 2005 is already final and executory;<br><br>II&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the print-out and/or photocopies of facsimile transmissions are electronic evidence and admissible as such;<br><br>III -&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether there was a perfected contract of sale between MCC and Ssangyong, and, if in the affirmative, whether MCC breached the said contract; and<br><br>IV -&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the award of actual damages and attorney's fees in favor of Ssangyong is proper and justified.<br><br><center>- I -<br></center><br>It cannot be gainsaid that in <i>Albano v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> we held that receipt of a copy of the decision by one of several counsels on record is notice to all, and the period to appeal commences on such date even if the other counsel has not yet received a copy of the decision.&nbsp; In this case, when Atty. Samson received a copy of the CA decision on September 14, 2005, MCC had only fifteen (15) days within which to file a motion for reconsideration conformably with Section 1, Rule 52 of the Rules of Court, or to file a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> in accordance with Section 2, Rule 45.&nbsp; The period should not be reckoned from September 29, 2005 (when Castillo Zamora &amp; Poblador received their copy of the decision) because notice to Atty. Samson is deemed notice to collaborating counsel.<br><br>We note, however, from the records of the CA, that it was Castillo Zamora &amp; Poblador, not Atty. Samson, which filed both MCC's and Chan's Brief and Reply Brief.&nbsp; Apparently, the arrangement between the two counsels was for the collaborating, not the principal, counsel to file the appeal brief and subsequent pleadings in the CA.&nbsp; This explains why it was Castillo Zamora &amp; Poblador which filed the motion for the reconsideration of the CA decision, and they did so on October 5, 2005, well within the 15-day period from September 29, 2005, when they received their copy of the CA decision.&nbsp; This could also be the reason why the CA did not find it necessary to resolve the question of the timeliness of petitioner's motion for reconsideration, even as the CA denied the same.<br><br>Independent of this consideration though, this Court assiduously reviewed the records and found that strong concerns of substantial justice warrant the relaxation of this rule.<br><br>In <i>Philippine Ports Authority v. Sargasso Construction and Development Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><i> </i> we ruled that:<br><blockquote>In <i>Orata v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>, we held that where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, this Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its legal jurisdiction. In addition to the basic merits of the main case, such a petition usually embodies justifying circumstance which warrants our heeding to the petitioner's cry for justice in spite of the earlier negligence of counsel. As we held in <i>Obut v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><blockquote>[W]e cannot look with favor on a course of action which would place the administration of justice in a<i> </i>straight jacket for then the result would be a poor kind of justice if there would be justice at all. Verily, judicial orders, such as the one subject of this petition, are issued to be obeyed, nonetheless a non-compliance is to be dealt with as the circumstances attending the case may warrant. What should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant is to be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on technicalities.<br></blockquote>The rules of procedure are used only to secure and not override or frustrate justice. A six-day delay in the perfection of the appeal, as in this case, does not warrant the outright dismissal of the appeal. In <i>Development Bank of the </i><i>Philippines</i><i> vs. Court of Appeals</i>, we gave due course to the petitioner's appeal despite the late filing of its brief in the appellate court because such appeal involved public interest. We stated in the said case that the Court may exempt a particular case from a strict application of the rules of procedure where the appellant failed to perfect its appeal within the reglementary period, resulting in the appellate court's failure to obtain jurisdiction over the case. In <i>Republic vs. Imperial, Jr.</i>, we also held that there is more leeway to exempt a case from the strictness of procedural rules when the appellate court has already obtained jurisdiction over the appealed case.&nbsp; We emphasize that:<br><blockquote>[T]he rules of procedure are mere tools intended to facilitate the attainment of justice, rather than frustrate it. A strict and rigid application of the rules must always be eschewed when it would subvert the rule's primary objective of enhancing fair trials and expediting justice. Technicalities should never be used to defeat the substantive rights of the other party. Every party-litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Moreover, it should be remembered that the Rules were promulgated to set guidelines in the orderly administration of justice, not to shackle the hand that dispenses it.&nbsp; Otherwise, the courts would be consigned to being mere slaves to technical rules, deprived of their judicial discretion.&nbsp; Technicalities must take a backseat to substantive rights.&nbsp; After all, it is circumspect leniency in this respect that will give the parties the fullest opportunity to ventilate the merits of their respective causes, rather than have them lose life, liberty, honor or property on sheer technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The other technical issue posed by respondent is the alleged <i>pro forma</i> nature of MCC's motion for reconsideration, ostensibly because it merely restated the arguments previously raised and passed upon by the CA.<br><br>In this connection, suffice it to say that the mere restatement of arguments in a motion for reconsideration does not <i>per se </i>result in a <i>pro forma</i> motion.&nbsp; In <i>Security Bank and Trust Company, Inc. v. Cuenca</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we held that a motion for reconsideration may not be necessarily <i>pro forma</i> even if it reiterates the arguments earlier passed upon and rejected by the appellate court.&nbsp; A movant may raise the same arguments precisely to convince the court that its ruling was erroneous.&nbsp; Furthermore, the <i>pro forma</i> rule will not apply if the arguments were not sufficiently passed upon and answered in the decision sought to be reconsidered.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">- II -<br></div><br>The second issue poses a novel question that the Court welcomes.&nbsp; It provides the occasion for this Court to pronounce a definitive interpretation of the equally innovative provisions of the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 (R.A. No. 8792) <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Rules on Electronic Evidence.<br><br>Although the parties did not raise the question whether the original facsimile transmissions are "electronic data messages" or "electronic documents" within the context of the Electronic Commerce Act (the petitioner merely assails as inadmissible evidence the photocopies of the said facsimile transmissions), we deem it appropriate to determine first whether the said fax transmissions are indeed within the coverage of R.A. No. 8792 before ruling on whether the photocopies thereof are covered by the law. In any case, this Court has ample authority to go beyond the pleadings when, in the interest of justice or for the promotion of public policy, there is a need to make its own findings in order to support its conclusions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends that the photocopies of the <i>pro forma </i>invoices presented by respondent Ssangyong to prove the perfection of their supposed contract of sale are inadmissible in evidence and do not fall within the ambit of R.A. No. 8792, because the law merely admits as the best evidence the <i>original</i> fax transmittal. On the other hand, respondent posits that, from a reading of the law and the Rules on Electronic Evidence, the original facsimile transmittal of the <i>pro forma </i>invoice is admissible in evidence since it is an electronic document and, therefore, the best evidence under the law and the Rules. Respondent further claims that the photocopies of these fax transmittals (specifically <b>ST2-POSTS0401-1</b> and <b>ST2-POSTS0401-2</b>) are admissible under the Rules on Evidence because the respondent sufficiently explained the non-production of the original fax transmittals.<br><br>In resolving this issue, the appellate court ruled as follows:<br><blockquote><i>Admissibility of Pro Forma <br></i><i>Invoices; Breach of Contract <br></i><i>by Appellants</i><br><br>Turning first to the appellants' argument against the admissibility of the Pro Forma Invoices with Reference Nos. ST2-POSTS0401-1 and ST2-POSTS0401-2 (Exhibits "E", "E-1" and "F", pp. 215-218, Records), appellants argue that the said documents are inadmissible <i>(sic)</i> being violative of the best evidence rule.<br><br>The argument is untenable.<br><br>The copies of the said pro-forma invoices submitted by the appellee are admissible in evidence, although they are mere electronic facsimile printouts of appellant's orders. Such facsimile printouts are considered Electronic Documents under the New Rules on Electronic Evidence, which came into effect on August 1, 2001. (Rule 2, Section 1 [h], A.M. No. 01-7-01-SC).<br><blockquote>"(h) `Electronic document' refers to information or the representation of information, data, figures, symbols or other modes of written expression, described or however represented, by which a right is established or an obligation extinguished, or by which a fact may be proved and affirmed, which is received, recorded, transmitted, stored, processed, retrieved or produced electronically.

And to telecopy is <i>to send a document from one place to another via a fax machine</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>As further guide for the Court in its task of statutory construction, Section 37 of the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 provides that<br><blockquote>Unless otherwise expressly provided for, the interpretation of this Act <i>shall give due regard to its international origin</i> and the need to promote uniformity in its application and the observance of good faith in international trade relations. The generally accepted principles of international law and convention on electronic commerce shall likewise be considered.<br></blockquote>Obviously, the "international origin" mentioned in this section can only refer to the UNCITRAL Model Law, and the UNCITRAL's definition of "data message":<br><blockquote>"Data message" means information generated, sent, received or stored by electronic, optical or similar means <i>including, but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>is substantially the same as the IRR's characterization of an "electronic data message."<br><br>However, Congress deleted the phrase, "<i>but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy</i>," and replaced the term "data message" (as found in the UNCITRAL Model Law ) with "electronic data message." This legislative divergence from what is assumed as the term's "international origin" has bred uncertainty and now impels the Court to make an inquiry into the true intent of the framers of the law. Indeed, in the construction or interpretation of a legislative measure, the primary rule is to search for and determine the intent and spirit of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> A construction should be rejected that gives to the language used in a statute a meaning that does not accomplish the purpose for which the statute was enacted, and that tends to defeat the ends which are sought to be attained by the enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Interestingly, when Senator Ramon B. Magsaysay, Jr., the principal author of Senate Bill 1902 (the predecessor of R.A. No. 8792), sponsored the bill on second reading, he proposed to adopt the term "data message" as formulated and defined in the UNCITRAL Model Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> During the period of amendments, however, the term evolved into "<i>electronic</i> data message," and the phrase "<i>but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy</i>" in the UNCITRAL Model Law was deleted. Furthermore, the term "electronic data message," though maintaining its description under the UNCITRAL Model Law, except for the aforesaid deleted phrase, <i>conveyed</i> <i>a different meaning</i>, as revealed in the following proceedings:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Senator Santiago.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. President.

In light of the acceptance by the good Senator of my proposed amendments, it will then become necessary to add certain terms in our list of terms to be defined.&nbsp; I would like to add a definition on what is "data," what is "electronic record" and what is an "electronic record system."<br><br>If the gentleman will give me permission, I will proceed with the proposed amendment on Definition of Terms, Section 5.<br><br>Senator Magsaysay.&nbsp; Please go ahead, Senator Santiago.<br><br>Senator Santiago.&nbsp; We are in Part 1, short title on the Declaration of Policy, Section 5, Definition of Terms.<br><br>At the appropriate places in the listing of these terms that have to be defined since these are arranged alphabetically, Mr. President, I would like to insert the term DATA and its definition. So, the amendment will read: "DATA" MEANS REPRESENTATION, IN ANY FORM, OF INFORMATION OR CONCEPTS.<br><br>The explanation is this: This definition of "data" or "data" as it is now fashionably pronounced in America - - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the definition of "data" ensures that our bill applies to any form of information in an electronic record, whether these are figures, facts or ideas</span>.<br><br>So again, the proposed amendment is this: "DATA" MEANS REPRESENTATIONS, IN ANY FORM, OF INFORMATION OR CONCEPTS.<br><br>Senator Magsaysay. May I know how will this affect the definition of "Data Message" which encompasses electronic records, electronic writings and electronic documents?<br><br>Senator Santiago. These are completely congruent with each other. These are compatible. When we define "data," we are simply reinforcing the definition of what is a data message.<br><br>Senator Magsaysay. It is accepted, Mr. President.<br><br>Senator Santiago. Thank you. The next term is "ELECTRONIC RECORD." The proposed amendment is as follows:<br><br>"ELECTRONIC RECORD" MEANS DATA THAT IS RECORDED OR STORED ON ANY MEDIUM IN OR BY A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER SIMILAR DEVICE, THAT CAN BE READ OR PERCEIVED BY A PERSON OR A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER SIMILAR DEVICE. IT INCLUDES A DISPLAY, PRINTOUT OR OTHER OUTPUT OF THAT DATA.<br><br>The explanation for this term and its definition is as follows: The term "ELECTRONIC RECORD" fixes the scope of our bill. The record is the data. The record may be on any medium. It is electronic because it is recorded or stored in or by a computer system or a similar device.<br><br>The amendment is intended to apply, for example, to data on magnetic strips on cards or in Smart cards. <b><i>As drafted, it would not apply to telexes or faxes, except computer-generated faxes, unlike the United Nations model law on electronic commerce.</i></b> <i>It would also not apply to regular digital telephone conversations since the information is not recorded. It would apply to voice mail since the information has been recorded in or by a device similar to a computer. Likewise, video records are not covered. Though when the video is transferred to a website, it would be covered because of the involvement of the computer. Music recorded by a computer system on a compact disc would be covered.</i><br><br><i>In short, not all data recorded or stored in digital form is covered. A computer or a similar device has to be involved in its creation or storage. The term "similar device" does not extend to all devices that create or store data in digital form. Although things that are not recorded or preserved by or in a computer system are omitted from this bill, these may well be admissible under other rules of law. This provision focuses on replacing the search for originality proving the reliability of systems instead of that of individual records and using standards to show systems reliability.</i><br><br><i>Paper records that are produced directly by a computer system such as printouts are themselves electronic records being just the means of intelligible display of the contents of the record. Photocopies of the printout would be paper record subject to the usual rules about copies, but the original printout would be subject to the rules of admissibility of this bill.</i><br><br><i>However, printouts that are used only as paper records and whose computer origin is never again called on are treated as paper records. In that case, the reliability of the computer system that produces the record is irrelevant to its reliability.</i><br><br>Senator Magsaysay. Mr. President, if my memory does not fail me, earlier, the lady Senator accepted that we use the term "Data Message" rather than "ELECTRONIC RECORD" in being consistent with the UNCITRAL term of "Data Message." <i>So with the new amendment of defining "ELECTRONIC RECORD," will this affect her accepting of the use of "Data Message" instead of "ELECTRONIC RECORD"</i>?<br><br>Senator Santiago. No, it will not. Thank you for reminding me. <i>The term I would like to insert is ELECTRONIC DATA MESSAGE in lieu of "ELECTRONIC RECORD."</i><br><br>Senator Magsaysay. <i>Then we are, in effect, <b>amending the term of the definition of "Data Message" on page 2A, line 31, to which we have no objection</b></i>.<br><br>Senator Santiago. Thank you, Mr. President.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Senator Santiago.&nbsp; Mr. President, I have proposed all the amendments that I desire to, including the amendment on the effect of error or change. I will provide the language of the amendment together with the explanation supporting that amendment to the distinguished sponsor and then he can feel free to take it up in any session without any further intervention.<br><br>Senator Magsaysay. Before we end, Mr. President, I understand from the proponent of these amendments that these are based on the <i>Canadian E-commerce Law of 1998</i>. Is that not right?<br><br>Senator Santiago. <i>That is correct</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, when the Senate consequently voted to adopt the term "electronic data message," it was consonant with the explanation of Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago that it would not apply "<i>to telexes or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">faxes</span>, except computer-generated faxes, unlike the United Nations model law on electronic commerce.</i>" In explaining the term "electronic record" patterned after the E-Commerce Law of Canada, Senator Defensor-Santiago had in mind the term "electronic data message." This term then, while maintaining part of the UNCITRAL Model Law's terminology of "data message," has assumed a different context, this time, consonant with the term "electronic record" in the law of Canada.&nbsp; It accounts for the addition of the word "electronic" and the deletion of the phrase "<i>but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy.</i>" Noteworthy is that the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, explains the term "electronic record," as drafted in the Uniform Electronic Evidence Act, in a manner strikingly similar to Sen. Santiago's explanation during the Senate deliberations:<br><blockquote>"Electronic record" fixes the scope of the Act. The record is the data. The record may be any medium. It is "electronic" because it is recorded or stored in or by a computer system or similar device. The Act is intended to apply, for example, to data on magnetic strips on cards, or in smart cards. As drafted, <i>it would not apply to telexes or faxes (except computer-generated faxes), unlike the United Nations Model Law on Electronic Commerce.</i> It would also not apply to regular digital telephone conversations, since the information is not recorded. It would apply to voice mail, since the information has been recorded in or by a device similar to a computer. Likewise video records are not covered, though when the video is transferred to a Web site it would be, because of the involvement of the computer. Music recorded by a computer system on a compact disk would be covered.<br><br>In short, not all data recorded or stored in "digital" form is covered. A computer or similar device has to be involved in its creation or storage. The term "similar device" does not extend to all devices that create or store data in digital form. Although things that are not recorded or preserved by or in a computer system are omitted from this Act, they may well be admissible under other rules of law. This Act focuses on replacing the search for originality, proving the reliability of systems instead of that of individual records, and using standards to show systems reliability.<br><br>Paper records that are produced directly by a computer system, such as printouts, are themselves electronic records, being just the means of intelligible display of the contents of the record. Photocopies of the printout would be paper records subject to the usual rules about copies, but the "original" printout would be subject to the rules of admissibility of this Act.<br><br>However, printouts that are used only as paper records, and whose computer origin is never again called on, are treated as paper records. See subsection 4(2). In this case the reliability of the computer system that produced the record is relevant to its reliability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></blockquote>There is no question then that when Congress formulated the term "electronic data message," it intended the same meaning as the term "electronic record" in the Canada law. This construction of the term "electronic data message," which <i>excludes telexes or faxes, except computer-generated faxes</i>, is in harmony with the Electronic Commerce Law's focus on "paperless" communications and the "functional equivalent approach"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> that it espouses. In fact, the deliberations of the Legislature are replete with discussions on paperless and digital transactions.<br><br>Facsimile transmissions are not, in this sense, "paperless," but verily are paper-based.<br><br>A facsimile machine, which was first patented in 1843 by Alexander Bain,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> is a device that can send or receive pictures and text over a telephone line. It works by digitizing an image--dividing it into a grid of dots. Each dot is either on or off, depending on whether it is black or white. Electronically, each dot is represented by a bit that has a value of either 0 (off) or 1 (on). In this way, the fax machine translates a picture into a series of zeros and ones (called a bit map) that can be transmitted like normal computer data. On the receiving side, a fax machine reads the incoming data, translates the zeros and ones back into dots, and reprints the picture.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> A fax machine is essentially an image scanner, a modem and a computer printer combined into a highly specialized package. The scanner converts the content of a physical document into a digital image, the modem sends the image data over a phone line, and the printer at the other end makes a duplicate of the original document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Thus, in <i>Garvida v. Sales, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> where we explained the unacceptability of filing pleadings through fax machines, we ruled that:<br><blockquote>A facsimile or fax transmission is a process involving the transmission and reproduction of printed and graphic matter by scanning an original copy, one elemental area at a time, and representing the shade or tone of each area by a specified amount of electric current. The current is transmitted as a signal over regular telephone lines or via microwave relay and is used by the receiver to reproduce an image of the elemental area in the proper position and the correct shade. The receiver is equipped with a stylus or other device that produces a printed record on paper referred to as a facsimile.<br><br>x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A facsimile is not a genuine and authentic pleading. It is, at best, an exact copy preserving all the marks of an original. Without the original, there is no way of determining on its face whether the facsimile pleading is genuine and authentic and was originally signed by the party and his counsel. It may, in fact, be a sham pleading</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, in an ordinary facsimile transmission, there exists an original <i>paper-based</i> information or data that is scanned, sent through a phone line, and re-printed at the receiving end. Be it noted that in enacting the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, Congress intended <i>virtual or paperless</i> writings to be the <i>functional</i> equivalent and to have the same <i>legal function</i> as paper-based documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Further, in a virtual or paperless environment, technically, there is no original copy to speak of, as all direct printouts of the virtual reality are the same, in all respects, and are considered as originals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Ineluctably, the law's definition of "electronic data message," which, as aforesaid, is interchangeable with "electronic document," could not have included <i>facsimile transmissions</i>, which have an <i>original paper-based</i> copy <i>as sent</i> and a <i>paper-based</i> <i>facsimile</i> copy <i>as received</i>. These two copies are distinct from each other, and have different legal effects.&nbsp; While Congress anticipated future developments in communications and computer technology<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> when it drafted the law, it excluded the early forms of technology, like telegraph, telex and telecopy (except computer-generated faxes, which is a newer development as compared to the ordinary fax machine to fax machine transmission), when it defined the term "electronic data message."<br><br>Clearly then, the IRR went beyond the parameters of the law when it adopted verbatim the UNCITRAL Model Law's definition of "data message," without considering the intention of Congress when the latter deleted the phrase "<i>but not limited to, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic mail, telegram, telex or telecopy</i>."<i> </i>The inclusion of this phrase in the IRR offends a basic tenet in the exercise of the rule-making power of administrative agencies.&nbsp; After all, the power of administrative officials to promulgate rules in the implementation of a statute is necessarily limited to what is found in the legislative enactment itself. The implementing rules and regulations of a law cannot extend the law or expand its coverage, as the power to amend or repeal a statute is vested in the Legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Thus, if a discrepancy occurs between the basic law and an implementing rule or regulation, it is the former that prevails, because the law cannot be broadened by a mere administrative issuance--an administrative agency certainly cannot amend an act of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Had the Legislature really wanted ordinary fax transmissions to be covered by the mantle of the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, it could have easily lifted without a bit of tatter the entire wordings of the UNCITRAL Model Law.<br><br>Incidentally, the National Statistical Coordination Board Task Force on the Measurement of E-Commerce,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> on November 22, 2006, recommended a working definition of "electronic commerce," as "[a]ny commercial transaction conducted through electronic, optical and similar medium, mode, instrumentality and technology. The transaction includes the sale or purchase of goods and services, between individuals, households, businesses and governments conducted over computer-mediated networks through the Internet, mobile phones, electronic data interchange (EDI) and other channels through open and closed networks."&nbsp; The Task Force's proposed definition is similar to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD's) broad definition as it covers transactions made over any network, and, in addition, it adopted the following provisions of the OECD definition: (1) for transactions, it covers sale or purchase of goods and services; (2) for channel/network, it considers any computer-mediated network and NOT limited to Internet alone; (3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it excludes transactions received/placed using </span><i style="text-decoration: underline;">fax</i>, telephone or non-interactive mail; (4) it considers payments done online or offline; and (5) it considers delivery made online (like downloading of purchased books, music or software programs) or offline (deliveries of goods).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>We, therefore, conclude that <i>the terms "electronic data message" and "electronic document," as defined under the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, do not include a facsimile transmission</i>.&nbsp; Accordingly, a <i>facsimile transmission</i> cannot be considered as <i>electronic evidence.&nbsp; </i>It is not the functional equivalent of an original under the Best Evidence Rule and is not admissible as <i>electronic evidence</i>.<br><br>Since a facsimile transmission is not an "electronic data message" or an "electronic document," and cannot be considered as electronic evidence by the Court, with greater reason is a photocopy of such a fax transmission not electronic evidence.

After sifting through the records, the Court found that these invoices are <b>mere photocopies</b> of their original fax transmittals. Ssangyong avers that these documents were prepared after MCC asked for the splitting of the original order into two, so that the latter can apply for an L/C with greater facility. It, however, failed to explain why the originals of these documents were not presented.<br><br>To determine whether these documents are admissible in evidence, we apply the ordinary Rules on Evidence, for as discussed above we cannot apply the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 and the Rules on Electronic Evidence.<br><br>Because these documents are mere photocopies, they are simply secondary evidence, admissible only upon compliance with Rule 130, Section 5, which states, "[w]hen the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on his part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated." Furthermore, the offeror of secondary evidence must prove the predicates thereof, namely: (a) the loss or destruction of the original without bad faith on the part of the proponent/offeror which can be shown by circumstantial evidence of routine practices of destruction of documents; (b) the proponent must prove by a fair preponderance of evidence as to raise a reasonable inference of the loss or destruction of the original copy; and (c) it must be shown that a diligent and <i>bona fide</i> but unsuccessful search has been made for the document in the proper place or places. It has been held that where the missing document is the foundation of the action, more strictness in proof is required than where the document is only collaterally involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Given these norms, we find that respondent failed to prove the existence of the original fax transmissions of Exhibits E and F, and likewise did not sufficiently prove the loss or destruction of the originals.&nbsp; Thus, Exhibits E and F cannot be admitted in evidence and accorded probative weight.<br><br>It is observed, however, that respondent Ssangyong did not rely merely on Exhibits E and F to prove the perfected contract. It also introduced in evidence a variety of other documents, as enumerated above, together with the testimonies of its witnesses. Notable among them are <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice Nos. <b>ST2-POSTS<span style="text-decoration: underline;">080-1</span></b> and <b>ST2-POSTS<span style="text-decoration: underline;">080-2</span></b> which were issued by Ssangyong and sent via fax to MCC. As already mentioned, these invoices slightly varied the terms of the earlier invoices such that the quantity was now officially <b>100MT</b> per invoice and the price reduced to <b>US$1,700.00</b> per MT. The copies of the said August 16, 2000 invoices submitted to the court bear the conformity signature of MCC Manager Chan.<br><br><i>Pro Forma </i>Invoice No. <b>ST2-POSTS080-1</b> (Exhibit "X"), however, is a mere photocopy of its original. But then again, petitioner MCC does not assail the admissibility of this document in the instant petition. Verily, evidence not objected to is deemed admitted and may be validly considered by the court in arriving at its judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Issues not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned.<br><br>As to <i>Pro Forma</i> Invoice No. <b>ST2-POSTS080-2</b> (Exhibits "1-A" and "2-C"), which was certified by PCIBank as a true copy of its original,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> it was, in fact, petitioner MCC which introduced this document in evidence. Petitioner MCC paid for the order stated in this invoice. Its admissibility, therefore, is not open to question.<br><br>These invoices (<b>ST2-POSTS0401, ST2-POSTS080-1</b> and <b>ST2-POSTS080-2</b>), along with the other unchallenged documentary evidence of respondent Ssangyong, preponderate in favor of the claim that a contract of sale was perfected by the parties.<br><br>This Court also finds merit in the following observations of the trial court:<br><blockquote>Defendants presented Letter of Credit (Exhibits "1", "1-A" to "1-R") referring to Pro Forma Invoice for Contract No. ST2POSTS080-2, in the amount of US$170,000.00, and which bears the signature of Gregory Chan, General Manager of MCC. Plaintiff, on the other hand, presented Pro Forma Invoice referring to Contract No. ST2-POSTS080-1, in the amount of US$170,000.00, which likewise bears the signature of Gregory Chan, MCC. Plaintiff accounted for the notation "1/2" on the right upper portion of the Invoice, that is, that it was the first of two (2) pro forma invoices covering the subject contract between plaintiff and the defendants. Defendants, on the other hand, failed to account for the notation "2/2" in its Pro Forma Invoice (Exhibit "1-A"). Observably further, both Pro Forma Invoices bear the same date and details, which logically mean that they both apply to one and the same transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br></blockquote>Indeed, why would petitioner open an L/C for the second half of the transaction if there was no first half to speak of?<br><br>The logical chain of events, as gleaned from the evidence of both parties, started with the petitioner and the respondent agreeing on the sale and purchase of 220MT of stainless steel at US$1,860.00 per MT. This initial contract was <i>perfected</i>. Later, as petitioner asked for several extensions to pay, adjustments in the delivery dates, and discounts in the price as originally agreed, the parties slightly varied the terms of their contract, without necessarily novating it, to the effect that the original order was reduced to 200MT, split into two deliveries, and the price discounted to US$1,700 per MT. Petitioner, however, paid only half of its obligation and failed to open an L/C for the other 100MT. Notably, the conduct of both parties sufficiently established the existence of a contract of sale, even if the writings of the parties, because of their contested admissibility, were not as explicit in establishing a contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Appropriate conduct by the parties may be sufficient to establish an agreement, and while there may be instances where the exchange of correspondence does not disclose the exact point at which the deal was closed, the actions of the parties may indicate that a binding obligation has been undertaken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>With our finding that there is a valid contract, it is crystal-clear that when petitioner did not open the L/C for the first half of the transaction (100MT), despite numerous demands from respondent Ssangyong, petitioner breached its contractual obligation. It is a well-entrenched rule that the failure of a buyer to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breach of the contract between buyer and seller. Indeed, where the buyer fails to open a letter of credit as stipulated, the seller or exporter is entitled to claim damages for such breach. Damages for failure to open a commercial credit may, in appropriate cases, include the loss of profit which the seller would reasonably have made had the transaction been carried out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">- IV -<br></div><br>This Court, however, finds that the award of actual damages is not in accord with the evidence on record. It is axiomatic that actual or compensatory damages cannot be presumed, but must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> In <i>Villafuerte v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> we explained that:<br><blockquote>Actual or compensatory damages are those awarded in order to compensate a party for an injury or loss he suffered. They arise out of a sense of natural justice and are aimed at repairing the wrong done. Except as provided by law or by stipulation, a party is entitled to an adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss as he has duly proven. It is hornbook doctrine that to be able to recover actual damages, the claimant bears the onus of presenting before the court actual proof of the damages alleged to have been suffered, thus:<br><blockquote>A party is entitled to an adequate compensation for such pecuniary loss actually suffered by him as he has duly proved. Such damages, to be recoverable, must not only be capable of proof, but must actually be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty. We have emphasized that these damages cannot be presumed and courts, in making an award must point out specific facts which could afford a basis for measuring whatever compensatory or actual damages are borne.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>In the instant case, the trial court awarded to respondent Ssangyong US$93,493.87 as actual damages. On appeal, the same was affirmed by the appellate court. Noticeably, however, the trial and the appellate courts, in making the said award, relied on the following documents submitted in evidence by the respondent: (1) Exhibit "U," the Statement of Account dated March 30, 2001; (2) Exhibit "U-1," the details of the said Statement of Account); (3) Exhibit "V," the contract of the alleged&nbsp; resale of the goods to a Korean corporation; and (4) Exhibit "V-1," the authentication of the resale contract from the Korean Embassy and certification from the Philippine Consular Office.<br><br>The statement of account and the details of the losses sustained by respondent due to the said breach are, at best, self-serving. It was respondent Ssangyong itself which prepared the said documents. The items therein are not even substantiated by official receipts. In the absence of corroborative evidence, the said statement of account is not sufficient basis to award actual damages. The court cannot simply rely on speculation, conjecture or guesswork as to the fact and amount of damages, but must depend on <i>competent</i> proof that the claimant had suffered, and on evidence of, the actual amount thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the sales contract and its authentication certificates, Exhibits "V" and "V-1," allegedly evidencing the resale at a loss of the stainless steel subject of the parties' breached contract, fail to convince this Court of the veracity of its contents. The steel items indicated in the sales contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> with a Korean corporation are different in all respects from the items ordered by petitioner MCC, even in size and quantity. We observed the following discrepancies:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">List of commodities as stated in Exhibit "V"</span>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">COMMODITY: Stainless Steel HR Sheet in Coil, Slit Edge<br>SPEC:&nbsp;&nbsp; SUS304 NO. 1<br>SIZE/Q'TY:<br></div></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 120px;">2.8MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.193MT<br>3.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.736MT<br>3.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.885MT<br>3.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.629MT<br>4.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.307MT<br>4.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.247MT<br>4.5MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.450MT<br>4.5MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.870MT<br>5.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.391MT<br>6.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.589MT<br>6.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.878MT<br>6.0MM X 1,219MM X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.397MT<br>_______________________________<br><br>TOTAL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95.562MT<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br></div><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">List of commodities as stated in Exhibit "X" (the invoice that was not paid)</span>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">DESCRIPTION: Hot Rolled Stainless Steel Coil SUS 304<br>SIZE AND QUANTITY:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">2.6 MM X 4' X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.0MT<br>3.0 MM X 4' X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25.0MT<br>4.0 MM X 4' X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.0MT<br>4.5 MM X 4' X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15.0MT<br>5.0 MM X 4' X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.0MT<br>6.0 MM X 4' X C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25.0MT<br>_______________________________<br><br>TOTAL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100MT<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></div></blockquote>From the foregoing, we find merit in the contention of MCC that Ssangyong did not adequately prove that the items resold at a loss were the same items ordered by the petitioner. Therefore, as the claim for actual damages was not proven, the Court cannot sanction the award.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court finds that petitioner knowingly breached its contractual obligation and obstinately refused to pay despite repeated demands from respondent. Petitioner even asked for several extensions of time for it to make good its obligation. But in spite of respondent's continuous accommodation, petitioner completely reneged on its contractual duty. For such inattention and insensitivity, MCC must be held liable for nominal damages. "Nominal damages are `recoverable where a legal right is technically violated and must be vindicated against an invasion that has produced no actual present loss of any kind or where there has been a breach of contract and no substantial injury or actual damages whatsoever have been or can be shown.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Accordingly, the Court awards nominal damages of P200,000.00 to respondent Ssangyong.<br><br>As to the award of attorney's fees, it is well settled that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate and not every winning party is entitled to an automatic grant of attorney's fees.

The Model Law is based on the recognition that legal requirements prescribing the use of traditional paper-based documentation constitute the main obstacle to the development of modern means of communication. In the preparation of the Model Law, consideration was given to the possibility of dealing with impediments to the use of electronic commerce posed by such requirements in national laws by way of extension of the scope of such notions as `writing', `signature' and `original', with a view to encompassing computer-based techniques. Such an approach is used in a number of existing legal instruments, e.g., article 7 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and article 13 of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. It was observed that the Model Law should permit States to adapt their domestic legislation to developments in communications technology applicable to trade law without necessitating the wholesale removal of the paper-based requirements themselves or disturbing the legal concepts and approaches underlying those requirements. At the same time, it was said that electronic fulfillment of writing requirements might in some cases necessitates the development of new rules. This was due to one of many distinctions between EDI messages and paper-based documents, namely, that the latter were readable by the human eye, while the former were not so readable unless reduced to paper or displayed on a screen.<br><br>"16. The Model Law thus relies on a new approach, sometimes referred to as the `functional equivalent approach', which is based on an analysis of the purposes and functions of the traditional paper-based requirement with a view to determining how those purposes or functions could be fulfilled through electronic-commerce techniques. For example, among the functions served by a paper document are the following: to provide that a document would be legible by all; to provide that a document would remain unaltered over time; to allow for the reproduction of a document so that each party would hold a copy of the same data; to allow for the authentication of data by means of a signature; and to provide that a document would be in a form acceptable to public authorities and courts. It should be noted that in respect of all of the above-mentioned functions of paper, electronic records can provide the same level of security as paper and, in most cases, a much higher degree of reliability and speed, especially with respect to the identification of the source and content of the data, provided that a number of technical and legal requirements are met. However, the adoption of the functional-equivalent approach should not result in imposing on users of electronic commerce more stringent standards of security (and the related costs) than in a paper-based environment.<br><br>"17. A data message, in and of itself, cannot be regarded as an equivalent of a paper document in that it is of a different nature and does not necessarily perform all conceivable functions of a paper document. That is why the Model Law adopted a flexible standard, taking into account the various layers of existing requirements in a paper-based environment: when adopting the "functional-equivalent" approach, attention was given to the existing hierarchy of form requirements, which provides distinct levels of reliability, traceability and inalterability with respect to paper-based documents. For example, the requirement that date be presented in written form (which constitutes a `threshold requirement') is not to be confused with more stringent requirements such as `signed writing,' `signed original' or `authenticated legal act'.<br><br>"18. The Model Law does not attempt to define a computer-based equivalent to any kind of paper document. Instead, it singles out basic functions of paper-based form requirements, with a view to providing criteria which, once they are met by data messages, enable such data messages to enjoy the same level of legal recognition as corresponding paper documents performing the same function. It should be noted that the functional-equivalent approach has been taken in articles 6 to 8 of the Model Law with respect to the concepts of `writing', `signature' and `original' but not with respect to other legal concepts dealt with in the Model Law. For example, article 10 does not attempt to create a functional equivalent of existing storage requirements."
