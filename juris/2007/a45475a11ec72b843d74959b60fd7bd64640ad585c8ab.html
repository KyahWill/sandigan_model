Considering that the subject was a public land before free patents were issued, the appellants have no standing to ask for the reconveyance of the property to them. The proper remedy, if at all, is an action for reversion granting that there were misrepresentations in the applications for the free patents. The appellants have no legal personality to institute a suit for reversion for the constant rule on this matter is that <i>[I]f Sales Patents and TCT's were in fact fraudulently obtained, the suit to recover the disputed property should be filed by the State through the Office of the Solicitor General </i>â€”<i> the title having originated from a grant by the government, their cancellation is a matter between the grantor and the grantee </i>(De Ocampo vs. Arlos, 343 SCRA 716,717). Further, <i>(A) certificate of title, once registered, should not thereafter be impugned, altered, changed, modified, enlarged or diminished, except in a direct proceeding permitted by law </i>(Seville vs. National Development Company 351 SCRA 112, 114). Finally, the payment of the realty taxes by the appellants cannot be a sole and sufficient basis for the grant of the properties to them. <i>Tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership, but are merely indicia of a claim of ownership </i>(Del Rosario vs. Republic, 383 SCRA 262).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  (Italics in the original)<br></blockquote>Hence, petitioners' present petition for certiorari under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Respondents early on question petitioners' availment of a petition for certiorari, instead of a petition for review on certiorari.<br><br>If strict adherence to the letter of the law would result in absurdity and manifest injustice or where the merit of a party's cause is apparent and outweighs considerations of non-compliance with certain formal requirements, procedural rules may be liberally construed to afford a party-litigant the fullest opportunity to establish the merit of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on mere technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>This is one instance which calls for the relaxation of the Rules, given that, <i>inter alia</i>, the case involves about 24 hectares of land titled in the name of respondents Brigida Manalo-Velasco, Pedro Manalo, Simeona Manalo-Bunagan, and Jacinto Manalo, Jr. and said respondents' claim thereto run counter to the prior final rulings of the Director of Lands and the DENR Secretary rejecting their predecessor-in-interest Gregorio Manalo's application for homestead patent over the subject land and declaring petitioners' predecessor-in-interest Serapio Banguilan as the actual occupant and possessor thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the trial and appellate courts' ruling that petitioners' action is one for reversion, the allegations in their Amended Complaint show that it is one for declaration of nullity of the free patents and the certificates of title issued to respondents-heirs of Gregorio Manalo.<br><br><i>Heirs of Ambrocio Kionisala v. Heirs of Honorio Dacut</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> distinguishes an action for reversion from an action for declaration of nullity of free patents and certificates of title as follows:<br><blockquote>An ordinary civil action for declaration of nullity of free patents and certificates of title is not the same as an action for reversion. <b>The difference between them lies in the <u>allegations as to the character of ownership</u> of the realty whose title is sought to be nullified.</b>  In an action for reversion, the pertinent allegations in the complaint would <u>admit State ownership</u> of the disputed land. Hence in <i>Gabila v. Barriga</i> where the plaintiff in his complaint admits that he has no right to demand the cancellation or amendment of the defendant's title because even if the title were canceled or amended the ownership of the land embraced therein or of the portion affected by the amendment would revert to the public domain, we ruled that the action was for reversion and that the only person or entity entitled to relief would be the Director of Lands.<br><br>On the other hand, <i>a cause of action for declaration of nullity of free patent and certificate of title</i> would require <u>allegations of the plaintiff's ownership</u> of the contested lot <u>prior to the issuance</u> of such free patent and certificate of title as well as the <u>defendant's fraud or mistake</u>, as the case may be, in successfully obtaining these documents of title over the parcel of land claimed by plaintiff. In such a case, the nullity arises strictly not from the fraud or deceit but from the fact that the land is beyond the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands to bestow and whatever patent or certificate of title obtained therefor is consequently void <i>ab initio</i>. The real party in interest is not the State but the plaintiff who alleges a pre-existing right of ownership over the parcel of land in question even before the grant of title to the defendant. In <i>Heirs of Marciano Nagano v. Court of Appeals</i> we ruled â€”<blockquote>x x x from the allegations in the complaint x x x private respondents claim ownership of the 2,250 square meter portion for having possessed it in the concept of an owner, openly, peacefully, publicly, continuously and adversely since 1920. This claim is an assertion that the lot is private land x x x  Consequently, merely on the basis of the allegations in the complaint, the lot in question is apparently beyond the jurisdiction of the Director of the Bureau of Lands and could not be the subject of a Free Patent. Hence, the dismissal of private respondents' complaint was premature and trial on the merits should have been conducted to thresh out evidentiary matters. It would have been entirely different if the action were clearly for reversion, in which case, it would have to be instituted by the Solicitor General pursuant to Section 101 of C.A. No. 141 x x x<br></blockquote>It is obvious that private respondents allege in their complaint all the facts necessary to seek the nullification of the free patents as well as the certificates of title covering Lot 1015 and Lot 1017. <b>Clearly, they are the real parties in interest in light of their <u>allegations that they have always been the owners and possessors of the two (2) parcels of land even prior to the issuance of the documents of title in petitioners' favor</u>, hence the latter could only have committed fraud in securing them</b> â€”<blockquote>x x x That plaintiffs are absolute and exclusive owners and in actual possession and cultivation of two parcels of agricultural lands herein particularly described as follows [technical description of Lot 1017 and Lot 1015] x x x x 3. That plaintiffs became absolute and exclusive owners of the abovesaid parcels of land by virtue of inheritance from their late father, Honorio Dacut, who in turn acquired the same from a certain Blasito Yacapin and from then on was in possession thereof exclusively, adversely and in the concept of owner for more than thirty (30) years x x x 4. That recently, plaintiff discovered that defendants, without the knowledge and consent of the former, fraudulently applied for patent the said parcels of land and as a result thereof certificates of titles had been issued to them as evidenced by certificate of title No. P-19819 in the name of the Hrs. of Ambrocio Kionisala, and No. P-20229 in the name of Isabel Kionisala x x x 5. That the patents issued to defendants are null and void, the same having been issued fraudulently, defendants not having been and/or in actual possession of the litigated properties and the statement they may have made in their application are false and without basis in fact, and, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources not having any jurisdiction on the properties the same not being anymore public but already private property x x x<br></blockquote>It is not essential for private respondents to specifically state in the complaint the actual date when they became owners and possessors of Lot 1015 and Lot 1017. <b>The allegations to the effect that they were so preceding the issuance of the free patents and the certificates of title, <i>i.e.</i>, "the Department of Environment and Natural Resources not having any jurisdiction on the properties the same not being anymore public but already private property," are unquestionably adequate as a matter of pleading to oust the State of jurisdiction to grant the lots in question to petitioners.</b> If at all, the oversight in not alleging the actual date when private respondents' ownership thereof accrued reflects a mere deficiency in details which does not amount to a failure to state a cause of action. The remedy for such deficiency would not be a motion to dismiss but a motion for bill of particulars so as to enable the filing of appropriate responsive pleadings. (Emphasis, underscoring and italics supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Petitioners' claim of ownership over the subject land is vividly alleged in their Amended Complaint as follows: <br><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>Plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest, Serapio <u>started cultivating</u> a parcel of land, about 24 hectares, located in Sitio Minabbag, Lanna, Tumauini, Isabela in <u>1925</u>, about the same year, he filed his Homestead Application No. 108953 with the then, Bureau of Land;<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>Since <u>1925</u> plaintiffs have been in <u>open, continuous</u> and <u>un[in]terrupted possession and cultivation of the said parcel of land</u>, paying all the taxes due thereon</b>, <u>which fact had been confirmed and recognized by the DECISION OF THE DIRECTOR OF LAND, dated December 10, 1979 and affirmed by the HON.

Baquiran and intervenors Nicolas Banguilan, et. al (sic) have no possession thereof whatsoever.<br><br>[From a] perusal study of the oral and documentary evidence presented by the party-litigants in the case at bar, it is clear that the claim of protestant Gregorio Manalo that he was in actual possession of the land in controversy from 1931 to 1956 when Serapio Banguilan and his son Teofilo Banguilan forcibly took the land from him was not proved, as this was well rebutted by the respondent; that all the cases filed by him in court against the respondent were dismissed sustaining the possession of the respondent; that his homestead application was not approved which tends to show that he is not actually in possession of the land in question; that the improvements allegedly introduced by him, if any are all at his own risk because the land he cultivated is covered by a subsisting and approved homestead application of the respondent who has a better right on the land under consideration. Hence, he has not acquired any right on the land in dispute; the claim of applicant-intervenor Irene  G. Baquiran is without basis in fact and in truth; that said intervenor acted in bad faith when she bought the land knowing that the land is in question; that she has no better right than her predecessor-in-interest who have no right over the land she bought; and that the survey executed in favor of Gregorio Manalo and Juan Baquiran were not in order as the same were executed during the pendency of the case.<br><br>On the other hand, applicant-respondent claim that he and his tenants are in actual possession of the land in question since 1925; that when he first entered the same it was devoid of previous occupation and cultivation; that he immediately filed his homestead application thereto and was approved which shows that he immediately took step in perfecting his claim; that he had already filed his final proof; and that his possession has been continuous, actual and adverse since 1925 up to the present were proved. As a legal consequence thereof, he has already acquired a vested right on the land in question.<br><br>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is ordered that the Homestead Application No. 193571 of Gregorio Manalo be rejected forfeiting to the government whatever amount has been paid on account thereof; that the Free Patent Application No. 4-113 of Irene G. Baquiran be likewise rejected; that the claims of above-named intervenors dismissed and this case dropped; and that the Homestead Application No. 108953 (E-61170) of Serapio Banguilan be given further due course." (<u><i>Vide</i></u> records, pp. 83-84)<br></blockquote>On a joint appeal by Gregorio Manalo and Irene Baquiran, the foregoing findings were affirmed by the DENR Secretary through Romulo San Juan, Assistant Secretary for Legal Affairs, by Decision of September 26, 1989 which held:<br><blockquote>"From the facts on record, it appears that appellee's (Serapio Banguilan) possession and cultivation of the land in dispute is established. No convincing evidence has been adduced by appellant showing that appellee allegedly entered into the land by force or by coercive acts. In fact, the criminal case filed against appellee for illegal entry was dismissed by the court. On top of this, ocular inspection revealed that appellee is in actual possession of the land.<br><br>As already stated before, appellee's homestead application had already been approved. So that "when a homesteader has already complied with all the terms and conditions which entitled him to a patent for a particular tract of public land, he acquired a vested interest therein, and is to be regarded as the equitable owner thereof." (Balboa vs. Farrales, 51 Phil. 498; Mesina vs. Vda. de Sonza, 58 O.G. 25 p. 4603, June 18, 1962.)<br><br>With respect to the alleged payment of real property taxes by the appellants, suffice it to state that the tax receipts are not conclusive evidence of possession or ownership of the land."
