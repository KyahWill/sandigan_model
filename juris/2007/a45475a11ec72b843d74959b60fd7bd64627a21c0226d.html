				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 26 May 2006 affirming the conviction by the Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (RTC) of appellants Loida R. Soriano (Loida) and Manuelita L. Miguel (Lita) for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 and sentencing them to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a P500,000.00 fine each.<br><br>Appellants were arrested and charged following a "buy-bust" operation.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information against appellants reads:<br><blockquote>On or about April 8, 2003, in Pasig City and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, conspiring and confederating together and both of them mutually helping and aiding one another, not being lawfully authorized to sell, possess or otherwise use any dangerous drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver and give away to Police Officer Janet Sabo, a police poseur buyer, one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance weighing nine (9) centigrams (0.09 grams), which was found positive to the test for methylamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), a dangerous drug, in violation of the said law.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>When arraigned, appellants pleaded not guilty. Trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses, PO1 Janet Sabo (Sabo), who acted as poseur-buyer, PO2 Arturo San Andres (San Andres), a back-up operative who assisted Sabo, and PO1 Aldrin Mariano (Mariano), who transmitted the drug specimen confiscated from appellants to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory. Their testimonies sought to establish the following facts:<br><br>Acting on a tip from an informant that a certain "Loida," "Lita" and "Bangkay" were openly selling drugs in Bukid, Barangay Bambang, Pasig City, Police Inspector Rodrigo Villaruel formed a buy-bust team on 8 April 2003 composed of Sabo as poseur-buyer, San Andres, SPO4 Manuel Buenconsejo, PO3 Amillasan Salisa, Mariano and PO1 Alan Panis. Sabo was then given two (2) One Hundred Peso bills to be used as buy-bust money. At about 2:30 p.m. of the same day, the team proceeded to the site of operation. After parking their vehicle at the corner of J.P. Miguel in Brgy. Bambang, Sabo and the informant went to the house of Loida. The informant knocked at the door and one female person came out, later identified as Lita. He introduced Sabo to Lita as the one who wanted to buy <i>shabu</i> worth P200.00. Sabo then gave Lita the P200.00 marked money. Lita, in turn, gave the P200.00 to another lady inside the house, later identified as Loida. Loida handed a plastic sachet to Lita. Lita approached Sabo and gave it to the latter.<br><br>Upon inspection of the sachet containing the suspected <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>, Sabo sent her pre-arranged signal to the other police officers by combing her hair with her fingers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> San Andres approached and directed Loida to empty her short pants pocket of its contents. Loida obliged and handed two (2) pieces of P100.00 bills to San Andres. He later confirmed that the two bills bearing the serial numbers FC144922 and JT449380 respectively seized from Loida were the same bills previously photocopied and marked with letters J and S inside the two (2) zeroes of the P100.00 bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The <i>shabu</i> was brought by Mariano<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination, which yielded a positive result for methylamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In their defense, appellants denied the charge against them. They commonly narrated that at around 2:00 p.m. on 8 April 2003, they were conversing in front of their house when one Junjun Paulino (Junjun), who was acquainted with Loida, approached them. Junjun was asking for their help in selling his pieces of jewelry. Suddenly, several police officers in civilian clothes arrived and shouted, "<i>Walang tatakbo.</i>" Junjun ran away and the other police officers failed to catch up with him. Thereafter, they were forcibly brought to the police station for inquest. Lita was asked by the police officers to pinpoint a big-time drug pusher. Unable to extract information from her, she was charged with the instant offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Loida, on the other hand, alleged that upon arriving at the police station, the police officers brought out <i>shabu</i> on the table and informed them that they got the said drug from them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 23 July 2004, the RTC rendered a Decision finding appellants guilty of violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 and sentencing them to suffer life imprisonment and to pay a P500,000.00 fine each. The trial court gave credence to the prosecution's evidence in accordance with the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions accorded to police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Initially, the appeal was brought before us. Conformably with <i>People v. Mateo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> however, this Court in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated 28 February 2005 resolved to transfer the instant case to the Court of Appeals for intermediate review.<br><br>On 26 May 2006, the appellate court affirmed the judgment of the RTC. The appellate court held that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the identity of the buyer in the buy-bust operation and the seller, the object and the consideration as well as the delivery of the sold <i>shabu </i>and the payment of P200.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It observed that the prosecution evidence presented a complete picture detailing the transaction of the buy-bust operation â€” from the initial contact between Sabo and appellants, to the offer to purchase <i>shabu</i> by the poseur-buyer, the payment of the buy-bust money, and the consummation of the sale by delivery by appellants to Sabo of the <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellants appealed their conviction before this Court, adopting the same arguments in their Brief before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Appellants essentially maintain that the prosecution's evidence failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. They lament that the trial court failed to give weight to their direct testimonies, which were clearly more credible than the version of the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>It is jurisprudential that factual findings of trial courts especially those which revolve on matters of credibility of witnesses deserve to be respected when no glaring errors bordering on a gross misapprehension of the facts, or where no speculative, arbitrary and unsupported conclusions, can be gleaned from such findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses' deportment, demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After a painstaking review of the records, we agree with the trial court's finding that the guilt of the appellants was established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In every prosecution for illegal sale of<span style="font-style: italic;"> shabu</span>, the following elements must be sufficiently proved: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Indeed, all these elements were duly established. Appellants were caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu</i> through a buy-bust operation conducted by members of the Mayor's Special Action Team/City Hall Detachment of Pasig City.<br><br>The poseur-buyer, Sabo, positively testified that the sale took place and appellants were the authors thereof, thus:<br><blockquote><div align="justify"><table border="0" width="100%">

They claimed that Junjun approached them peddling his pieces of jewelry when the police officers arrived and arrested them. They were brought to the police station. Lita alleged that she was told to point to a big-time drug pusher. When she denied any knowledge thereof, she was charged for violation of Sec. 5 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br>Denial or frame-up, like alibi, has been viewed by the court with disfavor for it can just as easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The defense of frame-up or denial in drug cases requires strong and convincing evidence because of the presumption that the law enforcement agencies acted in the regular performance of their official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Bare denials of appellants cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the three police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Moreover, there is no evidence of any improper motive on the part of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation to falsely testify against appellants.<br><br>The presumption of innocence accorded the accused had been overturned by the evidence presented by the prosecution. Contrary to appellants' assertion, the prosecution had convincingly proved beyond reasonable doubt that the crime was committed. The inability of the accused to predicate their defense on anything other than their words alone ultimately condemns them to prison, especially in the light of the prosecution's evidence and witnesses, which appellants had been incapable of impeaching.<br><br>In fine, it has been established by proof beyond reasonable doubt that appellants sold <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. Under Sec. 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the penalty of life imprisonment to death and fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P1,000,000.00 shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved. Hence, the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, correctly imposed the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the decision dated 26 May 2006 of the Court of Appeals convicting appellants for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A.
