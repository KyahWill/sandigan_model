Federico Miranda, verbally objected to the tabulation on the ground that the election return was tampered and altered.&nbsp; Thereafter, the CBC suspended its proceedings to accommodate the objection.<br><br>On 21 May 2004, the CBC resumed its proceedings.&nbsp; Respondent's other counsel, Atty. Bayan Balt, reiterated their objection to the tabulation of the results of the election return from Precinct No. 108-A.&nbsp; Respondent then submitted his Formal Offer of Evidence to the CBC.&nbsp; Among respondent's evidence was the joint affidavit of the members of the Board of Election Inspectors in Precinct No. 108-A, which stated:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>That after the counting of votes which was held at People's Park, Marawi City, we prepared the election returns based on the votes obtained by candidates for National and Local position.<br><br></li><li>That to the best of our own personal knowledge, candidates for Councilors Omar "Bornok" Mohamad, Jr. and Anwar "Ano" S. Marabur obtained the following votes corresponding to their names as follows:<br><br>Omar "Bornok" Mohamad, Jr.&nbsp; - Forty-Eight votes (48 votes)<br><br>Anwar "Ano" S. Marabur - Fifty votes (50 votes)<br><br></li><li>That it is not true that Anwar "Ano" S. Marabur received One Hundred Fifty votes (150 votes).<br><br></li><li>That we executed this Affidavit to attest to the veracity of the foregoing statements and to inform the Honorable Members of the City Board of Canvassers of Marawi City that Candidate for Councilor Anwar "Ano" S. Marabur did not received [sic] or obtained [sic] One Hundred Fifty votes (150 votes).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Respondent also submitted an affidavit of one of his watchers claiming that respondent obtained 48 votes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> while petitioner received 50 votes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Certificate of Votes of Candidates,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; which was signed and thumb marked by the Board of Election Inspectors, likewise showed that petitioner obtained only 50 votes in Precinct No. 108-A.<br><br>Respondent also argued that it was impossible for petitioner to obtain 150 votes from Precinct No. 108-A because based on the contested election return only 132 voters actually voted in Precinct No. 108-A.<br><br>With the respondent's objections and offer of evidence, the CBC initially deferred its canvass with the announcement that it could only proclaim the nine candidates for councilor who obtained the highest votes.<br><br>However, on 22 May 2004, despite the continuous objections from respondent's counsel&nbsp; and his manifestation of intent to appeal, the CBC still included in its canvass the contested election return. The CBC proclaimed all the winning candidates, including petitioner as the 10<sup>th</sup> ranking councilor of Marawi City. The CBC then issued its ruling, declaring that respondent did not comply with the mandatory requirement of&nbsp; simultaneous submission of the verbal and written objections and that respondent submitted his offer of evidence beyond the prescribed period.&nbsp; The CBC also ruled that there was no convincing proof of any superimposition done on the contested election return.<br><br>On 25 May 2004, respondent filed a petition with the COMELEC, praying that the proceedings of the CBC be declared illegal and void.&nbsp; The petition alleged that on 20 May 2004, the canvass of all but one of the 190 precincts of Marawi City, particularly Precinct No. 108-A, showed respondent to be ahead of petitioner, with 10,070 votes as against 10,020 votes for petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; However, the election return from Precinct No. 108-A was allegedly missing, prompting the CBC to defer the canvass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; However, at around 8:00 p.m. of 20 May 2004, the missing election return allegedly reappeared.&nbsp; The election return showed signs of tampering atop the thumb marks and signatures of the members of the Board of Election Inspectors, and affixed at the end of the <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span> corresponding to petitioner's name were additional <span style="font-style: italic;">taras</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Alterations in the number of votes for petitioner in words and figures allegedly made it appear that petitioner had 150 votes instead of only 50 votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The petition also alleged that the CBC disregarded respondent's objections and denied him of any chance to appeal its inclusion of the contested election return.<br><br>Meanwhile, petitioner took his Oath of Office as councilor of Marawi City on 4 June 2004.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the COMELEC</span><br></div><br>In its Resolution of 21 February 2005, the COMELEC Second Division found that the CBC violated the prohibition in Section 20 of Republic Act No. 7166 (RA 7166)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on proclaiming any candidate as winner without authorization from the COMELEC after the COMELEC has ruled on the objections of the losing party. This prohibition is also found in the&nbsp; COMELEC rules.&nbsp; Since there was no such prior authorization from the COMELEC, the proclamation of petitioner as the 10<sup>th</sup> ranking councilor of Marawi City is void.<br><br>The COMELEC also found that the contested election return, "by sheer visual inspection," was clearly tampered.&nbsp; The 150 votes for petitioner were superimposed over the actual votes that he obtained - which were 50 votes.&nbsp; Excluding the contested election return, the total number of votes from all the precincts in Marawi City including the true votes in Precinct&nbsp; No. 108-A, would be:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Respondent&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10, 118 votes<br>Petitioner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10, 070 votes<br></div><br>Therefore, the winning candidate as the 10<sup>th</sup> councilor of Marawi City was respondent, instead of petitioner.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the resolution reads:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> under the foregoing premises, the instant Petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.&nbsp; Consequently, the proclamation of private respondent Anwar "Ano" S.

Such objection shall be recorded in the minutes of the canvass.<br><br>(b) Upon receipt of any such objection, the board of canvassers shall automatically defer the canvass of the contested returns and shall proceed to canvass the returns which are not contested by any party.<br><br>(c) Simultaneous with the oral objection, the objecting party shall also enter his objection in the form for written objections to be prescribed by the Commission. Within twenty-four (24) hours from and after the presentation of such an objection, the objecting party shall submit the evidence in support of the objection, which shall be attached to the form for written objections. Within the same period of twenty-four (24) hours after presentation of the objection, any party may file a written and verified opposition to the objection in the form also to be prescribed by the Commission, attaching thereto supporting evidence, if any. The board shall not entertain any objection or opposition unless reduced to writing in the prescribed forms.<br><br>The evidence attached to the objection or opposition, submitted by the parties, shall be immediately and formally admitted into the records of the board by the chairman affixing his signature at the back of each every page thereof.<br><br>(d) Upon receipt of the evidence, the board shall take up the contested returns, consider the written objections thereto and opposition, if any, and summarily and immediately rule thereon. The board shall enter its ruling on the prescribed form and authenticate the same by the signatures of its members.<br><br>(e) Any party adversely affected by the ruling of the board shall immediately inform the board if he intends to appeal said ruling. The board shall enter said information in the minutes of the canvass, set aside the returns and proceed to consider the other returns.<br><br>(f) After all the uncontested returns have been canvassed and the contested return ruled upon by it, the board shall suspend the canvass. Within forty-eight (48) hours, therefrom, any party adversely affected by the ruling may file with the board a written and verified notice of appeal; and within an unextendible period of five (5) days thereafter an appeal may be taken to the Commission.<br><br>(g) Immediately upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the board shall make an appropriate report to the Commission, elevating therewith the complete records and evidence submitted in the canvass, and furnishing the parties with copies of the report.<br><br>(h) On the basis of the records and evidence elevated to it by the board, the Commission shall decide summarily the appeal within seven (7) days from receipt of said records and evidence. Any appeal brought before the Commission on the ruling of the board, without the accomplished forms and the evidence appended thereto, shall be summarily dismissed.<br><br>The decision of the Commission shall be executory after the lapse of seven (7) days from receipt thereof by the losing party.<br><br>(i)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The board of canvassers shall not proclaim any candidate as winner unless authorized by the Commission</span> after the latter has ruled on the objection brought to it on appeal by the losing party.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Respondent presented his oral objections in accordance with <span style="font-weight: bold;">paragraph (a)</span>. Petitioner's own admission that respondent's counsel, Atty. Federico Miranda, verbally objected to the tabulation when the CBC was about to tally and tabulate the election return from Precinct No. 108-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> negates petitioner's claim that respondent belatedly aired his objections.&nbsp; Respondent presented his objections within the time allowed by law, which is when the election return is still being examined by the CBC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Therefore, respondent did not violate the rule that protestants should present objections to the inclusion or exclusion of election returns at the time the questioned returns are presented for inclusion in the canvass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to <span style="font-weight: bold;">paragraph (b),</span> the CBC deferred the canvass of the&nbsp; election returns with the announcement that it could only proclaim the nine candidates for councilor with the highest number of votes.<br><br>However, respondent failed to comply with the requirement in <span style="font-weight: bold;">paragraph (c),</span> pertaining to the submission of his written objections in the form prescribed by the COMELEC.&nbsp; Respondent explains that it was "due to the fact that [he] was completely deprived of the opportunity to file a simultaneous written objection because of the commotion that ensued immediately after&nbsp; [he] has entered his oral objection."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Significantly, petitioner acknowledged that a commotion occurred after respondent's counsel objected to the inclusion of the contested election return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>While respondent failed to submit his written objections, the Court finds that respondent's submission of his offer of evidence, including the evidence, within the prescribed period<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> constituted substantial compliance with the requirement that objections be reduced into writing.<br><br>Indeed, reducing the objections into writing and submitting them with the supporting evidence are crucial to the delivery of speedy and equitable relief in pre-proclamation controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; Unless this requirement is strictly observed, the COMELEC can not determine the <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> merit of the appeal, and the controversy will be unduly prolonged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; After reviewing respondent's evidence, we find that even without respondent's written objections, the CBC and the COMELEC could rule, as they did, on respondent's objections.&nbsp; Thus, the purpose for requiring the written objections, which is to expedite the resolution of pre-proclamation controversies, was achieved.&nbsp; There was no showing that the absence of the written objections unduly delayed the resolution of respondent's protest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, there was no indication that the COMELEC was unable to decide respondent's appeal for lack of his written objections.<br><br>To rule that the absence of respondent's written objections, despite the glaring irregularity of the election return from Precinct No. 108-A, is a ground to uphold petitioner's proclamation amounts to an absolute frustration of the electorate's will. Technicalities and procedural barriers should not be allowed to stand if they constitute an obstacle to the determination of the electorate's true will in the choice of their elective officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Petitioner himself understands the purpose of the rules on canvassing.&nbsp; The "rules relative to canvassing have for their object the determination of the true results of the elections based on the official election returns.&nbsp; In order that the result of the canvass would reflect the true expression of the people's will in the choice of their elective officials, the canvass must be based on true, genuine, and authentic election returns."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>At any rate, pursuant to <span style="font-weight: bold;">paragraph (d),</span> the CBC entertained and ruled on respondent's objections despite his failure to reduce such objections into writing. The CBC, in its Ruling of 22 May 2004, opined that "there was no most convincing proof" that superimposition was done on the contested election return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>However, the CBC contravened <span style="font-weight: bold;">paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (i)</span>.&nbsp; First, the CBC ignored respondent's manifestation to appeal. Under paragraph (e), the CBC should have entered respondent's intent to appeal in the minutes of the canvass, set aside the contested election return, and proceeded to consider the other returns.&nbsp; There is no showing that the CBC observed this procedure.&nbsp; Second, the CBC did not suspend the canvass, and instead proclaimed petitioner as one of the winning candidates for councilor.&nbsp; The CBC, in violation of paragraph (f), did not give respondent 48 hours to file his notice of appeal forcing respondent to appeal directly to the COMELEC.&nbsp; Consequently, the CBC did not elevate any record or&nbsp; evidence to the COMELEC as required in paragraph (g).&nbsp; Finally, disregarding paragraph (i), the CBC proclaimed petitioner without any COMELEC authorization after the COMELEC has ruled on respondent's objections.<br><br>Paragraph (i) of Section 20, RA 7166 provides that any proclamation made in violation of the prohibition against proclamation without the COMELEC authorization shall be void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span>. Accordingly, petitioner's proclamation as the 10<sup>th</sup> ranking and winning candidate for councilor is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Where a proclamation is void, the proclamation is no proclamation at all and the assumption of office of the proclaimed candidate cannot deprive the COMELEC of the power to declare such nullity and to annul the proclamation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; The nullity of the proclamation is one of the exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> to the rule that after a&nbsp; proclamation has been made, a pre-proclamation case before the COMELEC is no longer viable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; This resolves petitioner's argument that respondent's cause of action is proper in an election contest, and not in a pre-proclamation controversy.<br><br>In view of the CBC's violation of paragraph (i), among others, we find that the COMELEC properly annulled petitioner's proclamation and committed no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.&nbsp; For this Court to issue the extraordinary writ of certiorari, the tribunal or administrative body, in this case the COMELEC, must have issued the assailed decision, order, or resolution in a capricious and despotic manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Clearly, such is not the situation in the instant case.<br><br>Petitioner's contention that the contested election return contained no sign of any tampering or alteration, and thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> regular on its face, is untenable. The finding of the COMELEC that by simple inspection&nbsp; the contested election return is clearly tampered binds this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> absent any showing that this particular finding is unsubstantiated. As attested to by the members of the Board of Election Inspectors in Precinct No. 108-A, petitioner did not receive 150 votes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the election return does not, on its face, appear regular, the rule that the CBC and the COMELEC are not to look beyond or behind the election return is not applicable to this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In addition,&nbsp; the suspicious disappearance and sudden reappearance of the contested election return should have put the CBC on guard of possible tampering or alteration of the election return from Precinct No. 108-A. Yet, the CBC included in its canvass the election return and continued to proclaim petitioner in defiance of the express prohibition under paragraph (i) of Section 20 of RA 7166.<br><br>On petitioner's claim that respondent is not a registered voter of Barangay Marinaut East, we agree with the COMELEC's ruling that "issues relating to the qualifications of candidates are not proper in pre-proclamation controversies such as the instant case."&nbsp; As defined by the Omnibus Election Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> a pre-proclamation controversy refers to any question affecting the proceedings of the board of canvassers, or any matter raised under Sections 233, 234, 235, and 236 in relation to the preparation, transmission, receipt, custody, and appreciation of the election returns.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> we <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISS</span> the petition and <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRM</span> the Resolution dated 21 February 2005 of the Commission on Elections Second Division and the Resolution dated 6 September 2005 of the Commission on Elections <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> in SPC No. 04-204.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Austria-Martinez, Corona, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Tinga, </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, Garcia, Velasco, Jr., </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Nachura, JJ., </span>concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr., JJ., </span>on leave.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, J.,</span> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo,</span> pp. 46-59.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Composed of Presiding Commissioner Mehol K.
