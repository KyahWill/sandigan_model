On waking up at four, CCC and one of the younger children were gone, leaving AAA and a younger sister whom she was taking care of.&nbsp; &nbsp;At five p.m., BBB arrived.&nbsp; Appellant and BBB had an altercation over her and her husband being unemployed and their continued stay in the family house, causing financial difficulties to the family.&nbsp; BBB had thus a grudge against him on account of which he surmised that she gave a false report to her mother.<br><br>Appellant added that CCC and AAA filed the charge against him because he was jobless, and constantly inebriated and when in that state, he would quarrel with CCC and scold his children.<br><br>Appellant finally proffered that even if he was aware of the gravity of the offense lodged against him, he made no attempt to escape which is indicative of his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>By Decision dated June 18, 2002, the trial court found appellant guilty, disposing as follows: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Rodolfo Biyoc y Wenceslao GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of Rape (Violation of par. 1 (d), Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B 6th par., (1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 8353 and further in relation to Sec. 5 (j) of R.A. 8369) and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of DEATH, and to indemnify the private complainant [AAA] in the amount of P75,000.00 and P50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> appellant raised only one assignment of error â”€ "THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME OF RAPE,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in support of which, he argued that: <blockquote><ol><li>The trial court disregarded the fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prosecution</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failed</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">establish</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exact</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">age</span> of the victim and her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relationship</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br></li><li>The trial court did not give weight and credence to the accused's testimony thereby depriving him of the presumption of innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br></li><li>The trial court did not meet the test of moral certainty required for the conviction of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br></li><li>The trial court failed to consider the fact that the accused's arrest was legally objectionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied) </li></ol></blockquote> In his Supplemental Brief which was received by the Court on November 10, 2005, appellant raised additional assignments of error which may be summarized as follows:<br><br>1. The trial court erred in appreciating AAA's testimony that she had long been sexually molested by appellant, it being hearsay and, in any event, no criminal charges were filed therefor, and<br><br>2.&nbsp; The findings in the medico-legal report did not support the claim of the prosecution that AAA was raped on December 5, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant contends that the prosecution was unable to prove the age of AAA in accordance with the guidelines laid down by this Court in <i>People v. Pruna, viz</i>: <blockquote> In order to remove any confusion that may be engendered by the foregoing cases, we hereby set the following <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guidelines</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appreciating</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">age,</span> either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance. <ol> <li>The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.<br><br></li><li>In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.<br><br></li><li><b>If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is <u>shown</u> to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim's mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:<br><br></b> <ol type="a"><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;<br><br></li><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;<br><br></li><li><u>If</u> <u>the</u> <u>victim</u> <u>is</u> <u>alleged</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>below</u> <u>12</u> <u>years</u> <u>of</u> <u>age</u> <u>and</u> <u>what</u> <u>is</u> <u>sought</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>proved</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u> <u>she</u> <u>is</u> <u>less</u> <u>than</u> <u>18</u> <u>years</u> <u>old.<br><br></u> </li></ol> </li><li>In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, the complainant's testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.<br><br></li><li>It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.<br><br></li><li>The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </li></ol></blockquote> From the accusatory portion of the information quoted above, AAA was alleged to be 11 years old at the time of the alleged rape.&nbsp; The certificate of live birth or similar authentic documents were not presented.&nbsp; There is no showing that the prosecution claimed that the said documents had been lost, destroyed or were otherwise unavailable, hence, CCC's testifying on AAA's age does not suffice to prove that AAA was below the age of 12.<br><br>Since age was not adequately proven, it cannot be used to qualify the offense of rape in this case.<br><br>As for appellant's relationship to AAA, contrary to his claim that it was not proven, he himself admitted in open court that she is his daughter. <blockquote> ATTY. GARILLO: <blockquote> Q. Mr. Biyoc, where did you reside on December 5, 2000? <br>A. At Nawasa Pipeline, sir.<br><br>Q. With whom were you residing in that place? <br>A. My family sir.<br><br>Q. What is the name of your wife? <br>A. [CCC], sir.<br><br>Q. You have sons and daughters? <br>A. Yes, sir.<br><br>Q. How many are they? <br>A. Nine (9) sir.<br><br>Q. What is the name of your eldest? <br>A. BBB and [DDD] because they are twins, sir.<br><br>Q. Who is your second? <br>A. [EEE], <b>[AAA]</b>, [FFF], [GGG], [HHH] and [III], sir.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q. And who were with you at the second floor at the time you slept at 1:30? <br><b>A.&nbsp; My wife and my children, sir.</b><br><br><b>Q. Who among your children? <br>A. My two (2) youngest children, [AAA] and my wife, sir.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote></blockquote> Admission in open court of relationship has been held to be "sufficient and hence conclusive . . . to prove relationship with the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respecting appellant's claim that his testimony was not credited to thereby deprive him of the presumption of innocence, the same fails.<br><br>Appellant's attribution of the filing of the case to his having berated AAA's sister BBB is too shallow to merit credence. Even assuming that BBB nursed a grudge against him and that CCC was partly responsible in filing the case, it is contrary to the caring and protective instincts of a daughter and a wife to subject a younger sister and daughter, respectively, to the rigors of a trial for rape.&nbsp; But even if the two have the unimaginable capacity to subject AAA to an ordeal as a trial for rape, it would be difficult to even imagine how AAA, a child of tender years, would subject herself to the psychological stress and humiliation of pursuing the case. &nbsp;More so when the case is against her own father, even if he often scolded her and her siblings.&nbsp; Thus, in a similar case, this Court held: <blockquote> No woman would openly admit that she was raped and consequently subject herself to an examination of her private parts, undergo the trauma and humiliation of a public trial and embarrass herself with the need to narrate in detail how she was raped unless she was in fact raped. This is especially true when the accusing words are directed against a close relative, <u>especially</u> <u>the</u> <u>father</u>, as in this case. A young unmarried lass does not ordinarily file a rape complaint against anybody, much less her own father, if it is not true.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Parental punishment is not a good reason for a daughter to falsely accuse her father of rape. Filipino children's reverence and respect for elders is too deeply ingrained in Filipino children and families. Thus, it would take <u>depravity</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>young</u> <u>daughter</u> <u>to</u> <u>concoct</u> <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>story</u> <u>of</u> <u>defloration</u> <u>against</u> <u>her</u> <u>own</u> <u>father</u> <u>unless</u> <u>she</u> <u>had</u> <u>really</u> <u>been</u> <u>aggrieved.</u><br><br>Similarly, the imputation by CASTRO of ill-motive on the part of his wife and mother-in-law does not persuade us. It is <u>unnatural</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>parent,</u> <u>more</u> <u>so</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>mother,</u> <u>to</u> <u>use</u> <u>her</u> <u>offspring</u> <u>as</u> <u>an</u> <u>engine</u> <u>of</u> <u>malice</u> <u>especially</u> <u>if</u> <u>it</u> <u>will</u> <u>subject</u> <u>her</u> <u>child</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>humiliation,</u> <u>disgrace</u> <u>and</u> <u>even</u> <u>stigma</u> <u>attendant</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>prosecution</u> <u>for</u> <u>rape</u>, if she were not motivated solely by the desire to incarcerate the person responsible for her child's defilement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23] </sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied) </blockquote> As for appellant's argument that "the trial court disregarded the fact that no one actually saw appellant abusing [AAA]," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> &nbsp;the same does not persuade. &nbsp;This Court has consistently pronounced that the lone testimony of the victim in a prosecution for rape, if credible, suffices to sustain a verdict of conviction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <blockquote> . . . the rationale being that owing to the nature of the offense, the only evidence that can oftentimes be adduced to establish the guilt of the accused is the offended party's testimony (<i>People v. Lor,</i> L-47440-42, September 12, 1984, 132 SCRA 41). Hence, if the testimony of the offended party is not improbable, a defendant may be convicted on the lone testimony of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </blockquote> On appellant's not fleeing after his indictment, he needs only to be reminded that <blockquote> . . . non-flight by itself does not necessarily indicate a clear conscience.&nbsp; It is true that in a good number of cases, flight of the accused has been taken as an admission of guilt.&nbsp; However, as held in an equally good number of cases, the non-flight of the accused <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> is not proof, much less a conclusive one, of the accused's innocence…<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </blockquote> Respecting the trial court's crediting of AAA's testimony that she had long been sexually molested by appellant which testimony appellant alleges is hearsay, the same is mere <i>obiter dictum</i>.&nbsp; It neither augments nor denigrates the trial court's finding that appellant raped AAA beyond reasonable doubt on December 5, 2000.<br><br>On the alleged inconsistency, attention to which appellant draws, between AAA's claim that appellant had successfully inserted his penis into her vagina and another claim that he was only able to slightly insert it due to BBB's arrival, appellant loses sight of the fact that there were two instances on the same occasion in which he was alleged to have inserted his penis â”€ before and after BBB's &nbsp;arrival. <blockquote> <b>Q: And you were asked this question, and I will quote: "and panghahalay niya sa iyo kahapon petsa 5 ng Disyembre humigit kumulang alas 4:00 ng hapon, naipasok ba niyang muli ang kanyang ari sa iyong ari", and your answer is like this.
