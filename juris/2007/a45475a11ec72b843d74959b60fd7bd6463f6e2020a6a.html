Also, the personal circumstances of the victim or any other information tending to establish or compromise her identity, as well as those of her immediate family or household members, is not disclosed in this decision.<br><br>The facts:<br><br>In the court of origin, Mario Guillermo y Esteban was accused of incestuous rape on two (2) counts under two separate Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> worded as follows:<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Criminal Case No. 2001-129:</span><br><blockquote>That on or about November 18, 2000 at around 11:00 o'clock in the evening at Brgy.

Thereafter, a joint trial on the merits ensued, in the course of which the prosecution presented the oral testimonies of the victim XXX, of the victim's mother and of Dr. Mercedes Gapultos, a doctor from the Camiling Emergency Hospital where XXX was brought for examination.<br><br>The People's version of the incidents is succinctly summarized by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in its Appellee's Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>On November 18, 2000, at about 11:00 in the evening, while private complainant XXX and her three (3) sisters are sleeping, XXX suddenly woke up feeling that someone removed her panty and that someone was already on top of her, whom she later recognized as her father herein appellant.  She also felt appellant insert his organ in her organ.<br><br>When she was awakened, appellant immediately stood up and put on his underwear and short pants.  At the same time, XXX also saw appellant laughing at her.<br><br>On April 3, 2001, at around 2:00 in the morning, XXX woke up and found out that her short pants were down and her sex organ was wet.  Later in the morning of the same day, when they were about to have breakfast, appellant told XXX that he inserted his penis in her organ.  When confronted, appellant merely told her that she would not get pregnant.</blockquote>On the other hand, the defense's version is hinged mainly on appellant's denial. To quote from his own (appellant's) brief:<br><blockquote>MARIO GUILLERMO denied that he ever committed the accusations  leveled against him by his daughter. He could only surmise that her mother coached his daughter on what to say.<br><br>He recalled that on November 18, 2000 at around 11 o'clock in the evening, as he was trying to sleep inside their bedroom, his daughter, the herein complainant, suddenly got up from bed. It is the habit of the complainant to walk while still asleep. She usually walks whenever she sleeps even during her afternoon nap. He remembered also that his daughter attended a seminar but returned only after three (3) days. He scolded and spanked her every time she failed to come home on the same day.</blockquote>Significantly, appellant made no attempt to dispute the allegations regarding the April 29, 2001 rape incident in his appellant's brief, other than asserting that XXX did not see appellant inserting his penis in her vagina.<br><br>On February 5, 2004, the trial court came out with its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> convicting appellant of incestuous rape on two (2) counts and sentencing him as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, accused MARIO GUILLERMO y ESTEBAN is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, two (2) counts under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH for each crime of Rape, and, further, to pay the private complainant the amount of P75,000.00 by way of civil indemnity <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span> in each of the two (2) cases, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of moral damages, likewise, in each of the two (2) cases, and the amount of P50,000.00 by way of exemplary damages, with costs.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.</blockquote>As stated at the onset hereof, the Court, in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of August 24, 2004, and pursuant to its ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Mateo</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> referred the case and its records to the CA for appropriate action and disposition.<br><br>In turn, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of April 6, 2006, the CA affirmed that of the trial court. Dispositively, the CA decision reads:<br><blockquote>UPON THE VIEW WE TAKE OF THIS CASE, THUS, the appealed Decision dated February 5, 2004 of the Regional Trial Court of Camiling, Tarlac, Branch 68, in Criminal Cases Nos. 2001-129 and 2001-130, finding the accused-appellant MARIO GUILLERMO Y ESTEBAN guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of qualified rape and sentencing him in each case to suffer the supreme penalty of death and to pay his daughter-victim, XXX, the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages is AFFIRMED.<br><br>Should no motions for reconsideration be filed in these cases by the accused-appellant within the allowable reglementary period, or after the lapse thereof, let the entire records of this case be forwarded to the Honorable Supreme Court for appropriate action thereon.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>In its Resolution of September 19, 2006, the Court resolved to accept the case and required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs.<br><br>In separate <span style="font-style: italic;">Manifestations</span> (In lieu of a Supplemental Brief) respectively dated October 17, 2006 and November 8, 2006, appellant, through the Public Attorney's Office, and appellee <span style="font-style: italic;">People</span>, through the  Office of the Solicitor General,  informed the Court that they were no longer filing supplemental briefs and were merely adopting their appellant's and appellee's briefs before the CA as their supplemental briefs.<br><br>In his Appellant's Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> before the CA, appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THAT THE FACT OF CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, WHICH IS A VITAL ELEMENT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE, WAS NOT PROVEN WITH CERTAINTY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>ASSUMING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED, THE COURT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A QUO</span> GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THE REAL AGE OF THE COMPLAINANT.</blockquote>The appeal must fail.<br><br>Appellant claims that the prosecution failed to present concrete evidence to prove that he had sexual intercourse with his own daughter.<br><br>In  an  effort  to  exculpate  himself, appellant imputes ill motive on the  part  of  his  daughter  XXX  in  charging  him  with rape.  He claims that his daughter harbored ill-feelings against him whenever he scolded or spanked her every time she came home late at night or when she failed to come home for three (3) days after asking permission from him to attend a seminar.<br><br>Contrary to appellant's assertions, XXX testified that although she harbored ill-feelings against her father, such ill-feelings easily came to pass.  Thus:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" scope="row" valign="top">PROS. GUARDIANO:</td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top" width="10%"> <br></td> <td width="90%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top"> <br></td> <td>xxx</td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top">Q </td> <td>Miss witness, earlier when counsel asked you about scolding, you had an ill feeling about your father, what is the reason?</td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top">A </td> <td>I had an ill feeling Sir but after a while that feeling passed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top">Q </td> <td>By reason of the scolding?</td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td scope="row" valign="top">A </td> <td>Yes, Sir I had ill feeling for a moment but it will pass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The imputation of ill motive on the part of the victim XXX against appellant hardly merits consideration. The alleged ill-feelings harbored by XXX against her father are too flimsy to justify the filing of charges punishable by death. The acts imputed against the appellant -- incestuous rapes -- are not ordinary criminal offenses that can be hurled with facility.  In relating her experiences in public, not only the victim, but her entire family as well, had to go through the humiliation of a trial. Surely, only the genuine desire to seek justice impelled XXX to come out in the open and reveal her unfortunate fate in the hands of her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>To be sure, XXX was duly informed of the dire consequences of the charges she filed against her father.

Testimonies of youthful rape victims are, as a general rule, given full faith and credit, considering that when a girl says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></div><br>Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.)
