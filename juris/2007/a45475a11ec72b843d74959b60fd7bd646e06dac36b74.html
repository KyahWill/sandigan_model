Quejada and Ruth I. Paredes to verify and submit a report on sub-allotment advises issued to various highway engineering districts in Cebu, particularly, the Cebu City, Cebu 1st, Cebu 2nd and the Mandaue City Highway Engineering Districts.  Complying with the directive, they conducted an investigation and in due course submitted their findings.  Their report (Exhibit C) confirmed the issuance of fake Letters of Advice of Allotments (LAAs) in the districts mentioned.  They discovered that two sets of LAAs were received by the districts.  One set consists of regular LAAs which clearly indicated the covering sub-allotment advices and were duly signed by Mrs. Angelina Escaño, Finance Officer of the MPH Regional Office.  The LAAs were numbered in proper sequence and duly recorded in the logbook of the Accounting, Budget and Finance Division. The other set consists of fake LAAs which do not indicate the covering sub-allotment advice and were signed by Chief Accountant Rolando Mangubat and Engr. Jose Bagasao, instead of the Finance Officer.  These fake LAAs were not numbered in proper sequence; they were mostly undated and were sometimes duplicated.  They could not be traced to the files and records of the Accounting, Budget and Finance Division.  The accounting entry for the disbursements made on the fake LAAs was debited to the Accounts-Payable Unliquidated Obligations (8-81-400) and credited to the Checking Account with the Bureau of Treasury (8-70-790).  Nevertheless, the expenditures were taken from obligations of the current year (1978) because all the supporting papers of the payment vouchers were dated in that year.  The entries in the journal vouchers filed with the MPH Regional Office were adjusted every month to 8-81-400 (unliquidated or prior years obligation), 8-83-000 (liquidated or current year obligations) and 8-70-700 (Treasury/Agency Account).  All of these were approved for the Finance Officer by Chief Accountant Rolando Mangubat. Mangubat, however, had no authority to approve them because since October 1977, he had already been detailed to the MPH Central Office. There were indications that the practice had been going on for years.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Due to these serious irregularities, then President Marcos created a Special Cabinet Committee on MPH Region VII "Ghost Projects Anomalies" which in turn organized a Special Task Force composed of representatives from the Finance Ministry Intelligence Bureau (FMIB), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the Bureau of Treasury and the Commission on Audit.   The mission of the task force was to conduct a wider and more extended investigation in all the fifteen (15) highway engineering districts of MPH Region VII, including the Cebu First Highway Engineering District, the 1977 questionable disbursements of which are the subject matter of these cases.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>For a better understanding of these highways cases, the flow in the release of funds to the various agencies of the government and the control devices set up for disbursement and accounting of public funds should first be explained.  A chart (Exhibit B) graphically shows the flow of allotments from the Ministry down to the district level.<br><br>On the basis of appropriation laws and upon request made by heads of agencies, the then Ministry of Budget released funds to the various agencies of the government by means of an Advice of Allotment (AA) and a Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC).  The Advice of Allotment is an authority for the agency to incur obligations within a specified amount in accordance with approved programs and projects. The Cash Disbursement Ceiling is an authority to pay.  Upon receipt of the AA and CDC from the Budget, the Central Office of the agency prepares the Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA) and the Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (ACDC) for each region, in accordance with the disbursement allotment.  These are sent to the Regional Office.  Upon receipt, the Budget Officer of the region prepares the corresponding Letters of Advice of Allotment (LAA) which are forwarded to the various districts of the region (The amount that goes to each district is already indicated in the Advice of Allotment).  Only upon receipt of the LAA is the district office authorized to incur obligations.<br><br>Now, how are funds released by the Regional Office to the different districts and ultimately paid out to contractors, the District Engineer submits to the Regional Director a request for allotment in accordance with the program of work prepared by the former. This procedure starts with the preparation of a Requisition for Supplies and Equipment (RSE) in the District Office by the Senior Civil Engineer, approved by the District Engineer, and signed by the Chief Accountant of the Highway Engineering District, who certifies as to the availability of funds.  The RSE is then submitted to the Regional Director for approval.  Once it is approved, a Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) is prepared by the Chief Accountant of the district Senior Civil Engineer.  The ROA signifies that a certain amount of district funds has been set aside or earmarked for the particular expenditures stated in the RSE.  On the basis of the ROA, the District Office puts up advertisements, [conducts] biddings, makes awards and prepares purchase orders which are served on the winning bidder.  The District Office also prepares a summary of deliveries with the corresponding delivery receipts and tally sheets, conducts inspection and prepares the General Voucher for the payment of deliveries.  Once the General Voucher (GV) has been prepared, the corresponding check in the form of a Treasury Check Account for Agency (TCAA) is drawn by the Disbursing Officer and finally released to the contractor.<br><br>At the end of every month, the Report of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officer (RCIDD) is prepared, listing all the checks issued during that period.  The RCIDDO is submitted to the accounting division of the region.  Upon receipt of the RCIDDO, the Regional Office draws a journal voucher, debiting the account obligation (liquidated or unliquidated obligation, whichever is applicable), and crediting the account Treasury Check Account for Agency (TCAA).  The RCIDDO is recorded in the Journal of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officers (JCIDDO) and posted in the general ledger at the end of each month.<br><br>Simultaneous with the flow of the RCIDDO, the ROAs are summarized in the Reports of Obligations Incurred (ROI) in the District Office, once or twice a month, depending upon the volume of transactions.  The ROI is then submitted to the Regional Office.  Upon receipt of the ROI, the accountant of the Regional Office draws a journal voucher taking up the following entry: debiting the appropriation allotted (0-90-000) and crediting the obligation incurred (0-82-000). This is recorded in the general voucher and posted to the general ledger at the end of each month.  The journal voucher is prepared, closing the account 8-70-709 to 8-71-100-199 at the end of each month.  It is also recorded and posted to the general ledger.  At the end of the month, the balances of each account shown in the general ledger are summarized in a statement called the trial balance. The trial balance is submitted to the MPH Central Office in Manila where it is consolidated with other trial balances submitted by other regional offices.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The elaborate accounting procedure described above with its system of controls was set up obviously to make sure that government funds are properly released, disbursed and accounted for.  In the hands of untrustworthy guardians of the public purse, however, it proved to be inadequate.  There were loopholes which an unscrupulous person adroit in government accounting could take advantage of to surreptitiously draw enormous sums of money from the government.<br><br>Sometime in February, 1977, accused Rolando Mangubat (Chief Accountant), Delia Preagido (Accountant III), Jose Sayson (Budget Examiner), and Edgardo Cruz (Clerk II), all of MPH Region VII, met at the Town and Country Restaurant in Cebu City and hatched an ingenious plan to siphon off large sums of money from government coffers.  Mangubat had found a way to withdraw government money through the use of fake LAAs, vouchers and other documents and to conceal traces thereof with the connivance of other government officials and employees.  In fine, the fraudulent scheme involved the splitting of LAAs and RSEs so that the amount covered by each general voucher is less than P50,000.00 to do away with the approval of the Regional Auditor; the charging of disbursements to unliquidated obligations due the previous year to provide the supposed source of funds; and the manipulation of the books of account by negation or adjustment, i.e., the cancellation of checks through journal vouchers to conceal disbursements in excess of the cash disbursement ceiling (CDC), so as not to reflect such disbursements in the trial balances submitted to the Regional Office.<br><br>Mangubat enticed Preagido, Cruz and Sayson to join him.  All three agreed to help him carry out his plan.  They typed the fake LAAs during Saturdays. Cruz and Sayson also took charge of negotiating or selling the fake LAAs to contractors at 26% of the gross amount.  Preagido on her part manipulated the General Ledger, Journal Vouchers and General Journal thru negative entries to conceal the illegal disbursements.  Thus, in the initial report of the auditors (Exhibit D), it was discovered that the doubtful allotments and other anomalies escaped notice due to the following manipulations:<br><blockquote>"The letter-advices covering such allotments (LAA) were generally not signed by the Finance Officer nor recorded in the books of accounts.  Disbursements made on the basis of these fake LAAs were charged to the unliquidated Obligations (Account 8-81-400), although the obligations being paid were not among those certified to the unliquidated obligations (Account 8-81-400) at the end of the preceding year.  To conceal the overcharges to authorized allotments, account 8-81-400 and the excess of checks issued over authorized cash disbursements ceiling, adjustments were prepared monthly through journal vouchers to take up the negative debit to Account 8-81-400 and a negative credit to the Treasury Checking Account for Agencies Account 8-70-790.  These journal vouchers in effect cancelled the previous entry to record the disbursements made on the basis of the fake LAAs. Thus, the affected accounts (Accounts 8-81-400 and 8-70-790), as appearing in the trial balance would not show the irregularity.  The checks, however, were actually issued."<br></blockquote>The four formed the nucleus of the nefarious conspiracy.  Other government employees, tempted by the prospect of earning big money, allowed their names to be used and signed spurious documents.<br><br>Although the anomalies had been going on for sometime (February 1977 to June 1978), the PNB and Bureau of Treasury had no inkling about it until the NBI busted the illegal operations.  (Some of the recipients of the stolen funds spent lavishly and bought two cars at a time).  The reason for this is that, at that time, the PNB and Bureau of Treasury were not furnished copy of the mother CDC and the local branch of the PNB did not receive independent advice from the PNB head office in Manila.  There were no deposits of money made with the PNB from which withdrawals could be charged.  Only CDCs were presented to it, and not knowing that some of the CDCs were fake, the PNB branch paid out the checks drawn against them.  The bank had also no way of knowing what amount was appropriated for the district; consequently, it did not know if the limit had already been exceeded.  Only an insider steep in government accounting, auditing and banking procedures, particularly their flaws and loopholes, could have pulled off such an ingenious and audacious plan.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Focusing our attention now on the anomalies committed in the Cebu First District Engineering District, hereinafter referred to as the Cebu First HED for brevity, the Court finds that the same pattern of fraud employed in the other highway engineering districts in MPH Region VII was followed.  The Cebu First HED received from Region VII thirty-four Letters of Advice of Allotment (LAAs) in the total sum of P4,734,336.50 and twenty-nine (29) corresponding Sub-Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (SACDCs), amounting to P5,160,677.04 for the period January 1, 1977 to December 31, 1977.  But apart from this, the Cebu First HED appears to have also received for the same period another set of eighty-four (84) LAAs amounting to P4,680,694.76 which however, could not be traced to any Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA) or matched to the Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (ACDCs) received from the MPH and Regional Office.  This is highly irregular and not in consonance with accounting procedures.<br><br>It was also made to appear that the payments were made for alleged prior year's obligations and chargeable to Account 8-81-400, obviously because, they were not properly funded.  Furthermore, the list of projects in Region VII for 1977 showed that Cebu First HED completed rehabilitation and/or improvement of roads and bridges in its districts from February to May 1977, with expenditures amounting to P613,812.00.  On the other hand, the expenditures for barangay roads in the same district in 1977 amounted to P140,692.00, and these were all completed within the period from November to December, 1977.  These completed projects were properly funded by legitimate LAAs and CDCs in the total amount of only P754,504.00.  However, an additional amount of P3,839,810.74 was spent by the Cebu First HED for maintenance of roads and bridges for the same year (1977) but the same could not be traced to any authoritative document coming from the MPH.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>A total of 132 General Vouchers, emanating from fake LAAs and ACDCs, were traced back to Rolando Mangubat, Regional Accountant of Region VII and Adventor Fernandez, Regional Highway Engineer, also of Region VII.  Those LAAs and ACDCs became the vehicles in the disbursement of funds amounting to P3,839,810.74, through the vouchers purportedly issued for the purchase and delivery of the aforementioned materials allegedly used for the maintenance and repair of the national highways within the Cebu First HED.  Despite the enormous additional expenditure of P3,839,810.74, the roads and bridges in the district, as found out by the NBI, did not show any improvement.  As testified to by several barangay captains, the road maintenance consisted merely of spreading <i>anapog</i> or limestone on potholes of the national highway.<br><br>Obviously, the vouchers for payments of alleged maintenance of roads and bridges in the additional amount of P3,839,810.74 were prepared for no other purpose than to siphon the said amount from the government coffer into the pockets of some officials and employees of Region VII and the Cebu First HED, as well as the suppliers and contractors who conspired and confederated with them.<br></blockquote>The nuclei of this massive conspiracy, namely: Rolando Mangubat, Jose Sayson, and Edgardo Cruz, all of MPH Region VII, were found guilty in all 119 counts and were accordingly sentenced by the SB. The other conniver, Delia Preagido, after being found guilty in some of the cases, became a state witness in the remainder.  On the basis of her testimony and pertinent documents, Informations were filed, convictions were obtained, and criminal penalties were imposed on the rest of the accused.<br><br>On the other hand, petitioners were both Civil Engineers of the MPH assigned to the Cebu First Highway Engineering District.  Petitioner Fernan, Jr. was included among the accused in Criminal Case Nos. 2879, 2880, 2881, 2885, 2914, and 2918 allegedly for having signed six (6) tally sheets or statements of deliveries of materials, used as bases for the preparation of the corresponding number of general vouchers.  Fund releases were made to the suppliers, contractors, and payees based on these general vouchers.<br><br>The Information against Fernan, Jr. in SB Criminal Case No. <b>2879</b> reads as follows:<br><blockquote>The undersigned accuses Rocilo Neis, Rolando Mangubat, Adventor Fernandez, Angelina Escaño, Delia Preagido, Camilo de Letran, Manuel de Veyra, Heracleo Faelnar, Basilisa Galvan, Matilde Jabalde, Josefina Luna, Jose Sayson, Edgardo Cruz, Leonila del Rosario, Engracia Escobar, Abelardo Cardona, Leonardo Tordecilla, Agripino Pagdanganan, Ramon Quirante, Mariano Montera, Mariano Jarina, Leo Villagonzalo, Asterio Buqueron, Zosimo Mendez, Simon Fernan, Jr. and Juliana de los Angeles for <i>estafa</i> thru falsification of public and commercial documents, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on, about and during the period from <b>December 1, 1976 up to January 31, 1977</b>, both dates inclusive, in the City of Cebu and in Cebu Province, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused Rocilo Neis, Assistant District Engineer of Cebu HED I;

In 1977, only more than ½ of this portion of the national highway was cemented while the remaining portion was asphalted.  While said portion of the national highway already had cracks and potholes as of 1977, the real problem was the uneven elevation of the surface of the shoulder of the road.

In 1977, the said road already had potholes which maintenance men filled up with anapog beginning in March, 1977.  The anapog was hauled in from Km. 64, the usual excavation place of anapog.

In 1977, the road from Km. 107 to Km. 108 was a gravel road.  It was properly maintained by the highways people, and every time potholes appeared on the road, they would be filled-up with anapog.  This material was dumped along the road by trucks of the Bureau of Public Highways.  On the other hand, the road leading to the heart of the poblacion was asphalted, but with potholes.  In 1977, the potholes were filled up by camineros with gravel delivered by dump trucks of the Bureau of Public Highways.

Clearly, there were no deliveries of supplies and materials for asphalting and repair of roads described in the tally sheets and other supporting documents signed by petitioners.<br><br>While petitioner Torrevillas presented Vice-Mayor Emigdio Tudlasan of Tabuclan, Cebu, who testified that he saw the asphalting of the Tabuclan Road from kilometers 18 to 19, said testimony is not conclusive on the actual delivery of the supplies indicated in the tally sheets, as Tudlasan was not present at the time of alleged delivery. Moreover, his testimony runs counter to the testimonies of <i>Barangay</i> Captain Remedios Feliciano of Looc, San Remigio, Cebu and <i>Barangay</i> Captain Pedro Orsal of Poblacion, San Remigio, Cebu. Feliciano testified that she was <i>Barangay</i> Captain of Looc, San Remigio, Cebu from 1977 to 1982; that her <i>barangay</i> is traversed by the national highway, stretching from km. 109 to km. 110; and that the only work undertaken to improve the road was the filling up of potholes with crushed limestone which camineros gathered from the roadside. On the other hand, Orsal testified that he was <i>Barangay</i> Captain of Poblacion, San Remigio, Cebu, from January 1972 to 1980; that his <i>barangay</i> is traversed by the national highway, from km. 107 to km. 110; that in 1977, the road from km. 107 to km. 108 was a gravel road maintained by the highways people, and every time potholes appeared on the road, they would be filled-up with <i>anapog</i>, which was dumped along the road by the Bureau of Public Highways; and that it was only in 1978 when the road was re-asphalted and extended from the junction of the poblacion to the adjacent barrio of Looc.<br><br>Compared to the testimony of Vice-Mayor Tudlasan, the testimonies of <i>Barangay</i> Captains Feliciano and Orsal are entitled to more weight and credit, and are more credible considering the fact that they are residents of the area where the road supposedly to be repaired is located plus the fact that they saw only limestone, not asphalt, that was used in the repair of the road in 1977. The testimonies of Feliciano and Orsal are further buttressed by the findings and statements of government witnesses, namely--Ruth Inting Paredes, Supervising Commission on Audit (COA) Auditor assigned to Region VII; Felicitas Cruz Ona, Supervising COA Auditor assigned to the main COA office; Federico A. Malvar, Senior National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Agent of the Anti-Graft Section and member of the COA NBI team assigned to investigate the anomalies; Rogelio C. Mamaril, Supervising NBI Agent of the Anti-Fraud and Action Section; and Delia Comahig Preagido, Accountant III, MPH, Region VII--to the effect that the general vouchers and LAAs that corresponded to the aforementioned tally sheets signed by petitioner Torrevillas were fake or falsified.  Undeniably, the government witnesses have no motive to testify falsely against petitioner Torrevillas and, hence, credible. We conclude that there were no actual deliveries of supplies for asphalting of road and repair on kilometers 108 and 109, which were the subjects of Criminal Case Nos. 2855, 2856, 2858, and 2859.<br><br>Glaring is the finding of the SB that the Cebu First Highway Engineering District, to which petitioners were assigned, had fake LAAs totaling to PhP 4,924,366.50, while the fake Cash Disbursement Ceilings issued amounted to PhP 6,271,150.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  The Cebu First Highway Engineering District had also issued checks per unrecorded reports in the total sum of PhP 1,135,176.82.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  Therefore, the total illegal disbursements in the Cebu First Highway Engineering District alone were a staggering PhP 12,330,693.32 circa 1977.<br><br>Of this total, petitioner Fernan, Jr. freely admitted signing tally sheets which pertained to non-existent deliveries of road construction supplies and materials totaling PhP 146,000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> including PhP 27,000 in Criminal Case No. 2914 where petitioner Torrevillas was among the co-accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> These tally sheets were attached as the supporting papers to fake general vouchers which facilitated the release of check payments to suppliers.<br><br>These checks were allegedly paid to suppliers Juliana de los Angeles (Criminal Case Nos. 2879, 2880, 2881, 2885, and 2914) and Ismael Sabio, Jr. (Criminal Case No. 2918).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On his part, petitioner Torrevillas voluntarily admitted to signing tally sheets, reports of inspection, requisitions of supplies and equipment, and other pertinent documents totaling an even greater amount of PhP 337,861.01,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> including PhP 27,000 in Criminal Case No. 2914 where petitioner Fernan, Jr. was among the co-accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  These documents signed by petitioner Torrevillas were likewise attached as supporting papers to fake general vouchers which facilitated the release of check payments to suppliers.<br><br>These checks were allegedly paid to suppliers Rufino V.

There is no question that petitioners, at the time of the commission of the crime, were public officers"civil engineers"assigned to the MPH.  Their signing of tally sheets and related documents pertaining to the alleged deliveries of supplies for road repair and construction constitutes intervention and/or taking advantage of their official positions, especially considering that they had the duty to inspect the purported deliveries and ascertain the veracity of the documents and the statements contained in them.<br><br>The tally sheets bearing their signatures contained false recitals of material facts which the petitioners had the duty to verify and confirm.  These tally sheets were attached as supporting documents to fake LAAs and subsequently became the bases for the disbursement of public funds to the damage and prejudice of the government.  Indubitably, there exists not even an iota of doubt as to petitioners' guilt.<br><br>The essential elements of estafa through falsification of public documents are present in the cases against petitioners, as follows:<br><ol><li><b>Deceit:</b> Petitioners Fernan, Jr. and Torrevillas made it appear that supplies for road construction and maintenance were delivered by suppliers allegedly in furtherance of alleged lawful projects when in fact said supplies were not delivered and no actual asphalting or repair of road was implemented.  In doing so, petitioners:<br><br>1.1. Were public officers or employees at the time of the commission of the offenses;<br><br>1.2. Took advantage of their official position as highway engineers; and<br><br>1.3. Made untruthful statements in several narrations of fact.<br><br></li><li><b>Damage:</b> The government disbursed PhP 146,000 in the case of Fernan, Jr. and PhP 337,861.01 in the case of Torrevillas, as payments to various suppliers for the delivery of non-existent supplies.<br><br>By way of defense, petitioners posit that the tally sheets and other documents could in fact be traced to genuine LAAs that were in the custody of the NBI.  Unfortunately, these genuine LAAs were not introduced in evidence.  It is an age-old axiom that s/he who alleges something must prove it. Petitioners' assertion that the documents they signed were all genuine and duly covered by genuine LAAs was substantiated only by their own self-serving and uncorroborated testimonies.  We hesitate to give much weight and credit to their bare testimonies in the face of clear, convincing, overwhelming, and hard evidence adduced by the State.<br></li></ol>If the genuine LAAs were vital to their defense, and they firmly believed that the documents were indeed in the custody of the NBI, then petitioners could have easily procured the compulsory process to compel the production of said documents.  However, petitioners miserably failed to avail of subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> which the court <i>a quo</i> could have readily granted.  The inability to produce such important and exculpatory pieces of evidence proved disastrous to petitioners' cause.  Their conviction was indeed supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt which was not overturned by defense evidence.<br><br><b>Petitioners acted in conspiracy with one another</b><br><br>Petitioners vigorously claim error on the part of the lower court when it made the finding that they were co-conspirators with the other parties accused despite the dearth of evidence to amply demonstrate complicity.<br><br>We are not convinced by petitioners' postulation.<br><br>Indeed, the burden of proving the allegation of conspiracy falls to the shoulders of the prosecution. Considering, however, the difficulty in establishing the existence of conspiracy, settled jurisprudence finds no need to prove it by direct evidence.  In <i>People v. Pagalasan</i>, the Court explicated why direct proof of prior agreement is not necessary:<br><blockquote>After all, secrecy and concealment are essential features of a successful conspiracy.  Conspiracies are clandestine in nature.  It may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, showing that they had acted with a common purpose and design.  Conspiracy may be implied if it is proved that two or more persons aimed their acts towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so that their combined acts, though apparently independent of each other, were in fact, connected and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a concurrence of sentiment.  To hold an accused guilty as a co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity.  There must be intentional participation in the transaction with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Estrada v. Sandiganbayan</i>, we categorized two (2) structures of multiple conspiracies, namely: (1) the so-called "wheel" or "circle" conspiracy, in which there is a single person or group (the "hub") dealing individually with two or more other persons or groups (the "spokes"); and (2) the "chain" conspiracy, usually involving the distribution of narcotics or other contraband, in which there is successive communication and cooperation in much the same way as with legitimate business operations between manufacturer and wholesaler, then wholesaler and retailer, and then retailer and consumer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>We find that the conspiracy in the instant cases resembles the "wheel" conspiracy. The 36 disparate persons who constituted the massive conspiracy to defraud the government were controlled by a single hub, namely: Rolando Mangubat (Chief Accountant), Delia Preagido (Accountant III), Jose Sayson (Budget Examiner), and Edgardo Cruz (Clerk II), who controlled the separate "spokes" of the conspiracy.  Petitioners were among the many spokes of the wheel.<br><br>We recall the painstaking efforts of the SB through Associate Justice Cipriano A. Del Rosario, Chairperson of the Third Division, in elaborating the intricate web of conspiracy among the accused, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Mangubat enticed Preagido, Cruz and Sayson to join him.  All three agreed to help him carry out his plan.</b>  They typed fake LAAs during Saturdays.  Cruz and Sayson also took charge of negotiating or selling fake LAAs to contractors at 26% of the gross amount.  Preagido manipulated the general ledger, journal vouchers and general journal through negative entries to conceal the illegal disbursements.  In the initial report of COA auditors Victoria C. Quejada and Ruth I. Paredes it was discovered that the doubtful allotments and other anomalies escaped notice due to the following manipulations:<br><blockquote>"The letter-advices covering such allotments (LAA) were not signed by the Finance Officer nor (sic) recorded in the books of accounts.  Disbursements made on the basis of these fake LAAs were charged to the unliquidated obligations (Account 8-81-400), although the obligations being paid were not among those certified to the unliquidated obligations (Account 8-81-400) at the end of the preceding year.  To conceal the overcharges to authorized allotments, account 8-81-400 (<i>sic</i>) and the excess of checks issued over authorized cash disbursements ceiling, adjustments were prepared monthly through journal vouchers to take up the negative debit to Account 8-81-400 and a negative credit to the Treasury Checking Account for Agencies Account 8-70-790.  These journal vouchers in effect cancelled the previous entry to record the disbursements made on the basis of fake LAAs. Thus the affected accounts (Accounts 8-81-400 and 8-70-790), as appearing in the trial balance, would not show the irregularity.  The checks, however, were actually issued."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote><b>The four formed the nucleus of the nefarious conspiracy.

The Cebu First HED received from Region VII thirty-four Letters of Advice of Allotment (LAAs) in the total sum of P4,734,336.50 and twenty-nine (29) corresponding Sub-Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (SACDCs), amounting to P5,160,677.04 for the period January 1, 1977 to December 31, 1977.  But apart from this, the Cebu First HED appears to have also received for the same period another set of eighty-four (84) LAAs amounting to P4,680,694.76 which however, could not be traced to any Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA) OR MATCHED TO THE Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (ACDCs) received from the MPH and Regional Office.  This is highly irregular and not in consonance with accounting procedures.<br><br>It was also made to appear that the payments were made for alleged prior year's obligations and chargeable to Account 81-400, obviously because, they were not properly funded.  Furthermore, the list of projects in Region VII for 1977 showed that Cebu first HED completed rehabilitation and/or improvement of roads and bridges in its districts from February to May, 1977, with expenditures amounting to P613,812.00.  On the other hand, the expenditures for barangay roads in the same district in 1977 amounted to P140,692.00, and these were all completed within the period from November to December, 1977.  These completed projects were properly funded by legitimate LAAs and CDCs in the total amount of only P754,504.00.

As testified to by several barangay captains, the road maintenance consisted merely of spreading anapog or limestone on potholes of the national Highway.<br><br>Obviously, the vouchers for payments of alleged maintenance of roads and bridges in the additional amount of P3,839,810.74 were prepared for no other purpose than to siphon off the said amount from the government coffer into the pockets of some officials and employees of Region VII and the Cebu First HED, as well as the suppliers and contractors who conspired and confederated with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>After a close re-examination of the records, the Court finds no reason to disturb the finding of the anti-graft court that petitioners are co-conspirators of the other accused, headed by Chief Accountant Rolando Mangubat, who were similarly convicted in practically all the 119 counts of estafa.  Undisturbed is the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts and in the absence of strong and compelling reasons or justifications, it will accord finality to the findings of facts of the SB.  The feeble defense of petitioners that they were not aware of the ingenuous plan of the group of accused Mangubat and the indispensable acts to defraud the government does not merit any consideration.  The State is not tasked to adduce direct proof of the agreement by petitioners with the other accused, for such requirement, in many cases, would border on near impossibility.  The State needs to adduce proof only when the accused committed acts that constitute a vital connection to the chain of conspiracy or in furtherance of the objective of the conspiracy.  In the case at bench, the signing of the fake tally sheets and/or delivery receipts, reports of inspection, and requests for supplies and materials by petitioners on separate occasions is vital to the success of the Mangubat Group in siphoning off government funds.  Without such fabricated documents, the general vouchers covering the supply of materials cannot be properly accomplished and submitted to the disbursing officer for the preparation of checks.<br><br>State witness Ruth Paredes, Supervising COA Auditor, elaborated on the procedure regarding the award of the contract more specifically to the payment of the contractor or supplier.  Once the Request for Supplies and Equipment is approved by the Regional Office, the Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) or the request for funds is signed by the District Engineer pursuant to the approved plans and budget and signed by the district accountant as to availability of funds.<br><br>The district office will advertise the invitation to bid and award the contract to the lowest bidder.  The Purchase Order (PO) is prepared and addressed to the winning bidder.  Upon delivery of the supplies and materials, the supplier bills the district office for payment.  Consequently, the requisitioning officer will prepare the general voucher which must be accompanied by the following documents: <br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>The ROA;<br></li><br><li>The PO;<br></li><br><li>The abstract of Bid together with the Bid quotations;<br></li><br><li>The delivery receipts together with the tally sheets; and<br></li><br><li>The tax clearance and tax certificate of the supplier.<br></li></ol></blockquote>After the preparation and submission of the general voucher and the supporting documents, the disbursing officer shall prepare and draw a check based on said voucher.  The check is countersigned by an officer of the district office and/or the COA Regional Director based on the amount of the check.<br><br>Thus, it is clear that without the tally sheets and delivery receipts, the general voucher cannot be prepared and completed.  Without the general voucher, the check for the payment of the supply cannot be made and issued to the supplier.  Without the check payment, the defraudation cannot be committed and successfully consummated.  Thus, petitioners' acts in signing the false tally sheets and/or delivery receipts are indispensable to the consummation of the crime of estafa thru falsification of public documents.  Surely, there were ghost or false deliveries of supplies and materials as convincingly shown by the testimonies of the barangay captains, officials, and residents of the areas where the materials were allegedly used.  More importantly, if there were actual deliveries of materials made, then there would be no need to fake the LAAs because the suppliers will have to be paid the cost of said materials plus a reasonable profit.  As a result, there is nothing or not much to share with the more than 30 or so co-conspirators, for the suppliers would not be too dim-witted to part with even their cost in buying the materials they allegedly supplied.  Moreover, the fake delivery receipts and tally sheets signed by petitioners were linked to the general vouchers upon which check payments were made to the suppliers who were found guilty of participating in the fraud.  With respect to petitioner Fernan, Jr., he signed tally sheets on the ghost deliveries of Juliana de los Angeles and Ismael Sabio, Jr.  On the part of petitioner Torrevillas, he signed false tally sheets and delivery receipts on supplies allegedly delivered by Rufino V. Nuñez, Juliana de los Angeles, Ismael Sabio, Jr., and Manuel Mascardo.  Lastly, the checks issued to these suppliers based on general vouchers supported by the false tally sheets and general vouchers signed by petitioners cannot be traced to any genuine LAAs, resulting in the inescapable conclusion that these LAAs were unauthorized; hence, fake or fabricated.  These are undisputed tell-tale signs of the complicity by petitioners with the Mangubat syndicate.<br><br>In <i>People v. Mangubat</i>, the court <i>a quo</i> elucidated the conspiracy in the Cebu highway scam in a trenchant manner:<br><blockquote>Where the acts of each of the accused constitute an essential link in a chain and the desistance of even one of them would prevent the chain from being completed, then no conspiracy could result as its consummation would then be impossible or aborted.  But when each and everyone of the accused in the instant cases performed their assigned tasks and roles with martinet-like precision and accuracy, by individually performing essential overt acts, so much so that the common objective is attained, which is to secure the illegal release of public funds under the guise of fake or simulated public documents, then each and everyone of said accused are equally liable as co-principals under the well-established and universally-accepted principle that, once a conspiracy is directly or impliedly proven, the act of one is the act of all and such liability exists notwithstanding no-participation in every detail in the execution of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>In sum, the required quantum of proof has been adduced by the State on the conspiracy among the accused including petitioners.
