				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Case</b></u></div><br>This is a petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the 7 January 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and 20 May 2002 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 56816. The Court of Appeals affirmed the 9 September 1997 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 224 (trial court) in Civil Case No. Q-95-24170.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Facts<br><br></b></u></div>Petitioner Titan Construction Corporation (petitioner) is engaged in the construction business, while respondent Uni-Field Enterprises, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (respondent) is engaged in the business of selling various construction materials.<br><br>From 1990 to 1993, petitioner purchased on credit various construction supplies and materials from respondent. Petitioner's purchases amounted to P7,620,433.12 but petitioner was only able to pay P6,215,795.70, leaving a balance of P1,404,637.42. On 19 October 1994, respondent sent a demand letter to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> But the balance remained unpaid.<br><br>On 26 June 1995, respondent filed with the trial court a complaint for collection of sum of money with damages against petitioner.<br><br>In its Answer dated 18 August 1995, petitioner admitted the purchases but disputed the amount claimed by respondent. Petitioner also interposed a counterclaim and sought to recover P204,527.99 from respondent based on damaged vinyl tiles, non-delivery of materials, and advances for utility expenses, dues, and insurance premiums on the condominium unit turned over by petitioner to respondent.<br><br>On 9 September 1997, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of respondent. The 9 September 1997 Decision provides:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, therefore, judgment is hereby rendered for the plaintiff [respondent] as against the defendant [petitioner] and ordering the latter to pay the plaintiff [respondent] the following:<br></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>The principal amount of P1,404,114.00;</li><li>Interest Charges in the amount of P504,114.00 plus accrued interest charges at 24% per annum compounded yearly reckoned from July, 1995 up to the time of full payment;</li><li>Liquidated Damages in the amount of P324,147.94;</li><li>Attorney's Fees equivalent to 25% of whatever amount is due and payable and accumulated appearance fees at P1,000.00 per hearing; and</li><li>Costs of suits.</li></ol>IT IS SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals. In its 7 January 2002 Decision, the Court of Appeals denied the appeal for lack of merit and affirmed the trial court's 9 September 1997 Decision.<br><br>In its 20 May 2002 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration. Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></div><br>The 7 January 2002 Decision of the Court of Appeals reads:<br><blockquote>A careful reading of the records of the case shows that in the answer to the complaint, the existence of the delivery receipts and invoices were not denied by appellant, rather, it admitted the transactions subject of the instant case. Clearly, if the damages alleged are liquidated or stipulated, they are deemed admitted when not specifically denied.<br></blockquote><blockquote>x x x x<br></blockquote><blockquote>Further, appellant cannot question the interest rate on overdue accounts as the same was provided for in the delivery receipts and sales invoices, which have not been denied by    it. Therefore, the terms and conditions therein have become the law between the parties, and both are bound by said conditions. Failure of a party to contest the terms and conditions results in his admission thereof.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Appellant asserts that "nowhere is there any stipulation that plaintiff is entitled to a 24% interest". This is absurd. The Sales Invoices and Delivery Receipts, contained the provision that:<br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>"This invoice is the written contract between Unifield Enterprises, [I]nc. and the above-named customer. This is payable on demand unless otherwise indicated hereinabove. Interest of 24% per annum will be charged on overdue accounts, compounded with the outstanding principal obligation as they accrue. Claims or corrections hereto or in the goods must be communicated in writing to Uni-field Enterprises within two (2) days from receipt of the goods. x x x Should Unifield Enterprises, Inc. be constrained to effect collection through Court action and proceedings before the Fiscalï¿½s [sic], said customer agrees to pay the following additional sums: (1) 25% liquidated damages based on the outstanding total obligation; (2) 25% attorney's fees based on the total claim including said liquidated damages; (3) appearance fees of counsel at P500.00 per hearing in addition to all other court costs and expenses. x x x"<br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>It is emphasized that contracts are perfected by mere consent; the stipulations of the contract being the law between the parties, courts have no alternative but to enforce them as they are agreed upon and written, there being no law or public policy against the stipulated provisions.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Verily, this Court finds no reason to go against the findings of the lower court considering that the assailed decision was arrived at "after a careful review and perusal of the evidence presented by both parties in their pleadings filed before the" lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></div><br>Petitioner raises the following issues:<br><ol><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING LEGAL BASIS FOR [AWARDING] LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, ATTORNEY'S FEES AND INTEREST IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENT; and<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED BY OVERLOOKING CERTAIN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF WEIGHT AND INFLUENCE WHICH IF CONSIDERED WOULD ALTER THE RESULTS OF THE CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></u><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i><b>Factual Findings of the Trial Court and the Court of Appeals Bind the Court</b></i><br></div><br>Petitioner asks the Court to review the records of the case and re-examine the evidence presented before the trial court and the Court of Appeals.<br><br>As a rule, only questions of law may be appealed to the Court by petition for review. The Court is not a trier of facts, its jurisdiction being limited to errors of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Moreover, factual findings of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are generally binding on this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In this case, the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals were based on substantial evidence which were not refuted with contrary proof by petitioner. We thus find no reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i><b>On the Award of Interests, Liquidated Damages, and Attorney's Fees<br><br></b></i></div>Petitioner insists that the trial court and the Court of Appeals had no legal basis to award interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees because the delivery receipts and sales invoices, which served as the basis for the award, were not formally offered as evidence by respondent. Petitioner also alleges that the delivery receipts and sales invoices were in the nature of contracts of adhesion and petitioner had no option but to accept the conditions imposed by respondent.<br><br>While the delivery receipts and sales invoices did not form part of respondent's formal offer of evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> records show that the delivery receipts and sales invoices formed part of petitioner's formal offer of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The delivery receipts and sales invoices expressly stipulated the payment of interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees in case of overdue accounts and collection suits. Petitioner did not only bind itself to pay the principal amount, it also promised to pay (1) interest of 24% per annum on overdue accounts, compounded with the principal obligations as they accrue; (2) 25% liquidated damages based on the outstanding total obligation; and (3) 25% attorney's fees based on the total claim including liquidated damages. Since petitioner freely entered into the contract, the stipulations in the contract are binding on petitioner. Thus, the trial court and the Court of Appeals did not err in using the delivery receipts and sales invoices as basis for the award of interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees.<br><br>On the allegation that the delivery receipts and sales invoices are in the nature of contracts of adhesion, the Court has repeatedly held that contracts of adhesion are as binding as ordinary contracts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Those who adhere to the contract are in reality free to reject it entirely and if they adhere, they give their consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It is true that on some occasions the Court struck down such contract as void when the weaker party is imposed upon in dealing with the dominant party and is reduced to the alternative of accepting the contract or leaving it, completely deprived of the opportunity to bargain on equal footing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Considering that petitioner and respondent have been doing business from 1990 to 1993 and that petitioner is not a small time construction company, petitioner is "presumed to have full knowledge and to have acted with due care or, at the very least, to have been aware of the terms and conditions of the contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Petitioner was free to contract the services of another supplier if respondent's terms were not acceptable. Moreover, petitioner failed to show that in its transactions with respondent it was the weaker party or that it was compelled to accept the terms imposed by the respondent. In fact, petitioner only questioned the terms of the contract after the trial court issued its 9 September 1997 Decision. The Court, therefore, upholds the validity of the contract between petitioner and respondent.<br><br>However, the Court will reduce the amount of attorney's fees awarded by the trial court and the Court of Appeals. In this case, aside from the award of P324,147.94 as liquidated damages, the trial court and the Court of Appeals also ordered petitioner to pay respondent attorney's fees "equivalent to 25% of whatever amount is due and payable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The law allows a party to recover attorney's fees under a written agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In <i>Barons Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>, the Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>[T]he attorney's fees here are in the nature of liquidated damages and the stipulation therefor is aptly called a penal clause. It has been said that so long as such stipulation does not contravene law, morals, or public order, it is strictly binding upon defendant. The attorney's fees so provided are awarded in favor of the litigant, not his counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, the law also allows parties to a contract to stipulate on liquidated damages to be paid in case of breach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> A stipulation on liquidated damages is a penalty clause where the obligor assumes a greater liability in case of breach of an obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The obligor is bound to pay the stipulated amount without need for proof on the existence and on the measure of damages caused by the breach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Articles 1229<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and 2227<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the Civil Code empower the courts to reduce the penalty if it is iniquitous or unconscionable. The determination of whether the penalty is iniquitous or unconscionable is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and depends on several factors such as the type, extent, and purpose of the penalty, the nature of the obligation, the mode of breach and its consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court notes that respondent had more than adequately protected itself from a possible breach of contract because of the stipulations on the payment of interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees. The Court finds the award of attorney's fees "equivalent to 25% of whatever amount is due and payable" to be exorbitant because it includes (1) the principal of P1,404,114.00; (2) the interest charges of P504,114.00 plus accrued interest charges at 24% per annum compounded yearly reckoned from July 1995 up to the time of full payment; and (3) liquidated damages of P324,147.94. Moreover, the liquidated damages and the attorney's fees serve the same purpose, that is, as penalty for breach of the contract. Therefore, we reduce the award of attorney's fees to 25% of the <b>principal obligation</b>, or P351,028.50.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>AFFIRM</b> the appealed Decision dated 7 January 2002 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
