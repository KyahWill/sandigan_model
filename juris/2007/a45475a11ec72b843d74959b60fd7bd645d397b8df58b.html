				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Which came first, the chicken or the egg?<br><br>This age-old question has spurned millions of debates in scientific and religious circles, and has stimulated the imagination of generations of children and adults.  Many profess that they are certain of the answer, and yet their answers are divergent.<br><br>The case at bar involves a similarly baffling question, but in significantly lesser proportions of philosophical mystery.  Petitioner claims that, in the two Deeds of Donation he is impugning, the signatures of the donee were jotted down before the bodies of the Deeds were typewritten.  Respondents maintain that the bodies of the Deeds were encoded first, and then, a clashing presentation of expert witnesses and circumstantial evidence ensued.  Petitioner's expert claims she is certain of the answer: the signature came first.  Respondents' expert, on the other hand, says that it is impossible to determine which came first accurately.  As both the trial court and the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of respondents, petitioner is furious how these courts could adopt an opinion that was "neither here nor there."<br><br>However, as it is with the chicken and egg riddle, is the person certain of which came first necessarily the one who is more credible?<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 4 September 2002 and 27 November 2002, respectively, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 40391 affirming the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City dated 8 April 1992 in Civil Cases No. 36089 and No. 36090.<br><br>The facts of the case, as summarized by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:<br><blockquote>On February 15, 1980, [petitioner] instituted these cases, to wit: (1) Civil Case No. 36089, entitled: "Augusto Gomez, as Special Administrator of the Intestate Estate of Consuelo Gomez, Plaintiff, versus Maria Rita Gomez-Samson, Marcial Samson, Jesus B. Gomez, and the Registers of Deeds of Pasig and Marikina, Rizal, Defendants"; and (2) Civil Case No. 36090, entitled: "Augusto Gomez, as Special Administrator of the Intestate Estate of Consuelo Gomez, Plaintiff, versus Ariston Gomez, Sr., and Ariston B. Gomez, Jr., Defendants", both in the Regional Trial Court, Pasig City.<br><br>CONSUELO, ARISTON, SR. and Angel, all surnamed Gomez, were sister and brothers, respectively.  MARIA-RITA Gomez-Samson, JESUS Gomez and ARISTON Gomez, JR. are the children of ARISTON, SR. while AUGUSTO Gomez is the child of Angel.<br><br>In Civil Case No. 36089, plaintiff AUGUSTO alleged in his complaint that CONSUELO, who died on November 6, 1979, was the owner of the following real properties:<br><blockquote>"(a) A parcel of land, with all the improvements thereon, situated in Marikina, Metro Manila, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 340233 in her name, x x x;<br><br>"(b) A parcel of land, with all the improvements thereon, situated in Marikina, Metro Manila, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 353818 in her name, x x x,"<br><br>"(c) A parcel of land, with all the improvements thereon, situated in Pasig, Metro Manila, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 268396 in her name, x x x;"</blockquote>that after the death of Consuelo, defendants Rita and Jesus fraudulently prepared and/or caused to be prepared a Deed of Donation <span style="font-style: italic;">Intervivos</span>; that in the said document, Consuelo donated the above described properties to defendants Rita and Jesus; that the said defendants forged or caused to be forged the signature of the donor, Consuelo; that the notarial acknowledgement on the said document was antedated to April 21, 1979; that on the basis of the said document defendants sought the cancellation of the certificates of title in the name of Consuelo and the issuance of new ones in the names of defendants Rita and Jesus.<br><br>On the basis of the foregoing, plaintiff prayed that the Deed of Donation <span style="font-style: italic;">Intervivos</span> be declared false, null and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span>, and/or be nullified; that TCT Nos. 340233, 353818, and 268396 be reinstated or be replaced by titles in the name of the Intestate Estate of Consuelo Gomez; and, that defendants be ordered to pay damages, by way of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation plus costs.<br><br>On April 24, 1980, private defendants, and nominal defendants Registers of Deeds of Pasig and Marikina, Rizal, filed their common answer, denying the material allegations in the complaint and asserting that a copy of the deed of donation was submitted to the Notarial Section of the CFI of Quezon City as early as July 2, 1979; that the said document is valid and not a forgery or otherwise subject to similar infirmity; that the said document being valid, the properties covered therein passed in ownership to private defendants, as early as April 20, 1979; that defendants have the perfect and absolute right to cause the cancellation of TCT Nos. 340233, 353818, and 26839 and request for the issuance of new certificates of titles in their respective names; that they have the right to use, enjoy, possess, dispose and own these properties; that no law was violated by the nominal defendants when the old certificates of title were cancelled and new certificates were issued in the name of the private defendants, hence, plaintiff has no cause of action against the nominal defendants neither has the court jurisdiction over the foregoing issue.<br><br>Defendants thereafter prayed for moral damages of P2,000,000.00; compensatory damages of P1,000,000.00; exemplary damages of P500,000.00; attorney's fees of P200,000.00; and that individual plaintiff be made jointly and severally liable with the estate of Consuelo Gomez.<br><br>In Civil Case No. 36090, the same plaintiff alleged in his complaint that Consuelo was also the sole and absolute owner of the following personal properties:<br><br>(a) Seventy-five (75) common shares of stock of V-Tri Realty, Inc. with a total par value of P75,000.00 and covered by Stock Certificate No. 003;<br><br>(b) Eleven thousand eight hundred fifty three (11,853) common shares of stock of First Philippine Holdings Corporation with a total par value of P118,530.00 covered by Stock Certificates Nos.

Whereupon, the records of Civil Case No. 36090 were transmitted to the RTC, Branch 23.<br><br>After appropriate proceedings, the trial court directed the parties to submit their respective memoranda thirty (30) days from their receipt of the transcript of stenographic notes.<br><br>In its joint decision dated April 8, 1992, the trial court dismissed the complaints.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the RTC Joint Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is Ordered:<br><ol><li>That the instant complaints be dismissed;<br><br></li><li>That the replevin bonds nos. 2223, 2224, 2225, and 2226 of the Stronghold Insurance Company, Incorporated be cancelled;<br><br></li><li>That Augusto Gomez and the estate of the late Consuelo Gomez, jointly and solidarily, should pay to Ariston Gomez, Jr. the following amounts:<br><br>Moral damages of P1,000,000.00;<br><br>Exemplary damages of P250,000.00<br><br>Attorney's fees of P200,000.00<br></li></ol>And costs of suit; with legal interest on all the amounts, except on costs and attorney's fees, commencing from February 15, 1980, until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals.

Respondents, on the other hand, presented their own expert witness, Francisco Cruz, Chief of Document Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the PC-INP Crime Laboratory.  Other direct evidence presented by respondents includes testimonies positively stating that the Deeds of Donation were signed by Consuelo in their completed form in the presence of Notary Public Jose Sebastian.  These testimonies are that of Jose Sebastian himself, and that of several of the respondents including Ariston Gomez, Jr. (Ariston, Jr.), who allegedly drafted said Deeds of Donation.<br><br>As the testimony of Zenaida Torres is the single most important evidence of petitioner, it is imperative to examine the lengthy discussion of the trial court analyzing her testimony, and the contradictory findings of Francisco Cruz.<br><br>Zenaida Torres's testimony, as noted by the trial court, was that she had examined the two Deeds of Donation, denominated as Documents No. 401 and No. 402, and her findings were that the signatures therein were indeed those of Consuelo.  However, she opined that Documents No. 401 and No. 402 were not typed or prepared in one continuous sitting because the horizontal lines had some variances horizontally.  Nevertheless, she admitted that the vertical lines did not show any variance.<br><br>Zenaida Torres also testified that with respect to Document No. 401, the typewritten words "Consuelo C. Gomez" were typed after the handwritten signature "Consuelo C. Gomez."  This is based on her analysis of the letter "o" in the handwritten signature, which touches the letter "n" in the typewritten name "Consuelo C. Gomez."  She could not, however, make any similar findings with respect to Document No. 402, because the typewritten words "Consuelo C. Gomez" and the handwritten signature "Consuelo C. Gomez" "do not even touch" in the latter document.<br><br>Zenaida Torres failed to convince the trial court that the Deeds of Donation were not prepared in one sitting:<br><blockquote>To start with, it is very significant that Torres herself admits that the signatures of Consuelo in the Donations 401 and 402 are genuine.<br><br>(This is contrary to the allegations of Augusto in his complaint; wherein he alleged that the signatures of Consuelo were forged.  In fact, as per the allegations, in Augusto's complaint, the signatures were forged, after the death of Consuelo).<br><br>(In effect, Augusto is now trying to shift the thrust of his attack, to a scenario wherein Consuelo allegedly signed two papers in blank, and thereafter, said Donations 401 and 402 were typed on top.)<br><br>Furthermore, Torres fell apart during, cross-examination.  Torres admitted that she had not taken any specialized studies on the matter of "Questioned Documents," except on one or two seminars on "Questioned Documents."  She admitted that she had not passed the Board Exams, as a Chemist; she further admitted that she has not written any thesis or similar work on the subject matter at issue.<br><br>Regarding non-typing in one continuous sitting, she admitted that she had never seen the typewriter used to type the Donations 401 and 402, nor even tried to get hold of it, before she made the report; that there were no variances insofar as the vertical alignments of the typewritten documents were concerned; that there were only variances insofar as the horizontal alignments are concerned; she admitted that if anybody had wanted to incorporate a document into a blank sheet of paper, on top of a signature, the normal step to be taken would be to be careful on horizontal alignment, which can be seen via the naked eye; and not the vertical alignment.  Yet, the vertical alignment, as admitted by her, was perfect.<br><br>In fact, she had to admit that it is possible that if the paper roller is loose, the horizontal alignment will have a variance; whereas, the vertical alignment would have no variance, and there would be nothing sinister about this.  She had to admit this, because she was confronted with an authority on the matter, more particularly the book of Wilson Harrison (vide Exhibit "17").  She admitted that she had not used bromide when she took the photographs of the two (2) Donations 401 and 402, which photographs she later on enlarged.  She admitted that when she had taken the photographs of the two (2) Donations, she had not put the typewritten pitch measure on top.  She admitted that when the photographs were enlarged, the alignment of the typewritten words became distorted; more so when a typewriter pitch measure is not used, when photographing the documents.<br><br>In effect, insofar as the issue of typewriting in one sitting or not, is concerned, the testimony of Torres was completely discredited (Vide TSN of May 19, 1986).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>On the other hand, the trial court gave weight to the testimony of Francisco Cruz:<br><blockquote>Cruz testified on this point that the Donations 401 and 402 were both typed in one continuous sitting.  He elucidated clearly on how he arrived at this conclusion.<br><br>To start with, he was able to determine that the typewriter used was the elite typewriter, because as per Cruz, when his typewriting measuring the instruments were placed over the documents, there were twelve (12) letters that went inside one inch, which is a characteristic of an elite typewriter.<br><br>Secondly, he noticed that the color tone of the typewriter ink is the same, thru the entire documents.<br><br>As per Cruz, this is another indication that the Donations 401 and 402 were prepared in one continuous sitting, because, as per Cruz, if the typewriter is used one time and sometime after that, the typewriter is used again, the color tone will most probably be different.<br><br>He further concluded that both the horizontal and vertical alignments are in agreement.  He explained how he arrived at this conclusion.<br><br>As per Cruz, by using an instrument which is a typewriting measuring instrument produced by the Criminal Research Co., Inc. in the USA and placing said instrument to test the vertical alignment from the top down to the bottom, there is a perfect vertical alignment.<br><br>In fact, as per Cruz, when he took photographs of the documents, he had already placed the typewriting measuring instrument over the document and he showed to the court the enlarged photographs, indicating clearly that all the vertical alignments are all in order.<br><br>He also found out that the horizontal and vertical alignments are in agreement.<br><br>He explained that the slight variances as to the spacing of the words "Know All Men By These Presents" and the words "That I Consuelo C. Gomez, single, of legal age, Filipino, and a resident of 24 Pine Street, New Marikina Subdivision, Marikina", there is a slight disagreement in the spacing, but not in the alignment.<br><br>He explained that the normal reason for such discrepancy in the spacing is because the typist sometimes tries to push the variable spacer; the [button] on the left side of the roller, and if you press that round [button], there will be a variance spacing namely one space, two spaces, and three spaces; and these are not attached so there is a variable in the spacing.<br><br>In short, this was due to the pushing of the variable paper by the typist.<br><br>Furthermore, he emphasized that the left margins are aligned and this signifies that there was typing in one continuous sitting, because if you type on a paper and re-insert it again, there are differences in the left hand margin.  All of his findings appear in the blow up photographs which were marked as Exhibits "31" to "34".<br><br>He even pointed out the differences in the Jurat wherein admittedly, Judge Sebastian inserted the date "21<sup>st</sup>" and "1" (page number), "401" (document number), "I" (book number), and "82" (series); and also his signature "Jose R. Sebastian" and his "PTR Number" (vide pages 12 to 19, TSN of April 25, 1982).<br><br>All attempts by opposite counsel to discredit the testimony of Cruz on this issue, proved futile.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>As stated above, petitioner also alleges that the signature "Consuelo C. Gomez" was written before the typewritten name "Consuelo C. Gomez."  In this second round of analysis of the respective testimonies of Zenaida Torres and Francisco Cruz, the trial court arrived at the same conclusion:<br><blockquote>[ZENAIDA TORRES'S] FINDINGS ARE BASED SOLELY ON A SINGLE HANDWRITTEN LETTER "O", WHICH TOUCHES (DOES NOT EVEN INTERSECT) THE TYPEWRITTEN LETTER "N".  BASED ON THIS, WITHOUT MORE, TORRES CONCLUDED THAT THE TYPEWRITTEN NAME "CONSUELO C. GOMEZ" CAME AFTER THE HANDWRITTEN SIGNATURE "CONSUELO C. GOMEZ".</blockquote>We need but cite authorities on the matter (with which Authorities Torres was confronted and which authorities she had to admit), which read as follows:<br><blockquote>The Intersection of Ink Lines with Typescript.  It is often stated that is possible to determine whether an ink line which intersects typescript was written before or after the typing.  The theory is simple; most typewriter inks are greasy and an ink line tends to shrink in width as it passes over a greasy place on the paper.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If, indeed, an ink line is observed to suffer a distinct reduction in width every time it intersects the typescript it may safely be concluded that the ink line was written after the typescript.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In practice, however, ink lines written across typescript are rarely seen to suffer any appreciable shrinkage in width, since the amount of oily medium transferred from the ribbon to the paper is rarely sufficient to have any effect.  Indeed, if the ink happens to be alkaline, surplus ink, instead of shrinking, may spread out into the typescript to increase the width of the inkline at the intersection.  In the case the proof that the ink followed the typescript would be the presence of a swelling rather than a shrinkage.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experience has shown that it is rarely possible for any definite opinion as to the order of appearance on the paper for intersecting ink lines and typescript to be justified on the [meager] amount of evidence which generally available.</span><br><br>A similar state of affairs will be found to hold for carbon paper and waxer; which have much in common with typewriter ribbons in the way the mark they make on paper react with intersecting ink lines". (Wilson, Suspect Documents; Exhibits "19"; "19-A"; "37"; "37-D"; underscoring ours).<br><br>In fact, the very authority of Torres on the matter, states as follows:<br><br>"Sequence of Writing<br><br>Intersecting writing strokes may have distinctive patterns, depending upon the order of writing the lapse of time between the two writings, the density of the two strokes and the kind of inks, writing instruments, and paper used.  With a binocular microscope or a hand-magnifier aided by skillfully controlled light and photography, the true order of preparation may be revealed and demonstrated to a lay observer.<br><br>What appears to be the obvious solution may not always be the correct answer.  For example, the line of deepest color usually appears on top even if it was written first.  Careful study and testing is necessary before reaching a conclusion.  Some of the more common criteria for determining sequence are considered in the following paragraphs.<br><br>If we considered the intersection of two writing strokes or the intersection of writing and typewriting the majority of problems are covered.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Substantial, repeated intersections of two writings offer a higher probability of success than a single indifferent intersection, such as a weak stroke crossing another which only very infrequently can produce a clear indication of the order of writing"</span>. (Exhibits "V" and "V-1" (underscoring ours).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>The trial court again sided with Francisco Cruz who testified, citing authorities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that it is impossible to determine accurately which came first, because there were no intersections at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  The trial court added: "[i]n fact, common sense, without more, dictates that if there are no intersections (between the typewritten and the handwritten words), it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine which came first."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  The Court of Appeals found nothing erroneous in these findings of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Petitioner claims that the testimony of Zenaida Torres, having positively maintained that the handwritten signatures "Consuelo C.

It is, thus, highly improbable for an expert witness to forget his examination of said evidence.  Consequently, whereas faulty memory may be the reason for the negative testimonies delivered by ordinary witnesses, this is unlikely to be so with respect to expert witnesses.  While we, therefore, cannot say that positive evidence does not carry an inherent advantage over negative evidence when it comes to expert witnesses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the process by which the expert witnesses arrived at their conclusions should be carefully examined and considered.<br><br>On this respect, Prof. Wigmore states that the ordinary expert witness, in perhaps the larger proportion of the topics upon which he may be questioned, has not a knowledge derived from personal observation.  He virtually reproduces, literally or in substance, conclusions of others which he accepts on the authority of the eminent names responsible for them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  In the case at bar, the expert witnesses cited sources as bases of their observations.  Francisco Cruz's statement that "no finding or conclusion could be arrived at,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> has basis on the sources presented both by him and by Zenaida Torres.  Both sets of authorities speak of intersecting ink lines.  However, the typewritten words "Consuelo C. Gomez" barely touch and do not intersect the handwritten signature Consuelo C. Gomez in Document No. 401.  In Document No. 402, said typewritten words and handwritten signature do not even touch.<br><br>In the case at bar, therefore, the expert testimony that "no finding or conclusion can be arrived at," was found to be more credible than the expert testimony positively stating that the signatures were affixed before the typing of the Deeds of Donation.  The former expert testimony has proven to be more in consonance with the authorities cited by both experts.<br><br>As regards the assertion that Zenaida Torres conducted her tests on the carbon originals of both Deeds of Donation found in the notarial registrar, whereas Francisco Cruz merely examined the original in the possession of Ariston, Jr. with respect to Document No. 401, suffice it to say that this circumstance cannot be attributed to respondents.  After the examination of the documents by Zenaida Torres, fire razed the Quezon City Hall.  The carbon originals of said Deeds were among the documents burned in the fire.  Petitioner never rebutted respondents' manifestation concerning this incident, nor accused respondents of burning the Quezon City Hall.<br><br>Other than the above allegations, petitioner's attack on the entire testimony of Francisco Cruz (including the part concerning whether the Deeds were typed in one continuous sitting) rests primarily in the contention that, while Zenaida Torres was court-appointed, Francisco Cruz's testimony was solicited by respondents, one of whom had previously solicited such testimony for another case.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v.

The trial court is consequently given the discretion in weighing all these circumstances in its determination of the expert witness' credibility, as it is in a better position than the appellate courts to observe the demeanor of these witnesses.  As there is no evidence of abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in such determination, the latter is not reviewable by this Court.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Alleged patent irregularities on the<br>face of the assailed Deeds of<br>Donation</span><br><br>As previously mentioned, the testimony of Zenaida Torres constitutes the only direct evidence presented by petitioner to prove that the Deeds of Donation were merely intercalated over the signature of Consuelo.

None of these alleged irregularities affects the validity of the subject Deeds of Donation, nor connotes fraud or foul play.  It is true that the condition and physical appearance of a questioned document constitute a valuable factor which, if correctly evaluated in light of surrounding circumstances, may help in determining whether it is genuine or forged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  However, neither the expert witnesses, nor our personal examination of the exhibits, had revealed such a questionable physical condition.<br><br>Legal documents contained in 8 ½ x 11 paper are neither unheard of, nor even uncommon.  The same is true with regard to single-spaced legal documents; in fact, petitioner's Supplemental Memorandum was actually single-spaced.<br><br>That the subject Deeds of Donation appear to have conveyed numerous properties in two sheets of paper does not militate against their authenticity.  Not all people equate length with importance.  The simplicity and practicality of organizing the properties to be donated into real and personal properties, and using one-page documents to convey each category, are clearly appealing to people who value brevity.  The same appeal of conciseness had driven petitioner to make a single-spaced Supplemental Memorandum whose only object was to summarize the arguments he has laid down in the original twice-as-long Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> an endeavor that we, in fact, appreciate.<br><br>The allegation concerning the use of one typewriter to encode both Deeds of Donation, including the notarial acknowledgment portion, TAN, and residence certificates, is purely paranoia.  Being in the legal profession for many years, we are aware that it is common practice for the parties to a contract to type the whole document, so that all the notary public has to do is to input his signature, seal, and the numbers pertaining to his notarial registry.<br><br>The use of single-paged documents also provides an explanation as to why the PTR number and the date and place of issue are found in the right-hand side of the name and signature of Jose Sebastian, instead of below it.  We agree with respondents that it is irrational, impractical, and contrary to human experience to use another page just to insert those minute but necessary details.  Such use of single-paged documents, taken together with the fact that the Deeds of Donation are of almost the same length, are also the reasons why it does not baffle us that the signatures of Consuelo appear at around the same portions of these Deeds.  Indeed, we would have been suspicious had these documents been of varying lengths, but the signatures still appear on the same portions in both.<br><br>The only observations concerning the physical appearance of the subject Deeds of Donation that truly give us doubts as to their authenticity are the relatively small margins on the sides of the same, the lack of copies thereof, and the alleged inclusion in Document No. 402 of a bodega allegedly not owned by Consuelo.  However, these doubts are not enough to establish the commission of fraud by respondents and to overturn the presumption that persons are innocent of crime or wrong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  Good faith is always presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  It is the one who alleges bad faith who has the burden to prove the same,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> who, in this case, is the petitioner.<br><br>The small margins in the said Deeds of Donation, while indicative of sloppiness, were not necessarily resorted to because there was a need to intercalate a long document and, thus, prove petitionerï¿½s theory that there were only two pieces of paper signed by Consuelo.   Respondents admit that the use of one sheet of paper for both Deeds of Donation was intentional, for brevity's sake.  While the ensuing litigation could now have caused regrets on the part of Ariston, Jr. for his decision to sacrifice the margins for brevity's sake, there still appears no indication that he did so maliciously.  Indeed, law professors remind bar examinees every year to leave margins on their booklets.  Despite the importance examinees put into such examinations, however, examinees seem to constantly forget these reminders.<br><br>The testimonies of Ariston Gomez, Sr. (Ariston, Sr.), Ariston, Jr., Maria Rita Gomez-Samson (Maria Rita), and Notary Public Jose Sebastian tend to show that there were one original and two copies each of Documents No. 401 and No. 402.  Of these documents, it was the original of Document No. 402 and a duplicate original of Document No. 401 which were actually presented by petitioner himself before the trial court, through the representative of the notarial registrar of Quezon City, who testified pursuant to a subpoena.  The latter two documents were submitted to the NBI for examination by petitioner and by the NBI Handwriting Expert, Zenaida Torres.<br><br>Petitioner testified that he could not find copies of the two Deeds of Donation with the Bureau of Records Management.

On the other hand, Maria Rita testified that one copy each of the duplicate originals of Documents No. 401 and No. 402 were lost.  Maria Rita explained that when she was about to leave for Spain to visit her sister in Palma de Mallorica, her father, Ariston, Sr., gave her the brown envelope, containing duplicate originals of the Deeds of Donation in question, to show to her sister in Palma de Mallorica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>  Maria Rita explained in detail how her handbag was stolen as she was praying in a chapel while waiting for the connecting flight from Madrid to Palma de Mallorica.  The handbag allegedly contained not only duplicate originals of the said Deeds of Donation, but also other important documents and her valuables.  Maria Rita presented the police report of the Spanish police authorities<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and her letter to the Valley National Bank of U.S.A.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> regarding these losses.<br><br>Notary public Jose Sebastian retained two copies of the Deeds of Donation in his files.

Since Jose Sebastian had to transmit to the Notarial Registrar duplicate originals of the document, he had to photocopy the same to keep as his own copies, and transmit to the Notarial Registrar whatever duplicate original copies he had.  Jose Sebastian did not notice that, instead of retaining a duplicate original of Document No. 402, what was left with him was the original.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>While it cannot be denied that the unfortunate incidents and accidents presented by respondents do arouse some suspicions, the testimonies of Ariston, Jr., Maria Rita, and Jose Sebastian had been carefully examined by the trial court, which found them to be credible.  Time and again, this Court has ruled that the findings of the trial court respecting the credibility of witnesses are accorded great weight and respect since it had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses as they testified before the court.  Unless substantial facts and circumstances have been overlooked or misunderstood by the latter which, if considered, would materially affect the result of the case, this Court will undauntedly sustain the findings of the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>All petitioner has succeeded in doing, however, is to instill doubts in our minds.  While such approach would succeed if carried out by the accused in criminal cases, plaintiffs in civil cases need to do much more to overturn findings of fact and credibility by the trial court, especially when the same had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.  It must be stressed that although this Court may overturn a conviction of the lower court based on reasonable doubt, overturning judgments in civil cases should be based on preponderance of evidence, and with the further qualification that, when the scales shall stand upon an equipoise, the court should find for the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Respondents also point out that Ariston, Jr., the person they claim to have prepared said Deeds of Donation, was never confronted during the trial with all these alleged irregularities on the face of the Deeds of Donation. As such, the trial court was never given a chance to determine whether Ariston, Jr. would have given a rational, logical and acceptable explanation for the same.<br><br>Respondents are correct.  As the alleged irregularities do not, on their faces, indicate bad faith on the part of respondents, it is necessary for petitioner to confront respondents with these observations.  Respondents would not have thought that the Deeds of Donation would be impugned on the mere basis that they were written on short bond paper, or that their margins are small.  Respondents were thus deprived of a chance to rebut these observations by testimonies and other evidence, and were forced to explain the same in memoranda and briefs with the appellate courts, where these observations started to crop up.  It would have been different if the date of the documents had been after Consuelo's death, or if there had been obvious alterations on the documents.  In the latter cases, it would have been the responsibility of respondents' counsel to see to it that Ariston, Jr. explain such inconsistencies.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Payment of donor's tax before the<br>death of Consuelo</span><br><br>In ruling that there had been no antedating or falsification of the subject Deeds of Donation, the Court of Appeals was also persuaded by the following evidence: (1) the finding that it was the deceased CONSUELO herself who paid the donor's tax of the properties subject of the donation, as evidenced by the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank (PCIB) check she issued to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on 9 October 1979, in the amount of P119,283.63, and (2) the testimony and certification dated 22 November 1979 of Jose Sebastian that the said documents were acknowledged before him on 21 April 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  Respondents had presented evidence to the effect that Consuelo made an initial payment of P119,283.63 for the Donor's Tax on 9 October 1979, while respondent Ariston, Sr., supplied the deficiency of P2,125.82 on 4 December 1979.<br><br>Petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals seriously erred in its finding of fact that Consuelo herself paid the donor's tax of the properties subject of the donation on 9 October 1979, as the evidence allegedly shows that the Donor's Tax was paid on 4 December 1979, or a month after Consuelo's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  Petitioner thereby calls our attention to his Exhibit "O," a certificate dated 4 December 1979 issued by Mr. Nestor M.

SEBASTIAN<br>Notary Public<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></div></blockquote>Petitioner points out that the Certification was made after the death of Consuelo, and claims that the same appears to be a scheme by Jose Sebastian to concoct an opportunity for him to make mention of the subject Deeds of Donation <span style="font-style: italic;">intervivos</span>, "despite the plain fact that the latter had utterly no relation to the matter referred to by Jose Sebastian in the opening phrase of the letter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>It is well to note that, as stated by the Court of Appeals, Jose Sebastian was originally a witness for petitioner Augusto.  As such, Rule 132, Section 12, of the Rules of Court prohibits petitioner from impeaching him:<br><blockquote>SEC. 12.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Party may not impeach his own witness. -</span> Except with respect to witnesses referred to in paragraphs (d) and (e) of section 10, the party producing a witness is not allowed to impeach his credibility.<br><br>A witness may be considered as unwilling or hostile only if so declared by the court upon adequate showing of his adverse interest, unjustified reluctance to testify, or his having misled the party into calling him to the witness stand.<br><br>The unwilling or hostile witness so declared, or the witness who is an adverse party, may be impeached by the party presenting him in all respects as if he had been called by the adverse party, except by evidence of his bad character.  He may also be impeached and cross-examined by the adverse party, but such cross-examination must only be on the subject matter of his examination-in-chief.</blockquote>This rule is based on the theory that a person who produces a witness vouches for him as being worthy of credit, and that a direct attack upon the veracity of the witness "would enable the party to destroy the witness, if he spoke against him, and to make him a good witness, if he spoke for him, with the means in his hands of destroying his credit, if he spoke against him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Neither had there been declaration by the court that Jose Sebastian was an unwilling or hostile witness.  Jose Sebastian is also neither an adverse party, nor an officer, director nor a managing agent of a public or private corporation or of a partnership or association which is an adverse party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Be that as it may, even if Jose Sebastian had been declared by the court as an unwilling or hostile witness, the third paragraph of Section 12 as quoted above, in relation to Section 11<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the same Rule, only allows the party calling the witness to impeach such witness by contradictory evidence or by prior inconsistent statements, and <span style="font-style: italic;">never by evidence of his bad character</span>.  Thus, Jose Sebastian's subsequent dismissal as a judge would not suffice to discredit him as a witness in this case.<br><br>We have also ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Dominguez</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> which, in turn cited <span style="font-style: italic;">Cordial v. People</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>(E)ven convicted criminals are not excluded from testifying in court so long as, having organs of sense, they "can perceive and perceiving can make known their perceptions to others."<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact of prior criminal conviction alone does not suffice to discredit a witness; the testimony of such a witness must be assayed and scrutinized in exactly the same way the testimony of other witnesses must be examined for its relevance and credibility.</span>  x x x.  (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>The effect of this pronouncement is even more significant in this case, as Jose Sebastian<span style="font-style: italic;"> has never been <span style="text-decoration: underline;">convicted</span> of a crime <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> his testimony</span>, but was <span style="font-style: italic;">instead <span style="text-decoration: underline;">administratively sanctioned</span> eleven years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> such testimony</span>.  Scrutinizing the testimony of Jose Sebastian, we find, as the trial court and the Court of Appeals did, no evidence of bias on the part of Jose Sebastian.  On top of this, Jose Sebastian's testimony is supported by the records of the notarial registry, which shows that the documents in question were received by the Notarial Registrar on 2 July 1979, which was four months before the death of Consuelo on 6 November 1979.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Alleged unusual circumstances<br>relative to the execution and<br>notarization of the subject Deeds of<br>Donation</span><br><br>The last set of circumstantial evidence presented by petitioner to prove the alleged intercalation of the subject Deeds of Donation on two blank papers signed by Consuelo are the following allegedly unusual circumstances relative to the execution and notarization of the said deeds.  According to petitioner:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The signing and acknowledgement of the Deeds of Donation on 21 April 1979 is highly improbable and implausible, considering the fact that Consuelo left the same day for the United States on a pleasure trip;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]<br><br></sup></li><li>The flight time of Consuelo on 21 April 1979 was 11:00 a.m..  And even assuming that the flight time was 1:00 p.m., as contended by respondents, the ordinary boarding procedures require Consuelo to be at the airport at least two hours before flight time, or 11:00 a.m..  Petitioner points out that respondents' alleged time frame (from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.) is not enough to accomplish the following acts: respondents and Consuelo leaving Marikina at 7:00 a.m. and arriving at the notary public Jose Sebastian's house at Pag-asa, Q.C. at about 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.; some "small talk with Jose Sebastian; Jose Sebastian examining the documents; Jose Sebastian having a closed meeting with Consuelo to discuss the documents; Jose Sebastian reading the documents to respondents line by line and asking the latter whether they accepted the donation; Jose Sebastian typing the notarial entries; the parties signing the deeds; Jose Sebastian talking privately with Consuelo, who paid the former in cash for his services; Ariston Gomez, Jr. driving Consuelo and other respondents back to Marikina, and dropping the other respondents at their respective residences; picking up Consuelo's luggage; and Ariston Gomez, Jr. bringing Consuelo to the Manila International Airport;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]<br><br></sup></li><li>It is contrary to human experience for Consuelo and respondents not to make a prior arrangement with the notary public Jose Sebastian and instead take a gamble on his being in his office;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]<br><br></sup></li><li>It is illogical for Consuelo to rush the execution of the donations when she was in fact planning to come back from her pleasure trip shortly, as she did;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]<br><br></sup></li><li>The choice of a notary public from Quezon City is highly suspect, when Consuelo and respondents reside in Marikina.  It is also illogical that Consuelo would have chosen a notary public whom she met only on the same day she executed the  Deeds, especially when Consuelo had a regular lawyer whose notarial services she availed of only two weeks before her death;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]<br><br></sup></li><li>It is improbable that Consuelo paid Jose Sebastian in cash, for there is no reason for her to carry much cash in peso when she was about to leave for the United States in that same morning;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]<br><br></sup></li><li>Maria Rita's residence certificate was obtained from Manila when she is a resident of Marikina.  Also, Maria Rita obtained said residence certificate on 20 April 1979, and yet Maria Rita testified that she was surprised to know of the donation only on 21 April 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>  Also suspicious are the circumstances wherein Ariston Gomez, Jr. obtained a residence certificate on 17 April 1979, when he testified that he knew of the schedule for signing only on 20 April 1979, and Consuelo had two residence certificates, as she used different ones in the Deeds of Donation and the document notarized two weeks before her death;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]<br><br></sup></li><li>If Consuelo was really frugal, she could have also made a will;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]<br><br></sup></li><li>All the instrumental witnesses of the Deeds of Donation are biased, being themselves either donees of the other Deed of Donation, or a relative of a donee;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and<br><br></li><li>Respondents were not able to sufficiently and substantially explain the belated transfer of the properties covered by the assailed Deeds of Donation. Petitioner points to Maria Rita's testimony that the real properties were transferred after the death of Consuelo.  While respondents assert that the personal properties were transferred to them prior to Consuelo's death, evidence shows otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>This Court does not find anything suspicious in a person wanting to transfer her properties by donation to her loved ones before leaving for abroad via an airplane.  While many believe these days that taking the plane is the "safest way to travel," this has not always been the case.  The fear that planes sometimes crash, now believed to be irrational, has always been at the back of the minds of air travelers.  Respondents maintain in their testimonies before the RTC that the Deeds were completed to the satisfaction of Consuelo only on 20 April 1979.  She allegedly wanted to have the documents signed and notarized before she left for abroad.<br><br>The claim that the flight time of Consuelo was at 11:00 a.m. is hearsay thrice removed, and thus cannot be given any weight.  Petitioner claims that he was told by his twelve-year old son that Consuelo was leaving at 11:00 a.m. on 21 April 1979, such son having learned about this from the maid of Consuelo when the son called Consuelo's house that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>  This is in contrast to Maria Rita's positive testimony that the flight time was at 1:00 p.m. on the same day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>  Maria Rita joined Consuelo in this flight.<br><br>As regards petitioner's claim that respondents' alleged time frame in the morning of 21 April 1979 was insufficient, this Court is not convinced.  As held by the Court of Appeals, petitioner did not present any proof that it had been impossible to perform those alleged acts within three hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>  As argued by respondents, the one-paged documents can be read aloud without difficulty within five to ten minutes each.  We can also take judicial notice of the fact that traffic is usually very minimal on Saturday mornings, and was much less of a problem in 1979.<br><br>Respondents and Consuelo's decision not to make a prior arrangement with notary public Jose Sebastian does not surprise us either.  Respondents explain that, since the telephone lines of Marikina were inefficient in the year 1979, they decided to take a calculated gamble.  It is not at all unreasonable to expect that Jose Sebastian would be at his house on a Saturday, at around 8:00 a.m.<br><br>With respect to the choice of a notary public from Quezon City, we find the explanation relative thereto satisfying.  We quote:<br><blockquote>Moreover, ARISTON, JR. disclosed that they could not have gone to the notary public whom his aunt, CONSUELO, knew because she did not want to go to said notary public since our cousins whom she didn't like had access to him and she wanted to keep the execution of the deeds confidential.  Thus:<br><blockquote>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also you know for a fact that your auntie had a regular Notary Public for the preparation and notarization of legal documents in the name of Atty. Angeles, now Congressman Angeles of Marikina, is that correct?<br><br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It depends on the frame of time. Yes and No. He was a regular Notary Public, but way before that date.

Thus, the testimony of MA. RITA revealed, insofar as the real properties are concerned, the following:<br><blockquote>"Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Since you were already aware as you claim that as early as when you went to the States in the company of your auntie, Consuelo Gomez, these 2 parcels of land together with the improvements consisting of a house were transferred to you, you did not exert efforts after your arrival from the States to effect the transfer of these properties?<br><br>"A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       No, I did not.<br><br>"Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Why?<br><br>"A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Well, for delicadeza. My auntie was still alive.  I am not that aggressive.  Tita Elo told me "akin na iyon" but I did not transfer it in my name. <span style="font-style: italic;">"Siempre nakakahiya."</span><br><br>"Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       That was your reason for not effecting the transfer of the properties in your name?<br><br>"A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Yes, that was my reason.<br><br>"Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Did you not know that the deed supposedly executed by Consuelo Gomez was a donation inter vivos, meaning, it takes effect during her lifetime?<br><br>"A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       I do not know the legal term donation inter vivos.  I have also my sentiment.  Tita Elo was very close to us but I did not want to tell her: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Tita Elo, ibigay mo Na iyan SA akin.  Itransfer mo na sa pangalan ko."</span>  It is not my character to be very aggressive.ï¿½<br><br>In addition, Article 712 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br>"ART. 712.  Ownership is acquired by occupation and by intellectual creation.<br><br>"Ownership and other real rights over property are acquired and transmitted by law, by donation, by testate and intestate succession, and in consequence of certain contracts, by tradition.<br><br>"They may also be acquired by means of prescription."</blockquote>Clearly, the issuance of the titles in the names of the defendants is not the mode by which they acquired ownership of the properties, but rather the fact that the same were donated to them.  The circumstance that aforesaid properties were actually transferred in the names of the donees only after the death of the donor, although the deeds of donation were dated April 21, 1979, does not by itself indicate that the said documents were antedated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner seems to unduly foreclose the possibility - one which experience tells us is not a rare occurrence at all - that donations are often resorted to in place of testamentary dispositions, often for the purpose of tax avoidance.  Such properties usually remain in the donor's possession during his or her lifetime, despite the fact that the donations have already taken effect.  Nevertheless, the purpose of utilizing donation as a mode to transfer property is not in issue here.<br><br>Finally, the allegations concerning the payment of Jose Sebastian in cash, the suggestion that Consuelo should have also made a will, and the claim that all the instrumental witnesses of the will are biased, are purely speculative.<br><br>In sum, all these circumstantial evidence presented by petitioner had failed to comply with the strict requirements in using circumstantial evidence, for which Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient. -</span> Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:<br><br>(a)        There is more than one circumstance;<br><br>(b)        The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and<br><br>(c)        The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>While the above provision seems to refer only to criminal cases, it has been pointed out that in some jurisdictions, no distinction is made between civil and criminal actions as to the quality of the burden of establishing a proposition by circumstantial evidence.  In such jurisdictions the rule is generally stated to be that the circumstances established must not only be consistent with the proposition asserted but also inconsistent with any other rational theory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>In all, what petitioner has succeeded in doing is to raise doubts in our minds.  Again, while such approach would succeed if carried out by the accused in criminal cases, plaintiffs in civil cases need to do much more to overturn findings of fact and credibility by the trial court, especially when the same had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Leniency in the weighing of petitioner's evidence could only produce a mere equipoise:<br><blockquote>When the scales shall stand upon an equipoise and there is nothing in the evidence which shall incline it to one side or the other, the court will find for the defendant.<br><br>Under this principle, the plaintiff must rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weaknesses of the defendant's claim.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Even if the evidence of the plaintiff may be stronger than that of the defendant, there is no preponderance of evidence on his side if such evidence is insufficient in itself to establish his cause of action."</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Petitioner's liability for damages</span><br><br>The last part of the trial court's decision, which was affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> by the Court of Appeals, involves the award of damages in favor of Ariston, Jr.  The trial court held Augusto Gomez and the estate of the late Consuelo "jointly and solidarily liable" for moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<br><br>The trial court held:<br><blockquote>The records are clear, that plaintiff was so desperate for evidence to support his charges, that he repeatedly subpoenaed the defendants themselves; at the risk of presenting evidence contradictory to his legal position and which actually happened, when plaintiff subpoenaed Ariston Gomez Jr., Ariston Gomez Sr., and Maria Rita Gomez-Samson, as his witnesses.<br><br>All told, the court finds plaintiff was motivated not by a sincere desire to insure the totality of the estate of Consuelo, but rather by his desire to cause injury to defendants, and to appropriate for himself and the rest of the Gomez brothers and nephews, other than the donees, properties which were clearly validly disposed of by Consuelo, via Donations Inter Vivos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></blockquote>Our own examination of the records of the case, however, convinces us of the contrary.  Respondents never assailed the authenticity of petitioner's evidence, and merely presented their own evidence to support their assertions.  As previously stated, petitioner's evidence had successfully given us doubts as to the authenticity of the subject Deeds of Donation.  While such doubts are not enough to discharge petitioner's burden of proof, they are enough to convince us that petitioner's institution of the present case was carried out with good faith.  The subpoenas directed against respondents merely demonstrate the zealous efforts of petitioner's counsel to represent its client, which can neither be taken against the counsel, nor against its clients.<br><br>While, as regards the alleged intercalation of the Deeds of Donation on two blank sheets of paper signed by Consuelo, the burden of proof lies with petitioner, the opposite is true as regards the damages suffered by the respondents.  Having failed to discharge this burden to prove bad faith on the part of petitioner in instituting the case, petitioner cannot be responsible therefor, and thus cannot be held liable for moral damages.<br><br>This Court has also held that, in the absence of moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages, no exemplary damages can be granted, for exemplary damages are allowed only in addition to any of the four kinds of damages mentioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>The attorney's fees should also be deleted, as it was supposed to be the consequence of a clearly unfounded civil action or proceeding by the plaintiff.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> subject to the modification of the assailed Decision, the Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
