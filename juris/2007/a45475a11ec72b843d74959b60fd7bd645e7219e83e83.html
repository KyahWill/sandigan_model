				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This resolves respondents’ (1) motion for reconsideration of the Court’s October 30, 2006 Decision, praying that the dismissal of petitioner be declared legal, or in the alternative, that petitioner be awarded separation pay instead of reinstatement; and (2) motion for clarification on the computation of backwages in relation to the propriety of his payroll reinstatement instead of actual reinstatement pending appeal from the Labor Arbiter’s decision.<br><br>Anent the issue of illegal dismissal, respondents merely reiterate the thrust of their Comment and after giving our <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> a second look, we find no sufficient basis to reconsider our findings that petitioner was illegally dismissed.<br><br>As regards the award of reinstatement, the Court finds that it would be best to award separation pay instead of reinstatement, in view of the strained relations between petitioner and respondents.&nbsp; In fact, while petitioner prayed for reinstatement, he also admitted that there is a “strained relationship now prevailing between [him and respondents.]”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under the doctrine of strained relations, the payment of separation pay has been considered an acceptable alternative to reinstatement when the latter option is no longer desirable or viable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In view of the illegal dismissal of petitioner, he is entitled to separation pay in lieu of reinstatement for the reason above stated, computed from the date of petitioner’s employment until finality of our decision;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and backwages to be computed from the date he was constructively dismissed, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, July 17, 2002, up to the finality of this decision, less the amounts paid in accordance with his payroll reinstatement.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the discretion to choose the mode of reinstatement lies with the employer, the exercise thereof by respondents in the instant case was, as correctly held by the Labor Arbiter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; a mockery of the true import of actual reinstatement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> considering that petitioner was reinstated as a Reserved Franchise Manager<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and was made to perform demeaning jobs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; This finding of fact by the Labor Arbiter as affirmed by the National Labor Relations Commission is entitled to great weight and respect and is therefore adopted by this Court.&nbsp; Moreover, payroll reinstatement is proper in this case because the physical presence of petitioner in the office might have worsened the already strained relations between him and respondents, particularly, his immediate superior respondent De Jesus, to whom he will directly report every day, as a Manager Reserve.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the motion for reconsideration is <span style="font-weight: bold;">PARTIALLY GRANTED</span>.&nbsp; The May 27, 2003 Decision of the Labor Arbiter finding that petitioner was constructively dismissed, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">REINSTATED</span> with the following <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODIFICATIONS</span>: (a) Respondents Caesar B.
