The court, thus, affirmed the award made by the trial court of actual, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees, in favor of the respondent.<br><br>After the petitioner filed its Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to the Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the respondent, a Joint Motion to Render Judgment Based on Compromise Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was filed with this Court by both parties.

The petition is    currently pending;<br><br>WHEREAS, to maintain goodwill, promote better understanding, and avoid a protracted, tedious and expensive litigation, petitioner Shell and respondent Licup (collectively referred to as "the parties") have agreed to completely settle and waive any and all of their respective claims, counterclaims and charges against each other;<br><br>NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, and the receipt, release and quitclaim hereinafter set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:<br><ol type="1"><li>Respondent Licup, his heirs, assigns, successors-in-interest, agents, and representatives confirm and acknowledge the receipt from petitioner Shell, of the gross sum of Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php7,500,000.00), Philippine Currency, as evidenced by Managers' Check No. 24405 dated 14 August 2006, and payable to the order of respondent Licup, which represents the full, complete, absolute and final amicable settlement of any and all claims the respondent Licup may have against petitioner Shell, its directors, officers, employees, agents, successors-in-interest, affiliates, and/or clients, in connection with or by reason of  respondent  Licup's contracts  and  transactions  with  petitioner<br><br>Shell, as pleaded in the Complaint in Civil Case No. 95-413, Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 61.<br><br></li><li>All signage, pumps and other materials    bearing Shell trademarks and tradenames, shall be recalled and/or removed by petitioner Shell, with at least three (3) days prior written notice to Licup, separate herefrom, at Shell's exclusive expense within thirty (30) days from the payment herein indicated.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">2.1.

Any removal or recall effected by Shell pursuant hereto on the station subject of the RTC case shall be accomplished in a manner that will minimize any disruptions to the operations or business conducted at the said station, but the parties foresee that the station's closure of three (3) days shall be required to effect any necessary removal/recall; <span style="font-style: italic;">provided however</span>, that (i) Shell shall not be liable for any disruption caused by any delay by Licup in the procurement or installation of any replacement (e.g,. pumps, signage) of the equipment removed and recalled by Shell; and (ii) if no circumstances or events beyond its control occur, Shell shall complete the removal and recall within ten (10) working days from commencement thereof.

He binds himself, absolutely and irrevocably, to withdraw and not to pursue any claim, cause or causes or right of action, against petitioner Shell, arising thereunder or in connection therewith, and further declares such claim, demand, cause or causes of action, to be wholly and forever satisfied and extinguished.  For its part, Shell hereby waives, condones or otherwise releases Licup from any and all claims pleaded in the Answer or other pleading filed on Shell's behalf in Civil Case No. 95-413.<br><br></li><li>The parties also agree that this settlement includes the satisfaction of all awards contained in the dispositive portion of the 11 December 2000 decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. 95-413, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 69954.  Respondent Licup expressly agrees and commits that, by virtue of the settlement amount herein provided and the other terms of the Agreement, the RTC's 11 December 2000 decision is now hereby fully and finally satisfied and extinguished.<br><br></li><li>The parties give their full consent to the forfeiture of any and all awards which may be granted in their favor in relation to the instant case.<br><br></li><li>Petitioner Shell will immediately file the necessary pleading in the Supreme Court to effect the withdrawal of the petition it has filed therewith.<br><br></li><li>The parties agree to keep the terms and conditions of this Compromise Agreement confidential, and not to communicate its details to members of the press or to parties or entities in the petroleum industry, except when such publicity becomes necessary to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement.<br><br></li><li>The parties make these commitments with the full understanding that the aforementioned consideration by way of amicable settlement is in no way an admission of fault or liability on the part of petitioner Shell, and/or its directors, officers, employees, successors-in-interest, affiliates, and/or clients, for any wrongful acts.
