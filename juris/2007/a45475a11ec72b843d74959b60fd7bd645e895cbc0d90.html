				<BR><BR>&nbsp;Before us is a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 76563.&nbsp; The CA decision reversed the Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC NCR CA No. 029319-01, which, in turn, affirmed the Decision of the Labor Arbiter in NLRC NCR Case No. 30-12-04787-00 dismissing the complaint of respondent Klaus K. Schonfeld.<br><div align="justify"><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>Respondent is a Canadian citizen and was a resident of New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.&nbsp; He had been a consultant in the field of environmental engineering and water supply and sanitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pacicon Philippines, Inc.

The president of PPI, Jens Peter Henrichsen, who was also the director of PCIJ, was based in Tokyo, Japan.&nbsp; Henrichsen commuted from Japan to Manila and vice versa, as well as in other countries where PCIJ had business.<br><br>In 1997, PCIJ decided to engage in consultancy services for water and sanitation in the Philippines.&nbsp; In October 1997, respondent was employed by PCIJ, through Henrichsen, as Sector Manager of PPI in its Water and Sanitation Department.&nbsp; However, PCIJ assigned him as PPI sector manager in the Philippines.&nbsp; His salary was to be paid partly by PPI and PCIJ.<br><br>On January 7, 1998, Henrichsen transmitted a letter of employment to respondent in Canada, requesting him to accept the same and affix his conformity thereto. Respondent made some revisions in the letter of employment and signed the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; He then sent a copy to Henrichsen.&nbsp; The letter of employment reads:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Mr. Klaus K.

It was docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 30-12-04787-00.<br><br>In his Complaint, respondent alleged that he was illegally dismissed; PPI had not notified the DOLE of its decision to close one of its departments, which resulted in his dismissal; and they failed to notify him that his employment was terminated after August 4, 1999.&nbsp; Respondent also claimed for separation pay and other unpaid benefits.&nbsp; He alleged that the company acted in bad faith and disregarded his rights. &nbsp;He prayed for the following reliefs:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Judgment be rendered in his favor ordering the respondents to reinstate complainant to his former position without loss of seniority and other privileges and benefits, and to pay his full backwages from the time compensation was with held (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.

Petitioners claimed that respondent did not offer any justification for filing his complaint against PPI before the NLRC in the Philippines. Moreover, under Section 12 of the General Conditions of Employment appended to the letter of employment dated January 7, 1998, complainant and PCIJ had agreed that any employment-related dispute should be brought before the London Court of Arbitration.&nbsp; Since even the Supreme Court had already ruled that such an agreement on venue is valid, Philippine courts have no jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Respondent opposed the Motion, contending that he was employed by PPI to work in the Philippines under contract separate from his January 7, 1998 contract of employment with PCIJ.&nbsp; He insisted that his employer was PPI, a Philippine-registered corporation; it is inconsequential that PPI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCIJ because the two corporations have separate and distinct personalities; and he received orders and instructions from Henrichsen who was the president of PPI.&nbsp; He further insisted that the principles of <span style="font-style: italic;">forum non conveniens</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">lex loci contractus</span> do not apply, and that although he is a Canadian citizen, Philippine Labor Laws apply in this case.<br><br>Respondent adduced in evidence the following contract of employment dated January 9, 1998 which he had entered into with Henrichsen:<br><blockquote>Mr. Klaus K.

The instant complaint filed by the complainant is dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></div><br>The Labor Arbiter found, among others, that the January 7, 1998 contract of employment between respondent and PCIJ was controlling; the Philippines was only the “duty station” where Schonfeld was required to work under the General Conditions of Employment. &nbsp;PCIJ remained respondent’s employer despite his having been sent to the Philippines.&nbsp; Since the parties had agreed that any differences regarding employer-employee relationship should be submitted to the jurisdiction of the court of arbitration in London, this agreement is controlling.<br><br>On appeal, the NLRC agreed with the disquisitions of the Labor Arbiter and affirmed the latter’s decision <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Respondent then filed a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 65 with the CA where he raised the following arguments:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE LABOR ARBITER’S DECISION CONSIDERING THAT:<br><blockquote>A. PETITIONER’S TRUE EMPLOYER IS NOT PACIFIC CONSULTANTS INTERNATIONAL OF JAPAN BUT RESPONDENT COMPANY, AND THEREFORE, THE LABOR ARBITER HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE INSTANT CASE; AND<br><br>B. THE PROPER VENUE FOR THE PRESENT COMPLAINT IS THE ARBITRATION BRANCH OF THE NLRC AND NOT THE COURT OF ARBITRATION IN LONDON.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL OF THE COMPLAINT CONSIDERING THAT PETITIONER’S TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT IS ILLEGAL:<br><br></blockquote>A. THE CLOSURE OF RESPONDENT COMPANY’S WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR WAS NOT <span style="font-style: italic;">BONA FIDE</span>.<br><br>B. ASSUMING <span style="font-style: italic;">ARGUENDO</span> THAT THE CLOSURE OF RESPONDENT COMPANY’S WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR WAS JUSTIFIABLE, PETITIONER’S DISMISSAL WAS INEFFECTUAL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT (DOLE) AND PETITIONER WAS NOT NOTIFIED THIRTY (30) DAYS BEFORE THE ALLEGED CLOSURE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Respondent averred that the absence or existence of a written contract of employment is not decisive of whether he is an employee of PPI.&nbsp; He maintained that PPI, through its president Henrichsen, directed his work/duties as Sector Manager of PPI; proof of this was his letter-proposal to the Development Bank of the Philippines for PPI to provide consultancy services for the Construction Supervision of the Water Supply and Sanitation component of the World Bank-Assisted LGU Urban Water and Sanitation Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He emphasized that as gleaned from Alien Employment Permit (AEP) No. M-029908-5017 issued to him by DOLE on February 26, 1999, he is an employee of PPI. It was PPI president Henrichsen who terminated his employment; PPI also paid his salary and reimbursed his expenses related to transactions abroad. That PPI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCIJ is of no moment because the two corporations have separate and distinct personalities.<br><br>The CA found the petition meritorious. &nbsp;Applying the four-fold test<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of determining an employer-employee relationship, the CA declared that respondent was an employee of PPI. &nbsp;On the issue of venue, the appellate court declared that, even under the January 7, 1998 contract of employment, the parties were not precluded from bringing a case related thereto in other venues. While there was, indeed, an agreement that issues between the parties were to be resolved in the London Court of Arbitration, the venue is not exclusive, since there is no stipulation that the complaint cannot be filed in any other forum other than in the Philippines.<br><br>On November 25, 2004, the CA rendered its decision granting the petition, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED in that the assailed Resolutions of the NLRC are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

They contend that it was the PCIJ which employed respondent as an employee; it merely seconded him to petitioner PPI in the Philippines, and assigned him to work in Manila as Sector Manager.&nbsp; Petitioner PPI, being a wholly-owned subsidiary of PCIJ, was never the employer of respondent.<br><br>Petitioners assert that the January 9, 1998 letter of employment which respondent presented to prove his employment with petitioner PPI is of doubtful authenticity since it was unsigned by the purported parties.&nbsp; They insist that PCIJ paid respondent’s salaries and only coursed the same through petitioner PPI.&nbsp; PPI, being its subsidiary, had supervision and control over respondent’s work, and had the responsibilities of monitoring the “daily administration” of respondent. &nbsp;Respondent cannot rely on the pay slips, expenses claim forms, and reimbursement memoranda to prove that he was an employee of petitioner PPI because these documents are of doubtful authenticity.<br><br>Petitioners further contend that, although Henrichsen was both a director of PCIJ and president of PPI, it was he who signed the termination letter of respondent upon instructions of PCIJ. &nbsp;This is buttressed by the fact that PCIJ’s letterhead was used to inform him that his employment was terminated. &nbsp;Petitioners further assert that all work instructions came from PCIJ and that petitioner PPI only served as a “conduit.”&nbsp; Respondent’s Alien Employment Permit stating that petitioner PPI was his employer is but a necessary consequence of his being “seconded” thereto.&nbsp; It is not sufficient proof that petitioner PPI is respondent’s employer. The entry was only made to comply with the DOLE requirements.<br><br>There being no evidence that petitioner PPI is the employer of respondent, the Labor Arbiter has no jurisdiction over respondent’s complaint.<br><br>Petitioners aver that since respondent is a Canadian citizen, the CA erred in ignoring their claim that the principlesof <span style="font-style: italic;">forum non conveniens</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">lex loci contractus </span>are applicable.&nbsp; They also point out that the principal office, officers and staff of PCIJ are stationed in Tokyo, Japan; and the contract of employment of respondent was executed in Tokyo, Japan.<br><br>Moreover, under Section 21 of the General Conditions for Employment incorporated in respondent’s January 7, 1998 letter of employment, the dispute between respondent and PCIJ should be settled by the court of arbitration of London.&nbsp; Petitioners claim that the words used therein are sufficient to show the exclusive and restrictive nature of the stipulation on venue.<br><br>Petitioners insist that the U.S. Labor-Management Act applies only to U.S. workers and employers, while the Labor Code of the Philippines applies only to Filipino employers and Philippine-based employers and their employees, not to PCIJ. &nbsp;In fine, the jurisdictions of the NLRC and Labor Arbiter do not extend to foreign workers who executed employment agreements with foreign employers abroad, although “seconded” to the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]<br><br></sup>In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> respondent maintains that petitioners raised factual issues in their petition which are proscribed under Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The finding of the CA that he had been an employee of petitioner PPI and not of PCIJ is buttressed by his documentary evidence which both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC ignored; they erroneously opted to dismiss his complaint on the basis of the letter of employment and Section 21 of the General Conditions of Employment.&nbsp; In contrast, the CA took into account the evidence on record and applied case law correctly.<br><br>The petition is denied for lack of merit.<br><br>It must be stressed that in resolving a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, the CA is not proscribed from reviewing the evidence on record.&nbsp; Under Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended by R.A. No. 7902, the CA is empowered to pass upon the evidence, if and when necessary, to resolve factual issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> &nbsp;If it appears that the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC misappreciated the evidence to such an extent as to compel a contrary conclusion if such evidence had been properly appreciated, the factual findings of such tribunals cannot be given great respect and finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Inexplicably, the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC ignored the documentary evidence which respondent appended to his pleadings showing that he was an employee of petitioner PPI; they merely focused on the January 7, 1998 letter of employment and Section 21 of the General Conditions of Employment.<br><br>Petitioner PPI applied for the issuance of an AEP to respondent before the DOLE.&nbsp; In said application, PPI averred that respondent is its employee.&nbsp; To show that this was the case, PPI appended a copy of respondent’s employment contract.&nbsp; The DOLE then granted the application of PPI and issued the permit.<br><br>It bears stressing that under the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, one of the requirements for the issuance of an employment permit is the employment contract. Section 5, Rule XIV (Employment of Aliens) of the Omnibus Rules provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coverage</span>. – This rule shall apply to all aliens employed or seeking employment in the Philippines and the present or prospective employers.<br><br>SECTION 2.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Submission of list</span>. – All employers employing foreign nationals, whether resident or non-resident, shall submit a list of nationals to the Bureau indicating their names, citizenship, foreign and local address, nature of employment and status of stay in the Philippines.<br><br>SECTION 3. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Registration of resident aliens</span>. – All employed resident aliens shall register with the Bureau under such guidelines as may be issued by it.<br><br>SECTION 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Employment permit required for entry</span>. – No alien seeking employment, whether as a resident or non-resident, may enter the Philippines without first securing an employment permit from the Ministry.&nbsp; If an alien enters the country under a non-working visa and wishes to be employed thereafter, he may only be allowed to be employed upon presentation of a duly approved employment permit.<br><br>SECTION 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Requirements for employment permit applicants</span>. – The application for an employment permit shall be accompanied by the following:<br><blockquote>(a) Curriculum vitae duly signed by the applicant indicating his educational background, his work experience and other data showing that he possesses technical skills in his trade or profession.<br><br>(b) Contract of employment between the employer and the principal which shall embody the following, among others:<br><br>1. That the non-resident alien worker shall comply with all applicable laws and rules and regulations of the Philippines;<br><br>2. That the non-resident alien worker and the employer shall bind themselves to train at least two (2) Filipino understudies for a period to be determined by the Minister; and<br><br>3. That he shall not engage in any gainful employment other than that for which he was issued a permit.<br><br>(c) A designation by the employer of at least two (2) understudies for every alien worker.&nbsp; Such understudies must be the most ranking regular employees in the section or department for which the expatriates are being hired to insure the actual transfer of technology.<br></blockquote></blockquote>Under Section 6 of the Rule, the DOLE may issue an alien employment permit based only on the following:<br><blockquote>(a) Compliance by the applicant and his employer with the requirements of Section 2 hereof;<br><br>(b) Report of the Bureau Director as to the availability or non-availability of any person in the Philippines who is competent and willing to do the job for which the services of the applicant are desired;<br><br>(c) His assessment as to whether or not the employment of the applicant will redound to the national interest;<br><br>(d) Admissibility of the alien as certified by the Commission on Immigration and Deportation;<br><br>(e) The recommendation of the Board of Investments or other appropriate government agencies if the applicant will be employed in preferred areas of investments or in accordance with the imperative of economic development.<br></blockquote>Thus, as claimed by respondent, he <span style="font-style: italic;">had</span> an employment contract with petitioner PPI; otherwise, petitioner PPI would not have filed an application for a Permit with the DOLE.&nbsp; Petitioners are thus estopped from alleging that the PCIJ, not petitioner PPI, had been the employer of respondent all along.<br><br>We agree with the conclusion of the CA that there was an employer-employee relationship between petitioner PPI and respondent using the four-fold test. &nbsp;Jurisprudence is firmly settled that whenever the existence of an employment relationship is in dispute, four elements constitute the reliable yardstick: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the employer’s power to control the employee’s conduct. &nbsp;It is the so-called “control test” which constitutes the most important index of the existence of the employer-employee relationship–that is, whether the employer controls or has reserved the right to control the employee not only as to the result of the work to be done but also as to the means and methods by which the same is to be accomplished. &nbsp;Stated otherwise, an employer-employee relationship exists where the person for whom the services are performed reserves the right to control not only the end to be achieved but also the means to be used in reaching such end.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> &nbsp;We quote with approval the following ruling of the CA:<br><blockquote>[T]here is, indeed, substantial evidence on record which would erase any doubt that the respondent company is the true employer of petitioner. &nbsp;In the case at bar, the power to control and supervise petitioner’s work performance devolved upon the respondent company. &nbsp;Likewise, the power to terminate the employment relationship was exercised by the President of the respondent company. &nbsp;It is not the letterhead used by the company in the termination letter which controls, but the person who exercised the power to terminate the employee. &nbsp;It is also inconsequential if the second letter of employment executed in the Philippines was not signed by the petitioner. &nbsp;An employer-employee relationship may indeed exist even in the absence of a written contract, so long as the four elements mentioned in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mafinco</span> case are all present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>The settled rule on stipulations regarding venue, as held by this Court in the vintage case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Banking Corporation v. Tensuan</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> is that while they are considered valid and enforceable, venue stipulations in a contract do not, as a rule, supersede the general rule set forth in Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of Court in the absence of qualifying or restrictive words. They should be considered merely as an agreement or additional forum, not as limiting venue to the specified place. &nbsp;They are not exclusive but, rather permissive. &nbsp;If the intention of the parties were to restrict venue, there must be accompanying language clearly and categorically expressing their purpose and design that actions between them be litigated only at the place named by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, no restrictive words like “<span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>,” “<span style="font-style: italic;">solely</span>,” “<span style="font-style: italic;">exclusively in this court</span>,” “<span style="font-style: italic;">in no other court save</span> —,” “<span style="font-style: italic;">particularly</span>,” “<span style="font-style: italic;">nowhere else but/except</span> —,” or words of equal import were stated in the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> &nbsp;It cannot be said that the court of arbitration in London is an exclusive venue to bring forth any complaint arising out of the employment contract.<br><br>Petitioners contend that respondent should have filed his Complaint in his place of permanent residence, or where the PCIJ holds its principal office, at the place where the contract of employment was signed, in London as stated in their contract. &nbsp;By enumerating possible venues where respondent could have filed his complaint, however, petitioners themselves admitted that the provision on venue in the employment contract is indeed merely permissive.<br><br>Petitioners’ insistence on the application of the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">forum non conveniens</span> must be rejected.&nbsp; The bare fact that respondent is a Canadian citizen and was a repatriate does not warrant the application of the principle for the following reasons:<br><br>First.&nbsp; The Labor Code of the Philippines does not include <span style="font-style: italic;">forum non conveniens</span> as a ground for the dismissal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Second.&nbsp; The propriety of dismissing a case based on this principle requires a factual determination; hence, it is properly considered as defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Third.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Bank of America, NT&amp;SA, Bank of America International, Ltd. v.
