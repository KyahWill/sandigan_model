Parayno, Jr. issued Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 31-2003 setting the "Uniform Guidelines on the Taxation of Imported Motor Vehicles through the Subic Free Port Zone and Other Freeport Zones that are Sold at Public Auction."&nbsp;

However, in cases where the consignee-auctioneer has already paid the VAT and excise tax on the motor vehicles before the registration thereof with LTO and the conduct of public auction, the additional VAT and excise tax shall be paid by winning bidder resulting from the difference between the winning bid price and the value used by the consignee-auctioneer in payment of such taxes.&nbsp; For excise tax purposes, in case the winning bid price is lower than the total costs to import, reconditioning/rehabilitation of the motor vehicles, and other administrative and selling expenses, the basis for the computation of the excise tax shall be the total costs plus ten percent (10%) thereof.&nbsp; The additional VAT and excise taxes shall be paid to the BIR before the auctioned motor vehicles are registered with the LTO.<br><br>1.5&nbsp; In case the services of a professional auctioneer is employed for the public auction, the final withholding tax of 25%, in case he/she is a non-resident citizen or alien, or the expanded withholding tax of 20%, in case he/she is a resident citizen or alien, shall be withheld by the consignee-auctioneer from the amount of consideration to be paid to the professional auctioneer and shall be remitted accordingly to the BIR.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>This was later amended by RMC No. 32-2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><ol start="2" type="I"><li>The imported motor vehicles after its release from Customs custody are sold through public auction/negotiated sale by the consignee within or outside of the Freeport Zone:<br><br> <ol type="A"> <li>The gross income earned by the consignee-seller from the public auction/negotiated sale of the imported vehicles shall be subject to the preferential tax rate of five percent (5%) in lieu of the internal revenue taxes imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, provided that the following conditions are present:<br><br> <ol> <li>That the consignee-seller is a duly registered enterprise entitled to such preferential tax rate as well as a registered taxpayer with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).<br><br></li><li>That the total income generated by the consignee-seller from sources within the customs territory does not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the total income derived from all sources. <br><br> </li></ol></li><li>In case the consignee-seller is a registered enterprise and/or locator not entitled to the preferential tax treatment or if the same is entitled from such incentive but its total income from the customs territory exceeds thirty percent (30%) of its entire income derived from the customs territory and the freeport zone, the sales or income derived from the public auction/negotiated sale shall be subjected to the regular internal revenue taxes imposed by the Tax Code. The consignee-seller shall also observe the compliance requirements prescribed by the Tax Code.&nbsp; When public auction or negotiated sale is conducted within or outside of the freeport zone, the following tax treatment shall be observed:<br><br> <ol> <li>Value Added Tax (VAT)/ Percentage Tax (PT) - VAT or PT shall be imposed on every public auction or negotiated sale.<br><br></li><li>Excise Tax - The imposition of excise tax on public auction or negotiated sale shall be held in abeyance pending verification that the importer's selling price used as a basis by the Bureau of Customs in computing the excise tax is correctly determined.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners Asia International Auctioneers, Inc.

No.] 7227" the RMCs issued by the CIR.&nbsp; They explain that they "do not challenge the rate, structure or figures of the imposed taxes, rather they challenge the authority of the respondent Commissioner to impose and collect the said taxes." They claim that the challenge on the authority of the CIR to issue the RMCs does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).<br><br>Petitioners' arguments do not sway.<br><br>R.A. No. 1125, as amended, states:<br><blockquote> Sec. 7. Jurisdiction.—The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein provided—<br><br>(1) <b>Decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments</b>, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or <b>other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other laws or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue</b>; x x x (<i>emphases supplied</i>)</blockquote>We have held that RMCs are considered administrative <i>rulings</i> which are issued from time to time by the CIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>Rodriguez v. Blaquera</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> is in point.&nbsp; This case involves Commonwealth Act No. 466, as amended by R.A. No. 84, which imposed upon firearm holders the duty to pay an initial license fee of P15 and an annual fee of P10 for each firearm, with the exception that in case of "bona fide and active members of duly organized gun clubs and accredited by the Provost Marshal General," the annual fee is reduced to P5 for each firearm. Pursuant to this, the CIR issued General Circular No. V-148 which stated that "bona fide and active members of duly organized gun clubs and accredited by the Provost Marshal General... shall pay an initial fee of fifteen pesos and an annual fee of five pesos for each firearm held on license except caliber .22 revolver or rifle."&nbsp; The General Circular further provided that "[m]ere membership in the gun club does not, as a matter of right, entitle the member to the reduced rates prescribed by law.&nbsp; The licensee must be accredited by the Chief of Constabulary... [and] the firearm covered by the license of the member must be of the target model in order that he may be entitled to the reduced rates."&nbsp; Rodriguez, as manager of the Philippine Rifle and Pistol Association, Inc., a duly accredited gun club, in behalf of the members who have paid under protest the regular annual fee of P10, filed an action in the Court of First Instance (now RTC) of Manila for the nullification of the circular and the refund of P5.&nbsp; On the issue of jurisdiction, plaintiff similarly contended that the action was not an appeal from a ruling of the CIR but merely an attempt to nullify General Circular No. V-148, hence, not within the jurisdiction of the CTA.&nbsp; The Court, in finding this argument unmeritorious, explained:<br><blockquote> We find no merit in this pretense.&nbsp; General Circular No. V-148 directs the officers charged with the collection of taxes and license fees to adhere strictly to the interpretation given by the defendant to the statutory provision above mentioned, as set forth in the circular.&nbsp; The same incorporates, therefore, a decision of the Collector of Internal Revenue (now Commissioner of Internal Revenue) on the manner of enforcement of said statute, the administration of which is entrusted by law to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.&nbsp; As such, it comes within the purview of [R.A.] No. 1125, section 7 of which provides that the [CTA] "shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal * * * decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in * * * matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue."&nbsp; Besides, it is plain from plaintiff's original complaint that one of its main purposes was to secure an order for the refund of the sums collected in excess of the amount he claims to be due by way of annual fee from the gun club members, regardless of the class of firearms they have.&nbsp; Although the prayer for reimbursement has been eliminated from his amended complaint, it is only too obvious that the nullification of General Circular No. V-148 is merely a step preparatory to a claim for refund.</blockquote>Similarly, in<b> CIR v. Leal,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><b> </b>pursuant to Section 116 of Presidential Decree No. 1158 (The National Internal Revenue Code, as amended) which states that "[d]ealers in securities shall pay a tax equivalent to six (6%) per centum of their gross income.&nbsp; Lending investors shall pay a tax equivalent to five (5%) per cent, of their gross income," the CIR issued Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 15-91 imposing 5% lending investor's tax on pawnshops based on their gross income and requiring all investigating units of the BIR to investigate and assess the lending investor's tax due from them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issuance of RMO No.&nbsp; 15-91 was an offshoot of the CIR's finding that the pawnshop business is akin to that of "lending investors" as defined in Section 157(u) of the Tax Code.&nbsp; Subsequently, the CIR issued RMC No. 43-91 subjecting pawn tickets to documentary stamp tax.&nbsp; Respondent therein, Josefina Leal, owner and operator of Josefina's Pawnshop, asked for a reconsideration of both RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91, but the same was denied by petitioner CIR.&nbsp; Leal then filed a petition for prohibition with the RTC of San Mateo, Rizal, seeking to prohibit petitioner CIR from implementing the revenue orders.&nbsp; The CIR, through the OSG, filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; The RTC denied the motion.&nbsp; Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the CA which dismissed the petition "for lack of basis."&nbsp; In reversing the CA, dissolving the Writ of Preliminary Injunction issued by the trial court and ordering the dismissal of the case before the trial court, the Supreme Court held that "[t]he questioned RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91 are actually rulings or opinions of the Commissioner implementing the Tax Code on the taxability of pawnshops."&nbsp; They were issued pursuant to the CIR's power under Section 245<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the Tax Code "to make rulings or opinions in connection with the implementation of the provisions of internal revenue laws, including ruling on the classification of articles of sales and similar purposes."&nbsp; The Court held that under R.A. No. 1125 (An Act Creating the Court of Tax Appeals), as amended, such rulings of the CIR are appealable to the CTA.<br><br>In the case at bar, the assailed revenue regulations and revenue memorandum circulars are actually rulings or opinions of the CIR on the tax treatment of motor vehicles sold at public auction within the SSEZ to implement Section 12 of R.A. No. 7227 which provides that "exportation or removal of goods from the territory of the [SSEZ]&nbsp; to the other parts of the Philippine territory shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under the Customs and Tariff Code and other relevant tax laws of the Philippines."&nbsp; They were issued pursuant to the power of the CIR under Section 4 of the National Internal Revenue Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> Section 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases.--&nbsp; <b>The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance.</b><br><br><b>The power to decide</b> disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or <b>other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals. (</b><i>emphases supplied</i>)</blockquote>Petitioners point out that the CA based its decision on Section 7 of R.A.
