The Secretary of Labor ordered that the P1,000 received by private respondents Romeo Alejo, Atong Cenon, Jr., Geofrey Mino, Dennis Epi, and Ricky Doria be deducted from their respective claims.  The Secretary of Labor ruled that, pursuant to RA 7730, the Court’s decision in the <i>Servando</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> case is no longer controlling insofar as the restrictive effect of Article 129 on the visitorial and enforcement power of the Secretary of Labor is concerned.<br><br>The Secretary of Labor also stated that there was no denial of due process because EBVSAI was accorded several opportunities to present its side but EBVSAI failed to present any evidence to controvert the findings of the Regional Director.  Moreover, the Secretary of Labor doubted the veracity and authenticity of EBVSAI’s documentary evidence.  The Secretary of Labor noted that these documents were not presented at the initial stage of the hearing and that the payroll documents did not indicate the periods covered by EBVSAI’s alleged payments.<br><br>EVBSAI filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the Secretary of Labor in his 3 January 2000 Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>EBVSAI filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></div><br>In its 29 May 2001 Decision, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition and affirmed the Secretary of Labor’s decision.  The Court of Appeals adopted the Secretary of Labor’s ruling that RA 7730 repealed the jurisdictional limitation imposed by Article 129 on Article 128 of the Labor Code.  The Court of Appeals also agreed with the Secretary of Labor’s finding that EBVSAI was accorded due process.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also denied EBVSAI’s motion for reconsideration in its 26 February 2002 Resolution.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></div><br>This case raises the following issues:<br><ol><li>Whether the Secretary of Labor or his duly authorized representatives acquired jurisdiction over EBVSAI; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the Secretary of Labor or his duly authorized representatives have jurisdiction over the money claims of private respondents which exceed P5,000.</li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b><br></div><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>On the Regional Director’s Jurisdiction over EBVSAI</i></b><br></div><br>EBVSAI claims that the Regional Director did not acquire jurisdiction over EBVSAI because he failed to comply with Section 11, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  EBVSAI points out that the notice of hearing was served at the Ambuklao Plant, not at EBVSAI’s main office in Makati, and that it was addressed to Leonardo Castro, Jr., EBVSAI’s Vice-President.<br><br>The Rules on the Disposition of Labor Standards Cases in the Regional Offices<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (rules) specifically state that notices and copies of orders shall be served on the parties or their duly authorized representatives at their last known address or, if they are represented by counsel, through the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The rules shall be liberally construed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and only in the absence of any applicable provision will the Rules of Court apply in a suppletory character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In this case, EBVSAI does not deny having received the notices of hearing.  In fact, on 29 March and 13 June 1996, Danilo Burgos and Edwina Manao, detachment commander and bookkeeper of EBVSAI, respectively, appeared before the Regional Director.  They claimed that the 22 March 1996 notice of hearing was received late and manifested that the notices should be sent to the Manila office.  Thereafter, the notices of hearing were sent to the Manila office.  They were also informed of EBVSAI’s violations and were asked to present the employment records of the private respondents for verification.  They were, moreover, asked to submit, within 10 days, proof of compliance or their position paper.  The Regional Director validly acquired jurisdiction over EBVSAI.   EBVSAI can no longer question the jurisdiction of the Regional Director after receiving the notices of hearing and after appearing before the Regional Director.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>On the Regional Director’s Jurisdiction over the Money Claims</i></b><br></div><br>EBVSAI maintains that under Articles 129 and 217(6) of the Labor Code, the Labor Arbiter, not the Regional Director, has exclusive and original jurisdiction over the case because the individual monetary claim of private respondents exceeds P5,000.  EBVSAI also argues that the case falls under the exception clause in Article 128(b) of the Labor Code.  EBVSAI asserts that the Regional Director should have certified the case to the Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for a full-blown hearing on the merits.<br><br>In <i>Allied Investigation Bureau, Inc. v. Sec. of Labor,</i> we ruled that:<br><blockquote>While it is true that under Articles 129 and 217 of the Labor Code, the Labor Arbiter has jurisdiction to hear and decide cases where the aggregate money claims of each employee exceeds P5,000.00, said provisions of law do not contemplate nor cover the visitorial and enforcement powers of the Secretary of Labor or his duly authorized representatives.<br><br>Rather, said powers are defined and set forth in Article 128 of the Labor Code (as amended by R.A. No. 7730) thus:<br><blockquote>Art. 128 Visitorial and enforcement power. --- x x x</blockquote>(b) <i>Notwithstanding the provisions of Article[s] 129 and 217 of this Code to the contrary, and in cases where the relationship of employer-employee still exists, the Secretary of Labor and Employment or his duly authorized representatives shall have the power to issue compliance orders to give effect to [the labor standards provisions of this Code and other] labor legislation based on the findings of labor employment and enforcement officers or industrial safety engineers made in the course of inspection.</i>  The Secretary or his duly authorized representatives shall issue writs of execution to the appropriate authority for the enforcement of their orders, except in cases where the employer contests the findings of the labor employment and enforcement officer and raises issues  supported by documentary proofs which were not considered in the course of inspection.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The aforequoted provision explicitly excludes from its coverage Articles 129 and 217 of the Labor Code by the phrase “(N)otwithstanding the provisions of Articles 129 and 217of this Code to the contrary x x x” thereby retaining and further strengthening the power of the Secretary of Labor or his duly authorized representatives to issue compliance orders to give effect to the labor standards provisions of said Code and other labor legislation based on the findings of labor employment and enforcement officer or industrial safety engineer made in the course of inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Italics in the original)</blockquote>This was further affirmed in our ruling in <i>Cirineo Bowling Plaza, Inc. v. Sensing,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> where we sustained the jurisdiction of the DOLE Regional Director and held that <b>“the visitorial and enforcement powers of the DOLE Regional Director to order and enforce compliance with labor standard laws can be exercised even where the individual claim exceeds P5,000.”</b><br><br>However, if the labor standards case is covered by the exception clause in Article 128(b) of the Labor Code, then the Regional Director will have to endorse the case to the appropriate Arbitration Branch of the NLRC.  In order to divest the Regional Director or his representatives of jurisdiction, the following elements must be present: (a) that the employer contests the findings of the labor regulations officer and raises issues thereon; (b) that in order to resolve such issues, there is a need to examine evidentiary matters; and (c) that such matters are not verifiable in the normal course of inspection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  The rules also provide that the employer shall raise such objections during the hearing of the case or at any time after receipt of the notice of inspection results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Regional Director validly assumed jurisdiction over the money claims of private respondents even if the claims exceeded P5,000 because such jurisdiction was exercised in accordance with Article 128(b) of the Labor Code and the case does not fall under the exception clause.<br><br>The Court notes that EBVSAI did not contest the findings of the labor regulations officer during the hearing or after receipt of the notice of inspection results.  It was only in its supplemental motion for reconsideration before the Regional Director that EBVSAI questioned the findings of the labor regulations officer and presented documentary evidence to controvert the claims of private respondents.  But even if this was the case, the Regional Director and the Secretary of Labor still looked into and considered EBVSAI’s documentary evidence and found that such did not warrant the reversal of the Regional Director’s order.  The Secretary of Labor also doubted the veracity and authenticity of EBVSAI’s documentary evidence.  Moreover, the pieces of evidence presented by EBVSAI were verifiable in the normal course of inspection because all employment records of the employees should be kept and maintained in or about the premises of the workplace, which in this case is in Ambuklao Plant, the establishment where private respondents were regularly assigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> we <b>DENY</b> the petition.
