Ana, San Pablo City.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>Petitioner Ranilo A. Velasco (petitioner) and respondent Benigno C. Layesa, Jr. (respondent) were two of the four candidates for Punong Barangay of Sta. Ana, San Pablo City in the 15 July 2002 barangay elections. After the canvassing of votes, the Barangay Board of Canvassers proclaimed petitioner winner with&nbsp; 390 votes. Petitioner's nearest rival, respondent, received 375 votes.<br><br>Claiming that some votes cast in his favor were erroneously excluded from the canvassing, respondent filed an election protest in the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, San Pablo City (trial court). Respondent prayed for the revision of 26 ballots from four precincts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Petitioner initially moved to dismiss the case but, in an Amended Answer, counterclaimed for the revision of ballots cast in another precinct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>In its Decision dated 23 August 2002, the trial court declared the election results tied, with petitioner and respondent each obtaining 390 votes. On the uncontested ballots, the trial court found that petitioner and respondent received 389 and 375 votes, respectively. After revision of the contested ballots, the trial court credited 15 more votes to respondent and one more vote to petitioner, thus leaving petitioner and respondent with 390 votes each. The trial court ordered the drawing of lots to break the tie and determine the winner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Petitioner appealed to the COMELEC, contending that the trial court erred in crediting respondent with 15 more votes.

In his motion, petitioner limited his objection to five ballots, namely: <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">-</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Exhibit "9" with the name "JR=LAYESA" written on the left uppermost portion of the ballot, beside the seal of the Republic of the Philippines, with the space for Punong Barangay left unfilled;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>-</td><td> <div align="justify">Exhibits "7," "8," and "10" with respondent's name written on the first space for Barangay Kagawad, leaving blank the space for Punong Barangay.

Traversing the matters petitioner raised in his motion, the COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> held that&nbsp; (1) the Second Division properly credited respondent with the votes cast for him in Exhibits "9" and "13" under the "neighborhood rule"; (2) Exhibits "7" and "8" were not prepared by one person; and (3) Exhibit "10" is not a marked ballot.<br><br>On the contentions respondent raised in his motion for reconsideration, the COMELEC<span style="font-style: italic;"> En Banc</span> ruled that Exhibit "A" is not a marked ballot and that the vote for petitioner was properly credited in his favor under the "neighborhood rule."&nbsp; The COMELEC <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> further ruled that Exhibit "4" cannot be&nbsp; credited to&nbsp; respondent as intent&nbsp; to vote for respondent cannot be ascertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition<br><br>Petitioner has narrowed the scope of his appeal to three ballots - Exhibits "9," "10," and "13."

The vote cast for respondent in Exhibit "10" is valid while those in Exhibits "9" and "13" are stray.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">On the Appreciation of Ballots</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">with Misplaced Votes</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></div><br>The votes contested in this appeal are all <span style="font-weight: bold;">misplaced votes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, votes cast for a candidate for the wrong or, in this case, inexistent office. In appreciating such votes, the COMELEC applied the "neighborhood rule." As used by the Court, this nomenclature, loosely based on a rule of the same name devised by the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> refers to an exception<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to the rule on appreciation of misplaced votes under Section 211(19) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code) which provides:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any vote</span> in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or<span style="font-weight: bold;"> in favor of a candidate for an office for which he did not present himself shall be considered as a stray vote</span> but it shall not invalidate the whole ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 211(19) is meant to avoid confusion in the minds of the election officials as to the candidates actually voted for and to stave off any scheming design to identify the vote of the elector, thus defeating the secrecy of the ballot which is a cardinal feature of our election laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Section 211(19) also enforces Section 195 of the Omnibus Election Code which provides that in preparing the ballot, each voter must "fill his ballot by writing in the proper place for each office the name of the individual candidate for whom he desires to vote."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Excepted from Section 211(19) are ballots with (1) a general misplacement of an entire series of names intended to be voted for the successive offices appearing in the ballot;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (2) a single<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> or double<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> misplacement of names where such names were preceded or followed by the title of the contested office or where the voter wrote after the candidate's name a directional symbol indicating the correct office for which the misplaced name was intended;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and (3) a single misplacement of a name written (a) off-center from the designated space,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (b) slightly underneath the line for the contested office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (c) immediately above the title for the contested office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> or (d) in the space for an office immediately following that for which the candidate presented himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In these instances, the misplaced votes are nevertheless credited to the candidates for the office for which they presented themselves because the voters' intention to so vote is clear from the face of the ballots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This is in consonance with the settled doctrine that ballots should be appreciated with liberality to give effect to the voters' will.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Foregoing Rule and Exceptions</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Applied to the Case</span><br></div><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Exhibit "10"</span><br><br>In this ballot, the voter wrote respondent's name twice  on the&nbsp; upper right side of the ballot above the instructions to the voter and on the first line for Sangguniang Barangay Kagawad, leaving blank the space for Punong Barangay. Both names are followed by the word "Charman."<br><br>The COMELEC correctly credited respondent with the vote cast for him in this ballot following the exception to Section 211(19) of ballots with a single misplaced name followed by the title of the contested office. The voter's repetition&nbsp; of respondent's name in the first line for Sangguniang Barangay Kagawad followed by the word "Charman" renders the vote valid. The voter's intent to cast his vote for respondent as Punong Barangay or barangay chairman is obvious when he wrote the word "Charman" - which can only stand for "[Barangay] Chairman" - after respondent's name.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Exhibits "9" and "13"</span><br><br>As described, the voter in Exhibit "9" wrote respondent's name on the left uppermost portion of the ballot, beside the seal of the Republic of the Philippines. In Exhibit "13," the voter also wrote respondent's name in the upper portion of the ballot, above the instructions to the voter but below the words "San Pablo City." In both ballots, the voters left unfilled the space for Punong Barangay but each wrote a name in the first line for Sangguniang Barangay Kagawad (Ronel O. Gutierrez in Exhibit "9" and Volter Estreleado in Exhibit "13").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Court holds that the votes for respondent in these ballots are stray and cannot be counted in his favor.<br><br>Respondent's name is not found on or near any of the lines corresponding to the offices of Punong Barangay or Sangguniang Barangay Kagawad - the offices in contention in the 15 July 2002 barangay elections. Instead, respondent's name is found outside of where these lines begin and end, namely, beside the seal of the Republic of the Philippines on the topmost portion of the ballot (Exhibit "9") and above the instructions to the voter, underneath the words "San Pablo City" (Exhibit "13"). Section 211(19), which treats misplaced votes as stray, speaks of a vote for a candidate "for an <span style="font-weight: bold;">office</span> for which he did not present himself." Thus, there is more reason to apply this rule here as the votes in Exhibits "9" and "13" do not even relate to any office.<br><br>Nor do the votes in question fall under any of the exceptions to Section 211(19) enumerated above. Exhibits "9" and "13" are not similar or analogous to ballots with a general misplacement of a series of names; a single or double misplacement of names preceded or followed by the title of the contested office or by a symbol indicating the correct office to which the vote was intended; or a single misplacement of a name written off-center, under the correct line, immediately above the name of the contested office, or in the space for an office immediately following that for which the candidate presented himself.&nbsp; Indeed, unlike these exceptions where the voters' mistake or confusion is evident from the face of the ballot, Exhibits "9" and "13" present an unusual case of extremes - while respondent's name was written way off its proper place, the names of persons who were presumably candidates for Sangguniang Barangay Kagawad were properly placed, without the slightest deviation, in the first of the seven lines for that office.<br><br>This gives only two possible impressions.&nbsp; First, that the voters in these two ballots knew in fact where to write the candidates' names, in which case the votes for respondent written way off its proper place become&nbsp; stray votes.&nbsp; Second, the voters' manner of voting was a devise to identify the ballots, which renders the ballots invalid.&nbsp; We adopt the more liberal view - that the misplaced votes&nbsp; in Exhibits "9" and "13" are stray votes under Section 211(19), thus, leaving the ballots valid.<br><br>Significantly, the chances of voter confusion generated by the appearance of the ballot are not as high in the 15 July 2002 barangay elections as in other elections involving local and national officials. In the 15 July 2002 elections, the ballots contained only one column consisting of blank lines or spaces for the offices of Punong Barangay and Barangay Kagawad (7 lines). In contrast, the ballots used in the 10 May 2004 local and national elections contained two columns: the first consisted of blank lines or spaces for the offices of President, Vice-President, Senators (12 lines), and Party-List Representative while the second consisted of blank lines for the offices of Representative, Governor, Vice-Governor, members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (4 lines), Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and members of the Sangguniang Bayan (8 lines). This is a material factor which dissuades us from indulging in presumptions of mistake or confusion to explain the misplaced votes in Exhibits "9" and "13."<br><br>This Court is ever mindful of the need, under our republican form of government, to give full expression to the voters' will as indicated in the ballots. This explains the numerous exceptions we have carved out of Section 211(19). However, liberality in ballot appreciation ends where subversion of the legislature's will begins. Congress enacted Sections 195 and 211(19) precisely to guard against the extreme irregularity Exhibits "9" and "13" present. Thus, we here draw the line between permissible deviations from Sections 195 and 211(19) and flagrant disregard of an elementary rule in voting under our present electoral system.<br><br>Accordingly, the votes in Exhibits "9" and "13" are deducted from the total number of votes credited to respondent, leaving a total of 388 votes in his favor. As petitioner's total number of votes remains unchanged at 390 votes, he is the duly elected Punong Barangay of Sta. Ana, San Pablo City.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, we <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANT</span> the petition.

the misplaced vote was not intended as an identifying mark; and<br>iv. there were no intervening votes between the line for Representative and the line on which the claimant's name could be found, except when the vote was written on the&nbsp; line&nbsp; for&nbsp; Governor,&nbsp; in which case, this requisite is no longer necessary.<br></div>b) On the line for President, provided that:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">i. the line for Representative is blank;<br>ii. no other name of a congressional candidate was written on the ballot;<br>iii. the misplaced vote was not intended as an identifying mark;

the "Intent Rule," comprising of two parts (the "Evident Intent Rule" and "Correct Sequence Rule"), which provides:<br><blockquote>A)&nbsp; Evident Intent Rule<br>Claimed ballots shall be admitted where the name of the party-claimant appeared on any line other than that for Representative, and is preceded by the descriptive title "Congressman"&nbsp; or "Representative," or the word "Congressman" or "Representative" was written on a space immediately followed by the name of a claimant, or with an arrow pointing to the space for Representative subject to the following conditions:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) the line for Representative is blank, or has an entry which is not a&nbsp; congressional candidate but with an arrow pointing to the appropriate space where the vote should be;<br>2) no other name of a congressional candidate is written on the ballot;&nbsp; and<br>3) the misplaced vote was not intended as an identifying mark.<br></div><br>B)&nbsp; Correct Sequence Rule<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) A misplaced name of a congressional candidate may be admitted provided it can be discerned from the sequence of votes or entries that the voter intended to vote for the congressional candidate named therein, provided that:<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a)&nbsp; the line for Representative is blank&nbsp; or&nbsp; need&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; blank&nbsp; if&nbsp; the voter was not so lettered;<br>b)&nbsp; no other name of a congressional candidate was written on the ballot; and<br>c)&nbsp; the misplaced vote was not intended as an identifying mark.<br>2)&nbsp; Where the name of the party claimant appears below the line or space for Representative/Congressman and is followed by the name of a gubernatorial candidate or the names of the gubernatorial and vice-gubernatorial candidates, respectively, subject to the following conditions:<br>a)&nbsp; the line for Representative is blank;<br>b)&nbsp; no other name of a congressional candidate was written on the ballot;<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">c)&nbsp; the misplaced vote was not intended as an identifying mark;
