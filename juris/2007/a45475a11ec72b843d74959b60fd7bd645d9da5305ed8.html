In the absence of grave abuse of discretion or any jurisdictional infirmity or error of law, the factual findings, conclusions, rulings, and decisions rendered by the said Commission on matters falling within its competence shall not be interfered with by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The MCTC originally found a total of 86 ballots cast in favor of Yamat in Precinct Nos. 56-A, 57-A, and 58-A as invalid for having been written by only one person.&nbsp; Both the COMELEC Second Division and <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span>, however, nullified the MCTC's findings on 80 of these ballots and found them to be valid.<br><br>It is fallacious for Balingit to argue that the COMELEC "sweepingly" validated the contested ballots and did not take into consideration his objections thereto, and that the COMELEC did not clearly set out the basis for its findings, as the assailed Resolution dated April 11, 2005 shows otherwise.&nbsp;

No. 9340 amended R.A. No. 9164 by extending the term of <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang kabataan</span> until October of 2007; indeed, the Court finds it odd that the COMELEC should justify the immediate execution of its decision with the "proximity of the elections."<br><br>The COMELEC, being the specialized agency tasked with the supervision of elections, is presumed to be aware of the passage of R.A. No. 9340.&nbsp; As Balingit correctly pointed out, R.A.
