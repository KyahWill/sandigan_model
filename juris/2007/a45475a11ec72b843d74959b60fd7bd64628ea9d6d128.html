He alleged that as a holder of a certificate of public convenience, DLPC is mandated by law to provide him with electric service; the grounds relied upon by respondent Orig in denying his application are anchored on bias and prejudice, since he (Diaz) is one of the stockholders of Diaz and Co.

He moved for a reconsideration, which was, however, denied in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated August 20, 1987.

The electricity in the building was then restored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On November 24, 1987, Diaz filed a Complaint for Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Prohibitory and Mandatory Injunction and Restraining Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> before the RTC, Davao City, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 18,855-87</b>.

The RTC ordered Diaz to immediately remove Meter No. 86673509 and disconnect the electrical wirings he had unilaterally connected to the upper floor rooms. Diaz filed a motion for reconsideration but was denied. On June 13, 1998, the sheriff, with the aid of DLPC personnel, caused the removal of Meter No. 86673509.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Diaz assailed the orders via petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the CA.

In defense, Diaz alleged the following: (1) that the complaint was intended to harass him; (2) he was entitled to electric service by virtue of his subrogation to the right of NFA/KADIWA; (3) the installation of Meter No. 86673509 was made with the knowledge and consent of DLPC; (4) there is a pending case between the parties regarding Meter Nos. 84738 and 86673509; and (5) the filing of the action is premature. The complaint was docketed as <b>I.S. No. 593.</b><br><br>On March 21, 1989, Lolito O. Evangelino, 4th Asst.

He opined that the correspondence to DLPC Manager Orig negated DLPC's claim of lack of consent and knowledge, and since the issue is still pending litigation in court, the determination of whether there is theft of electricity is premature (<b>Sp.

They also alleged that the officers of DLPC exacted additional and illegal profits from its consumers by devising a deceptive Varying Discount Formula; based on the alleged misrepresentation of said officers, the Board of Energy (BOE) granted DLPC provisional authority to apply the formula, thereby resulting in    losses of more or less P300,000.00 to Diaz, Ramos, and Arguelles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> As regards the charge of falsification, the complainants alleged that DLPC had its properties appraised by the Technical Management Services, Philippines, Inc.

An Information was filed before the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of Tagum, Davao del Norte, docketed as <b>Crim. Case No. 5800</b>.

On motion of the Prosecutor, the RTC dismissed the case in an Order dated July 13, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>On August 9, 1983, the officers of    DLPC, Eduardo J.

The plaintiff alleged that Diaz, motivated by malice and ill-will, had taken it upon himself to find fault in DLPC's acts and oppose all its application with the BOE, using the media to assault its good name by circulating or publishing libelous and false statements in the newspapers. The case was docketed as <b>Civil Case No. CEB-11843</b>.<br><br>DLPC further alleged that Diaz published and disseminated a handbill claiming that there was something irregular and anomalous regarding the Energy Regulation Board's approval of the appraisal of the properties and equipment of DLPC, because of which the customers of DLPC could expect a P5.00 per kilowatt charge in the future. Diaz allegedly gave identical interviews with the <i>Mindanao Daily Mirror </i>and the <i>Ang Peryodiko Dabaw</i> reiterating what he said in the handbill.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> In addition, Diaz, in an interview with the <i>People's Daily Forum</i>, claimed that the National Power Corporation sold two (2) generating sets to DLPC for only P1.00 each.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Consequently, DLPC suffered besmirched reputation and public humiliation, and damage to its business standing.

Due to the pendency of various actions before several courts, the trial court opted to segregate the issues. It focused only on the alleged malicious prosecution with regard to the filing of the criminal action for theft, <b>I. S. No. 593</b>, and for Violation of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876, <b>I.S. No. 92-4590</b>. The RTC reasoned in this wise:<br><blockquote>The records show that plaintiff's first cause of action, which is damages for defendant's refusal to grant him electric service, has become moot and academic by virtue of the compromise agreement executed by the plaintiff and the defendant in the mandamus case docketed as Civil Case No. 18288 of this Court. The parties filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss based on the Compromise Agreement which was granted by this Court and which led to the eventual dismissal of the case with prejudice.<br><br>In summary, plaintiff asks for damages for defendant's alleged malicious prosecution of a criminal case of theft of electricity against him, for plaintiff's filing of a charge of violation of P.D. 401 as amended after dismissal of the theft case, the filing of a damage suit against him before the RTC of Cebu City which was dismissed and the filing of another damage suit before the same Cebu RTC which is still pending. Damages are also being sought for defendant's removal of Electric Meter No. 847328 (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>). But this is a subject matter of a case pending before Branch 13 of this Court and therefore said court retains jurisdiction over the said cause of action. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>On May 22, 2000, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> dismissing the complaint. The <i>fallo</i> reads:<br><blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, finding no merit in plaintiff's complaint, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing said complaint with costs de oficio.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC held that while the City Prosecutor, and later the Secretary of Justice, concluded that there was no probable cause for the crime of theft, this did not change the fact that plaintiff made an illegal connection for electricity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> A person's right to litigate should not be penalized by holding him liable for damages.<br><br>Diaz appealed the decision to the CA, alleging that:<br><blockquote>I - THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT "WHEN THE DEFENDANTS FILED THE CASES OF THEFT, THEY DID SO IN HONEST BELIEF THAT PLAINTIFF IS CRIMINALLY LIABLE".<br><br>II - THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING THE CASE AT BAR AND WITHOUT GRANTING THE AWARD OF DAMAGES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 1, 2003, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> It concluded that the evidence on hand showed good faith on the part of DLPC in filing the subject complaints. It pointed out that Diaz had been using the electrical services of DLPC without its consent. As to the effect of the compromise agreement, the CA ruled that it did not bar the filing of the criminal action. Thus, under the principle of <i>damnum absque injuria,</i> the legitimate exercise of a person's right, even if it causes loss to another, does not automatically result in an actionable injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>Diaz, now petitioner, comes before this Court in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, raising the following errors:<br><blockquote>a) "Proof of moral suffering must be introduced, otherwise the award of moral damage is not proper. In this case, the evidence presented by the appellant is insufficient to overcome the presumption of good faith." (Decision, p. 10)<br><br>b) "In view of the foregoing, it is clear that the subject complaints were filed so as to protect appellee DLPC's interest. In this regard, it must be borne in mind that no person should be penalized for the exercise of the right to litigate." (Decision, p. 12)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br></blockquote>The issues raised in the present action can be summarized as follows: (1) whether or not the compromise agreement entered into between DLPC and Diaz barred the former from instituting further actions involving electric Meter No. 84736 or 86673509; (2) whether or not DLPC acted in bad faith in instituting the criminal cases against Diaz; and (3) whether or not Diaz is entitled to damages.<br><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>Petitioner insists that the compromise agreement as well as the decision of the <b>CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 14909</b> already settled the controversies between them; yet, DLPC instituted the theft case against Diaz, and worse, instituted another action for violation of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876. Thus, the only conclusion that can be inferred from the acts of DLPC is that they were designed to harass, embarrass, prejudice, and ruin him. He further avers that the compromise agreement in <b>Civil Case No. CEB-1049</b> completely erased litigious matters that could necessarily arise out of either Electric Meter No. 84736 or 86673509.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Moreover, Diaz asserts that the evidence he presented is sufficient to prove the damages he suffered by reason of the malicious institution of the criminal cases.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Article 2028 of the Civil Code defines a compromise as a contract whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid litigation or put an end to one already commenced. The purpose of compromise is to settle the claims of the parties and bar all future disputes and controversies. However, criminal liability is not affected by compromise for it is a public offense which must be prosecuted and punished by the Government on its own motion, though complete reparation should have been made of the damages suffered by the offended party. A criminal case is committed against the People, and the offended party may not waive or extinguish the criminal liability that the law imposes for the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Moreover, a compromise is not one of the grounds prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the extinction of criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>As can be inferred from the compromise agreement, Diaz and DLPC merely agreed to (1) reduce the latter's total claims to only P385,000.00;   (2) for DLPC to waive its counterclaims against Diaz; and (3) upon receipt of the amount, for DLPC to immediately install the necessary electric service to the building. The parties likewise agreed to the dismissal of Sp. Civil Case No. 18,288 for being moot and academic. Nowhere in said agreement did the parties agree that DLPC was barred from instituting any further action involving electric Meter No. 84736 or 86673509.<br><br>We find that petitioner is not entitled to damages under Articles 19,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> 20<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> and 21,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> and Articles 2217<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> and 2219(8)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> of the New Civil Code.<br><br>The elements of abuse of rights are the following: (a) the existence of a legal right or duty; (b) which is exercised in bad faith; and (c) for the sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Thus, malice or bad faith is at the core of the above provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Good faith refers to the state of the mind which is manifested by the acts of the individual concerned. It consists of the intention to abstain from taking an unconscionable and unscrupulous advantage of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Good faith is presumed and he who alleges bad faith has the duty to prove the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Bad faith, on the other hand, does not simply connote bad judgment to simple negligence, dishonest purpose or some moral obloquy and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of known duty due to some motives or interest or ill-will that partakes of the nature of fraud. Malice connotes ill-will or spite and speaks not in response to duty. It implies an intention to do ulterior and unjustifiable harm. Malice is bad faith or bad motive. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>The evidence presented by respondents negates malice or bad faith. Petitioner himself alleged in his complaint that he unilaterally installed Meter No. 86673509 to replace Meter No. 84738 after it was removed by DLPC. No less than this Court, in <b>G.R. No. 85445</b>, admonished petitioner and reminded him that connections of electrical service and installations of electric meters should always be upon mutual contract of the parties, and that payments for electrical consumption should also be made promptly whenever due.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> Based on these established facts, petitioner has not shown that the acts of respondent were done with the sole intent of prejudicing and injuring him.<br><br>Petitioner may have suffered damages as a result of the filing of the complaints. However, there is a material distinction between damages and injury. Injury is the illegal invasion of a legal right; damage is the loss, hurt or harm which results from the injury; and damages are the recompense or compensation awarded for the damage suffered. Thus, there can be damage without injury in those instances in which the loss or harm was not the result of a violation of a legal duty. In such cases, the consequences must be borne by the injured person alone; the law affords no remedy for damages resulting from an act which does not amount to a legal injury or wrong. These situations are often called <i>damnum absque injuria</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> Whatever damages Diaz may have suffered would have to be borne by him alone since it was his acts which led to the filing of the complaints against him.<br><br>On the other hand, malicious prosecution has been defined as an action for damages brought by or against whom a criminal prosecution, civil suit or other legal proceeding has been instituted maliciously and without probable cause, after the termination of such prosecution, suit, or other proceeding in favor of the defendant therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> It is an established rule that in order for malicious prosecution to prosper, the following requisites must be proven by petitioner: (1) the fact of prosecution and the further fact that the defendant (respondent) was himself the prosecutor, and that the action finally terminated with an acquittal; (2) that in bringing the action, the prosecutor acted without probable cause; and (3) that the prosecutor was actuated or impelled by legal malice, that is, by improper or sinister motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> The foregoing are necessary to preserve a person's right to litigate which may be emasculated by the undue filing of malicious prosecution cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> From the foregoing requirements, it can be inferred that malice and want of probable cause must both be clearly established to justify an award of damages based on malicious prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>The Court notes that respondents initiated two separate criminal actions, one for theft of electricity, Inv. Sheet No. 593 July/1988, and the other, for Violation of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876, I.S. No. 92-4590. It must be stressed that theft of electricity is a felony defined and penalized under the Revised Penal Code, while Violation of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876, is an offense punished by a special law. What generally makes the former a felony is criminal intent (<i>dolo</i>) or negligence (<i>culpa</i>); what makes the latter a crime is the special law enacting it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> In addition, the elements of the two (2) offenses are different from one another. In theft, the elements are: (1) intent to gain; (2) unlawful taking; (3) personal property belonging to another; (4) and absence of violence or intimidation against persons or force upon things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> On the other hand, the crime of Violation of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876, is <i>mala prohibita</i>. The criminal act is not inherently immoral but becomes punishable only because the law says it is forbidden. With these crimes, the sole issue is whether the law has been violated. Criminal intent is not necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>While the institution of separate criminal actions under the provisions of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876, and under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on theft may refer to identical acts committed by petitioner, the prosecution thereof cannot be limited to one offense because a single criminal act may give rise to a multiplicity of offenses; and where there is variance or difference between the elements of an offense in one law and another law, as in the case at bar, there will be no double jeopardy because what the rule on double jeopardy prohibits refers to identity of elements in the two (2) offenses. Otherwise stated, prosecution for the same act is not prohibited; what is forbidden is prosecution for the same offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Hence, no fault could be attributed to respondent DLPC when it instituted the two separate actions.<br><br>As earlier stated, a claim for damages based on malicious prosecution will prosper only if the three elements aforecited are shown to exist. We find that none of the requisites are attendant here.<br><br>First. Although respondent DLPC initiated before the prosecutor's office <b>Inv. Sheet No. 593 July/1988</b> for theft of electricity, and <b>I.S. No. 92-4590</b> for Violation of P.D. 401, as amended by B.P. Blg. 876, no information was ever filed in court. The cases were eventually dropped or dismissed before they could be filed in court. Ultimately, both actions could not end in an acquittal.<br><br>Second. It cannot be concluded that respondent DLPC acted without probable cause when it instituted the actions. The events which led to the filing of the complaints are undisputed, and respondent DLPC cannot be faulted for filing them. In the early case of <i>Buchanan v. Esteban</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> this Court had already stressed that "one cannot be held liable in damages for maliciously instituting a prosecution where he acted with probable cause." As Justice Moreland explained in that case:<br><blockquote>Probable cause is the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief, in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted. The general rule is well settled that one cannot be held liable in damages for maliciously instituting a prosecution where he acted with probable cause. In other words, a suit will lie only in cases where a legal prosecution has been carried on without probable cause. And the reason for the rule as stated by Blackstone, is that it would be a very great discouragement to public justice if prosecutors, who had a tolerable ground of suspicion, were liable to be sued at law when their indictments miscarried.<br></blockquote>Thus, the element of malice and the absence of probable cause must be proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> There must be proof that the prosecution was prompted by a sinister design to vex and humiliate a person, and that it was initiated deliberately knowing that the charge was false and baseless to entitle the victims to damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> The two elements must simultaneously exist; otherwise, the presence of probable cause signifies, as a legal consequence, the absence of malice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> In the instant case, it is evident that respondent DLPC was not motivated by malicious intent or by a sinister design to unduly harass petitioner, but only by a well-founded anxiety to protect its rights. Respondent DLPC cannot therefore be faulted in availing of the remedies provided for by law.<br><br>In a free society, controversies are heard and settled under the rule of law in the forum of the courts of justice. It is one of the virtues of our system of government that a person who feels aggrieved does not have to take the law into his or her hands or resort to the use of force for the vindication of injury. The courts are there to hear and act on the complaint. The right to litigate is an escape valve to relieve the pressures of personal disagreements that might otherwise explode in physical confrontation. It is necessary not only for upholding one's claims when they are unjustly denied but also for the maintenance of peace, if not goodwill, among incipient antagonists. Without the right to litigate, conflicting claims cannot be examined and resolved in accordance with one of the primary purposes of government, which is to provide for a just and orderly society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> Hence, the mere act of submitting a case to the authorities for prosecution does not render a person liable for malicious prosecution should he or she be unsuccessful, for the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
