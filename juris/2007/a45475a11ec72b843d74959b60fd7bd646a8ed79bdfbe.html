				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> seeks to set aside the April 30, 2001 decision of the Court Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 50888<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and its April 3, 2003 resolution denying reconsideration.<br><br>In a letter-agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 15, 1984, Primitivo E. Domingo handed the management of his estate, including the respondent corporation Sta. Mesa Market Corporation (SMMC), to petitioner Ernesto L. Salas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> As estate manager, petitioner was primarily tasked to ensure SMMC's continued viability and profitability by redeveloping the Sta. Mesa market and restructuring the corporation's finances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Domingo, on the other hand, bound himself to transfer (on or before June 30, 1985)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 30% of SMMC's subscribed and paid-up capital stock to petitioner as part of his compensation. But, if petitioner failed to achieve a monthly market revenue of at least P350,000, he would be obliged to return the shares of stock of SMMC to Domingo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On December 28, 1984, Domingo, as chairman of SMMC, and petitioner, in his personal capacity and as chairman of Inter-Alia Management Corporation (Inter-Alia), formalized their agreement under a property and financial management contract (management contract).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Shortly after the execution of the contract, SMMC, under petitioner's management, leased the Sta. Mesa market to Malaca Realty Corporation (Malaca).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> But it became apparent soon thereafter that Malaca was financially incapable of improving and expanding the existing facilities of the Sta. Mesa market.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In fact, it was unable to pay the monthly rent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, SMMC terminated its lease contract with Malaca.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As a result, its board of directors became dissatisfied with petitioner's management of the corporation. Thereafter, it ended its management contract with    petitioner (and Inter-Alia).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On June 8, 1987, petitioner filed an action for specific performance and damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> against SMMC and Domingo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He alleged that SMMC's monthly market revenue had surpassed P350,000 yet Domingo refused to comply with his obligation to deliver 30% of the subscribed and paid-up capital stock of SMMC to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In his answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Domingo argued that petitioner was not entitled to the shares of SMMC. On the contrary, the corporation suffered additional losses and incurred new liabilities (which respondents consistently itemized in their pleadings) amounting to P1,935,995.06 over the twenty-one (21) months petitioner was managing it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On August 21, 1995, the RTC rendered a decision in favor of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The trial court considered copies of SMMC's audited financial statements which showed an improvement in the corporation's monthly average gross income (from P251,790 in 1984 to P409,794 in 1985). It found that petitioner not only increased SMMC's monthly gross income but also exceeded the target monthly gross income of P350,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Hence, it ordered respondent heirs to deliver the shares of SMMC (equivalent to 30% of its total subscribed and paid-up capital stocks) to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondent heirs appealed the judgment of the RTC to the CA. On April 30, 2001, the appellate court rendered its decision. It found that the trial court erred in admitting petitioner's documentary evidence. According to the CA, petitioner failed to prove the authenticity of the audited financial statements. He did not present a representative of SMMC's external auditor, Bejarin Jimenez &amp; Co., to testify on the genuineness and due execution of the audited financial statements of SMMC. Instead, petitioner presented a memorandum prepared by a member of his management team attesting to the increase in the corporation's monthly market revenue. For this reason, the appellate court ruled that the audited financial statements were not only self-serving but also hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, the CA reversed the RTC decision and dismissed petitioner's complaint.<br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration but his motion was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner avers that Amado Domingo, a vice-president of SMMC and an heir of the deceased Primitivo E. Domingo, testified that the audited financial statements presented in court were copies of those submitted by SMMC to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for purposes of tax payments and compliance with reportorial requirements, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Therefore, Amado Domingo, in effect, admitted the genuineness and due execution of the documents which made authentication unnecessary.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, insist that the audited financial statements were inadmissible in evidence due to lack of proper authentication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>We agree with the CA.<br><br>The documents in question were supposedly copies of the audited financial statements of SMMC. Financial statements (which include the balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flow) show the fiscal condition of a particular entity within a specified period. The financial statements prepared by external auditors who are certified public accountants (like those presented by petitioner) are audited financial statements. Financial statements, whether audited or not, are, as general rule, private documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, once financial statements are filed with a government office pursuant to a provision of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> they become public documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Whether a document is public or private is relevant in determining its admissibility as evidence. Public documents are admissible in evidence even without further proof of their due execution and genuineness. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> On the other hand, private documents are inadmissible in evidence unless they are properly authenticated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Section 20. <span style="font-style: italic;">Proof of private documents</span>. Before any private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved either:<br><ol type="a"><li>By anyone who saw the document executed or written; or<br><br></li><li>By evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.<br></li></ol>Any other private document need only be identified as that which it is claimed to be.<br></blockquote>Petitioner and respondents agree that the documents presented as evidence were mere copies of the audited financial statements submitted to the BIR and SEC. Neither party claimed that copies presented were <span style="font-style: italic;">certified true copies</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of audited financial statements obtained or secured from the BIR or the SEC which under Section 19(c), Rule 132 would have been public documents. Thus, the statements presented were private documents. Consequently, authentication was a precondition to their admissibility in evidence.<br><br>During authentication in court, a witness positively testifies that a document presented as evidence is genuine and has been duly executed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> or that the document is neither spurious nor counterfeit nor executed by mistake or under duress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In this case, petitioner merely presented a memorandum attesting to the increase in the corporation's monthly market revenue, prepared by a member of his management team. While there is no fixed criterion as to what constitutes competent evidence to establish the authenticity of a private document, the best proof available must be presented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The best proof available, in this instance, would have been the testimony of a representative of SMMC's external auditor who prepared the audited financial statements. Inasmuch as there was none, the audited financial statements were never authenticated.<br><br>Nevertheless, petitioner insists on the application of an exception to this rule: authentication is not necessary where the adverse party has admitted the genuineness and due execution of a document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The fact, however, was that nowhere in his testimony did Amado Domingo categorically admit the authenticity of the copies of the audited financial statements. He only testified that SMMC regularly submitted its audited financial statements to the BIR and SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> There was never any admission that the documents presented by petitioner were true or faithful copies of those submitted to the BIR and the SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
