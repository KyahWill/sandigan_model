SP No. 66341 affirming the 8 August 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).&nbsp; The CTA ordered the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (petitioner) to issue a tax credit certificate for P6,994,659.67 in favor of Burmeister and Wain Scandinavian Contractor Mindanao, Inc. (respondent).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Antecedents</span><br></div><br>The CTA summarized the facts, which the Court of Appeals adopted, as follows:<br><blockquote>[Respondent] is&nbsp; a domestic corporation duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines with principal address located at Daruma Building, Jose P. Laurel Avenue, Lanang, Davao City.<br><br>It is represented that a foreign consortium composed of&nbsp; Burmeister and Wain Scandinavian Contractor A/S (BWSC-Denmark), Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding, Ltd., and Mitsui and Co., Ltd. entered into a contract with the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) for the operation and maintenance of [NAPOCOR’s] two power barges.&nbsp; The Consortium appointed BWSC-Denmark as its coordination manager.<br><br>BWSC-Denmark established [respondent] which subcontracted the actual operation and maintenance of NAPOCOR’s two power barges as well as the performance of other duties and acts which necessarily have to be done in the Philippines.<br><br>NAPOCOR paid capacity and energy fees to the Consortium in a mixture of currencies (Mark, Yen, and Peso).&nbsp; The freely convertible non-Peso component is deposited directly to the Consortium’s bank accounts in Denmark and Japan, while the Peso-denominated component is deposited in a separate and special designated bank account in the Philippines.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Consortium pays [respondent] in foreign currency inwardly remitted to the Philippines through the banking system.<br><br>In order to ascertain the tax implications of the above transactions, [respondent] sought a ruling from the BIR which responded with BIR Ruling No. 023-95 dated February 14, 1995, declaring therein that if [respondent] chooses to register as a VAT person and the consideration for its services is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the aforesaid services shall be subject to VAT at zero-rate.<br><br>[Respondent] chose to register as a VAT taxpayer.&nbsp; On May 26, 1995, the Certificate of Registration bearing RDO Control No. 95-113-007556 was issued in favor of [respondent] by the Revenue District Office No. 113 of Davao City.<br><br>For the year 1996, [respondent] seasonably filed its quarterly Value-Added Tax Returns reflecting, among others, a total zero-rated sales of P147,317,189.62 with VAT input taxes of P3,361,174.14, detailed as follows:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"><td align="left" width="10%">Qtr.</td> <td align="left" width="10%"> Exh.</td><td align="left" width="10%">Date Filed <br></td> <td align="left" width="10%">Zero-Rated Sales</td><td align="left" width="10%">VAT Input Tax</td></tr> <tr><td colspan="5">----------------------------------------------------------------------</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"> <td>1st </td><td>E </td><td>04-18-96&nbsp;

The sum of P43,893,951.07, representing January to March 1996 sales was subjected to zero rate.&nbsp; Consequently, [respondent] filed its 1996 amended VAT return consolidating therein the VAT output and input taxes for the four calendar quarters of 1996.&nbsp; It paid the amount of P6,994,659.67 through BIR’s collecting agent, PCIBank, as its output tax liability for the year 1996, computed as follows:<br>&nbsp; <br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="75%"> <tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"> <td align="left" width="55%">Amount subject to 10% VAT</td> <td style="text-align: right;" width="45%"> P103,558,338.11</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor="#ffffff"> <td> Multiply by&nbsp;

[Respondent] believed that it erroneously paid the output VAT for 1996 due to its availment of the Voluntary Assessment Program (VAP) of the BIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>On 27 December 1999, respondent filed a petition for review with the CTA in order to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period under the Tax Code. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals</span><br></div><br>In its 8 August 2001 Decision, the CTA ordered petitioner to issue a tax credit certificate for P6,994,659.67 in favor of respondent.&nbsp; The CTA’s ruling stated:<br><blockquote>[Respondent’s] sale of services to the Consortium [was] paid for in acceptable foreign currency inwardly remitted to the Philippines and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.&nbsp; These were established by various BPI Credit Memos showing remittances in Danish Kroner (DKK) and US dollars (US$) as payments for the specific invoices billed by [respondent] to the consortium.&nbsp; These remittances were further certified by the Branch Manager x x x of BPI-Davao Lanang Branch to represent payments for sub-contract fees that came from Den Danske Aktieselskab Bank-Denmark for the account of [respondent].&nbsp; Clearly, [respondent’s] sale of services to the Consortium is subject to VAT at 0% pursuant to Section 108(B)(2) of the Tax Code. &nbsp;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The zero-rating of [respondent’s] sale of services to the Consortium was even confirmed by the [petitioner] in BIR Ruling No. 023-95 dated February 15, 1995, and later by VAT Ruling No. 003-99 dated January 7,1999, x x x.<br><br>Since it is apparent that the payments for the services rendered by [respondent] were indeed subject to VAT at zero percent, it follows that it mistakenly availed of the&nbsp; Voluntary Assessment Program by paying output tax for its sale of services.&nbsp; x x x &nbsp;<br><br>x x x Considering the principle of solutio indebiti which requires the return of what has been delivered by mistake, the [petitioner] is obligated to issue the tax credit certificate prayed for by [respondent]. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals, which dismissed the petition for lack of merit and affirmed the CTA decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> &nbsp;<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court of Appeals’ Ruling</span><br></div><br>In affirming the CTA, the Court of Appeals rejected petitioner’s view that since respondent’s services are not destined for consumption abroad, they are not of the same nature as project studies, information services, engineering and architectural designs, and other similar services mentioned in Section 4.102-2(b)(2) of Revenue Regulations No. 5-96<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> as subject to 0% VAT.&nbsp; Thus, according to petitioner, respondent’s services cannot legally qualify for 0% VAT but are subject to the regular 10% VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">8]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals found untenable petitioner’s contention that under VAT Ruling No. 040-98, respondent’s services should be destined for consumption abroad to enjoy zero-rating.&nbsp; Contrary to petitioner’s interpretation,&nbsp; there are two kinds of transactions or services subject to zero percent VAT under VAT Ruling No. 040-98.&nbsp; These are (a) services other than repacking goods for other persons doing business outside the Philippines which goods are subsequently exported; and (b) services by a resident to a non-resident foreign client, such as project studies, information services, engineering and architectural designs and other similar services, the consideration for which is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span> (BSP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</span>9]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals stated that “only the first classification is required by the provision to be consumed abroad in order to be taxed at zero rate.&nbsp; In x x x the absence of such express or implied stipulation in the statute, the second classification need not be consumed abroad.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals further held that assuming petitioner’s interpretation of Section 4.102-2(b)(2) of Revenue Regulations No. 5-96 is correct, such administrative provision is void being an amendment to the Tax Code.&nbsp; Petitioner went beyond merely providing the implementing details by adding another requirement to zero-rating.&nbsp; “This is indicated by the additional phrase ‘as well as services by a resident to a non-resident foreign client, such as project&nbsp; studies, information services and engineering and architectural designs and other similar services.’&nbsp; In effect, this phrase adds not just one but two requisites: (a)&nbsp; services must be rendered by a resident to a non-resident; and (b) these must be in the nature of project studies, information services, etc.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals explained that under Section 108(b)(2) of the Tax Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup>for services which were performed in the Philippines to enjoy zero-rating, these must comply only with two requisites, to wit:&nbsp; (1) payment in acceptable foreign currency and (2) accounted for in accordance with the rules of the BSP.&nbsp; Section 108(b)(2) of the Tax Code does not provide that services must be “destined for consumption abroad” in order to be VAT zero-rated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals disagreed with petitioner’s argument that our VAT law generally follows the destination principle (i.e., exports exempt, imports taxable).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Court of Appeals stated that “if indeed the ‘destination principle’ underlies and is the basis of the VAT laws, then petitioner’s proper remedy would be to recommend an amendment of Section 108(b)(2) to Congress.&nbsp; Without such amendment, however, petitioner should apply the terms of the basic law. Petitioner could not resort to administrative legislation, as what [he] had done in this case.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issue</span><br></div><br>The lone issue for resolution is whether respondent is entitled to the refund of P6,994,659.67 as erroneously paid output VAT for the year 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Court</span><br></div><br>We deny the petition.<br><br>At the outset, the Court declares that the denial of the instant petition is not on the ground that respondent’s services are subject to 0% VAT.&nbsp; Rather, it is based on the non-retroactivity of the prejudicial revocation of BIR Ruling No. 023-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and VAT Ruling No. 003-99,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which held that respondent’s services&nbsp; are subject to 0% VAT and which respondent invoked in applying for refund of the output VAT. <br><br>Section 102(b) of the Tax Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the applicable provision in 1996 when respondent rendered the services and paid the VAT in question, enumerates which services are zero-rated, thus:<br><blockquote>(b) Transactions subject to zero-rate. ? The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to 0%:<br><br>(1) Processing, manufacturing or repacking goods<span style="font-weight: bold;"> for other persons doing business outside the Philippines </span>which goods are subsequently exported, where the services are paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span> (BSP);<br><br>(2) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Services other than those mentioned in the preceding sub-paragraph,</span> the consideration for which is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas </span>(BSP);<br><br>(3) Services rendered to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to zero&nbsp; rate;<br><br>(4) Services rendered to vessels engaged exclusively in international shipping; and<br><br>(5)&nbsp; Services performed by subcontractors and/or contractors in processing, converting, or manufacturing goods for an enterprise whose export sales exceed seventy percent (70%) of total annual production.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In insisting that its services should be zero-rated, respondent claims that it complied with the requirements of the Tax Code for zero rating under the second paragraph of Section 102(b).&nbsp; Respondent asserts that (1) the payment of its service fees was in acceptable foreign currency, (2) there was inward remittance of the foreign currency into the Philippines, and (3) accounting of such remittance was in accordance with BSP rules. Moreover, respondent contends that its services&nbsp; which “constitute the actual operation and management of two (2) power barges in Mindanao” are not “even remotely similar to project studies, information services and engineering and architectural designs under Section 4.102-2(b)(2) of Revenue Regulations No. 5-96.” As such, respondent’s services need not be “destined to be consumed abroad in order to be VAT zero-rated.” <br><br>Respondent is mistaken. &nbsp;<br><br>The Tax Code not only requires that the services be other than “processing, manufacturing or repacking of goods” and that payment for such services be in acceptable foreign currency accounted for in accordance with BSP rules. Another essential condition for qualification to zero-rating under Section 102(b)(2) is that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">recipient of such services is doing business <span style="font-style: italic;">outside</span> the Philippines</span>. While this requirement is not expressly stated in the second paragraph of Section 102(b), this is clearly provided in the first paragraph of Section 102(b) where the listed services must be “for other persons doing business outside the Philippines.”&nbsp; The phrase <span style="font-weight: bold;">“<span style="font-weight: bold;">f</span>or other persons doing business outside the Philippines” </span>not only refers to the services enumerated in the first paragraph of Section 102(b), but also pertains to the general term “services” appearing in the second paragraph of Section 102(b). In short, services other than processing, manufacturing, or repacking of goods must likewise be performed for persons doing business outside the Philippines. &nbsp;<br><br>This can only be the logical interpretation of Section 102(b)(2).&nbsp; If the provider and recipient of the “other services” are both doing business in the Philippines, the payment of foreign currency is irrelevant.&nbsp; Otherwise, those subject to the regular VAT under Section 102(a) can avoid paying the VAT by simply stipulating payment in foreign currency inwardly remitted by the recipient of services.&nbsp; To interpret Section 102(b)(2) to apply to a payer-recipient of services doing business in the Philippines is to make the payment of the regular VAT under Section 102(a) dependent on the generosity of the taxpayer.&nbsp; The provider of services can choose to pay the regular VAT or avoid it by stipulating payment in foreign currency inwardly remitted by the payer-recipient. Such interpretation removes Section 102(a) as a tax measure in the Tax Code, an interpretation this Court cannot sanction.&nbsp; A tax is a mandatory exaction, not a voluntary contribution. &nbsp;<br><br>When Section 102(b)(2) stipulates payment in “acceptable foreign currency” under BSP rules, the law clearly envisions the payer-recipient of services to be doing business outside the Philippines.&nbsp; Only those not doing business in the Philippines can be required under BSP rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> to pay in acceptable foreign currency for their purchase of goods or services from the Philippines.&nbsp; In a domestic transaction, where the provider and recipient of services are both doing business in the Philippines, the BSP cannot require any party to make payment in foreign currency. &nbsp;<br><br>Services covered by Section 102(b) (1) and (2) are in the nature of export sales since the payer-recipient of services is doing business outside the Philippines. Under BSP rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the proceeds of export sales must be reported to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</span>. Thus, there is reason to require the provider of services under Section 102(b) (1) and (2) to account for the foreign currency proceeds to the BSP.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same rationale does not apply if the provider and recipient of the services are both doing business in the Philippines since their transaction is not in the nature of an export sale even if payment is denominated in foreign currency. &nbsp;<br><br>Further, when the provider and recipient of services are<span style="font-weight: bold;"> both </span>doing business in the Philippines, their transaction falls squarely under Section 102(a) governing <span style="font-weight: bold;">domestic</span> sale or exchange of services.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a purely local sale or exchange of services subject to the regular VAT, unless of course the transaction falls under the other provisions of Section 102(b).<br><br>Thus, when Section 102(b)(2) speaks of <span style="font-weight: bold;">“[s]ervices other than those mentioned in the preceding subparagraph,”</span> the legislative intent is that only the services are different between subparagraphs 1 and 2.&nbsp; The requirements for zero-rating, including the essential condition that the recipient of services is doing business outside the Philippines, remain the same under both subparagraphs. &nbsp;<br><br>Significantly, the amended Section 108(b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> [previously Section 102(b)] of the present Tax Code clarifies this legislative intent.&nbsp; Expressly included among the transactions subject to 0% VAT are “[s]ervices other than those mentioned in the [first] paragraph [of Section 108(b)] rendered to <span style="font-weight: bold;">a person engaged in business conducted outside the Philippines or to a nonresident person not engaged in business who is outside the Philippines</span> when the services are performed, the consideration for which is paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP.”<br><br>In this case, the payer-recipient of respondent’s services is the Consortium which is a joint-venture doing business in the Philippines. While the Consortium’s principal members are non-resident foreign corporations, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Consortium itself is doing business in the Philippines.</span>&nbsp; This is shown clearly in BIR Ruling No. 023-95 which states that the contract between the Consortium and NAPOCOR is for a 15-year term, thus: <br><blockquote>This refers to your letter dated January 14, 1994 requesting for a clarification of the tax implications of a contract between a consortium composed of Burmeister &amp; Wain Scandinavian Contractor A/S (“BWSC”), Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding, Ltd. (MES), and Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. (“MITSUI”), all referred to hereinafter as the “Consortium”, and the National Power Corporation (“NAPOCOR”) <span style="font-weight: bold;">for the operation and maintenance of two 100-Megawatt power barges (“Power Barges”) acquired by NAPOCOR for a 15-year term.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Considering this length of time, the Consortium’s operation and maintenance of&nbsp; NAPOCOR’s power barges cannot be classified as a single or isolated transaction.&nbsp; The Consortium does not fall under Section 102(b)(2)&nbsp; which requires that the recipient of the services must be a person doing business outside the Philippines. Therefore, respondent’s services to the Consortium, not being supplied to a person doing business outside the Philippines, cannot legally qualify for 0% VAT. &nbsp;<br><br>Respondent, as subcontractor of the Consortium, operates and maintains NAPOCOR’s power barges in the Philippines. NAPOCOR pays the Consortium, through its non-resident partners, partly in foreign currency outwardly remitted.&nbsp; In turn, the Consortium pays respondent also in foreign currency inwardly remitted and accounted for in accordance with BSP rules. This payment scheme does not entitle respondent to 0% VAT.&nbsp; As the Court held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. American Express International, Inc. (Philippine Branch)</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the place of payment is immaterial, much less is the place where the output of the service is ultimately used.&nbsp; An essential condition for entitlement to 0% VAT under Section 102(b)(1) and (2) is that the recipient of the services is a person doing business outside the Philippines. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In this case, the recipient of the services is the Consortium, which is doing business not outside, but within the Philippines because it has a 15-year contract to operate and maintain NAPOCOR’s two 100-megawatt power barges in Mindanao. </span><br><br>The Court recognizes the rule that the VAT system generally follows the “destination principle” (exports are zero-rated whereas imports are taxed).&nbsp; However, as the Court stated in <span style="font-style: italic;">American Express</span>, there is an exception to this rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This exception refers to the 0% VAT on services enumerated in Section 102 and performed in the Philippines. For services covered by Section 102(b)(1) and (2), the recipient of the services must be a person doing business outside the Philippines.&nbsp; Thus, to be exempt from the destination principle under Section 102(b)(1) and (2), the services must be (a) performed in the Philippines; (b) for a person doing business outside the Philippines; and (c) paid in acceptable foreign currency accounted for in accordance with BSP rules.<br><br>Respondent’s reliance on the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">American Express</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26] </sup>is misplaced. That case involved a recipient of services, specifically American Express International, Inc. (Hongkong Branch), doing business outside the Philippines.&nbsp; There, the Court stated:<br><blockquote>Respondent [American Express International, Inc.
