After investigation, Judge Erum submitted a Report with the following relevant findings and recommendation:<br><blockquote>Clearly, the evidence for the complainants had established that respondent, Aurora Laranang, violated [Supreme Court] Administrative Circular No. 24-90 dated July 12, 1990 xxx when she failed to submit the [TSN] of the proceedings held on November 12, 2003, Criminal Case No. 98-1984 for six (6) months and that held on January 26, 2004 in Criminal Case No. 01-1275 for a period of three (3) months, constraining the presiding judge to issue orders dated February 18, 2004 (Exh. E, Annex 6) and April 26, 2004 (Exh. E-2, Annex 6-b) directing the respondent, xxx to transcribe her stenographic notes within five days from those dates, respectively, in the two (2) respective cases.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>As to the charge of habitual absenteeism, this court finds that [respondent] had been absent more than the allowable absences under Civil Service Commission Circular No. 4, Series of 1991 which circular is adopted by the Hon. Supreme Court in Administrative Circular No. 14-12002 dated March 18, 2002.<br><br>As to the charge of notoriously undesirable and quarrelsome, the complainants had not presented evidence to prove the same.<br><br>As to the said two (2) Administrative cases filed against the respondent, Aurora Laranang, this Court need not include in this charge as the same were already the subject of administrative investigations, one (1) of which had been decided and the respondent Aurora Laranang, had served the penalty of suspension.<br><br>WHEREFORE, xxx the respondent, Aurora Laranang, is found guilty of neglect of duty and habitual absenteeism, and therefore, the undersigned recommends that the respondent Aurora Laranang, be meted the penalty of one (1) whole year suspension without pay pursuant to Section 33 of RA 2260, as amended by [RA] 6040. Considering that the said respondent Aurora Laranang, had already resigned, effective August 16, 2005, as per acceptance of resignation by the Hon. Court Administrator dated October 4, 2005, the one (1) whole year salary shall be deducted from whatever emoluments and benefits she will receive from the Hon.

She also claimed that, under the Omnibus Civil Service Rules Implementing Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, an employee may be allowed to go on&nbsp; leave of absence without pay for a period not exceeding one (1) year in addition to his/her vacation and/or sick leave earned.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Records show that the weekly rotating schedule of assignments of court stenographers was spread among three stenographers (respondent and complainants, Anita A. Cruz and Norma B. Lapid) during the first week of January 2002 and January 2003. Based on said schedule, the yearly distribution of workload of the three appears quite fair and equitable.&nbsp; Under court practice, each of the stenographers provides relief support to the stenographer on duty for the whole week, so that in event the latter fails to report on her scheduled week, the court proceedings would remain unhampered. Respondent claims that to make up for her absences, she usually took over the duty of the relieving stenographer upon her return for work, so as not to distort the pre-arranged work schedules.<br><br>As it were, respondent failed to substantiate her claim.&nbsp; She failed to prove that the other two stenographers did agree to the changes in schedule of assignments, as the two in fact vigorously pursued this complaint.<br><br>Compounding&nbsp; said&nbsp; neglect of duty is respondent's failure to transcribe the stenographic notes taken by her during court proceedings within the time specified in Administrative Circular No. 24-90,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which prescribes, thus:<br><blockquote>1. Clerks of Court and stenographers are enjoined to faithfully comply with Rule 136, Section 17, par. 1, Rules of Court, which is quoted hereunder:<br><blockquote>Section 17. Stenographers- It shall be the duty of the stenographer who has attended a session of Court either in the morning or in the&nbsp; afternoon, to deliver to the Clerk of Court, immediately at the close of such morning or in the afternoon session, all the notes he has taken, to be attached to the record of the case, and it shall likewise be the duty of the Clerk to demand that the stenographer comply with said duty. The Clerk of Court shall stamp the date on which notes are received by him. When such notes are transcribed, the transcript&nbsp; shall be delivered&nbsp; to the Clerk, duly initialed on each page thereof, to be attached to the records of the case.<br></blockquote>2. (a) All stenographer are required to transcribe all stenographic notes and to attach the transcripts to&nbsp; the record of the case not later than twenty (20) days from the time the notes are taken. xxx<br><br>(b) The stenographer concerned shall accomplish a verified monthly certification&nbsp; as to compliance with this duty.&nbsp; xxx<br><br>(c) With respect to untranscribed stenographic notes as of the date of the effectivity of this Circular&nbsp; all stenographers are directed to submit the transcript thereof not later than&nbsp; three (3) months from date of effectivity of this Circular.<br></blockquote>A clear violation by the respondent of the foregoing circular is evident from the two (2) orders issued by Presiding Judge Jocelyn A. Solis-Reyes in Criminal Case No. 98-1984 entitled <i>People v. Joselyn Posadas</i> and Criminal Case No. 01-1275 entitled <i>People v. Renato C. Mallari.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>In the first case, the scheduled hearing of May 17, 2004 was reset to another date because the stenographic notes taken by respondent during the trial held on November 12, 2003, or after six (6) months and four (4) days have passed, were not yet transcribed.&nbsp; The same is true with the other case where the trial, supposed to be held on April 26, 2004, was also reset because the stenographic notes taken during the trial held on January 26, 2004, that is, three months before said hearing were not yet transcribed.&nbsp; Respondent offered no explanation for her failure to comply with the said deadline.<br><br>As the Court now sees it, respondent was less than zealous in the performance of her official duties. Her delay and inefficiency in punctually transcribing the stenographic notes she took of court proceedings assigned to her definitely prejudiced public service and undermined the speedy and orderly administration of justice.<br><br>The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; will&nbsp; also not countenance respondent's repeated absences.&nbsp; The civil service law requires that an employee, whenever possible, must submit his/her application for leave in advance so as not to paralyze or hamper public service. Respondent's repeated absences violated this civil service requirement on the advance filing of applications for official leave.<br><br>Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 4, Series of 1991, of the Civil Service Commission (CSC), provides:<br><blockquote>An officer or employee in the civil service shall be considered habitually absent if he incurs unauthorized absences exceeding the allowable 2.5 days monthly leave credits under the leave law for at least three (3) months in a semester or at least three (3) consecutive months during the year.<br></blockquote>Under CSC MC No. 30, series of 1989, habitual absenteeism is classified as a grave offense. On the other hand, frequent unauthorized absences or tardiness in reporting for duty is, for the first offense, punishable with suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year, and with dismissal from the service for the second offense.<br><br>Given&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing yardsticks, respondent's absences can neither be classified as frequent nor habitual, for such&nbsp; absences were not in reality unauthorized as her applications for leave were eventually duly approved by the OAS-OCA. Be that as it may, Section II of Administrative Circular No. 2-99 entitled "<i>Strict Observance Of Working Hours And Disciplinary Action for Absenteeism And Tardiness</i>" lays down the degree of stringency which must be adopted in the determination of the proper sanctions to be imposed, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>II.&nbsp; Absenteeism and tardiness, even if such do not qualify as "habitual" or "frequent" under Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 04, Series of 1991, shall be dealt with <i>severely</i>, and any falsification of daily time records to cover up for such absenteeism and/or tardiness shall constitute gross dishonesty or serious misconduct. (italics ours)<br></blockquote>Respondent's repeated absences have, to be sure, undermined public service.&nbsp; Time and again, this Court has pronounced that any act which falls short of the exacting standards for public office, especially by those who are expected to preserve the good image of the judiciary, shall not be countenanced. Public office is a public trust. Public officers must at all time be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.<br><br>We note that this is not respondent's first offense for absenteeism and violation of SC circulars on submission of stenographic notes. As earlier recited, in Adm. Matter No. P-00-1368, respondent was found guilty of gross neglect of duty and habitual tardiness and suspended from office, apart from being ordered to submit within 6 months the transcript of stenographic notes in the eleven cases mentioned in the said case. The Order, however, came with a caveat that a repetition of the same or similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Given the above perspective, the dismissal of respondent is indicated. Considering,&nbsp; however, that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; had already resigned effective August 16, 2005,&nbsp; as per&nbsp; acceptance&nbsp; of resignation&nbsp; by&nbsp; the OCA dated October 4, 2005, dismissal could no longer be imposed; hence, the penalty of&nbsp; fine in the amount equivalent to her one (1) year salary, as recommended by the investigating judge, is hereby imposed.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCORDINGLY</span>, respondent AURORA T. LARANANG is found GUILTY on a second instance, of inefficiency, gross neglect of duty and for having incurred repeated absences.&nbsp; She is FINED in the amount equivalent to her one whole year salary, the same to be deducted from her retirement, leave and other benefits and only the balance thereof shall be released to her in due course.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Azcuna, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, p. 284.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Exhibit "B-1."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit "D."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Now Supreme Court Associate Justice.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Rollo, pp. 17-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 136.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Annex "5."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Annex "5-a."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Annex "5-b."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Annex "5-c."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Annex "5-d."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Annex "5-e."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Annex "5-f."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Annex "5-g."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Annex "7-a."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Annex "7-b-1."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Annex "7-c."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Annex "7-c-1."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Annex "7-c-2."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Annex "5-h."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Annex "7-d."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Annex "7-d-1."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Which took effect on August 1, 2002.</div>
