				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The propriety of filing and granting of a motion for a bill of particulars filed for the estate of a defaulting and deceased defendant is the main issue in this saga of the protracted legal battle between the Philippine government and the Marcoses on alleged ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>This special civil action for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assails two resolutions of the Sandiganbayan ("anti-graft court" or "court") issued during the preliminary legal skirmishes in this 20-year case:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (1) the January 31, 2000 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which granted the motion for a bill of particulars filed by executor Ferdinand R.

Aquino successively sued former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and former First Lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos (Mrs. Marcos), and their alleged cronies or dummies before the anti-graft court to recover the alleged ill-gotten wealth that they amassed during the former president's 20-year rule.&nbsp; Roman A. Cruz, Jr. (Cruz), then president and general manager of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS); president of the Philippine Airlines (PAL); chairman and president of the Hotel Enterprises of the Philippines, Inc., owner of Hyatt Regency Manila; chairman and president of Manila Hotel Corporation; and chairman of the Commercial Bank of Manila (CBM), is the alleged crony in this case.<br><br>On July 21, 1987, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution and damages alleging that Cruz and the Marcoses stole public assets and invested them in several institutions here and abroad.&nbsp; Specifically, Cruz allegedly purchased, in connivance with the Marcoses, assets whose values are disproportionate to their legal income, to wit:&nbsp; two residential lots and two condominiums in Baguio City; a residential building in Makati; a parcel of land and six condominium units in California, USA; and a residential land in Metro Manila.&nbsp; The PCGG also prayed for the payment of moral damages of P50 billion and exemplary damages of P1 billion.<br><br>On September 18, 1987, Cruz filed an Omnibus Motion to Dismiss, strike out averments in the complaint, and for a bill of particulars.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On April 18, 1988, the court ordered that alias summonses be served on the Marcoses who were then in exile in Hawaii.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; The court likewise admitted the PCGG's Expanded Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated April 25, 1988, then denied Cruz's omnibus motion on July 28, 1988 after finding that the expanded complaint sufficiently states causes of action and that the matters alleged are specific enough to allow Cruz to prepare a responsive pleading and for trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; On September 15, 1988, Cruz filed his answer <i>ad cautelam</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On November 10, 1988, the alias summonses on the Marcoses were served at 2338 Makiki Heights, Honolulu, Hawaii.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The Marcoses, however, failed to file an answer and were accordingly declared in default by the anti-graft court on April 6, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Imelda R.

Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this Court affirmed the resolution of the anti-graft court, ruling that Mrs. Marcos had a meritorious defense, and that failure of a party to properly respond to various complaints brought about by the occurrence of circumstances which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against, such as being barred from returning to the Philippines, numerous civil and criminal suits in the United States, deteriorating health of her husband, and the complexities of her legal battles, is considered as due to fraud, accident and excusable negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On September 6, 1995, Mrs. Marcos filed her answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> arguing that the former President Marcos' wealth is not ill-gotten and that the civil complaints and proceedings are void for denying them due process.&nbsp; She also questioned the legality of the PCGG's acts and asked for P20 billion moral and exemplary damages and P10 million attorney's fees.<br><br>On January 11, 1999, after pre-trial briefs had been filed by Cruz, the PCGG, and Mrs. Marcos, the court directed former President Marcos' children to appear before it or it will proceed with pre-trial and subsequent proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On March 16, 1999, respondent filed a Motion for Leave to File a Responsive Pleading as executor of his late father's estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The PCGG opposed the motion, citing as ground the absence of a motion to set aside the default order or any order lifting the default status of former President Marcos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 1999, the court granted respondent's motion:<br><blockquote> x x x x<br><br>The Court concedes the plausibility of the stance taken by the Solicitor General that the default Order binds the estate and the executor for they merely derived their right, if any, from the decedent.&nbsp; Considering however the complexities of this case, and so that the case as against the other defendants can proceed smoothly as the stage reached to date is only a continuation of the pre-trial proceedings, the Court, in the interest of justice and conformably with the discretion granted to it under Section 3 of Rule 9 of the Rules of Court hereby accords affirmative relief to the prayer sought in the motion.<br><br>Accordingly, Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.[,] as executor of the [estate of] deceased defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos[,] is granted a period of ten (10) days from receipt of this Resolution within which to submit his Responsive Pleading.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>Respondent asked for three extensions totaling 35 days to file an answer.&nbsp; The court granted the motions and gave him until July 17, 1999 to file an answer.&nbsp; But instead of filing an answer, respondent filed on July 16, 1999, a Motion For Bill of Particulars,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> praying for clearer statements of the allegations which he called "mere conclusions of law, too vague and general to enable defendants to intelligently answer."<br><br>The PCGG opposed the motion, arguing that the requested particulars were evidentiary matters; that the motion was dilatory; and that it contravened the May 28, 1999 Resolution granting respondent's Motion for Leave to File a Responsive Pleading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The anti-graft court, however, upheld respondent, explaining that the allegations against former President Marcos were vague, general, and were mere conclusions of law.&nbsp; It pointed out that the accusations did not specify the ultimate facts of former President Marcos' participation in Cruz's alleged accumulation of ill-gotten wealth, effectively preventing respondent from intelligently preparing an answer.&nbsp; It noted that this was not the first time the same issue was raised before it, and stressed that this Court had consistently ruled in favor of the motions for bills of particulars of the defendants in the other ill-gotten wealth cases involving the Marcoses.<br><br>The <i>fallo</i> of the assailed January 31, 2000 Resolution reads:<br><blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the defendant-movant's motion for bill of particulars is hereby GRANTED.<br><br>Accordingly, the plaintiff is hereby ordered to amend pars. 9 and Annex "A", 12 (a) to (e), and 19 in relation to par-3 of the PRAYER, of the Expanded Complaint, to allege the ultimate facts indicating the nature, manner, period and extent of participation of Ferdinand E. Marcos in the acts referred to therein, and the amount of damages to be proven during trial, respectively, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this resolution[.]<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>Not convinced by petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the court ruled in the assailed March 27, 2001 Resolution that the motion for a bill of particulars was not dilatory considering that the case was only at its pre-trial stage and that Section 1,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Rule 12 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure allows its filing.<br><br>In urging us to nullify now the subject resolutions, petitioner, through the PCGG, relies on two grounds: <blockquote> <center>I.<br></center><br>The motion for bill of particulars contravenes section 3, rule 9 of the 1997 rules [OF] civil procedure.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>The motion for bill of particulars is patently dilatory and bereft of any basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Invoking Section 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, petitioner argues that since the default order against former President Marcos has not been lifted by any court order, respondent cannot file a motion for a bill of particulars.&nbsp; Petitioner stresses that respondent did not file a motion to lift the default order as executor of his father's estate; thus, he and the estate cannot take part in the trial.<br><br>Petitioner also contends that respondent was granted leave to file an answer to the expanded complaint, not a motion for a bill of particulars.&nbsp; The anti-graft court should not have accepted the motion for a bill of particulars after he had filed a motion for leave to file responsive pleading and three successive motions for extension as the motion for a bill of particulars is dilatory.&nbsp; Petitioner insists that respondent impliedly admitted that the complaint sufficiently averred factual matters with definiteness to enable him to properly prepare a responsive pleading because he was able to prepare a draft answer, as stated in his second and third motions for extension.&nbsp; Petitioner adds that the factual matters in the expanded complaint are clear and sufficient as Mrs. Marcos and Cruz had already filed their respective answers.<br><br>Petitioner also argues that if the assailed Resolutions are enforced, the People will suffer irreparable damage because petitioner will be forced to prematurely divulge evidentiary matters, which is not a function of a bill of particulars.&nbsp; Petitioner maintains that paragraph 12, subparagraphs a to e,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the expanded complaint "illustrate the essential acts pertaining to the conspirational acts" between Cruz and former President Marcos.&nbsp; Petitioner argues that respondent erroneously took out of context the phrase "unlawful concert" from the rest of the averments in the complaint.<br><br>Respondent, for his part, counters that this Court had compelled petitioner in several ill-gotten wealth cases involving the same issues and parties to comply with the motions for bills of particulars filed by other defendants on the ground that most, if not all, of the allegations in the similarly worded complaints for the recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth consisted of mere conclusions of law and were too vague and general to enable the defendants to intelligently parry them.<br><br>Respondent adds that it is misleading for the Government to argue that the default order against his father stands because the May 28, 1999 Resolution effectively lifted it; otherwise, he would not have been called by the court to appear before it and allowed to file a responsive pleading.&nbsp; He stresses that the May 28, 1999 Resolution remains effective for all intents and purposes because petitioner did not file a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Respondent likewise denies that his motion for a bill of particulars is dilatory as it is petitioner's continued refusal to submit a bill of particulars which causes the delay and it is petitioner who is "hedging, flip-flopping and delaying in its prosecution" of Civil Case No. 0006.&nbsp; His draft answer turned out "not an intelligent" one due to the vagueness of the allegations.&nbsp; He claims that petitioner's actions only mean one thing: it has no specific information or evidence to show his father's participation in the acts of which petitioner complains.<br><br>In its Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> petitioner adds that the acts imputed to former President Marcos were acts that Cruz committed in conspiracy with the late dictator, and which Cruz could not have done without the participation of the latter.&nbsp; Petitioner further argues that conspiracies need not be established by direct evidence of the acts charged but by a number of indefinite acts, conditions and circumstances.<br><br>In a nutshell, the ultimate issue is:&nbsp; Did the court commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in granting respondent's motion for a bill of particulars as executor of former President Marcos' estates considering that the deceased defendant was then a defaulting defendant when the motion was filed?<br><br>We rule in the negative, and dismiss the instant petition for utter lack of merit.<br><br>Under the Rules of Court, a defending party may be declared in default, upon motion and notice, for failure to file an answer within the allowable period.&nbsp; As a result, the defaulting party cannot take part in the trial albeit he is entitled to notice of subsequent proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The remedies against a default order are:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; a motion to set aside the order of default at any time after discovery thereof and before judgment on the ground that the defendant's failure to file an answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable neglect and that the defendant has a meritorious defense; (2)&nbsp; a motion for new trial within 15 days from receipt of judgment by default, if judgment had already been rendered before the defendant discovered the default, but before said judgment has become final and executory; (3)&nbsp; an appeal within 15 days from receipt of judgment by default; (4)&nbsp; a petition for relief from judgment within 60 days from notice of judgment and within 6 months from entry thereof; and (5)&nbsp; a petition for certiorari in exceptional circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In this case, former President Marcos was declared in default for failure to file an answer.&nbsp; He died in Hawaii as an exile while this case was pending, since he and his family fled to Hawaii in February 1986 during a people-power revolt in Metro Manila.&nbsp; His representatives failed to file a motion to lift the order of default.&nbsp; Nevertheless, respondent, as executor of his father's estate, filed a motion for leave to file a responsive pleading, three motions for extensions to file an answer, and a motion for bill of particulars all of which were granted by the anti-graft court.<br><br>Given the existence of the default order then, what is the legal effect of the granting of the motions to file a responsive pleading and bill of particulars?&nbsp; In our view, the effect is that the default order against the former president is deemed lifted.<br><br>Considering that a motion for extension of time to plead is not a litigated motion but an <i>ex parte</i> one, the granting of which is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the court; that in some cases we have allowed defendants to file their answers even after the time fixed for their presentation; that we have set aside orders of default where defendants' failure to answer on time was excusable; that the pendency of the motion for a bill of particulars interrupts the period to file a responsive pleading; and considering that no real injury would result to the interests of petitioner with the granting of the motion for a bill of particulars, the three motions for extensions of time to file an answer, and the motion with leave to file a responsive pleading, the anti-graft court has validly clothed respondent with the authority to represent his deceased father.&nbsp; The only objection to the action of said court would be on a technicality.&nbsp; But on such flimsy foundation, it would be erroneous to sacrifice the substantial rights of a litigant.&nbsp; Rules of procedure should be liberally construed to promote their objective in assisting the parties obtain a just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>While it is true that there was no positive act on the part of the court to lift the default order because there was no motion nor order to that effect, the anti-graft court's act of granting respondent the opportunity to file a responsive pleading meant the lifting of the default order on terms the court deemed proper in the interest of justice.&nbsp; It was the operative act lifting the default order and thereby reinstating the position of the original defendant whom respondent is representing, founded on the court's discretionary power to set aside orders of default.<br><br>It is noteworthy that a motion to lift a default order requires no hearing; it need be under oath only and accompanied by an affidavit of merits showing a meritorious defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; And it can be filed "at any time after notice thereof and before judgment."&nbsp; Thus, the act of the court in entertaining the motions to file a responsive pleading during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings effectively meant that respondent has acquired a <i>locus standi </i>in this case.&nbsp; That he filed a motion for a bill of particulars instead of an answer does not pose an issue because he, as party defendant representing the estate, is allowed to do so under the Rules of Court to be able to file an intelligent answer. It follows that petitioner's filing of a bill of particulars in this case is merely a condition precedent to the filing of an answer.<br><br>Indeed, failure to file a motion to lift a default order is not procedurally fatal as a defaulted party can even avail of other remedies mentioned above.<br><br>As default judgments are frowned upon, we have been advising the courts below to be liberal in setting aside default orders to give both parties every chance to present their case fairly without resort to technicality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Judicial experience shows, however, that resort to motions for bills of particulars is sometimes intended for delay or, even if not so intended, actually result in delay since the reglementary period for filing a responsive pleading is suspended and the subsequent proceedings are likewise set back in the meantime.&nbsp; As understood under Section 1 of Rule 12, mentioned above, a motion for a bill of particulars must be filed within the reglementary period for the filing of a responsive pleading to the pleading sought to be clarified.&nbsp; This contemplates pleadings which are <i>required</i> by the Rules to be answered under pain of procedural sanctions, such as default or implied admission of the facts not responded to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>But as defaulted defendants are not actually thrown out of court because the Rules see to it that judgments against them must be in accordance with the law and competent evidence, this Court prefers that the lifting of default orders be effected before trial courts could receive plaintiffs' evidence and render judgments. This is so since judgments by default may result in considerable injustice to defendants, necessitating careful and liberal examination of the grounds in motions seeking to set them aside. The inconvenience and complications associated with rectifying resultant errors, if defendant justifies his omission to seasonably answer, far outweigh the gain in time and dispatch of immediately trying the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The fact that former President Marcos was in exile when he was declared in default, and that he later died still in exile, makes the belated filing of his answer in this case understandably excusable.<br><br>The anti-graft court required the Marcos siblings through its January 11, 1999 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> to substitute for their father without informing them that the latter was already declared in default.&nbsp; They were unaware, therefore, that they had to immediately tackle the matter of default.&nbsp; Respondent, who stands as the executor of their father's estate, could assume that everything was in order as far as his standing in court was concerned.&nbsp; That his motion for leave to file a responsive pleading was granted by the court gave him credible reason not to doubt the validity of his legal participation in this case.&nbsp; Coupled with his intent to file an answer, once his motion for a bill of particulars is sufficiently answered by petitioner, the circumstances abovementioned warrant the affirmation of the anti-graft court's actions now being assailed.<br><br>As to the propriety of the granting of the motion for a bill of particulars, we find for respondent as the allegations against former President Marcos appear obviously couched in general terms.&nbsp; They do not cite the ultimate facts to show how the Marcoses acted "in unlawful concert" with Cruz in illegally amassing assets, property and funds in amounts disproportionate to Cruz's lawful income, except that the former President Marcos was the president at the time.<br><br>The pertinent allegations in the expanded complaint subject of the motion for a bill of particulars read as follows: <blockquote><ol start="11"> <li>Defendant Roman A.

But they are just that, accusations by generalization.&nbsp; Motherhood statements they are, although now they might be a politically incorrect expression and an affront to mothers everywhere, although they best describe the accusations against the Marcoses in the case at bar.<br><br>In Justice Laurel's words, "the administration of justice is not a matter of guesswork."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; The name of the game is fair play, not foul play.&nbsp; We cannot allow a legal skirmish where, from the start, one of the protagonists enters the arena with one arm tied to his back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; We must stress anew that the administration of justice entails a painstaking, not haphazard, preparation of pleadings.<br><br>The facile verbosity with which the legal counsel for the government flaunted the accusation of excesses against the Marcoses in general terms must be soonest refurbished by a bill of particulars, so that respondent can properly prepare an intelligent responsive pleading and so that trial in this case will proceed as expeditiously as possible.&nbsp; To avoid a situation where its pleadings may be found defective, thereby amounting to a failure to state a cause of action, petitioner for its part must be given the opportunity to file a bill of particulars. Thus, we are hereby allowing it to supplement its pleadings now, considering that amendments to pleadings are favored and liberally allowed especially before trial.<br><br>Lastly, the allowance of the motion for a more definite statement rests with the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; As usual in matters of a discretionary nature, the ruling of the trial court will not be reversed unless there has been a palpable abuse of discretion or a clearly erroneous order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; This Court has been liberal in giving the lower courts the widest latitude of discretion in setting aside default orders justified under the right to due process principle.&nbsp; Plain justice demands and the law requires no less that defendants must know what the complaint against them is all about.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>What is important is that this case against the Marcoses and their alleged crony and dummy be decided by the anti-graft court on the merits, not merely on some procedural <i>faux pas</i>.&nbsp; In the interest of justice, we need to dispel the impression in the individual respondents' minds that they are being railroaded out of their rights and properties without due process of law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan in granting respondent's Motion for Bill of Particulars, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.&nbsp; The Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated January 31, 2000 and March 27, 2001 in Civil Case No. 0006 are <b>AFFIRMED</b>.&nbsp; Petitioner is ordered to prepare and file a bill of particulars containing the ultimate facts as prayed for by respondent within twenty (20) days from notice.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio Morales, Tinga, Velasco, Jr.</i>, and <i>Reyes,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup><i> JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> Additional member due to the inhibition of Associate Justice Antonio T.
