				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On complaint of AAA, accused-appellant Harold Wally Cabierte, together with Jerry Macabio (Macabio) and Norbert Viernes (Viernes), was charged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio with rape in an Information, the accusatory portion of which reads:<blockquote>That on or about the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of December 1997, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding one another, dragged the undersigned inside the tent, held my hands, spread my legs after stripping off my clothings with force, and then did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the undersigned, against my will and consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 15542-R.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Upon reinvestigation, the prosecution found that three crimes of rape were committed by appellant and his co-accused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> hence, two additional informations, docketed as Criminal Cases No. 15594-R and No. 15595-R, with wordings substantially similar to the first, were filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The prosecution's version of events that led to the filing of the cases is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>At around 11:00 p.m. of December 2, 1997, AAA  sneaked out of her house to meet her boyfriend.  As she approached the meeting place, she saw a bonfire, a makeshift tent, and five members of her <span style="font-style: italic;">barkada</span>, namely:  Noel Recario (Recario), Christopher Villasanta (Villasanta), and the three accused.  As she whistled to indicate her presence, Recario invited her to join them which she did.<br><br>AAA then asked where her boyfriend was.  Viernes told her to wait.  She thus conversed with the group who was engaged in drinking.<br><br>As the night wore on, appellant, Viernes, Macabio, and Villasanta entered the makeshift tent and teased each other by removing each other's pants.<br><br>In the meantime, while Viernes was inside the tent, he offered AAA a cigarette.  Responding, AAA approached the entrance of the tent and when she was about to get the cigarette, Viernes put it at his crotch.<br><br>AAA thus indicated that she would no longer get the cigarette, but Viernes waved it at her so she took it, went back to the bonfire, and smoked.<br><br>AAA later proceeded to the tent together with Recario.  Viernes soon got pushed towards AAA, hitting his nape with her cigarette.  Enraged, Viernes grabbed AAA, pulling her inside the tent, making her fall on her knees.<br><br>As AAA tried to stand, Viernes pushed her and pinned her down with his body (<span style="font-style: italic;">dinaganan</span>).  Appellant thereupon held AAA's hands as Macabio held her legs.  Viernes soon had sexual intercourse with AAA over her protests and despite her physical struggles.<br><br>After Viernes, appellant, followed by Macabio, had sexual intercourse with AAA also against her will and despite her physical struggles.<br><br>After the boys left the tent, AAA went home, arriving before 3:00 a.m. of December 3, 1997. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The following day, or on December 4, 1997, AAA's boyfriend who had gotten wind that she was "<span style="font-style: italic;">ginalaw ng tatlo</span>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> confronted her and urged her to tell her parents about what happened.

Explaining these injuries, the doctor declared:<blockquote>[ATTY. OPIANO]<br>Q:  What would have caused such a contusion on the forearm of the victim?<br>[DR. BANDONILL]<br>A:    It would have been caused by a hard blunt object hitting that area.<br><br>Q:  And the contusion on the knee, what could have caused this contusion?<br>A:    The contusion on the knee would also have been caused by a hard blunt object hitting that organ also.<br><br>Q:  And with these contusions what could be [these] blunt, hard       x x x objects that would have been applied on this part of the body of the victim?<br>A:    Well, it could be a piece of wood, it could also be a piece of stone, it could also be the fist.<br><br>Q:  We go to the abrasions that you referred to.  Please describe to us what these abrasions are?<br>A:    The first abrasion which is entered as abrasion multiple linear over an area 5 cms. x 3 cms. posterior trunk area, these are <span style="font-style: italic;">gasgas</span> or lines which are found at the lower back of the subject, ma'am.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:  And what would be the cause of this multiple linear abrasion on the back of the victim, Mr. Witness?<br>A:  It might have been caused by a hard rough surface coming to contact with the area.<br><br>Q:  What about the abrasions which you mentioned on the posterior left chest area of the victim?<br>A:  Again, ma'am, this abrasion which is found at the back of the left chest would have been caused by x x x coming into contact with a hard rough surface.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br></span><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x</div><br>Court: [Q:]  Now, let us go back to these contusions and abrasions you mentioned.  You mentioned awhile ago that this contusion could have been caused by a hard blunt instrument like a piece of wood or a stone.  Now, supposing no wood or stone was used on her, what could have caused these contusions?<br>A:    Possibly, Your Honor, it could have been the fist.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x</div><br>Q:  Because you mentioned these contusions were on the right forearm and left knee.  Now is it possible that these contusions can be sustained if somebody puts his hand or even his knees on top of your right forearm so you won't be able to struggle or you would be immobilized?<br>A:    That's possible, Your Honor, if it was done with pressure and it was done with heavy weight.<br><br>Q:  How about this <span style="font-style: italic;">gasgas</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">could it be possible that if you lay down on the ground which is a rough surface the friction at the back of the body could cause that gasgas or abrasion while you keep moving and struggling?</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:  That is highly possible, Your Honor.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:  Because of the rough surface on the ground?<br>A:  Yes, your Honor.<br><br></span><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x</div><br>[ATTY. OPIANA]:  I would like to follow up on the question of the contusion on the knee of the patient.  Where at the knee of the patient would that contusion be located?<br>A:    It's above the middle border of the knee.  That means, right at the center of the knee, ma'am.<br><br>Q:  What could have caused this aside from xxx a blunt object.  How would have been applied [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] on the knee?<br>A:    Well, as discussed earlier, ma'am, it could have also [been] by a heavy weight, a hard blunt object placed on that area with a heavy weight.<br><br>Q:  Would it also be possible that a fist was used over said knee?<br>A:    It's possible, ma'am.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">COURT [Q]:  How about the person trying to immobilize that girl by putting his entire body on the top of her and first his knee or his own legs is pressed on that portion of the body?<br>A:  That's also possible, Your Honor.<br><br>Q:  It can cause that contusion?<br>A:  It can cause that contusion, Your Honor</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>It cannot be gainsaid that the injuries found by Dr. Bandonill are compatible with the claim of AAA at the witness stand:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x</div><br>Q:  What did you do when [Viernes] pulled you inside madame witness?<br>A:  I was about to stand but he pushed me.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x</div><br>Q:  What happened after he pushed you?<br>A:    <span style="font-weight: bold;">When I fell down, he pinned me with his body.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">PROSECUTOR CENTENO:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">May we just quote the Tagalog word, "dinaganan."</span><br><br>ATTY.
