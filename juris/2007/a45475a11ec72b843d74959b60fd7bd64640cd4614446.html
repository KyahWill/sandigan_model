The tax court acknowledged that petitioner is legally entitled to a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate of its unutilized VAT input taxes on domestic purchases of goods and service attributable to its zero-rated sales. However, the export invoices adduced in evidence by petitioner could not be considered as competent evidence to prove its zero-rated sales of goods for VAT purposes and for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate because no BIR authority to print said invoices was indicated thereon. The CTA also observed that some of the invoices do not contain the Taxpayer's Identification Number-VAT (TIN-V) of petitioner as required in Section 113, in conjunction with Section 237, of the Tax Code.  The dispositive portion of the CTA decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, petitioner's claim for issuance of a tax credit certificate in the amount of P11,770,181.70 allegedly representing its VAT input taxes on domestic purchases of goods and services for the period April 1, 1998 to June 30, 1998 is hereby DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> alleging that it was able to prove its export sales by the following documentary evidence:<br><blockquote>(1) Certifications of inward remittances marked as Exhibits "O" and "P" for the Petitioner.<br><br>(2) Airway bills.<br><br>(3) Export declarations.<br><br>(4) Certifications of Mr. Eliseo Aurellado (Exhibit "Q" for the Petitioner), the independent CPA duly commissioned by this Honorable Court, to the effect that the petitioner made export sales for the period covered in the amount of Php2,538, 906,840.16.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner also alleged the following in its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration:<br><blockquote>The petitioner truly believes that although the invoicing requirements prescribed under Section 113 (A)(1), in relation to Section 237 of the 1997 Tax Code, should be applied strictly in the use of invoices or receipts for purposes of substantiating input VAT incurred, the same stringent application is not called for when the invoices or receipts are used for purposes of substantiating actual export sales.<br><br>While the invoices or receipts being used to substantiate claim for input VAT pertain to domestic sales, the invoices or receipts presented by the petitioner, and which were invalidated by this Honorable Court pertain to export sales. There should be a marked difference because in domestic sales, there results a corresponding input VAT which may be possibly claimed by the purchaser, whereas in export sales, such as those done by the petitioner, the purchaser incurs no input VAT which it may eventually claim. Thus, for purposes of substantiation in the claim for input VAT resulting from domestic sales the stern application of the mentioned invoicing requirements is naturally demanded. But for simple purposes of substantiating export sales, as in the case of petitioner, it should not be as exacting especially considering that the petitioner still has to substantiate its input VAT, which, this time, needs to hurdle the aforesaid invoicing requirements under the 1997 Tax Code.<br><br>Moreover, unlike in the substantiation of input VAT, which can only be done through the submission of domestic sales invoices, there are other documents to show the fact of export sales such as export declarations, inward remittances and airway bills. This gives more plausible reason why invoices or receipts being used to prove input VAT need to comply with the invoice requirements set forth under Section 113(A)(1), in relation to Section 237, of the 1997 Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner appended thereto a letter-authority dated April 17, 1997 signed by BIR Regional Director Sol Hubahib of Region No. 9 approving its request to use computerized sales invoices.<br><br>On September 1, 2003, the CTA denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner filed before the CA a petition for review of the tax court's decision. Petitioner averred that, under Sections 113(A)(1) and 237 of the 1997 Tax Code, the following information is required to be indicated in the invoice or receipt: (1) a statement that the seller is VAT-registered; (2) the seller's TIN; and (3) the name, business style, if any, and address of the purchaser, customer or client. However, petitioner averred, such requirements apply only to domestic or local sales, considering that the output tax (the input tax on the part of the local purchaser), may be claimed by the latter as a credit against its output VAT. Thus, according to petitioner, the invoices or receipts being issued by the local seller are required to indicate the information listed under the aforementioned provisions of the Tax Code so that the local purchaser would have a valid basis in its claim for the crediting of the input VAT. On the other hand, such requirements do not apply to its export sales, since no input VAT may be claimed thereon. Petitioner further pointed out that the transaction is subject to 0% rate; there is no input VAT to be claimed by its foreign purchaser; and the latter is not a VAT-registered entity in the Philippines. Considering that no refundable or creditable input VAT results from its export sales transactions, it should not be subjected to strict compliance with the invoicing requirements.<br><br>Petitioner also claimed that the absence of BIR authority to print its TIN-V in some of the invoices is not fatal to its claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate as to invalidate the documents used to prove its export sales. It declared that it used computerized accounting forms as sales invoices in its export sales based on the letter-authority dated April 17, 1997 of the BIR. It was only through plain mistake and inadvertence that the sales invoices it used had no authority to print. Such omission should not allegedly render the said sales invoices altogether invalid or inadmissible for purposes of substantiating petitioner's <i>actual</i> export sales covering the period April 1, 1998 to June 30, 1998. Petitioner opined that its failure to adduce in evidence the said letter-authority of the BIR was due to its honest belief that it had already adduced sufficient evidence to prove its actual export sales.<br><br>Petitioner submitted that while the CTA ruled that the invoices which did not indicate TIN-V were not sufficient proof of its export sales, this constituted only a small part of the hundreds of invoices it had submitted. These defective invoices, therefore, relate to a small chunk of the export sales it made for the covered period. If at all, the invalid invoices could only mean that only a small part of its claim was being disallowed, not the entire claim.<br><br>On August 12, 2004, the CA rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> affirming the CTA ruling. The CA ruled that while under Section 106(A)(2)(a)(1) of the Tax Code, VAT-registered entities are entitled to claim VAT refund on their input taxes if their export sales are zero-rated, the claim is nevertheless subject to the invoicing and accounting requirements of VAT-registered persons under Section 113 in relation to Section 237 of the Tax Code. It is therefore clear, the appellate court concluded, that what should be proven are not only the export sales but also compliance with the requirements under the aforesaid sections of the Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The CA further ruled that Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 7-95 requires VAT-registered persons to issue <i>duly registered</i> receipts, and enumerates the entries that should be contained in the said <i>duly registered</i> receipts. Section 237 of the Tax Code further mandates that persons required to issue receipts or invoices should register these documents with the BIR.  In fact, RR No. 2-90 restored the requirement to register and stamp receipts and invoices prior to their use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus, VAT-registered persons are directed to issue duly registered invoices for every sale or lease of goods, properties or services, containing the required information under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>According to the CA, since petitioner issued invoices with the BIR's authority to print, it must be concluded that these invoices were not registered as they did not comply with the invoicing requirements under Section 113, and the requirements for issuance of receipts or sales or commercial invoices under Section 237. The CA declared that an unregistered receipt could not be used as supporting document for input tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It further explained that Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 42-2003 already clarified that failure to comply with invoicing requirements would result in the disallowance of the claim for input tax by the purchaser-claimant.  Hence, the CA ruled, if the claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate is based on the taxpayer's zero-rated sales, but the invoicing requirements in the issuance of sales invoices are not complied with, the claim for tax credit/refund of VAT on its purchases shall be denied. This is because the invoices issued to its customers failed to depict that the taxpayer is VAT-registered and that its sales are classified as zero-rated. According to the appellate court, however, this treatment is without prejudice to the right of the taxpayer to charge the input taxes to the appropriate expense account or asset account subject to depreciation, whichever is applicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The CA further declared that petitioner failed to establish that its computer-generated sales invoices were duly stamped with the approval of the BIR as shown by the letter-authority dated April 17, 1997, considering that the said letter-authority was not presented during the trial of the case, much less attached to the petition filed before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The <i>fallo</i> of the CA decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant petition is DENIED.

Only the following items are required to be indicated in the receipts or invoices: (1) a statement that the seller is a VAT-registered entity followed by its TIN-V; (2) the total amount which the purchaser pays or is obligated to pay to the seller with the indication that such amount includes the value-added tax; (3) date of the transaction; (4) quantity of merchandise; (5) unit cost; (6) description of merchandise or nature of service; (7) the name, business style, if any, and address of the purchaser, customer or client in the case of sales, receipt or transfers in the amount of P100.00 or more, or regardless of the amount, where the sale or transfer is made by a person liable to VAT to another person also liable to VAT, or where the receipt is issued to cover payment made as rentals, commissions, compensations or fees; and (8) the TIN of the purchaser where the purchaser is a VAT-registered person.<br><br>It should be noted that petitioner is engaged in export sales, such that the purchasers of its goods are foreign entities, which are, logically, not VAT-registered in our country or liable to pay VAT in our jurisdiction.   Items (7) and (8) in the above enumeration do not, thus, apply to petitioner; that is, they need not be reflected or indicated in the invoices or receipts, given that it is an entity engaged in export sales, and the purchasers of its goods which are foreign entities are not VAT-registered in our country nor liable to pay VAT in our jurisdiction.<br><br>In any case, the above cited provisions of law and revenue regulations do <i>not</i> provide that failure to reflect or indicate in the invoices or receipts  the BIR authority to print, as well as the TIN-V, would result in the outright invalidation of these invoices or receipts. Neither is it provided therein that such omission or failure would result in the outright denial of a claim for tax credit/refund. Instead, Section 264 of the Tax Code imposes the penalty of  fine and imprisonment for, among others, invoices or receipts that do not truly reflect or contain all the required information, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 264. Failure or Refusal to Issue Receipts or Sales or Commercial Invoices, Violations Related to the Printing of such Receipts or Invoices or Other Violations.</b> —<br><br>(a) Any person who, being required under Section 237 to issue receipts or sales or commercial invoices, fails or refuses to issue such receipts or invoices, issues receipts or invoices that do not truly reflect and/or contain all the informations required to be shown therein or uses multiple or double receipts or invoices, shall, upon conviction for each act or omission, be punished by a fine of not less than One thousand pesos (P1,000) but not more than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than two (2) years but not more than four (4) years.<br><br>(b) Any person who commits any of the acts enumerated hereunder shall be penalized in the same manner and to the same extent as provided for in this Section:<br><blockquote>(1) Printing of receipts or sales or commercial invoices without authority from the Bureau of Internal Revenue; or<br><br>(2) Printing of double or multiple sets of invoices or receipts;<br><br>(3) Printing of unnumbered receipts or sales or commercial invoices, not bearing the name, business style, Taxpayer Identification Number, and business address of the person or entity.<br></blockquote></blockquote>The appellate court's reliance on RMC No. 42-2003 is misplaced.  The said Circular clarified, <i>inter alia</i>, that failure to comply with the invoicing requirements on the documents supporting the sale of goods and services would result in the disallowance of the claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate of creditable input taxes. The said Circular mentioned as an example the failure to state the TIN of the taxpayer in the invoice or receipt. However, in petitioner's case, the principal ground for the denial of its claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate is its failure to reflect or indicate in its invoices the BIR authority to print.  As earlier discussed, the BIR authority to print is not one of the items required by law to be reflected or indicated in the invoices or receipts. In any case, the said Circular was issued on July 15, 2003 by then Commissioner Guillermo L. Parayno, Jr., while petitioner's claim was filed on May 18, 1999. Hence, RMC No. 42-2003 cannot be applied retroactively because to do so would be prejudicial to petitioner. In a long line of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court has affirmed that the rulings, circulars, rules and regulations promulgated by the Commissioner on Internal Revenue would have no retroactive application if to so apply them would be prejudicial to the taxpayers.<br><br>It bears reiterating that while the pertinent provisions of the Tax Code and the rules and regulations implementing them require entities engaged in business to secure a BIR authority to print invoices or receipts and to issue duly registered invoices or receipts, it is not specifically required that the BIR authority to print be reflected or indicated therein. Indeed, what is important with respect to the BIR authority to print is that it has been secured or obtained by the taxpayer, and that invoices or receipts are duly registered.<br><br>To stress, petitioner, as a VAT-registered entity, is engaged in export sales of advanced and large-scale ICs and, as such, under Section 106 (A)(2)(a)(1) of the Tax Code, its sales or transactions are subject to VAT at 0% rate. Further, subject to the requirements stated in Section 112(A), it is entitled to claim refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for input VAT taxes attributable to its export sales. As the Court had the occasion to explain since no output VAT was imposed on the zero-rated export sales, what the government reimburses or refunds to the claimant is the input VAT paid — thus, the necessity for the <i>input VAT paid</i> to be substantiated by purchase invoices or official receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> These sales invoices or receipts issued by the supplier are necessary to substantiate the actual amount or quality of goods sold and their selling price, and, taken collectively, are the best means to prove the input VAT payments of the claimant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate attributable to zero-rated sales, what is to be closely scrutinized is the documentary substantiation of the input VAT paid, as may be proven by other export documents, rather than the supporting documents for the zero-rated export sales. And since petitioner has established by sufficient evidence that it is entitled to a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 106 (A)(2)(a)(1) and 112(A) of the Tax Code, then its claim should not be denied, notwithstanding its failure to state on the invoices the BIR authority to print and the TIN-V.  Worthy of mentioning again is the fact that even the CTA and the CA have found petitioner to be legally entitled to a claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate of its unutilized VAT input taxes on domestic purchases of goods and services attributable to its zero-rated sales.<br><br>What applies to petitioner, as a PEZA-registered export enterprise, is the Court's pronouncement that leniency in the implementation of the VAT is an imperative, precisely to spur economic growth in the country and attain global competitiveness as envisioned in our laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The incentives offered to PEZA enterprises, among which are tax exemptions and tax credits, ultimately redound to the benefit of the national economy, enticing as they do more enterprises to invest and do business within the zones, thus creating more employment opportunities and infusing more dynamism to the vibrant interplay of market forces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Even as the Court now holds that petitioner is legally entitled to a refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate of its unutilized VAT input taxes on domestic purchases of goods and services attributable to its zero-rated sales, the case shall nevertheless be remanded to the CTA for proper determination and computation of petitioner's tax credit/refund, considering that in the Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of the independent auditor, Eliseo Aurellado, only the amount of P9,688,809.00 was deemed as petitioner's valid claim for tax credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> According to Aurellado, the difference of P2,081,372.32 from petitioner's input VAT claim of P11,770,181.70 was not supported by sufficient documentary proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>  The Court, not being a trier of facts, cannot certainly decide this factual circumstance.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.
