CR No. 20531 which affirmed the January 16, 1997 decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 171, Valenzuela,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Metro Manila in Criminal Case No. 5302-V-96.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petitioner Clement John Ferdinand M. Navarrete was charged with the crime of statutory rape of BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> under the following information: <br><blockquote>That on or about October 30, 1995 in Valenzuela, Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there [willfully], unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one [BBB], age[d] 5 years old.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The facts show that BBB, who was at that time five years old, and petitioner were neighbors, their houses being adjacent to each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; On October 30, 1995, at around past 9:00 in the evening, BBB went to petitioner’s house to watch television, which was something she often did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Only petitioner and BBB were there that night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; BBB testified that it was on this occasion that petitioner sexually abused her, “placed his penis [in her] vagina” twice, poked her vagina with a “stick with cotton”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and boxed her on the right side of her eye.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Then, petitioner brought her to the comfort room and pointed a knife to her throat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Afterwards, she and petitioner watched a pornographic movie<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AAA, BBB’s mother, testified that around 10:30 p.m., BBB went out of petitioner’s house. While trembling and crying, BBB embraced her mother and told her that <i>“Kuya Ferdie sinundot ako.”</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next day, on October 31, 1995, Dr. Noel Minay, medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation, examined BBB. He found that her maidenhead was short, intact and had a narrow opening at 0.3 cm. in diameter.&nbsp; He concluded that these findings precluded complete penetration by an average-sized Filipino male organ in full erection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Testifying in his own behalf, petitioner denied the accusation against him and claimed that AAA merely concocted the charge against him.&nbsp; He alleged that she had ill feelings against his mother who she thought had something to do with the separation of her (AAA’s) son from the Philippine Postal Corporation. He also posited that she resented the Navarretes’ refusal to allow her to place a “jumper” on their electrical connection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In a decision dated January 16, 1997, the RTC absolved petitioner of statutory rape as there was no clear and positive proof of the entry of petitioner’s penis into the labia of the victim’s vagina. However, it convicted petitioner for acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act):<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, [petitioner] Clement John Ferdinand Navarrete is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate imprisonment of TWELVE (12) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of RECLUSION TEMPORAL, as minimum to [SIXTEEN] (16) YEARS of RECLUSION TEMPORAL, as maximum with the accessory penalties prescribed by the law and to pay the costs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The accused is hereby ordered to indemnify the victim the amount of P20,000.00 as moral damages and the amount of P10,000.00 pursuant to Section 31 of the [Act].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>On appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC.&nbsp; Thus, this petition.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petitioner asserts that he cannot be convicted of acts of lasciviousness in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610, a crime not specifically alleged in the information which charged him with statutory rape. Otherwise, his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him would be violated. He likewise contends that his guilt for the said offense was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no merit in the petition.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Constitution mandates that the accused, in all criminal prosecutions, shall enjoy the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> From this fundamental precept proceeds the rule that the accused may be convicted only of the crime with which he is charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>An exception to this rule is the rule on variance in Section 4, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote>Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof. — When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information, and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in that which is proved.</blockquote>Petitioner was found guilty of violating Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sec. 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br><br>The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:<br><br><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx<br></div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse: Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, [or] the [RPC], for rape or lascivious conduct as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period.</blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this provision, when the victim is under 12 years old, the accused shall be prosecuted under either Article 335 (for rape) or Article 336 (for acts of lasciviousness) of the RPC.&nbsp; Accordingly, although an accused is charged in the information with the crime of statutory rape (<i>i.e.,</i> carnal knowledge of a woman under twelve years of age<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>), the offender can be convicted of the lesser crime of acts of lasciviousness, which is included in rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The case of <i>People v. Bon</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> is squarely in point. In that case, the accused was charged with the rape of a six-year old girl. The Court ruled that rape was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. We, however, held that the accused was “liable for the crime of acts of lasciviousness, as defined and penalized under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to RA 7610”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> since all the elements of this offense were established.&nbsp; Petitioner cannot therefore successfully argue that his constitutionally protected right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him was violated when he was found guilty under Section 5 of RA 7610.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petitioner next contends that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; We disagree.<br><br>In <i>Amployo v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> we declared that pursuant to Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, before an accused can be convicted of child abuse through lascivious conduct on a minor below 12 years of age, the requisites for acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC must be met in addition to the requisites for sexual abuse under Section 5 of RA 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>The elements of the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC are the following:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; The offender commits any <span style="font-weight: bold;">act of lasciviousness or lewdness</span>;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; It is done under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>a. By using force or intimidation; or<br><br>b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or<br><br>c.&nbsp; When the offended party is <span style="font-weight: bold;">under 12 years of age</span>; and<br></blockquote>(3)&nbsp; The offended party is another person of either sex. (emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The general rule is that the factual findings of the trial court deserve a high degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any clear showing that it overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which can alter the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; We uphold the findings of fact of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The RTC and CA did not find evidence of the entrance of petitioner’s penis into the labia of the victim’s female organ.&nbsp; Nevertheless, BBB’s testimony established that petitioner committed lascivious acts on her:<br><blockquote>BY ATTY.

The prosecution established that petitioner intentionally “placed his penis” in BBB’s vagina but without any indication that he was able to penetrate her:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<blockquote>Victim [BBB] testified that the accused “placed his penis into my vagina” and “[placed] a stick with cotton [in] my vagina” but the [specific] part of her vagina where the penis was placed was not indicated.<br><br><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Court cannot [assume] without doing violence to the precious jural yardstick but the prosecution must prove and present clear, positive and conclusive evidence of the act complained of particularly that the penis of the accused gained entrance [in] the labia majora of the organ of the victim.&nbsp; Not even in the medical findings and testimony of the NBI Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Noel Minay who conducted physical/genital examinations on the victim could [we] find support to justify an inference that there was entrance of the male organ of the accused within the labia of pudendum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Both lower courts also found that petitioner poked victim’s vagina with a stick with cotton and watched a pornographic movie with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> These acts are undoubtedly acts of lasciviousness or lewdness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The elements of sexual abuse under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610 that must be proven in addition to the elements of acts of lasciviousness are as follows:<br><ol><li>The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or <b>lascivious conduct.</b><br><br></li><li>The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or <b>subjected to other sexual abuse.</b><br><br></li><li>The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></li></ol><blockquote>“Lascivious conduct” is defined under Section 2 (h) of the rules and regulations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of RA 7610 as:<br><br>[T]he intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person.<br></blockquote>The aforestated acts of petitioner undeniably amounted to lascivious conduct under this law.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petitioner insists that Section 5 (b) of RA 7610 refers only to those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution and argues that this does not apply in this case since the victim is not a child exploited in prostitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petitioner’s argument is untenable.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Larin</i> (and reiterated in several subsequent cases),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we emphasized that the law covers not only a situation in which a child is abused for profit but also one in which a child, through coercion or intimidation, engages in any lascivious conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The very title of Section 5, Article III (Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse) of RA 7610 shows that it applies not only to a child subjected to prostitution but also to a child subjected to other sexual abuse.&nbsp; A child is deemed subjected to “other sexual abuse” when he or she indulges in lascivious conduct under the coercion or influence of any adult.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Here, BBB was sexually abused because she was coerced or intimidated by petitioner (who poked her neck with a knife)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> to indulge in lascivious conduct.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner committed acts of sexual abuse against BBB. The RTC found BBB’s testimony to be clear, candid, and straightforward. Her testimony was worthy of belief since she was young and had no ill-motive to falsely testify and impute a serious crime against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; In cases of acts of lasciviousness, the lone testimony of the offended party, if credible, is sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, courts are inclined to lend credence to the testimony of children of tender years. The revelation of an innocent child whose chastity has been abused deserves full credit, as her willingness to undergo the trouble and the humiliation of a public trial is an eloquent testament to the truth of her complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; In so testifying, she could have only been impelled to tell the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The trial court’s evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses is given great respect by the appellate court in the absence of proof that it was arrived at arbitrarily or that the trial court overlooked material facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; The rationale behind this rule is that the credibility of a witness can best be determined by the trial court since it has the direct opportunity to observe the candor and demeanor of the witnesses at the witness stand and detect if they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; We will not interfere with the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the face of the serious accusation against him, petitioner could only interpose denial as defense. Denial is an inherently weak defense and cannot prevail over the positive and categorical identification provided by the complainant. Denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is a self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As between the positive declaration of the prosecution witness and the negative statement of the accused, the former deserves more credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The lower courts also correctly disbelieved the corroborating testimonies of petitioner’s aunt and sister.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petitioner asserts that the RTC should not have given evidentiary weight to the inconsistent and contradictory testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; He urges this Court to apply the Latin maxim falsus in unus, falsus in omnibus (false in part, false in everything).<br><blockquote>We disagree.&nbsp; We have stated that:<br><br>[T]he maxim or rule <i>“falsus in [unus], falsus in omnibus”</i> does not lay down a categorical test of credibility.&nbsp; It is not a positive rule of law or of universal application. It should not be applied to portions of the testimony corroborated by other evidence, particularly where the false portions could be innocent mistakes. Moreover, the rule is not mandatory but merely sanctions a disregard of the testimony of a witness if the circumstances so warrant. To completely disregard all the testimony of a witness on this ground, his testimony must have been false as to a material point, and the witness must have a conscious and deliberate intention to falsify a material point.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that even the most candid witness oftentimes makes mistakes and confused statements. Instead of eroding the effectiveness of the evidence, such imperfections and discrepancies in the testimony can in fact be considered as signs of veracity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Aside from the fact that it is very difficult to give a mechanical and accurate account of a traumatic and horrifying experience,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the victim here was a mere five-year old girl when she was put on the witness stand. We should not expect a five-year old child to explain with exact precision the nature of the acts done to her, given her naiveté and still undeveloped vocabulary and command of language.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Despite this limitation, however, the victim never wavered in her claim that petitioner molested her.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In sum, we find petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby <b>DENIED.</b>&nbsp; The September 29, 2000 decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela, Branch 171, in Criminal Case No. 5302-V-96 finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of acts of lasciviousness and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment of twelve years and one day of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to sixteen years of reclusion temporal, as maximum, as well as to pay P20,000 moral damages and P10,000 fine is <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Costs against petitioner.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno C.J., (Chairperson), Sandoval-Guitierrez, Azcuna, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Ramon Mabutas, Jr. (now retired) and concurred in by Associate Justices Roberto A.
