Imperial owned five parcels of land<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with a total area of 156.1000 hectares, located in Barangay Pawa, Manito, Albay. Pursuant to the Land Reform Program under Presidential Decree No. 27<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and Executive Order No. 228,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) placed these lands under its Operation Land Transfer (OLT). On October 21, 1972, the lands were distributed to deserving farmer beneficiaries.<br><br>On July 20, 1994, Imperial filed a complaint for determination and payment of just compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines, the DAR, and the farmer beneficiaries. &nbsp;The case was docketed as Agrarian Case No. 94-01 and raffled to the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 3, as Special Agrarian Court.<br><br>During the course of the trial, the court created a commission to examine, investigate and ascertain facts relevant to the dispute including the lands' valuation. &nbsp;On June 21, 1996, the commission submitted a report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> containing the following findings: (1) the lands were not first-class riceland; (2) the irrigation came from a creek which depended on rains; (3) the harvest was once a year; (4) about fifteen hectares were devoted to non-fruit bearing coconut trees; (5) approximately five hectares were upland rice while the rest of the area was uncultivated; and (6) the lands were rolling hills. &nbsp;Using the formula under P.D.

Finding partly in favor of Imperial, the appellate court, in a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated November 23, 2001, set aside the trial court's decision, decreeing thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>. The records of this case are ordered <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> to the court of origin for reevaluation of the correct compensation for the land, including the portions identified as feeder road, right of way and barrio site, but excluding the portion or portions retained by the plaintiff as owner-cultivator, with legal interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum reckoned from the date of the compensable taking on October 21, 1972.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated March 21, 2003, the appellate court denied reconsideration. &nbsp;Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>The petitioner now assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">A.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN INCLUDING THE INTEREST OF 6% PER ANNUM IN THE CONCEPT OF DAMAGES IN COMPUTING THE JUST COMPENSATION FOR THE EXPROPRIATED PROPERTIES UNDER P.D.

No. 13 applies to all landowners: (1) whose lands are actually tenanted as of October 21, 1972, or thereafter, and covered by the OLT; (2) who opted for government-financing through the petitioner as the mode of compensation; and (3) who have not yet been paid the value of their land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> &nbsp;It provides a formula for determining the land value and the additional interests it would have earned, to wit:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">For palay:&nbsp;</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">LV = (2.5 x AGP x GSP) x (1.06)n</span><br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">where LV =&nbsp; Land Value<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; AGP&nbsp; =&nbsp; Average Gross Production<br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; GSP =&nbsp; Government Support Price (P35/cavan in 1972)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; Number of years from the date of tenancy up to the effectivity date of the Order<br></div><br>Furthermore, DAR A.O.

No. 13, as amended. &nbsp;Thus, we return to the guidelines provided under P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 since the same remained operative despite the passage of Republic Act No. 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> &nbsp;On this score, E.O. No. 229,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which provides for the mechanism of Rep. Act No. 6657, specifically states: "(P)residential Decree No. 27, as amended, shall continue to operate with respect to rice and corn lands, covered thereunder. ...."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> &nbsp;However, since just compensation embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also its payment within a reasonable time from the taking of the land,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we think that the appellate court correctly imposed an interest in the nature of damages for the delay. &nbsp;In line with current jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> we set the legal interest at 12% per annum. &nbsp;To this extent, we agree that we should modify the appellate court's ruling.<br><br>Now, concerning the second principal issue.<br><br>On the compensability of the areas used as feeder road, right of way, and barrio site, the petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals erred in including them in the computation since they are not devoted to or suitable for agriculture in contemplation of Rep. Act No. 6657 and the title to these areas remained with the respondent.<br><br>We must stress, at this juncture, that the taking of private lands under the agrarian reform program partakes of the nature of an expropriation proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> &nbsp;In a number of cases, we have stated that just compensation in expropriation proceedings represents the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator.&nbsp; The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss. &nbsp;To compensate is to render something which is equal in value to that taken or received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In this case, we are not unaware that the areas used as feeder road, right of way, and barrio site, effectively deprived respondent of the ordinary and beneficial use of his property or of its value. &nbsp;Although such areas were not strictly used for agricultural purposes, the same were diverted to public use. &nbsp;For this reason, we are of the view that respondent should be compensated for what he actually lost and that should include not only the areas distributed directly to the tenant beneficiaries but also those areas used as feeder road, right of way, and barrio site, which were undoubtedly diverted to the use of the public.&nbsp; The only area that ought to be excluded is the portion or portions retained by the respondent as owner-cultivator for his own use.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the instant petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED </span>for lack of merit. &nbsp;The assailed Decision dated November 23, 2001, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 68980 which set aside the Decision dated August 4, 2000, of the Regional Trial Court of Legazpi City, Branch 3, acting as a Special Agrarian Court in Agrarian Case No. 94-01, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION.</span><br><br>Let the records of this case be immediately <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> to the trial court for recomputation of the correct just compensation for the lands taken, including the portions identified as feeder road, right of way, and barrio site, but excluding the portion or portions retained by respondent as owner-cultivator. &nbsp;The trial court is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTED </span>to use the formula prescribed by DAR A.O.
