				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In &nbsp;this &nbsp;petition &nbsp;for &nbsp;review &nbsp;on &nbsp;certiorari &nbsp;under &nbsp;Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) seeks the annulment and setting aside of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 14, 2005 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in <span style="font-style: italic;">CA-G.R. CV No. 53576</span>, as reiterated in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of December 2, 2005 which denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration. The assailed decision modified that of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tanay, Rizal, Branch 80, by increasing the amount of just compensation due the respondents in an expropriation case filed against them by the petitioner.<br><br>The facts:<br><br>Herein respondents Aurellano, Lourdes and Nestor, all surnamed Tiangco, are the owners of a parcel of land with an area of 152,187 square meters at Barangay Sampaloc, Tanay, Rizal and registered in their names under TCT No. M-17865 of the Registry of Deeds of Rizal.<br><br>On &nbsp;the &nbsp;other &nbsp;hand, &nbsp;petitioner &nbsp;NPC is &nbsp;a &nbsp;government-owned &nbsp;and &nbsp;controlled corporation created for the purpose of undertaking the development and generation of power from whatever source. NPC's charter (Republic Act No. 6395) authorizes the corporation to acquire private property and exercise the right of eminent domain.<br><br>NPC requires 19,423 square meters of the respondents' aforementioned property, across which its <span style="font-style: italic;">500Kv Kalayaan-San Jose Transmission Line Project</span> will traverse. NPC's <span style="font-style: italic;">Segregation Plan</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for the purpose shows that the desired right-of-way will cut through the respondents'&nbsp; land, &nbsp;in &nbsp;such &nbsp;a &nbsp;manner that 33,392 square meters thereof will &nbsp;be &nbsp;left &nbsp;separated from 99,372 square meters of the property. Within the &nbsp;portion &nbsp;sought &nbsp;to be expropriated stand fruit-bearing tress, such as &nbsp;mango, avocado, jackfruit, <span style="font-style: italic;">casuy, santol, calamansi, sintones</span> and coconut trees.<br><br>On &nbsp;November 20, 1990, &nbsp;after repeated unsuccessful negotiations with &nbsp;the &nbsp;respondents, &nbsp;NPC &nbsp;filed with the RTC of Tanay, Rizal a complaint for expropriation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against them. In time, the respondents filed their answer.<br><br>On March 14, 1991, the trial court issued a Condemnation Order, granting NPC the right to take possession of the area sought to be expropriated. In the same Order, the court directed the parties to nominate their respective commissioners, with a third member to be nominated and appointed by the court itself, to determine the proper amount of just compensation to be paid to the respondents. As constituted in the manner thus indicated, the board of commissioners was composed of the following: for NPC, Atty. Restituto Mallo of its Legal Department; for the respondents, Mr. Basilio Afuang, a geodetic engineer and a real estate broker by profession; and for the court, Clerk of Court V Ms. Amelia de Guzman Carbonell.<br><br>On April 5, 1991, the trial court issued an order directing NPC to pay and deposit with the Rizal Provincial Treasurer the amount of P81,204.00, &nbsp;representing the temporary provisional value of the area&nbsp; subject of the expropriation prior to the taking of possession thereof. On April 22, 1991, with NPC having complied with the deposit requirement, a writ of possession was issued in its favor.<br><br>Thereafter, an ocular inspection of the premises was conducted and hearings before the board of commissioners were held, during which the Municipal &nbsp;Assessor of Tanay, Rizal was presented. He submitted a record of the Schedule of Values for taxation purposes and a certification to the effect that the unit value of the respondents' property is P21,000.00 per hectare.<br><br>On August 7, 1993, commissioner Basilio Afuang for the respondents filed his report. He pegged the price of the area sought to be expropriated at P30.00 per square meter or P582,690.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in the aggregate; and for the improvements thereon, Afuang placed a valuation of P2,093,950.00. The figures are in contrast with the respondents' own valuation of P600,600.00, for the area, and &nbsp;P4,935,500.00, for the improvements.<br><br>On September 14, 1993, NPC filed an amended complaint to acquire only 19,423 square meters of the respondents' property. The original area of 20,220 square meters initially sought to be expropriated under the original complaint turned out to be in excess of the area required.<br><br>For its part, NPC made it clear that it is interested only in acquiring an easement of right-of-way over the respondents' property and that ownership of the area over which the right-of-way will be established shall remain with the respondents. For this reason, NPC claims that it should pay, in addition to the agreed or adjudged value of the improvements on the area, <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> an easement fee in an amount equivalent to ten <span style="font-style: italic;">per cent</span> (10%) of the market value of the property as declared by the respondents or by the Municipal Assessor, whichever &nbsp;is &nbsp;lower, &nbsp;as &nbsp;provided for under Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 6395, &nbsp;as &nbsp;amended &nbsp;by &nbsp;Presidential &nbsp;Decree &nbsp;938.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The court-appointed &nbsp;commissioner, &nbsp;Ms. &nbsp;Amelia &nbsp;de &nbsp;Guzman &nbsp;Carbonell, found that the risk and dangerous nature of the transmission line project essentially deprive the respondents of the &nbsp;use of the area. Nonetheless, she recommended that the determination of just compensation should be relegated to "expert appraisers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>From the evidence before it, the trial court made a determination that the market value of the property is P2.09 per square meter, or P40,594.07 for the entire 19,423 square meters needed by NPC, and not the P30.00 per square meter claimed by the respondents. Neither did the trial court consider NPC's reliance on Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 6395, as amended by Presidential Decree 938, the court placing more weight on the respondents' argument &nbsp;that expropriation would result in the substantial impairment of the &nbsp;use &nbsp;of the area needed, even though what is sought is a mere aerial right-of-way. The court found as reasonable the amount of P324,750.00 offered by NPC for the improvements, as the same is based on the official current schedule of values as determined by the Municipal Assessor of Tanay, Rizal.<br><br>Hence, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of February 19, 1996, the trial court rendered &nbsp;judgment as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><ol><li>Expropriating in favor of [NPC] a parcel of land covering a total area of 19,423 sq.m. covered by TCT No. M-17860 owned by the [respondents];<br><br></li><li>Ordering the amount of P40,594.07 as just compensation for the 19,423 square meters of land affected by the expropriations; and the amount of P324,750.00 as reasonable compensation for the improvements on the land expropriated with legal interest from the time of possession by the plaintiff. No pronouncement as to costs.</li></ol>SO ORDERED. (Words in brackets supplied.)</blockquote>The respondents moved for reconsideration, presenting for the first time a document entitled "Bureau of Internal Revenue Circular of Appraisal," which shows that for the year 1985, lands in Barangay Sampaloc were valued at P30.00 per square meter; for the year 1992, at P80.00 per square meter; and for year 1994, at &nbsp;P100.00 per square meter. Respondents maintain that the price of P30.00 per square meter for the needed area of 19,423 square meters is the reasonable amount and should be the basis for fixing the amount of just compensation due them. The trial court denied the motion, stating that the BIR circular in question was belatedly filed and therefore NPC could not have opposed its presentation.<br><br>From the aforesaid decision of the trial court, both NPC and the respondents went on appeal to the CA whereat the separate appeals were consolidated and docketed as <span style="font-style: italic;">CA-G.R. CV No. 53576</span>. The appellate court found merit in the respondents' appeal, and disregarded the P2.09 per square meter valuation of the trial court, which was based on a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1984</span> tax declaration. Instead, the CA placed reliance upon a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1993</span> tax declaration, "being only two years removed from the time of taking."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The appellate court determined the time of taking to be in 1991. Thus, the greater value of P913,122.00 as declared in Tax Declaration No. 011-2667 dated July 23, 1993 should be the basis for determining just compensation. With regard to the value of improvements, the appellate court found NPC's valuation more favorable, being based on the current (1991) schedule of values for trees in the provinces of Rizal and Laguna. &nbsp;Hence, in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of March 14, 2005, the CA rendered judgment, to wit:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant Appeal is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Tanay, Rizal, Branch 80 dated February 19, 1996 is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">MODIFIED</span> and the compensation awarded for the 19,423 square meters of land affected is increased to P116,538.00, and the reasonable compensation for the improvements thereon is likewise increased to P325,025.00, with legal interest from the time of possession by the plaintiff-appellee NAPOCOR. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>NPC moved for reconsideration, but its motion was denied by the appellate court in its resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of December 2, 2005.<br><br>Hence, NPC's instant petition for review, submitting for our resolution only the following issues with respect to the <span style="font-style: italic;">amount of just</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">compensation</span> that must be paid the respondents for the expropriated portion (19,423 square meters) of their property:<br style="font-weight: bold;"><blockquote style="font-weight: bold;"><ol><li>Is it to be based on the 1984 or the 1993 valuation?<br><br></li><li>Should NPC pay for the value of the land being taken, or should it be limited to what is provided for under P.D. 938, that is, ten per cent (10%) of its market value as declared by the owner or the assessor (whichever is lower), considering that the purpose for which the property is being taken is merely for the establishment of a safe and free passage for its overhead transmission lines?</li></ol></blockquote>There is no issue as to the improvements. Since the P325,025.00 valuation therefor is the very price set by the NPC commissioner, to which the corporation did not object but otherwise adopts, the Court fixes the amount of P325,025.00 as just compensation for the improvements.<br><br>We now come to the more weighty question of what amount is just by way of compensation for the 19,423 square-meter portion of the respondents' property.<br><br>In eminent domain cases, the time of taking is the filing of the complaint, if there was no actual taking prior thereto. Hence, in this case, the value of the property at the time of the filing of the complaint on November 20, 1990 should be considered in determining the just compensation due the respondents. So it is that in <span style="font-style: italic;">National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> we ruled:<br><blockquote>Normally, the time of the taking coincides with the filing of the complaint for expropriation. Hence, many rulings of this Court have equated just compensation with the value of the property as of the time of filing of the complaint consistent with the above provision of the Rules. So too, where the institution of the action precedes entry into the property, the just compensation is to be ascertained as of the time of the filing of the complaint.</blockquote>The trial court fixed the value of the property at its <span style="font-weight: bold;">1984</span> value, while the CA, at its <span style="font-weight: bold;">1993</span> worth. Neither of the two determinations is correct. For purposes of just compensation, the respondents should be paid the value of the property as of the time of the filing of the complaint which is deemed to be the time of taking the property.<br><br>It was certainly unfair for the trial court to have considered a property value several years behind its worth at the time the complaint in this case was filed on November 20, 1990. The landowners are necessarily shortchanged, considering that, as a rule, land values enjoy steady upward movement. It was likewise erroneous for the appellate court to have fixed the value of the property on the basis of a 1993 assessment. NPC would be paying too much. Petitioner corporation is correct in arguing that the respondents should not profit from an assessment made years after the taking.<br><br>The expropriation proceedings in this case having been initiated by NPC on November 20, 1990, property values on such month and year should lay the basis for the proper determination of just compensation. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court ruled that the equivalent to be rendered for the property to be taken shall be substantial, full, ample and, as must apply to this case, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">real</span>. This must be taken to mean, among others, that the value as of the time of taking should be the price to be paid the property owner.<br><br>Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator.&nbsp; In this case, this simply means the property's <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">fair market value</span> at the time of the filing of the complaint, or "that sum of money which a person desirous but not compelled to buy, and an owner willing but not compelled to sell, would agree on as a price to be given and received therefor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss.<br><br>In the determination of such value, the court is not limited to the assessed value of the property or to the schedule of market values determined by the provincial or city appraisal committee; these values consist but one factor in the judicial valuation of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The nature and character of the land at the time of its taking is the principal criterion for determining how much just compensation should be given to the landowner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> All the facts as to the condition of the property and its surroundings, as well as its improvements and capabilities, should be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Neither of the two determinations made by the courts below is therefore correct. A new one must be arrived at, taking into consideration the foregoing pronouncements.<br><br>Now, to the second issue raised by petitioner NPC.<br><br>In &nbsp;several &nbsp;cases, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court struck down NPC's consistent reliance on Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 6395, as amended by Presidential Decree 938.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> &nbsp;True, an easement of a right-of-way transmits no rights except &nbsp;the &nbsp;easement &nbsp;itself, &nbsp;and the respondents would retain full ownership of the property taken. Nonetheless, the acquisition of such easement is not <span style="font-style: italic;">gratis</span>.&nbsp; The limitations on the use of the property taken for an indefinite period would deprive its owner of the normal use thereof.&nbsp; For this reason, the latter is entitled to payment of a just compensation, which must be neither more nor less than the monetary equivalent of the land taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>While the power of eminent domain results in the taking or appropriation of title to, and possession of, the expropriated property, no cogent reason appears why said power may not be availed of to impose only a burden upon the owner of the condemned property, without loss of title and possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> However, if the easement is intended to <span style="font-style: italic;">perpetually</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">indefinitely</span> deprive the owner of his proprietary rights through the imposition of conditions that affect the ordinary use, free enjoyment and disposal of the property or through restrictions and limitations that are inconsistent with the exercise of the attributes of ownership, or when the introduction of structures or objects which, by their nature, create or increase the probability of injury, death upon or destruction of life and property found on the land is necessary, then the owner should be compensated for the monetary equivalent of the land, in accordance with our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">NPC v. Manubay Agro-Industrial</span>:<br><blockquote>As correctly observed by the CA, considering the nature and the effect of the installation power lines, the limitations on the use of the land for an indefinite period would deprive respondent of normal use of the property.&nbsp; For this reason, the latter is entitled to payment of a just compensation, which must be neither more nor less than the monetary equivalent of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>The evidence suggests that NPC's transmission line project that traverses the respondents' property is perpetual, or at least indefinite, in nature. Moreover, not to be discounted is the fact that the high-tension current to be conveyed through said transmission lines evidently poses a danger to life and limb; injury, death or destruction to life and property within the vicinity. As the Court held in <span style="font-style: italic;">NPC v. Chiong,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> it is not improper to &nbsp;assume &nbsp;that NPC will erect structures for its transmission lines within the &nbsp;property. &nbsp;What &nbsp;is &nbsp;sought to be expropriated in this case is, at its longest &nbsp;extent, &nbsp;326.34 meters, and through it may be built several structures, &nbsp;not simply one. Finally, if NPC were to have its way, respondents &nbsp;will &nbsp;continue &nbsp;to pay the realty taxes due on the affected portion of their property, an imposition that, among others, merits the rejection of NPC's thesis of payment of a mere percentage of the property's actual value.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> &nbsp;the &nbsp;instant &nbsp;petition &nbsp;is &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span> &nbsp;in &nbsp;part &nbsp;in that the &nbsp;decision &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Court &nbsp;of &nbsp;Appeals dated March 14, 2005 &nbsp;vis a vis the award of &nbsp;P116,538.00, as and by way of just compensation for the 19,423 square meters of the respondents' property, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>, and the case is ordered <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> &nbsp;to &nbsp;the court of origin for the proper determination of the amount of just compensation for the portion thus taken, based on our pronouncements hereon. The same decision, however, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>, insofar as it pertains to the award of P325,025.00 for the improvements, with legal interest from the time of actual possession by the petitioner.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.<br><br></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, C.J., (Chairperson), </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sandoval-Gutierrez, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Azcuna, JJ., </span>concur.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Corona, J., </span>on leave.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Vicente Q.

Therein the Court declared:<br><br>Petitioner averred in its complaint in Civil Case No. 1442-I, that it sought to acquire "an easement of right-of-way" over portions of the properties owned by respondents, for a total of 10,950 square meters. <span style="font-style: italic;">However, a perusal of its complaint shows that petitioner also stated that it would erect structures for its transmission lines on portions of the expropriated property. In other words, the expropriation was not to be limited for the purpose of "easement of right-of-way."</span> In fact, in their Answer, the Heirs of Agrifina Angeles, alleged that petitioner had actually occupied an area of 4,000 square meters wherein it constructed structures for its transmission lines and was seeking to occupy another 4,000 square meters. Petitioner failed to controvert this material allegation. Justifiably, the market value of these 4,000 square meters allegedly occupied by the petitioner has become the very crux of the present case.<br></div>
