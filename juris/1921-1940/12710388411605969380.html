				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The judgment&nbsp; appealed from sentences the&nbsp; appellant, for the crime of murder&nbsp; committed on the person&nbsp; of Antonino Jacinto, to <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena perpetua,</span>&nbsp; with the accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, other than his widow Juana Rosenda, and two daughters, Dorotea and Oliva Jacinto, in the sum of P1,000 and the costs.<br><br>About April 19, 1925, Antonino&nbsp; Jacinto, his wife&nbsp; and two daughters lived&nbsp; in&nbsp; Mario Pamintuan's house&nbsp; in the municipality of Angeles, Pampanga.&nbsp; The facts in this case as stated by the Attorney-General are:<br><blockquote>"That at about 11 o'clock on the night of April 19, 1925, the deceased Antonino Jacinto, the&nbsp; accused Mario Pamintuan and one Melecio Santos went upstairs to the house of one Juan Cortes, situated in the municipality of Angeles, Province of Pampanga.&nbsp; When,&nbsp; after a few moments, the three decided to leave the house,&nbsp; the accused Mario Pamintuan was the&nbsp; first to go downstairs while Melecio Santos remained on the&nbsp; bamboo porch&nbsp; of said house waiting for Antonino Jacinto who had stopped for a drink of water. After the accused had come down and while Antonino Jacinto, who,&nbsp; had then gone ahead of&nbsp; Melecio Santos, was rinsing&nbsp; his&nbsp; mouth and standing with one of his feet on the first step of the&nbsp; stairway about to descend, a revolver shot was heard which wounded the&nbsp; said Antonino Jacinto, who thereupon cried out&nbsp; that the accused&nbsp; Mario Pamintuan&nbsp; had shot him&nbsp; with his&nbsp; revolver,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; calling to Melecio Santos, asked the latter not&nbsp; to leave him and to call his family&nbsp; because&nbsp; he felt he&nbsp; was&nbsp; about to&nbsp; die on&nbsp; account of having been wounded by the said accused. Judging from&nbsp; the flashes produced by the said shot which were&nbsp; seen through the interstices&nbsp; of the porch floor, it must have been fired from beneath the same.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; hearing the shot Juan Cortes and Melecio Santos started to run towards the&nbsp; inside of&nbsp; the&nbsp; house shouting&nbsp; for&nbsp; help and the police.&nbsp; The&nbsp; accused Mario&nbsp; Pamintuan did not respond to the cries for help given by Juan Cortes and Melecio Santos."<br></blockquote><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>Antonino&nbsp; Jacinto&nbsp; received two wounds produced&nbsp; by a bullet from&nbsp; a revolver which entered&nbsp; the&nbsp; posterior region of the left abdominal wall, almost level with the lower edge of the last lumbar vertebra, and passed&nbsp; out through the upper antero lateral right wall of the abdominal region, the location of the wounds indicating that the shot must have been fired from below in&nbsp; an upward direction while Antonino Jacinto was&nbsp; standing with&nbsp; his&nbsp; back towards&nbsp; the assailant.&nbsp; At daybreak Antonino Jacinto was taken to the municipal&nbsp; building and&nbsp; from there .to&nbsp; the&nbsp; San Fernando Hospital, where he died at 7.45 the following morning as a result of his wounds.<br><br>Early the following morning Lieut. Fortus of the Constabulary made an examination of the house and found on the porch floor, which was about 5 meters from the ground and made of split bamboo, an empty cartridge the appearance&nbsp; of which indicated that it had been recently fired. Upon examining the condition of the porch floor he found that the interstices in the bamboo were as wide as 2% inches in some instances.<br><br>Immediately after the incident the justice of the peace and some police officers went to the house, Antonino Jacinto&nbsp; still lying on the porch where he was shot, and the said Antonino Jacinto then told&nbsp; the justice of the peace that he had been wounded by a revolver shot fired by Mario Pamintuan, who possessed an automatic revolver and who harbored&nbsp; illicit intentions towards one&nbsp; of his daughters. Antonino&nbsp; Jacinto repeated this statement in the municipal building&nbsp; in the presence of the justice of the peace and then of Lieutenant Fortus, affirming that Mario Pamintuan, after shooting him, started to run away but he was able to recognize him.&nbsp; Antonino&nbsp; Jacinto made this statement in the belief that he was about to die, not only for the sake of making it, but because he must have had this&nbsp; belief in, view of the seriousness of his wounds as was shown&nbsp; by the fact that he died a few hours later.<br><br>While Antonino Jacinto was in the municipal&nbsp; building Mario Pamintuan was seen downstairs and was&nbsp; arrested at daybreak that&nbsp; same morning.<br><br>The deceased's&nbsp; family showed&nbsp; the greatest indifference and lack of interest in the incident.<br><br>When Agapito&nbsp; Cruz, who&nbsp; had&nbsp; gone to&nbsp; visit Antonino Jacinto&nbsp; in the municipal building,&nbsp; was&nbsp; leaving to return to his house, he&nbsp; was&nbsp; followed&nbsp; by Patricio Pamintuan, Mario's brother, who&nbsp; asked him on the road to get&nbsp; Mario Pamintuan's revolver which&nbsp; was buried underneath the latter's house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agapito did so and got the 45 automatic Colt revolver, still smelling of powder, loaded with five cartridges, and at Patricio's suggestion&nbsp; took it to his house in order to sell it later.&nbsp; The revolver was afterwards found by the authorities in Agapito Cruz's possession.<br><br>The attorney for Mario Pamintuan tried to establish that the latter&nbsp; had&nbsp; left the house&nbsp; where&nbsp; Melecio Santos&nbsp; and Antonino had gone, twenty minutes before the latter, going to his own house where, being almost asleep, he was informed of the shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wife and one of the daughters of the deceased&nbsp; corroborated this testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; The attitude of the deceased's wife and daughter in testifying as&nbsp; witnesses for the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; in this case is explained by their favorable&nbsp; attitude towards the appellant and their indifference and lack of interest in the&nbsp; deceased from the&nbsp; first moment of the incident.&nbsp; This favorable attitude of these witnesses towards the appellant went so far that they testified that&nbsp; in the interview had with&nbsp; the deceased before the latter's&nbsp; death and after the incident, he insinuated. to them that&nbsp; they&nbsp; testify that it&nbsp; was Mario Pamintuan&nbsp; who fired the shot at him, when such exceptional witnesses as the justice of the peace and the nurse, Petra C. Orencia, who were&nbsp; present at this interview,&nbsp; denied&nbsp; that the deceased had made such insinuation.<br><br>The fact that the&nbsp; appellant went&nbsp; downstairs&nbsp; from the house almost at the same time as&nbsp; the deceased, going on ahead, and at&nbsp; the moment when he&nbsp; reached the&nbsp; bottom while the deceased was still on&nbsp; the porch at the edge of the stairway about to descend, the shot was fired from below, the appellant having disappeared,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that the deceased upon&nbsp; receiving the shot saw the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; run, together with the other&nbsp; fact of having recovered the revolver,&nbsp; with which the shot must have been fired,&nbsp; buried beneath the appellant's house, leave no&nbsp; doubt as to his guilt. It is not improbable that the deceased was able to recognize him, considering that the porch was lighted by an electric bulb which gave light&nbsp; all around&nbsp; below.&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that the appellant left the house at the same time as the deceased and Melecio is proven by the testimony of the owner of the house, Juan Cortes, who is a disinterested witness.<br><br>The circumstance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the empty&nbsp; cartridge having&nbsp; been found on&nbsp; the porch&nbsp; floor,&nbsp; while it&nbsp; seems strange because the shot was fired from below,&nbsp; is&nbsp; easily explained.&nbsp; The shot was&nbsp; fired from an automatic Colt revolver at a distance of a meter, by putting the barrel through one of the interstices of the porch floor.&nbsp; Considering the height of the porch and the angle which, under the circumstances, would be formed by the floor and the barrel of the revolver, the empty cartridge, in escaping, must have entered through one of the interstices of the split bamboo floor and&nbsp; then dropped on it.<br><br>Undoubtedly, in committing the crime the appellant employed means, methods and forms which assured its&nbsp; consummation without any risk to himself from any defense the deceased might make, a circumstance which qualifies the crime as murder.<br><br>The Attorney-General in this instance contends that the aggravating circumstance&nbsp; of nocturnity must be taken into consideration in the&nbsp; commission of the crime and, consequently, the penalty&nbsp; provided by law must be imposed in its&nbsp; maximum degree. We believe, however, that this circumstance is included in that of treachery, which, qualifies the crime as murder.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against&nbsp; the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Romualdez, JJ</span>., concur. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ostrand, J</span>., with whom concur Johns and Villa-Real, JJ.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dissenting:<br><br>In my opinion there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no reliable&nbsp; evidence justifying the conviction of the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dying declaration of the deceased, the only evidence directly connecting the defendant with the commission of the crime was&nbsp; no doubt made in good faith, but the sketches Exhibits E and 4, and the photographs Exhibits 1 and 2 taken in connection with the oral evidence, shows conclusively to my mind that the deceased could&nbsp; not&nbsp; have obtained a sufficiently clear view of his assailant to enable him to identify the latter and that the dying declaration is&nbsp; based on mere suspicion.&nbsp; The deceased was shot from behind while standing on the <span style="font-style: italic;">batalan </span>of a&nbsp; house occupied by Juan&nbsp; Cortes, one of the witnesses for the prosecution.&nbsp; The floor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">batalan </span>was a little over 5 feet from the ground and was made&nbsp; of split bamboo, which, judging from the&nbsp; photographs, was laid quite closely, though there is evidence that there were places where the&nbsp; openings or interstices&nbsp; reached&nbsp; a width of 21 inches.&nbsp; There&nbsp; was no lamp on&nbsp; the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">batalan </span>itself,&nbsp; but there was&nbsp; an electric bulb&nbsp; or&nbsp; lamp in&nbsp; the&nbsp; adjoining kitchen, which threw some&nbsp; light on the <span style="font-style: italic;">batalan </span>through an open door of ordinary width; that the light could not have been very&nbsp; strong is&nbsp; indicated by the fact that the flash&nbsp; from the firing of the pistol was clearly visible.<br><br>The shot was fired through the floor from the&nbsp; space beneath the <span style="font-style: italic;">batalan </span>at a point between the kitchen&nbsp; light and the place where the deceased was&nbsp; standing.&nbsp; There could therefore have been no light falling on the face of the person firing the shot, and taking into consideration the distance from the eyes of the deceased to the point where the bullet penetrated the&nbsp; floor, it&nbsp; seems obvious that it was practically a physical impossibility for the deceased&nbsp; to have definitely identified his assailant.&nbsp;&nbsp; One has&nbsp; only to make the experiment of looking obliquely from a standing position&nbsp; through an ordinary bamboo floor into&nbsp; a dark&nbsp; or only partially lighted space beneath to&nbsp; realize the extreme improbability of the theory of the prosecution.<br><br>The deceased knew that the defendant possessed an automatic army pistol and this, in connection with the fact that the defendant was unwilling to go out with him on the evening in question and probably showed some resentment at being urged to do so,&nbsp; undoubtedly led the deceased in his half-drunken condition to&nbsp; believe that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime.&nbsp; But the town of Angeles&nbsp; is situated close to the Stotsenburg Military Reservation and there is evidence to the effect that other residents of the town possessed automatic pistols purchased from the soldiers and held without licenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence also indicates that the deceased had various enemies by reason of the facts that he was of a quarrelsome disposition and as a gambler often refused to pay&nbsp; his&nbsp; losses or debts.&nbsp; In these circumstances, he might&nbsp; well have been mistaken in his suspicion of&nbsp; the accused, and it is&nbsp; quite probable that the crime was committed by some other person.<br><br>The testimony of the witness Agapito Cruz is wholly incredible.&nbsp; It is not denied that the defendant on a certain occasion slapped the face of Agapito in the presence of a number of other persons, an insult not very readily forgotten, and there can&nbsp; be&nbsp; no doubt that Agapito harbored enmity against&nbsp; the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; He testifies that&nbsp; on the morning after the commission of the crime and as he came out from&nbsp; the municipal building after a call on&nbsp; the deceased, he met the&nbsp; defendant's brother, Patricio&nbsp; Pamintuan, who told him that there was a revolver concealed in the house of the defendant and requested him, Agapito, to go to the house and get the revolver&nbsp; and thereafter&nbsp; take care of it.&nbsp; This story does not seem reasonable; if Patricio desired to conceal the fact that his brother possessed the gun, he would not have informed&nbsp; a friend of&nbsp; the deceased who also was his brother's enemy of that fact, but would have taken&nbsp; care of the gun&nbsp; himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other features about Agapito's testimony which render&nbsp; it incredible, but which&nbsp; I shall not take the time and&nbsp; space to discuss.<br><br>The witness Cortes&nbsp; in whose&nbsp; house&nbsp; the crime was committed is&nbsp; supposed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be a disinterested witness, but he&nbsp; is not a truthful one.&nbsp; Though it clearly appears from the evidence that his house was a house of prostitution, he vigorously denies that fact and says that he does not know why the deceased, the defendant, and Melecio Santos came to the house about half past eleven, stayed there a few moments,&nbsp; and again returned to the house sometime after midnight; that he&nbsp; knew the&nbsp; defendant slightly,&nbsp; but did not&nbsp; know&nbsp; the other two,&nbsp; and that he&nbsp; conversed&nbsp; with them, but did not try to ascertain why they came to the house. That&nbsp; does&nbsp; not seem&nbsp; reasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The testimony of Melecio Santos&nbsp; that&nbsp; the deceased was looking for&nbsp; a prostitute by the name of Mameng with whom he desired to have intercourse and&nbsp; whom he finally found in Cortes' house on his return there after midnight seems&nbsp; much more probable.<br><br>The testimony&nbsp; of the widow and of the elder daughter of the deceased rings true and if&nbsp; they told the truth, the defendant&nbsp; could&nbsp; not have&nbsp; committed&nbsp; the crime.&nbsp; It is argued that the fact that they showed but little emotion over the death of&nbsp; the husband and father&nbsp; casts&nbsp; doubts upon their veracity,&nbsp; but when it is considered that the deceased&nbsp; was&nbsp; a convict&nbsp; in&nbsp; Bilibid from&nbsp; 1907&nbsp; until&nbsp; 1923 during which&nbsp; time his wife and children&nbsp; had to shift for themselves; that on his release from Bilibid he devoted himself to gambling as well as to sexual immorality, and that he received the fatal wound&nbsp; while visiting a house of prostitution,&nbsp; the&nbsp; apparent indifference of&nbsp; his family is easily understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears, however, from the&nbsp; testimony of the justice of the peace that&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow&nbsp; did her&nbsp; best to alleviate the pain of her husband&nbsp; while he was suffering from the&nbsp; wound.<br><br>The testimony&nbsp; of Melecio&nbsp; Santos as to his and his&nbsp; companions'&nbsp; movements&nbsp; during the&nbsp; evening and night in question is probably in&nbsp; the main true; he was severely cross-examined and testified consistently to a wealth of details without becoming involved incontradictions, something which would hardly have been possible&nbsp; if his testimony had been without foundation in fact.<br><br>As&nbsp; I have already&nbsp; stated, there is no reliable evidence showing the defendant's guilt.&nbsp; On the contrary, the weight of the evidence proves&nbsp; him&nbsp; innocent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime with which&nbsp; he&nbsp; is charged and he should have been acquitted.<br></div>
