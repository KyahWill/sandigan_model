				G.R. No. L-22448, August 02, 1924</h4>
				<H3>CASTOR FELISMINO ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE DIEGO GLORIA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TAYABAS, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The respondents demur to the petition for mandamus filed by Castor 
Felismino<em> et al.</em>, against the Honorable Diego Gloria <em>et al.</em>, 
on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action and that there is a defect of parties.
<p>The case having been submitted to our consideration, this court in a 
resolution of the 19th day of this month of July, 1924, sustained the demurrer, 
providing that unless the petitioners should amend their petition within ten 
days from receipt of notice of said resolution, their petition would be 
dismissed with the costs against them.</p>
<p>On July 28, 1924, counsel for petitioners informed this court in writing that 
they waived the right to amend the petition and prayed that "in the interests of 
the jurisprudence and the rights which the petitioners are and have been seeking 
to enforce in the courts of justice, a reasoned decision be handed down in this 
case."</p>
<p>Granting this request, which we find justified, this opinion is now 
delivered.</p>
<p>The facts alleged in the petition are substantially as follows:</p>
<p>On January 9, 1924, the Court of First Instance of Tayabas rendered judgment 
in civil case No. 1618, wherein the Philippine Sugar Estate Development Co., 
Ltd., was plaintiff and Ramon Ramos, his wife Pilar Ibafiez, Bernardo Marquez, 
and Arego Hermanos y Cia. were defendants, and which was for foreclosure of 
mortgage. Said judgment was in favor of the plaintiff corporation and gave a 
period of three months from the date thereof for the payment of the debt claimed 
and interest thereon, ordering the sheriff, in case such debt should not be paid 
within the period fixed, to proceed with the sale of the properties mortgaged 
described in the judgment.</p>
<p>No appeal having been taken from said judgment, and the periods fixed by the 
law having elapsed, said judgment became final.</p>
<p>The petitioners allege that it was only on April 7, 1924, that they happened 
to learn of such decision which they consider injurious to their rights, 
inasmuch as they are the persons who planted the plants existing on the lands 
involved in said action for foreclosure of mortgage, pursuant to contracts in 
writing executed with the mortgagors, defendants in that case, according to 
which "the permanent improvements should be, according to each contract, (?) or 
their value must be paid at the rate of P1 for each coconut tree, or one-half or 
one-third of said improvements together with the land should be delivered or 
transferred in fee simple to said planters" (Par. 2, Exhibit B).</p>
<p>The petitioners aver that as soon as they learned of the decision, they 
secured the professional services of an attorney, and on April 19, 1924, they 
filed with the Court of First Instance of Tayabas two petitions, one for 
intervention under section 121 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the other for 
the annulment of said judgment under section 113 of the same Code.</p>
<p>As that court denied these petitions and ordered, at the instance of the 
mortgagee, the execution of the aforesaid judgment, and the sheriff, one of the 
respondents, announced the sale at public auction of the mortgaged properties, 
to be held May 21, 1924, the petitioners came to this court, bringing this 
action and praying for the issuance of an injunction against the respondents; 
that the aforesaid decision be annulled; that the petitioners be allowed to 
intervene and the respondents sentenced to pay the costs and an indemnity for 
the damages caused to them by reason of this proceeding.</p>
<p>As may be seen, this is for the reason that the respondent judge refused to 
annul the judgment under the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, and to allow the petitioners to intervene in the aforesaid civil case 
No. 1618.</p>
<p>As to the refusal of the trial court to grant the petitioners the benefits of 
section 113, it must be noted that the relief provided in said section is not of 
strict right, but is purely discretionary on the part of the court to grant or 
not (Siguenza vs. Municipality of Hinigaran, 14 Phil., 495). And in cases 
involving discretion we cannot compel a trial court to act through mandamus 
(Lamb vs. Phipps, 22 Phil., 456).</p>
<p>With regard to the denial of the applicants' petition for permission to 
intervene in the case, we find no sufficient ground for such a petition for 
intervention, inasmuch as it is a case already decided by a final judgment. Such 
intervention is late. While the Spanish text of section 121 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure may, perhaps, give rise to a mistaken understanding as to the meaning 
of the phrase "<em>durante la tramitacion</em>," the fact is that the English 
text of this section removes all doubt, for it says "during the trial" 
(<em>durante la vista</em>), and the period of the trial (<em>vista</em>) 
terminates when the judgment begins.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Tayatxas having the right to deny such a late 
petition for intervention, we cannot compel it through mandamus to grant the 
same.</p>
<p>From all of this it results that the facts alleged in the petition for 
mandamus do not constitute a cause of action, and for this reason we have 
sustained the demurrer filed by the respondents, and this ruling is hereby 
confirmed.</p>
<p>The petitioners having waived the right to amend their petition, this 
proceeding is definitely dismissed with the costs against the petitioners. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor,</em> and <em>Ostrand, JJ., 
</em>concur.</p>
