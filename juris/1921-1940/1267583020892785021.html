				[ G. R. No. 45249, December 29, 1936</h4>
				<H3>THE  PEOPLE OF  THE  PHILIPPINE ISLANDS,  PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLEE, VS.  PEDRO MASONSON Y KATIBAK  (<I>ALIAS</I> PEDRO BALAGTAS, CRISPIN GONZALO), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant was charged&nbsp; with the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; theft and, upon&nbsp; a plea of guilty, he was sentenced by&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila to suffer one month and one&nbsp; day of <i>arresto mayor</i>, and to pay the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was further sentenced to&nbsp; an additional penalty of ten years and&nbsp; one day of <i>prision mayor</i> for habitual delinquency.<br><br>The only question raised by&nbsp; this appeal&nbsp; relates to the correctness of the imposition of the additional penalty upon the following allegation contained in&nbsp; the information:<br><blockquote>"That said accused&nbsp; is a habitual delinquent&nbsp; under the provisions of article&nbsp; 62 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; he having been&nbsp; previously convicted&nbsp; four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; times&nbsp; of the crime of theft, by final judgments of competent courts, his last date of conviction&nbsp; of the crime of theft being October 8, 1935."</blockquote>Upon this&nbsp; point this court has held that a finding&nbsp; of habitual&nbsp; delinquency cannot be predicated upon a plea&nbsp; of guilty to an&nbsp; information which fails to specify the dates of the commission of the alleged previous offenses, the appellant's convictions&nbsp; thereof, and his release thereunder. (People vs. Venus, p. 435, ante; People vs. Flores, p. 443, <i>ante</i>; People&nbsp; vs. Tapel, p. 464, <i>ante</i>.)&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a general allegation of a previous conviction is sufficient to sustain a finding of the existence of the aggravating circumstance of recidivism.&nbsp; (People vs. Alcantara, G.&nbsp; R. No. 39505,&nbsp; 58 Phil., 950; People vs. Fortaleza, G. R. No. 42871, 61 Phil., 1035; People vs. Valencia, 59 Phil., 42; People vs. Cabral, G. R. No. 39200, 58 Phil., 930; U. S.&nbsp; vs. Burlado, 42 Phil., 72.)<br><br>In the view we have taken of the case, the appellant must be found guilty of the crime of theft penalized with <i>arresto mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; article 309, paragraph&nbsp; 6.)&nbsp; The&nbsp; aggravating circumstance of recidivism having been offset by the modifying circumstance of plea of guilty,&nbsp; the penalty prescribed&nbsp; should be imposed in its&nbsp; medium period, that&nbsp; is to say, from two months and one day to&nbsp; three months&nbsp; of <i>arresto mayor</i>.<br><br>The judgment below should be modified by sentencing the appellant to suffer&nbsp; two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor</i> and by eliminating therefrom the additional penalty&nbsp; imposed for habitual delinquency.<br><br>Modified as&nbsp; above indicated the judgment&nbsp; is affirmed with costs <i>de oficio</i>.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel,</i> and <i>Concepcion, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
