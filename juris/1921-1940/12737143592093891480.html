				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE. FILOMENA CONCEPCION, OFFENDED PARTY AND APPELLANT, VS. JUAN ALEJANO Y DE LA CRUZ (ALIAS JUAN GATA), DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Attorney-General prays for the dismissal of this appeal, but the 
appellant objects.</p>
<p>The parties to the case are: The People of the Philippine Islands, plaintiff, 
and Juan Alejano y de la Cruz (alms Juan Gata), defendant, charged with the 
crime of qualified theft. The appellant herein, which is the estate of Filomena 
Concepcion, intervened only after the defendant had been acquitted by the trial 
court on a reasonable doubt of his guilt. The intervention filed by the estate 
of Filomena Concepcion sought the reconsideration of that part of the decision 
ordering the return of said ring to the owner, Pedro Razal.</p>
<p>The court having denied said reconsideration, the estate of Filomena 
Concepcion appealed and filed a brief in this court.</p>
<p>Before filing his brief, the Attorney-General moved for the dismissal of the 
appeal on the ground that the right to appeal is purely statutory; that the law 
only allows the parties to appeal from a final judgment or from an order made 
thereafter, affecting the substantial rights of the appellant, but not a third 
party even if the judgment apparently affects his interests. He adds that 
assuming the appellant has a legal right to appeal in this case, any judgment 
which may be rendered thereon would be nugatory, for the ring has already been 
returned to its lawful owner, and the latter cannot now be ordered to return it 
to the appellant, inasmuch as it would be disturbing the owner's peaceful 
possession and enjoyment of his property without due process of law and an 
opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p>Counsel for the estate of Filomena Concepcion invokes section 107, General 
Orders, No. 58, contending that the theft in question has injured not only Pedro 
Razal, the alleged owner of the ring, but also the appellant.</p>
<p>In ordering the return of the ring in question to the owner, the trial court 
acted in accordance with the provisions of second paragraph of article 120 of 
the Penal Code. The rule is applicable to the case at bar even though the 
defendant has been acquitted, for it has been proved that the ring in question 
belonged to, and was in possession of, Pedro Razal, and that it was stolen from 
him; in other words, the offense has been proved, but not the identity of the 
offender. The Penal Code rule certainly applies to the instant case. Res 
obicumque sit pro domino suo clamat.</p>
<p>Now then, in Varela vs. Finnick (9 Phil., 482), this court held that any 
person unlawfully deprived of his property may recover it, although it be in the 
possession of another who has acquired it by lawful means, saving'those 
mentioned in article 464 of the Civil Code. This doctrine had already been 
announced in Del Rosario vs. Lucena (8 Phil., 535) and Varela vs. Matute (9 
Phil., 479), and reiterated by this court in United States vs. Soriano and 
Villalobos (12 Phil., 512); Arenas vs. Raymundo (19 Phil, 46); Reyes vs. Ruiz 
(27 Phil., 458); and United States vs. Sotelo (28 Phil., 147).</p>
<p>The appellant contends that since the defendant has been acquitted, there was 
no reason for ordering the return of the ring to its alleged owner, citing cases 
of the Supreme Court of Spain, and that of Almeida Ghantangco and Lete vs. 
Abaroa (40 Phil., 1056). But it must not be lost sight of that the defendant was 
not sentenced to pay any indemnity, nor was anything adverse to him ordered. The 
defendant did not claim any right to the ring, having ignored it entirely by 
denying that he had taken it and pawned it in the pawnshop mentioned.</p>
<p>The return of the ring to its owner, Pedro Razal, did not injure the 
defendant or anybody else, except the appellant, who, however, until shown to be 
one of the "pawnshops established under authority of the Government" mentioned 
in the third paragraph of article 464, Civil Code, has no right to reimbursement 
of the amount for which the ring in question was pledged.</p>
<p>As to the procedural phase of this appeal, it must be observed that neither 
the Government nor the People of the Philippine Islands, the plaintiff herein, 
is interested in the ring in question, and hence, should not be made a party to 
the instant appeal, and the Attorney-General cannot be required to file a brief 
in the premises, although it must be acknowledged that his intervention in 
filing a motion for the dismissal of. the appeal, drawing the court's attention 
to the character and condition of the proceedings in hand, was most timely.</p>
<p>The parties really interested in the matter of the ring are the appellant 
herein on the one hand, and Pedro Razal on the other, who has not been 
impleaded. His absence prevents the final determination of the controversy, for 
he is a necessary party. And since it would not be in accord with the law to 
include him as a party at this stage of the proceedings, this appeal must be 
dismissed at once.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appeal is hereby dismissed without express pronouncement as to 
costs, and without prejudice to whatever right the appellant may have to the 
reimbursement of the amount for which the ring in question was pledged. So 
ordered.</p>
