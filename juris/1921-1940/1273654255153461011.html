				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CRISTOBAL FRANCISCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>After considering the evidence introduced in this case, the Court of First 
Instance of Pangasinan rendered judgment, finding the defendant guilty of the 
crime of homicide, as charged in the complaint, and sentencing him to the 
penalty of twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, to indemnify 
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P500 and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>Counsel for the accused prays for the reversal of the judgment appealed from, 
alleging that the lower court erred: (<em>a</em>) In compelling, as it in fact 
did compel, the accused to be present during the trial, notwithstanding that he 
had waived his right thereto; (<em>b</em>) in finding as a fact proven that the 
deceased Luis Abulencia died as a consequence of the wound received by him from 
the accused at about 7 o'clock in the morning of December 7, 1924; (<em>c</em>) 
in not holding that the facts proven fully prove that in wounding Luis 
Abulencia, the accused acted in self-defense with all the circumstances that are 
essential in order that the same may constitute an exemption from criminal 
liability; and (<em>d</em>) in not acquitting the defendant with all 
pronouncements in his favor.</p>
<p>As to the first error, it was held in the case of Diaz vs. United States (223 
U. S., 442), that except in cases in which the accused is in custody and in 
which the crime charged is a capital offense, the presence of the accused is 
indispensable only at the following stages: (1) At the arraignment; (2) at the 
time of the defendant's answering the complaint, if he pleads guilty, and (3) at 
the pronouncement of the judgment; that his presence at any other stage is not 
indispensable, and may be waived by the accused. So that in denying the petition 
of the accused, waiving his presence at the trial of this case, the trial court 
erred, but such an error is not reversible because it did not prejudice any 
right of the accused.</p>
<p>The second error finds no support in the case. There is plenty of evidence 
showing that Luis Abulencia died as a consequence of the wound received on the 
left side of the parietal region.</p>
<p>The defense contends that the trial court erred in not holding that the facts 
proven justify the acquittal of the accused for having acted in lawful 
self-defense with all the circumstances required for exemption from criminal 
liability.</p>
<p>The prosecution and the defense maintain opposite theories as to the time and 
manner in which the event took place. The witnesses for the prosecution 
uniformly testify that the accused struck Luis Abulencia with his bolo while the 
latter was plowing a field not far from the former's house. On the other hand 
the witnesses for the defense say that the act complained of occurred in front 
of the house of the accused about 3 or 4 meters from the staircase of said 
house; and that the event took place, according to the accused and his son, 
because said accused refused to drink the wine that Luis Abulencia was offering 
him, which caused the latter to assault him with a bolo, which aggression the 
former dodged by placing himself behind Domingo Zulueta, but pursued by 
Abulencia, before running away, he was able to take the bolo that Domingo 
Zulueta had on his belt, and with it he struck a blow against Luis 
Abulencia.</p>
<p>The trial court gave more credit to the witnesses for the prosecution than 
those for the defense, and we believe that it did right, for we find in the 
record that the chief of police who repaired to the place of the event saw blood 
stains on the rice field outside the fence of the defendant's house, which sEows 
that it was there where the deceased received the wound on the left parietal 
region, and not in front of the staircase of the defendant's house. On the other 
hand, Domingo Zulueta affirms that on that occasion he had no bolo, and if so, 
the accused could have taken none from him with which to strike the 
deceased.</p>
<p>The lower court says the following on this point: </p>
<p>"The court, however, does not consider the defense set up by the accused to 
be of any merit:</p>
<p>"1. Because said defense can in no way overthrow the conclusive and 
uncontradicted testimonies of the three eyewitnesses presented by the 
prosecution, who positively testified to having actually seen the accused 
inflict the wound that caused the death of the deceased in the manner above 
stated;</p>
<p>"2. Because such a defense was absolutely denied and overthrown by the 
witness of the prosecution, Domingo Zulueta, in testifying in rebuttal;</p>
<p>"3. Because at all events, it does not constitute complete exemption from 
liability; and</p>
<p>"4. Because by a careful examination of the attitude and manner of testifying 
of the witnesses for each party, the court has arrived at the conclusion that 
the witnesses for the prosecution are entitled to more credit than the witnesses 
for the defense.</p>
<p>"Although the motive of the criminal act was not duly established, owing to 
the fact that the prosecuting attorneys did not make the necessary effort to 
show the same to the court with certainty, yet such a circumstance does not 
exempt the accused from criminal liability, there appearing in the record direct 
and positive evidence that it was the accused who inflicted the wound that 
caused the death of the deceased, and specially if it is taken into 
consideration that the defense interposed by the accused does not come within 
the provisions of article 8 of the Penal Code so as to constitute a lawful 
defense." We have examined the record before us and find nothing justifying a 
modification of the findings set out in the judgment appealed from.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General calls our attention to the fact that the commission of 
the crime was not attended by any circumstance modifying liability, and 
therefore the penalty fixed by the law shall be imposed upon the accused in the 
medium degree, that is, from fourteen years, eight months and one day to 
seventeen years and four months of reclusion temporal The trial court imposed 
the penalty of twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal,</em> that is 
to say, the minimum degree of the penalty fixed by the law, taking undoubtedly 
into consideration, as mitigating circumstance, the lack of instruction of the 
accused, as shown by the record.</p>
<p>For the foregoing, the judgment appealed from must be, as is hereby, 
affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avancena, Ostrand,</em> and <em>Romualdez, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
