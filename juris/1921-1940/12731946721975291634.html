				<H3>CLARA GONZALEZ, FOR HERSELF AND AS JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF HER DECEASED HUSBAND, AGATON SANCHEZ, PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLANT, VS.  GIL  CALIMBAS AND  PEDRO POBLETE, PROVINCIAL DEPUTY SHERIFF OF BATAAN, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was instituted in the court of the justice of the peace of the municipality of Balanga, Bataan, by Clara Gonzalez, in her  own  right and as administratrix of the estate of her  deceased  husband, Agaton Sanchez, for  the purpose  of recovering from Gil Calimbas and Pedro Poblete, the latter as provincial deputy sheriff of Bataan, the lot  bearing the number 1034  in the  cadastral  survey of Balanga, situated  in  the municipality  of Balanga,  with the  residential building located thereon,  and  to recover rent and damages for the period during which the plaintiff claims to have been unlawfully deprived of possession.  The cause having reached the Court of First Instance by appeal, his Honor,  the trial judge, absolved the defendants from the complaint, with costs against the plaintiff; and from this judgment the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>It appears  that on  October  20,  1924, a judgment was rendered  in the  Court of  First  Instance of  Bataan in a civil case, wherein the defendant Gil Calimbas, as administrator of the estate of Anselma V. Angeles, recovered a sum of money from Agaton Sanchez and wife, Clara Gonzalez.  A few months thereafter execution issued from said judgment and was levied by the  defendant deputy sheriff upon  the  house and lot in Balanga, Bataan, which is the subject of this action and which  was at the time occupied by the plaintiff Clara Gonzalez,  widow of the then deceased Agaton Sanchez.   The sheriff's sale occurred on March 27, 1926, and the property levied upon was purchased by Gil Calimbas, administrator, as the  highest and  best  bidder, for the sum of P4,346.88.  On August  11, thereafter,  the defendant, as  deputy  sheriff, at the instance of Calimbas, ejected Anselma V. Angeles from the premises and delivered the property to Calimbas who  remained in possession at the time this action was tried.<br><br>It will be noted that ,the property was sold at sheriff's sale on March 27, 1926, and that the plaintiff was  ejected on August 11, 1926, or less than five months from the date of the sale.  The case for the  plaintiff supposes that  she had the right to  retain possession for the entire year allowed by law  for the redemption  of the property and that she was unlawfully dispossessed.   On the other hand,  the defendants suppose that the purchaser had the right to immediate possession  upon the  completion of the sale and consequently that it was the duty  of the  sheriff  to turn the execution  debtor out at once.<br><br>The question here presented  was mentioned in Aldecoa &amp;  Co. vs.  Navarro (23 Phil., 203, 206), but was there left unanswered as unnecessary to the decision.  In  Velasco vs. Rosenberg's,  Inc.   (32 Phil.,  72), it was  held  that a judgment  debtor in possession of  real property sold under execution  cannot be required to pay rent to the purchaser for such  property during the period  of redemption; and to the same effect is the earlier decision of De la Rosa vs. Revita Santos  (10 Phil.,  148).  In Riosa vs. Verzosa and Bulan (26 Phil., 86), it was held that when real estate is sold under execution and the owner is in possession thereof, he is entitled to remain in possession  and to collect the rents and profits during the period allowed for redemption.  But in the same decision it was pointed out that by virtue  of section 469  of the Code of Civil Procedure,  a different rule prevails where the land is in possession of  a tenant at the time of the  sale.<br><br>In the light of these and other decisions of this court, it is evident that our statute  intends that the debtor shall have  the  use  and occupation of the property during the period allowed for redemption  except in the special case where the property is in  the hands of a lessee at the time of the sale.<br><br>It is true that the first paragraph of section 463 of the Code of Civil Procedure declares in substance that the purchaser acquires all the right of the judgment debtor in the property,  <i>subject to the  right  of  redemption</i>.  But that paragraph must  be construed as  conferring only the  inchoate right and not the  absolute property  with  all its incidents.   This  is in conformity with the  interpretation placed by the  Supreme  Court of  California upon section 700 of the  Code of  Civil Procedure  of that State, from which the first paragraph of section  463  of our Code of Civil Procedure is taken.   In the California Code said paragraph reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Upon  a  sale of real property, the  purchaser  is substituted to, and acquires all the right, title, interest, and claim of the judgment debtor thereto;  and  when the estate  is less than a leasehold of two years' unexpired term, the sale is absolute.   In all other cases  the property is subject to redemption, as provided in thi3 chapter."<br></blockquote><br>Under this  provision the  Supreme  Court of California has declared that the judgment  debtor is entitled to retain possession  during the  entire period allowed by  law for redemption and that  the purchaser cannot during that period have a receiver  appointed to harvest the crops and impound the proceeds  (Mau,  Sadler &amp; Co. vs.  Kearney, 143 Cal, 506).<br><br>In this connection the American decisions call attention to the difference between the effects of  the delivery of the certificate of sale which is given to the purchaser at the time the sale  is made and the deed which is delivered to him at the expiration of the period of redemption.  The certificate  issued to the  purchaser under  section 463 of the Code of Civil Procedure is intended to be a mere memorial of the  fact that purchase was made by the person named as buyer in the certificate.  This document is not intended to operate as an absolute transfer of the property,  but merely to  identify  the  property, to show the price paid, and  the date  when  the right of redemption expires.  The effective conveyance of the  land is accomplished by the deed which is issued only after the period of  redemption  has expired.  The transfer is not perfect until  the execution and delivery of  the sheriff's  deed, though it must  be  understood  that when  the deed is  executed it operates, by relation, from the  time when  the lien of the judgment was acquired (Foorman  vs. Wallace, 75 Cal., 552, 556).   As is  said in  Pike vs.  Halpin (188 Mich., 447, 450), the rights secured by an execution purchaser at the sale are inchoate before the  deed, and it is necessary for the purchaser to procure his  deed to complete  his title. The mere  purchase and certificate of sale alone do not confer any right to the possession or beneficial use of the premises.<br><br>In  addition to the foregoing  considerations it  may be noted that section 468 of our Code of Civil Procedure implicitly, but clearly, recognizes the right of the judgment debtor to remain in possession  during the year allowed for redemption.<br><br>Diaz vs. Azcune (31 Phil., 213), is relied upon by the appellee as authority for the proposition that it is the peremptory duty of the  sheriff to eject the judgment debtor and place the purchaser,in possession immediately after the land is sold under execution.  But that  was a case  where the period of redemption had passed, and the court was not dealing with the situation that exists before the sale becomes  final.   On the other hand,  the case  of Pabico vs. Ong Pauco (43 Phil.,  572), relied upon by the appellant, is also indecisive of the point now before us, for the situation there considered by the court was one where a person who was stranger to the  judgment  and who had long been in undisputed possession of the  property was unlawfully ejected by the sheriff.   The opinion in that case, however, directs attention to the fact that the official Spanish translation of section 463 of the Code of Civil Procedure  is incorrect in indicating that the purchaser shall be placed  in possession of  property sold under  execution.<br><br>From  what has been said it follows  that the appealed decision  is erroneous.  The plaintiff in  this case having been improperly turned out of possession  before the expiration of the period  of redemption, is entitled to recover damages from the sheriff and the execution creditor,  as trespassers.  If the cause had reached its conclusion prior to the expiration of the period of redemption, the plaintiff would also have been entitled to be restored to possession, but that period has now passed, and damages only can  be awarded.  The damages to be allowed will be determined by the value of the use and occupation of the property for the period during which the right of redemption continued. Unfortunately no transcript of the testimony submitted  in the court below has been brought  to this court, with the result that we are unable to assess the damages here; and it will  be necessary to remand the cause for further proceedings in  order that the trial court may ascertain the amount of said damages and give judgment to the plaintiff for the same.<br><br>The judgment is reversed,  and  the cause remanded  for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion, without costs in this instance.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Malcolm</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villamor, JJ.</span>,  concur. <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, J.,</span> concurs in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">AVANCEÑA, <span style="font-style: italic;">C.J.,</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">  </span>dissenting:<br><br>Section 463 of  the  Code of Civil Procedure, correctly translated from the English edition, says: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Verificada la venta de los bienes raices, el comprador sustituira y adquirira todo derecho,  interes, titulo y action que el deitdor por sentencia tuviere sobre los mismos."</span>  Had the law said no more  than this, it would be clear that the purchaser  acquires the possession of  the property, which is  one of  the judgment debtor's chief rights and, besides, because this is the natural and legal  effect  of a sale after the price has been paid.  (Articles  1461 and  1466 of  the  Civil  Code.) But the law goes on to say: "<i>Salvo  el derecho de retracto, como se provee mas adelante"</i>  According to  the majority opinion, this means that, by reason and during the period of this right of redemption granted to the  judgment debtor, the purchaser does not acquire the possession of the property,   I  am  at  a loss to understand the  basis for  this doctrine.  If, by the sale, in the absence of this right  of redemption, the purchaser acquires the possession, then  the mere  presence  of such  right  should not  suspend  this effect.   Its purpose, if exercised, is to resolve, and not to suspend, the rights created by the purchase.   And because it is so, it takes for granted that the sale has taken effect, said sale being  the thing to be  resolved;  otherwise  this right  of redemption would be  nugatory.  If  the effect of this right of redemption granted to the  judgment  debtor is as the majority  opinion holds it to be, then the purchaser does not acquire the rights, interest, title  and  action of  the judgment debtor by the sale, as  the law provides;  and it may be said that in spite of the sale, he acquires nothing,— thus making the redemption produce a suspensive, instead of a resolutory, effect.<br><br>There is not a single legal  provision  to  support this construction.  On the contrary, it is prohibited by section 469  (Code of Civil  Procedure), which provides  that  the purchaser is entitled to receive the rents of  the  property sold, or the value of the use and occupation thereof, from the tenant in possession.   This implies that it is the purchaser who is in possession  and enjoyment of  the property. It is true that, according to this same section, such rents shall be considered a credit upon the redemption money to be paid; but this takes place only when the redemption is actually effected, because in that case the law decrees that its  effects  should retroact to the date of the sale, which stands resolved, and  is considered not to have been made; which  is also the reason why it is  reciprocally  provided (sec. 465, Code of Civil Procedure) that the judgment debtor or redemptioner must pay not only the price paid,  but also the interest.  But, while said section 469  provides that in case of redemption these rents shall be considered a credit upon the redemption  price, it does not say  that, if such redemption should not be effected within the  statutory period, and the purchaser's ownership is thereby consolidated, the latter must also pay to the judgment debtor the rents received from the tenant before the expiration of the period of redemption.  If the inclusion of the one is  the exclusion of the other, it  follows, from this silence of  the  law that if the redemption is not effected, and the  purchaser's title is consolidated, the latter is entitled to the rents received from the tenant during the period of redemption, and he is not bound to pay them to the judgment  debtor.   It must be so,  furthermore,  because otherwise the provision  entitling the purchaser  to receive the  rent from the tenant would  be entirely unreasonable  and  useless  since, at all events whether the  redemption is effected or not, he  has to pay it to the judgment debtor, thus imposing upon him the duty of managing the property purchased during the period  of  redemption  without  any  benefit to  himself. Moreover, while the law provides (sec. 465, Code of Civil Procedure)  that, should the right of redemption  be  exercised, the judgment debtor or redemptioner must reimburse the purchaser, not only for  the price paid, but also for its interest; the law does not say that he must pay this interest, even if the property is not redeemed.  From this silence of the law it also follows that he is not bound to pay.  If the vendor  need not pay such interest,  the law would be unjust to deny the purchaser's interest, and at the  same time deprive him, during the period of redemption, of  the profits of the property  which he purchased.  This injustice  is all the greater  when we consider that,  on the other hand, at the same time  that the judgment debtor is receiving the fruits of the property  sold to the purchaser during this period,  he  is also  receiving the benefits  from  the  price paid for it which would relieve him  from the obligation of paying his creditor the interest on the  amount of the judgment.   Said section 469 admits of no reasonable interpretation other than that the purchaser is entitled to the  rents received from the tenant during the period of redemption, should the latter not be effected.  And if it is so when the property is  leased, he should have the same right when it is not, for there is no reason whatsoever for discriminating between the  two cases.   And this right of the  purchaser to receive the fruits of the property purchased  by him, implies  his right to its possession and  excludes that of the judgment debtor.<br><br>Said  section  469, in granting the  judgment  debtor  a right of action to require the purchaser to  render accounts during the term  of redemption, speaks of rents, and profits. If the law only referred to the case when the property was leased, the word rents  would have  sufficed.  Add to this, that the law (sec. 465)  also presumes that during the period of  redemption the  purchaser may have paid the land tax on  the property.  All this can mean but one thing— that it  was  the legislator's  intention  that the  purchaser should be  in  the  possession  of  the property during  this period.<br><br>By virtue of the levy, which is the  first step in the  execution preceding the sale  of  the real property, the latter passes into the possession  of  the sheriff, because the word "levy" means a seizure and implies the taking possession of by the person  carrying out the execution  (Iturralde vs. Velazquez and Babasa, 41 Phil., 886).  The law does not say that after the sale, and before the expiration of the period of redemption, the sheriff is to continue in possession of the property levied upon.  It seems logical that this possession passes to the purchaser, since the law decrees that by the sale he has acquired all the rights of the judgment debtor. But, according to the majority opinion, the effect of the sale is to restore the possession, which had passed to the sheriff by  the levy, to the judgment debtor—thus setting  up an anomalous procedure, and  giving to the sale an  effect  contrary to its nature and its purpose.<br><br>As the  basis for its  decision, the majority cites section 468 (Code of  Civil  Procedure),  which grants to the purchaser, during the period of redemption, a right to apply for an  injunction against the person legally in possession of the property,  with  a view to avoiding the deterioration thereof.  This section really presumes that the purchaser is not in possession of the property.  But, it does not presume that the one in possession is precisely the judgment debtor. Construing this section in relation with the others on the same subject, I believe that  it  refers to the case covered by  section 469, wherein the property is in the possession of a tenant,  or a third party to whom the latter  has transferred his  right as such, during the period of redemption. In  this sense, this  section does not  militate against the purchaser's possession and lends  no support to the majority decision.<br><br>Several  decisions of this court, more  or less related to the present case,  are cited in the majority opinion.  The differences between this and some of those, are pointed out.<br><br>The only one of them that  can be held applicable is the case of Riosa vs. Verzosa and Bulan (26 Phil., 86).   But, subsequently, in the case of Diaz vs. Azcune (31 Phil., 213), this court laid down  a different rule, namely, that after the  sale,  the sheriff is bound to place the purchaser  in possession of the property  sold, and  upon the expiration of the period for redemption, if the latter is not effected, to execute the proper deed  of transfer in his  favor. Later on this court rendered another decision in the aforecited case of'Iturralde vs. Velazquez and  Babasa wherein it confirmed the doctrine laid down in the case of Diaz vs. Azcune.   In that case, Velazquez purchased certain  property at an execution sale.  It was alleged that the sale to Velazquez was made  maliciously and in  bad  faith.   The court found this allegation proved and  stated, as one of the grounds for its decision, the  following:<br><br><blockquote>"The fact that the  purchaser, Lucio Velazquez did not attempt to take possession of the land which he had bought, until after the lapse of the statutory period of redemption, is also  another  suspicious circumstance  tending  to  show that he had purposely and fraudulently kept the plaintiff in ignorance of the matter so as not to give him an opportunity to  redeem his land."<br></blockquote><br>In  my  opinion the  judgment appealed  from should be affirmed.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br>Ostrand,  <i>J</i>., with whom concurs Johns, J., concurring and dissenting:<br><br>I agree that the  plaintiff  was  unlawfully ousted by the sheriff or  his deputy and that the appealed judgment therefore must be reversed, but I dissent from certain <i>dicta</i> of the writer of the opinion of the court which may lead to the inference  that the decision in the case of Diaz vs. Azcune is good law and that a sheriff in this  jurisdiction has the power, without an order of a court, to place a purchaser under an execution sale in possession of the purchased land upon the expiration of the period of redemption.  That idea is erroneous and finds no support whatever in our laws.<br><br>It is, of course, evident that where the right to the possession of land is disputed, the determination of the right is a judicial and not  an executive or ministerial function. Under the old  English Common Law the sheriff had certain judicial powers, but these have, for the most part, been taken away from him by  statute (1  Blackstone's Com., Chase's ed., 343, note) and at the1 present day he is, in the United States, usually regarded as  a purely ministerial officer  (Atty.Gen, vs. Squires, 14  Cal. 12).  In Georgia and possibly in a few other states he is by statute authorized to evict the defendant after an execution sale, but the rule is universal that  without a special statutory  provision to that effect,  he cannot under any circumstances by force deprive any person, whether  a defendant in execution or not, of his possession of land without an order from a competent tribunal.  As stated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in the case of Morton vs.  Sanders' Heirs  (19 Am. Dec, 128) :<br><br><blockquote>"A sale of land by<i> fieri facias</i> does not, like the  execution of a <i>habere facias</i>, transfer the actual possession.  It only gives the right to acquire the possession to which the debtor was entitled.   If the debtor were  at the date of the sale in the occupancy of the land, the sheriff could not turn him out and put the purchaser in.   The purchaser could obtain the possession by an ejectment; neither the sheriff nor the circuit court, on  motion, could rightfully deliver to him the possession.  'A fortiori,' a stranger in possession,  could not be evicted  by the sheriff or  by the summary order of the court, without a trial in court by jury."</blockquote><br>In the Philippine Islands the powers and  duties of the sheriff are clearly defined in section 183 of the Administrative Code  which reads  as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 183.  <i>Powers and duties of sheriff</i>.—In the City of Manila and in  each of the several provinces  there shall be an officer  to  be known as the sheriff, whose powers and duties  shall be these:<br><br>" (a) He shall be the legal custodian of the courthouse or of the  quarters set  apart  for the court room and court offices,  including,  in  the City of Manila, the buildings occupied  by the Supreme Court, and the court of the justice of the peace, and he shall be charged with the care and safe- keeping of  all  public property therein, except the books, records, and papers appertaining to the office of the clerk.<br><br>"(b)  He  shall,  in  person or by deputy, attend the sessions of the Court of First Instance, shall enforce proper decorum  in the court room, and preserve good order in its precincts.   To this end he shall carry  into effect the orders. of the court made in this behalf, or of the judge thereof, and shall arrest any person there disturbing the court  or violating the peace.<br><br>"(c)  Except  as otherwise specially provided,  he shall serve all writs,  execute all processes, and carry into effect all orders issuing from the Court of First Instance or made by any  judge thereof; and in the City  of Manila the sheriff shall serve or execute civil writs, processes, and orders issued from any inferior or superior court or by a judge of any such court.  Criminal process, from whatever court or by whatever judge issued, shall be served in the City of Manila by members of the police department of the city, though the same may also be served or executed with equal effect by the sheriff."<br></blockquote><br>It will be observed that with the exception of the power to arrest disturbers  of  the peace under  certain circumstances, the duties and powers of the  sheriff in this jurisdiction  are purely ministerial.  It necessarily follows that in undertaking to dispossess  an occupant of land against the latter's  will  without a judicial order, a sheriff exceeds his powers  and, as  stated by this court in the case of Pabico vs. Ong Pauco  (43 Phil., 572),  he becomes  a mere trespasser.   I may say in passing that in view of the  fact that we are  not  here incumbered with the jury system, there would seem to be no reason why the court which has jurisdiction  of the original case may not, upon sufficient notice to the judgment debtor in possession, issue a writ of possession authorizing the sheriff to eject such  judgment  debtor after the expiration of the period of redemption from the sale.<br><br>In  its effort to  simplify the proceedings by  giving the sheriff  powers not authorized by law, the court  becomes guilty of judicial legislation which  eventually will lead to confusion.  If any legislation is required, it should be left to the discretion of the Legislature.   It is, however,  doubtful whether the granting of additional powers to the sheriffs would work to the advantage  of the public; we may well take  cognizance  of the fact that injustice has  frequently been  done by  high-handed  action  on the part of deputy sheriffs in ejecting, occupants of land sold under execution. By reason of the expenses involved, the majority of  such cases do not come before the courts, but to a person familiar with conditions in the provinces there will be no doubt as to their  existence.<br><br>The plaintiff in this case was unlawfully dispossessed of his land.  He  is, therefore, entitled to restoration  of his possession and to  damages.</div>
