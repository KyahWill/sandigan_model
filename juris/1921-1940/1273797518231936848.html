				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Cebu on the 20th day of February, 1922. Its purpose was to recover the 
possession of a certain piece or parcel of land, known as lot No. 1311 in a 
certain cadastral survey. The conditions upon which the plaintiff, claims the 
right to recover said parcel of land are mentioned in the complaint, and will be 
referred to later. The defendants interposed a general and special defense, 
together with a counterclaim.</p>
<p>The important facts as gathered from the record, and necessary for the 
decision of the present appeal, may be stated as follows:</p>
<p>First. On the 27th day of October, 1907, Marcosa Abellana was the owner of a 
lot located in the municipality of Cebu, Province of Cebu, which lot in a 
cadastral survey was numbered 1311.</p>
<p>Second. That on the 27th day of October, 1907, Dalmacia Abella was the owner 
of an adjoining lot, which in a cadastral survey later made, was known as lot 
No. 1309.</p>
<p>Third. That Dalmacia Abella later died, and the defendant Fortunata Obias, 
her daughter, became the owner of said lot No. 1309 by inheritance.</p>
<p>Fourth. On the 27th day of October, 1907, Marcosa Abellana sold, under a<em> 
pacto de retro</em>, her lot now known as 1311, the lot now in question, for the 
sum of P54, upon the following conditions: That the vendor Marcosa Abellana 
might repurchase said lot on the 27th day of October, 1920, by returning to the 
purchaser the sum of P54; and that during the period from the date of said 
contract up to the 20th day of October, 1920, the purchaser should pay to the 
vendor P.50 per month.</p>
<p>Fifth. That later, the exact date not appearing of record, a cadastral survey 
was presented in the Court of First Instance of the City of Cebu for the 
registration of a large number of lots, including said lot No. 1311.</p>
<p>During the consideration of that action (the cadastral survey), Marcosa 
Abellana, the herein appellant, laid claim to said lot and represented to the 
court that there was a <em>mortgage </em>existing against it in favor of 
Fortunata Obias, one of the appellees herein; and, in accordance with her 
representation, a notation was made upon the certificate of title, which was 
later issued in the name of Marcosa Abeliana, to that effect. The certificate of 
title was issued at Manila on the 21st day of February, 1921. The decree for the 
registration of said parcel of land seems to have been issued on the 29th day of 
April, 1916.</p>
<p>The conditions under which the plaintiff claims her right to recover said lot 
(No. 1311) are, first, by paying to the defendants the amount of said mortgage 
(P54) and, second, that the defendants shall pay to her P10 a month as rent for 
said lot, from the commencement of the present action (February, 1922).</p>
<p>The defendants in fact admit all of the allegations of the plaintiff, except 
the allegation that the contract called a mortgage is in fact a <em>pacto de 
retro</em> and not a mortgage, and their obligation to pay the P10 a month. They 
insist that the title to said lot (No. 1311), by virtue of the lapse of time, 
had been consolidated in them and that they were therefore the owners.</p>
<p>The contention of the defendants that the contract for the payment of the P54 
was a <em>pacto de retro</em> and not a mortgage is not now tenable for the 
reason that, whatever the contract was before the issuance of the certificate of 
title No. 5848 in favor of the plaintiff under the Torrens system, it was noted 
upon said certificate of title, as a part of the decree, as a mortgage and not a 
<em>pacto de retro</em>, with the full knowledge and consent of the defendants. 
That being true, they cannot now show that said contract was not a mortgage. By 
virtue of said decree and notation, which constituted a part of the decree, the 
contract between the plaintiff and the defendants is a mortgage, and if no other 
facts exist, the plaintiff is entitled, upon the payment of the amount due under 
said mortgage, to the possession of the land, or to maintain an action to 
foreclose said mortgage.</p>
<p>There exist, however, other facts clearly established in the record, which 
fully justify the contention of the defendants. They are: That after the 
registration of said lot (No. 1311) and before the commencement of the present 
action, the defendants and the plaintiff entered into a contract, by virtue of 
which the defendants were permitted to build a house upon said lot, which is 
alleged to be of the value of P4,500 and to buy said lot and to pay therefor the 
sum of P200 at any time the plaintiff might demand payment; and that the 
defendants stand ready and willing to pay the said P200 and, naturally, 'during 
the trial offered to pay the same.</p>
<p>While that contract was verbal, no objection was made during the trial to the 
proof, as to its form, showing the existence of said contract. Another fact is 
important, in our opinion, which supports the contention of the defendants, and 
that is, that they were the owners of the adjoining lot No. 1309, and that the 
said house which had been built at great cost, was constructed in a way so as to 
be located upon both lots (Nos. 1311 and 1309). Evidently, the defendants would 
not have built their residence so as to occupy both lots except in good faith, 
believing that their contract of purchase of lot No. 1311 was a valid and 
subsisting contract. The defendants are still willing and ready to comply with 
their contract of purchase of lot No. 1311 and to pay to the plaintiff the said 
sum of P200.</p>
<p>Considering all of the facts of record, we are of the opinion and so decide, 
that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed, with the condition that 
the defendants shall, within the period of ten days after the return of this 
record to the lower court, pay to the plaintiff the sum of P200, and when said 
sum is paid they shall be entitled to a new certificate of title under the 
Torrens system in their names. And, without any finding as to costs, it is so 
ordered.</p>
