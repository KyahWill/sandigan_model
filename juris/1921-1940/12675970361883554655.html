				<BR><STRONG>JOHNS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant was charged in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo with the crime of abduction&nbsp; alleged to have been committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on&nbsp; or about July 17, 1925, in the municipality of Tigbauan, Province of Iloilo, Philippine Islands, the above-named&nbsp; accused&nbsp; did intentionally,&nbsp; maliciously&nbsp; and criminally, and with lewd designs, abduct Magdalena Kahipe, a maiden over 12 but under&nbsp; 18 years of&nbsp; age, and take her to the municipality of Pavia&nbsp; where the defendant had carnal knowledge with&nbsp; her.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<br></blockquote>He plead&nbsp; not guilty,&nbsp; and as a result&nbsp; of the trial&nbsp; was convicted and sentenced to fourteen years, eight&nbsp; months&nbsp; and one&nbsp; day of<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion&nbsp; temporal,</span>&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; endow the&nbsp; offended party in the sum of P500, with the accessory&nbsp; penalties, to recognize the offspring, if&nbsp; any, and to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; costs.<br><br>On appeal, he contends that the lower court erred in sentencing him under the provisions of article 445&nbsp; of the Penal Code,&nbsp; and that he should&nbsp; have been sentenced&nbsp; under article 446, or to one year, eight months and twenty-one days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">JOHNS, J.:</span><br><br>The Attorney-General admits that this point is well taken. It will be noted that the information alleges that the maiden is over 12 but under 18 years of age, and that it does not allege that the&nbsp; abduction&nbsp; was made or&nbsp; that the carnal knowledge was&nbsp; had without&nbsp; her consent.&nbsp; Without such an&nbsp; allegation,&nbsp; where the information alleges that the girl is over&nbsp; 12 but under 18 years&nbsp; of&nbsp; age, it must&nbsp; legally be assumed that both the abduction and the&nbsp; carnal knowledge were with her consent.<br><br>Following the recommendation of the Attorney-General, the sentence of the lower court will&nbsp; be modified and reduced to one year, eight months&nbsp; and twenty-one days&nbsp; of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional,</span> and in all other respects affirmed, with costs. So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avance√±a, C.
