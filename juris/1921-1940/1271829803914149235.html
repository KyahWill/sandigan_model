				G.R. No. 30510, December 21, 1928</h4>
				<H3>ABENCIO TORRES, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAPE, SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT, AND DEOGRACIAS MOLO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original petition for certiorari filed by Abencio 
Torres against the Court of First Instance of Capiz and Deogracias Molo, praying 
that this court annul all the proceedings had, as well as orders and the 
judgment rendered in election contest No. 2447 of the Court of First Instance of 
Capiz, wherein Deogracias Molo is the protestant aiid Abencio Torres, the 
protestee, on the ground that said court had no jurisdiction to try the motion 
of protest filed in said contest, hear the evidence, and decide it, for the 
reason that the facts alleged therein are insufficient to confer jurisdiction on 
the court, inasmuch as the other candidates voted for the same office of 
municipal vice-president at the general elections held in the municipality of 
Makato, Capiz, have not been included as parties therein. 
<p align="justify">As we have before us all the evidence necessary to decide the 
question of jurisdiction raised in the present proceeding by virtue of the 
application and the documents accompanying it, there is no need to order the 
transmission of the original record of the election contest to this court; 
hence, with such evidence before us, we shall proceed to the solution of this 
proceeding. </p>
<p align="justify">The following are the pertinent facts necessary for the 
solution of the questions of procedural<br>law raised here: </p>
<p align="justify">On June 15,1928, the herein respondent Deogracias Molo filed 
the following motion of protest: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Comes now the above-named protestant, and to the court 
respectfully represents and alleges:</p>
<p align="justify">"I. That the protestant and the protestee are both of age, 
residents, and duly qualified electors in election precinct No. 2 of the 
municipality of Makato, Capiz, Philippine Islands, and both had full capacity to 
vote and be voted for in the last elections of June 5, 1928. </p>
<p align="justify">"II. That both the protestant and the protestee were candidates 
for the office of municipal vice-president, with certificates duly presented and 
registered, and as such were voted for, as well as the other candidates for the 
same office at the general elections of June 5, 1928, held at Makato. </p>
<p align="justify">"III. That according to the municipal board of canvassers, the 
protestant received 314 votes, the protestee 318, one Alejandro Legaspi 274, and 
one Baeelides Tabernilla 12, all for the office of municipal vice-president; in 
pursuance whereof said board of canvassers proclaimed the protestee Abencio 
Torres victorious and elected, having obtained a plurality of ballots lawfully 
cast in his favor. </p>
<p align="justify">"IV. That the protestant contests the election of the protestee 
as such municipal vice-president for the next triennium of 1928 to 1931, on the 
following grounds: </p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Because in the aforementioned precinct No. 2, there were 
29 ballots in the name of Alejandro Legaspi for the office of vice-president 
which were awarded to Abencio Torres; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) because 8 ballots in the name of the 
protestant Deogracias Molo were also awarded to said Abencio Torres, the 
protestee; (c) and because 6 other ballots in the name of Baselides Tabernilla 
were also awarded to the said Abencio Torres. </p>
<p align="justify">"V. That, such fraudulent proceedings or acts committed in 
election precinct No. 2, consisted in the chairman of the election, board 
reading one name for another, with the knowledge and consent of its two members, 
thus defrauding the will of the electors and changing the result of the 
election, which should have been as follows: For the office of vice-president: 
Deogracias Molo, the protestant, with 322 votes: Abencio Torres, the protestee, 
with 275 votes; Alejandro Legaspi with 303 votes; and Baselides Tabernilla with 
18 votes. </p>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the protestant prays the court: (1) That a <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena 
duces tecum</span> be issued to the municipal treasurer of Makato, commanding him to 
appear, bring, and exhibit to the court, the ballot boxes and all the papers or 
documents of the election pertaining to precinct No. 2 of said municipality; (2) 
that a <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena duces tecum</span> be issued to the municipal secretary commanding him 
to appear, bring, and exhibit to the court, all the papers and returns 
concerning the canvass made by the municipal council on June 12, 1928; (3) that 
the opening of said ballot boxes of precint No. 2, be ordered, and all the 
ballots contained therein be revised and recounted before the said court; (4) 
that in accordance with such recount and revision, the candidate who thus 
obtained the greatest number of votes be proclaimed elected as municipal 
vice-president; (5) that should it result that the protestee loses this 
contest by his fraudulent election, he be sentenced to pay the costs of this 
instance and all the damages suffered by the protestant, if the latter is 
elected and so proclaimed by the court, to the office of municipal 
vice-president; and (6) that the protestant be granted such further remedy as 
in law may be proper. </p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify">On June 28, 1928, the protestee Abencio Torres filed the 
following motion for dismissal: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The undersigned Abencio Torres, protestee in the aboveentitled 
proceeding, to the honorable court shows: <br></p><p align="justify">"That he hereby enters a special 
appearance to impugn the aforementioned proceeding and therefore prays for the 
dismissal thereof on the following grounds:</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">"GROUNDS</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. That this court has no jurisdiction over the person of the 
herein protestee and, consequently, no power to try and decide this case, other 
than to dismiss it, and </p>
<p align="justify">"2. That in the motion of protest filed by Deogracias Molo, the 
other candidates to the same office of municipal vice-president, Messrs. 
Alejandro Legaspi and Basilides Tabernilla, who respectively obtained votes in 
the last elections in the municipality of Makato, Capiz do not appear either as 
protestants or as protestees.</p>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the undersigned prays the honorable court to issue 
an order dismissing the motion of protest of the protestant Deogracias Molo with 
costs against the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">"Makato for Ibajay, Capiz, June 28, 1928. <br></p><p style="text-align: right;">(Sgd.) "ABENCIO TORRES<br> </p>
<p align="justify">"NOTE.—Copy of this motion was sent by registered mail to the 
protestant Deogracias Molo who lives in Tangalan, municipality of Makato, Capiz, 
as evidenced by the attached post-office receipt." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On July 14, 1928, the other registered candidates voted for the 
office of vice-president,<br>Alejandro Legaspi and Basilides Tabernilla, entered 
a voluntary appearance. </p>
<p align="justify">On July 21, 1928, the protestant Deogracias Molo filed an 
amended protest including all the candidates voted for the office of municipal 
vice-president as protestees. </p>
<p align="justify">On August 4, 1928, after having heard the parties, the 
respondent court denied the motion for dismissal.</p>
<p align="justify">Later on the court rendered judgment in favor of the protestant 
and against the protestee. </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Ferrer vs. Gutierrez David and Lucot (43 Phil., 
795), cited by this court in recent decisions rendered in the election contests 
of Saldana vs. Consunji (G. R. No. 30173 [1928])<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Yumul vs. Palma (G. R. No. 
30174 [1928] )<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> this court laid down the doctrine that in order that the court 
may acquire jurisdiction to try an election contest, it is sufficient to allege 
in the motion of protest the essential facts pointed out by the law for 
conferring jurisdiction over the contest, among which are the following: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) 
that the protestant has duly registered his candidacy and has received votes at 
the election (Tengco vs. Jocson, 43 Phil., 715); (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that the protestee has been 
proclaimed elected in said election (Manalo vs. Sevilla, 24 Phil., 609); and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) 
that the motion of protest must be presented within two weeks after the 
proclamation (Navarro vs. Veloso, 23 Phil., 625; Manalo vs. Sevilla, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>; 
Hontiveros vs. Altavas, 39 Phil., 226). </p>
<p align="justify">It is not contended in the election contest now before us that 
any of these essential facts for conferring jurisdiction has not been alleged, 
but only the fact that the other registered candidates voted for the office of 
municipal vice-president were not included as protestees. </p>
<p align="justify">It is true that in order that a court may decide a case and 
that its decision become effective, it is necessary that it have jurisdiction 
over the subject matter of the controversy and over the parties litigant. 
Jurisdiction over the person of the protestant is acquired by the presentation 
of the protest, and jurisdiction over the person or persons of the protestee or 
protestees, is acquired by the summons.</p>
<p align="justify">Jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy is 
acquired by the court through the presentation of the motion of protest 
alleging the essential facts for conferring jurisdiction. </p>
<p align="justify">While it is true that section 481 of the Election Law as lastly 
amended by Act No. 3387, provides that proceedings for the judicial contest of 
an election shall be by virtue of a protest with summons, and that unless the 
name of the protestee or protestees appear in the motion of protest they 
cannot be summoned, yet the omission of said names does not prevent the court 
from acquiring jurisdiction over the subject matter of the controversy, and over 
the party protestant. The mere act of putting in the name or names of the party 
or parties protested against is not sufficient for the court to acquire jurisdiction over their persons. It is necessary that they be summoned upon the 
protest in the form provided by law in order that the judgment to be rendered 
may affect them. </p>
<p align="justify">This same section 481 provides furthermore, that "the candidate 
whose election is contested and all other registered candidates voted for may 
reply thereto within fifteen days after the summons, or if they have appeared 
without being summoned, within fifteen days from the date of their appearance, 
but in all cases before the beginning of the hearing of the case in court." This 
same provision of law, in stating "the candidate whose election is contested and 
all other registered candidates voted for" seems to indicate that it is not 
necessary that all the registered candidates voted for be made parties 
protestees, but it is sufficient that their names appear in the protest so that 
the sheriff may summon them all. </p>
<p align="justify">Now then; it not only happens that the names of the other 
candidates, Alejandro Legaspi and Basilides Tabernilla, appear in the motion of 
protest, but that, moreover, the latter appear voluntarily, thus conferring 
jurisdiction on the court over their persons. </p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, then, it appears that since the motion of 
protest alleged all the essential facts for conferring jurisdiction on the court 
and included the names of the parties, protestant and protestee, which latter 
was summoned, and of the other registered candidates voted for, who appeared of 
their own free will, the Court of First Instance of Capiz acquired jurisdiction 
to try and decide the case.</p>
<p align="justify">By virtue whereof, and not finding any merit in the present 
proceeding the same is denied and dismissed, with costs against the petitioner. 
So ordered. </p>
