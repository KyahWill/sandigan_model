				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant admits that he killed Silverio Rendora, but alleges that he did so in self-defense.
<p>The Court of First Instance of Manila found him guilty of homicide
as charged in the information, and sentenced him to twelve years and
one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, the accessaries of the law, P1,000 indemnity, and the costs.</p>
<p>Defendant appeals from this judgment, and through counsel contends
that he is exempt from all liability, or at least, it should be
considered in his favor that he acted partly in self-defense, or that
he committed homicide through gross negligence, or, at the very least,
he should be given the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of lack
of intention to cause so great a wrong.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that the deceased Silverio Rendora, and the
defendant, were employees of the Funeraria Nacional where they were
working when the crime took place; that the deceased went over to where
the defendant was and brushed against him; that the defendant struck
the deceased on the right shoulder whereas the latter grabbed him, and
held him by the waist; that the defendant then struck the deceased
again, but in a delicate part of the body, dealing a mortal blow, for
the victim died a few moments later.</p>
<p>The appellant's plea of self-defense cannot be taken into account
because it has not been proved. The deceased did not attack him. His
having brushed against the defendant has not been shown to have been
either deliberate or was done, aggressively. It was the defendant who
began the attack and he cannot be said to have acted in self-defense,
either wholly or in part.</p>
<p>We agree, however, with the trial court in considering the
mitigating circumstance of lack of education, and with the
Attorney-General in also taking into account the mitigating
circumstance of lack of intent to commit so great a wrong as actually
resulted.</p>
<p>With regard to the latter circumstance, the facts in this case lead
us to the same conclusion as that reached from the facts in the case of
United States <em>vs</em>. Rodriguez (23 Phil., 22). And the law
requires that this mitigating circumstance be taken into account,
because the perpetrator cannot be made to answer fully for the act
committed, since there was a discrepancy between the intention and the
result, the latter, being more serious than the former. Intent is an
essential element of a crime; therefore, when the intent is less than
the material act committed, reason, good sense and the public
conscience cannot but fix on the guilty person a mitigated
responsibility.</p>
<p>There being no aggravating circumstance, the two mitigating
circumstances indicated remain intact, and the Attorney-General justly
recommends that the penalty to be imposed upon the appellant for the
homicide be lowered to the one next lower, as provided in article 81,
rule 5, of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2298.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is modified as to the penalty,
and affirmed in all other respects, and the appellant is sentenced to
six years and one day of mayor, and the "costs of both instances. So
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a</em>, <em>C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns,</em> and <em>Villa-Real, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
