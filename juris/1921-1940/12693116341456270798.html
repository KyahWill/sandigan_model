				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BUTTE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The plaintiff-appellant is the widow of
Walter E. Jones who perished in the fire which destroyed his residence
in Pasay, Rizal, in November 24, 1929. His life was insured for $50,000
with the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of Toronto and for
P10,000 with the Employers Liability Assurance Corporation Limited for
both of which the appellee, E. E. Elser, is the Manila representative.
The appellant was the beneficiary named in both policies.
<p> It appears from Exhibit 20 dated January 9, 1930, that the
Manufacturers Life Insurance Company had some doubt as to the cause of
the insured's death and insisted on a thorough investigation. By a
cable dated February 13, 1930, the company again asked for full report
on any suspicious circumstances indicating suicide. On February 15,
1930, Elser made a full report (Exhibit 21) as to the circumstances of
Jones's death and on March 18, 1930, the company approved the claim and
authorized payment.</p>
<p> The Employers Liability Assurance Corporation, after their doubts
as to the cause of Jones's death were cleared up by a thorough
investigation, finally authorized payment of their accident policy on
April 3, 1930. As Elser had assured the Manufacturers Life Insurance
Company that the Employers Liability Corporation, the accident company,
would approve the claim, payment of the policies of the former company
was withheld until the latter company acted finally. Immediately after
the receipt of the cable of April 3, 1930 (Exhibit 26), authorizing
payment of the accident policy, the appellee Elser on April 4, 1930,
paid the appellant in full in the manner hereinafter indicated and the
appellant signed receipts, Exhibits 31 and 32, in full satisfaction of
her claims as the policies of both companies.</p>
<p> The P100,000 due under the policy of the Manufacturers Life
Insurance Company was paid in two checks: one for P20,000 which the
appellant endorsed and delivered to Francisco A. Delgado and one for
P80,000 retained by her. The gist of the present action is that the
appellant accepted, endorsed and delivered to Francisco A. Delgado the
said check for P20,000 under duress and intimidation. Seven thousand
seventeen pesos and two centavos of the said P20,000 was delivered to
the China Banking Corporation in payment of a past due promissory note
executed by Walter E. Jones upon which the appellee P. D. Carman was an
accommodation endorser.</p>
<p> The ultimate facts may be sifted out from the evidence as follows:
In the interval between the date of the death of Jones (November 24,
1929) and April 4, 1930, when the said payments were made, the appellee
Carman and his attorney had several interviews with the appellant there
being present her uncle, Alberto Barretto, and her attorney, Alfredo
Chicote, both of them able and experienced lawyers. In these
conferences Carman and his attorney insisted that Jones had received
the entire proceeds of the said promissory note to the China Banking
Corporation, on which Carman was an accommodation endorser, and that
Jones had assured the endorser that his insurance would respond for
said debt if not paid in his lifetime. They further insisted that a
moral obligation rested on the widow to pay this debt. Mrs. Jones, by
advice of her counsel, agreed to put P50,000 of the insurance money in
escrow until the final determination of her liability, if any, on this
debt. This was not satisfactory to Carman whose attorney thereupon,
under date of March 24, 1930 (Exhibit D) wrote to Barretto:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * that unless Mrs. Angeles Tapia Jones, the
widow, agrees to save Messrs. Carman and Few harmless in this matter, I
shall be obliged to bring an injunction suit tomorrow to prevent E. E.
Elser from paying any insurance moneys whatsoever to her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Unless I have a satisfactory reply from you by
tomorrow, Tuesday, at 8.30 a. m., I regret to state that I shall
proceed to file suit as above stated. I sincerely trust this will be
unnecessary because of the reflection against the good name of the late
Walter E. Jones and of the possibility that, as a result of evidence
which may be brought out in court, grave doubt may arise as to the
manner in which he met his death."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under date of March 25, 1930 (Exhibit C), Carman's attorney wrote
to the insurance companies in care of Elser that Carman claimed an
interest in the proceeds of the said policies on the life of Walter E.
Jones and demanded that no payment should be made until Carman was
fully protected against liability on account of said promissory note.
Under date of April 2, 1930, Carman's attorney wrote a letter to Mrs.
Jones, the appellant, which concludes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In view of the foregoing, therefore, and of the
apparently deliberate delay which has taken place in this matter I
regret to advise that unless the liability of my clients, Messrs.
Carman and Few has been taken care of absolutely by Friday noon, April
4, 1930, I have been instructed to bring action to protect my clients'
interest in respect of insurance on the life of your deceased husband.
I shall regret exceedingly to take such action but my clients feel that
since you have taken the position that they should suffer thru the
deceit practiced by your deceased husband in respect of his insurance
money, you yourself will likewise have to suffer as, in the event suit
is brought »by my clients in this matter, we shall be obliged to allege
not only fraud but that your deceased husband met his death thru other
than accidental means.</p>
  <p> "I am sending a copy of this letter
to Mr. E. E. Elser, the representative of the insurance companies
interested in this insurance, for his information and guidance."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> On the morning of April 4, 1930, as above stated, Elser, in his
office, at the request of the appellant and in the presence of her
counsel Barretto and Chicote, prepared, signed and delivered to the
appellant the check for P80,000 and to Delgado, the check for P20,000.
Thereupon she signed receipts for the same. He testified that although
he had voluntarily and without security loaned money to the appellant,
he never demanded or required that he should be reimbursed out of the
proceeds of said policies and he never took part in any of the
conferences above mentioned relating to the claim of Carman. He further
testified that he notified McFie that he would pay the money due on the
policies immediately upon receiving authority from the companies
regardless of the demands of Carman's attorneys unless he was
restrained by an order of the court. As above stated, he received that
authority on April 3, 1930, and the money was paid on April 4, 1930.</p>
<p> Did Mrs. Jones pay her husband's debt with the China Banking
Corporation upon which Carman was endorser because she was coerced or
intimidated by the statement in the letter of Carman's attorney of
April 2, 1930, as follows: "in the event suit is brought by my clients
in this matter, we shall be obliged to allege not only fraud but that
your deceased husband met his death thru other than accidental means"?</p>
<p> Circumstances may be conceived in which such a veiled threat might
constitute intimidation which would annul a juristic act under the
provisions of article 1267 of the Civil Code. The pertinent part of
said article is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Intimidation exists when one of the contracting
parties is inspired with a reasonable and well-grounded fear of
suffering an imminent and serious injury to his person or property, or
to the person or property of his spouse, descendants or ascendants.</p>
  <p>
"In order to determine the extent of the intimidation, the age, sex,
and status of the person must be considered." Disregarding the opinion
and hearsay evidence, we are convinced that the appellant paid said
debt under the advice of her counsel, Barretto and Chicote, voluntarily
and because she was in dire need of the P80,000 which she received at
the same time she endorsed the check for P20,000 to Delgado. She
testified as follows:</p>

<p>No mention in the foregoing testimony is made of any fear that the
threatened litigation might prove that the appellant's husband had
committed suicide and shame might be brought upon the appellant and her
family. It is plain that the motivating cause and the circumstance that
obliged her to make this settlement was "si no accedia a eso, me
quedaria en miseria absoluta, porque no me querian pagar el producto
del seguro." Her counsel, Barretto, who is also her uncle, testified
that he went to see the appellant and said to her:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Mira, realmente, si tu no te avienes a pagar esta
cantidad te vas a ver imposibilitada, es decir, no vas a poder vivir,
no vas a tener con quo vivir. Si no consigues dinero, te vas a morir de
hambre."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> We agree with the appellant's counsel "que la demandante estaba
persuadida de que estas afirmaciones del demandado Carman y de su
abogado eran completamente falsas puesto que de la investigacion que se
habia hecho por las companias aseguradoras se habia demostrado que la
muerte de Walter E. Jones se habia debido a un accidente y no al
suicidio." (Brief, page 50.) Her attorneys, to whom she exhibited said
letter, would see instantly the futility of the threatened litigation;
and in any event would never have permitted their client, the
appellant, to sacrifice any rights under the coercion and intimidation
of another.</p>
<p> The evidence leaves us without any doubt that the appellant paid
the debt of her husband in order to obtain the release of the balance
of the insurance money of which she was in dire need; and not because
she feared the litigation threatened by Carman. Whether she did not
also act from a sense of moral obligation to pay her husband's debt, we
cannot say. But this is certain; in every step she took she had the
advice of two able lawyers whose advice she accepted and followed.
There is therefore no basis in the evidence for a finding that she paid
her husband's debt because of a reasonable and well grounded fear of
suffering an imminent and serious injury at the hands of the appellee
Carman. (Cf. Martinez <em>vs.</em> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, 15 Phil., 252, and Vales <em>vs.</em> Villa, 35 Phil., 769.)</p>
<p> We have considered all of the assignments of error of the appellant
and find no ground for reversing the decision appealed from, which is
hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p> <em>Street, Malcolm, Abad Santos, Hull, Vickers, Goddard, </em>and <em>Diaz, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<p><strong>VILLA-REAL,</strong> <em>J., </em>with whom concurs <strong>IMPERIAL,</strong><em> J., </em>dissenting:</p>
<p> The court below in dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * Lo mas que resulta de las pruebas
practicadas por la demandante es que ella se nego en la primera
entrevista que tuvo con los demandados a pagar las reclamaciones de
estos, y persistio en su negativa por bastante tiempo hasta que fue
amenazada con un litigio que la impediria disfrutar enseguida del
importe de las po1izas de su finado marido. El hecho de que la
demandante haya pagado las reclamaciones de los demandados para evitar
las consecuencias que el citado litigio podria traer para ella y su
familia, no constituye en si la intimidation que anula el
consentimiento. Para ello es preciso algo mas. Era preciso que se
hubiera privado de su libre voluntad y election. Seria preciso que
hubiera obrado inducida por el miedo, mas bien que por su propio
juicio. Al contrario, la demandante tuvo tiempo y oportunidad para que
su juicio y discernimiento sustituyan el miedo, y resultando que ella
estuvo en todas las ocasiones en que se puso en contacto personal con
los demandados representada y asesorada por su tio carnal D. Alberto
Barretto, Juez que fue de Primera Instancia de estas islas, y por un
abogado notable y respetable como lo es D. Alfredo Chicote, es dificil
creer que dicha demandante haya pagado las reclamaciones de los
demandados mediante dolo e intimidacion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The majority opinion in affirming the decision of the lower court says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The evidence leaves us without any doubt that the
appellant paid the debt of her husband in order to obtain the release
of the balance of the insurance money of which she was in dire need;
and not because she feared the litigation threatened by Carman. Whether
she did not also act from a sense of moral obligation to pay her
husband's debt, we cannot say. But this is certain; in every step she
took she had the advice of two able lawyers whose advice she accepted
and followed. There is therefore no basis in the evidence for a finding
that she paid her husband's debt because of a reasonable and well
grounded fear of suffering an imminent and serious injury at the hands
of the appellee Carman. (Cf. Martinez <em>vs.</em> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, i5 Phil., 252, and Vales <em>vs.</em> Villa, 35 Phil., 769.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It will, therefore, be seen that while the court below found that
the plaintiff paid the claims of the defendants in order to avoid the
consequences that the litigation with which she was threatened might
bring upon her and her family, but held that such threat did not
constitute duress and did not annul her consent, the majority opinion
finds that "the appellant paid the debt of her husband in order to
obtain the release of the balance of the insurance money of which she
was in dire need; and not because she feared the litigation threatened
by Carman." No exception and appeal has been taken from the said
finding of the court below. While it is true that an appellate court
may base its affirmance of a decision on a different theory or on
different grounds provided the question involved was properly before
the lower court (4 Corpus Juris, p. 662), the said finding of the lower
court not being involved in this appeal, this court cannot reverse such
finding.</p>
<p> If the court below found that the plaintiff paid the claims of the
defendants in order to avoid the consequences of the litigation with
which she was threatened by Carman and the majority of this court finds
that if she did not do so she would not be able to collect the balance
of the insurance money of which she was in dire need, the question
arises as to whether such threats and peremptory need of money if she
did not endorse the check of ?20,000 were sufficient to constitute
duress.</p>
<p> Article 1267 of the Civil Code provides that "intimidation exists
when one of the contracting parties is inspired with a reasonable and
well-grounded fear of suffering an imminent and serious injury to his
person or property, or to the person or property of his spouse,
descendants or ascendants, that in order to determine the extent of the
intimidation, the age, sex, and status of the person must be
considered, and that fear of displeasing persons to whom obedience and
respect are due shall not annul a contract."</p>
<p> Three are, therefore, the necessary conditions in order that duress
may vitiate consent and render a contract invalid, to wit: First, that
the intimidation be the determining cause of the contract; second, that
it be unjust; and third, that it be grave.</p>
<p> Was the threat of litigation, the consequences of which would
blacken the memory of the deceased Walter E. Jones and injure the good
name and reputation of his family, the determining cause of the
endorsement of the check of P20,000?</p>
<p> As we have seen, the lower court so found, although the majority
opinion found that the determining cause was her peremptory need of
money and the fear that she could not collect the insurance money.</p>
<p> The next question is, was such cause unjust?</p>
<p> There is no doubt that Mrs. Jones was morally bound to pay the
personal debts of her husband out of the insurance money of which she
was his only beneficiary; but she has not the legal duty to do so. To
threaten her with the bringing of an action, for the success of which
it would be necessary to prove that the late Walter E. Jones committed
suicide and fraud, in order to compel her to pay her husband's personal
debts, is certainly not authorized by any law, and consequently, unjust.</p>
<p> The last question is whether such a threat is grave.</p>
<p> Judging from the earnestness with which the threats were made by
Carman himself and through his attorney orally and by letters not only
to Mrs. Jones directly but also through Barretto to bring an action to
stop the payment of the insurance money, with the assurance that they
have evidence to substantiate their contention, and judging from the
letter written by McFie to E. E. Elser holding him responsible for
double the amount claimed if he paid the insurance policy, there can be
no doubt that McFie and Carman meant what they said. The fact that E.
E. Elser reported to the insurance companies that the death of Jones
was purely accidental and that the report was approved by the insurance
companies concerned, did not prevent the latter from stopping the
payment of the insurance policies if evidence were found subsequently
indicating that Walter E. Jones co emitted suicide. The threats were,
therefore, grave.</p>
<p> If at the time Mrs. Jones endorsed the check for P20,000 she had in
mind the said unjust and grave threats, and the fact that she would be
reduced to misery if she could not collect the insurance money of her
husband of which she was the sole beneficiary, she had no other choice
than that of yielding to the demands of the defendants under such
threats.</p>
<p> Both the lower court and the majority of this court consider the
assistance of Barretto, uncle of Mrs. Jones, and of Alfredo Chicote as
an element counteracting the effect of the threats as they must have
advised her of the futility of such litigation and that she willingly
endorsed the check. The advice given to his niece by Alberto Barretto
is quoted both in the decision appealed from and in the majority
opinion. From the terms of such advice it cannot be inferred that he
indicated to her that she should pay the debt of her deceased husband
as it was her moral obligation to do so; but on the contrary, Barretto
placed before her the dilemma of either acceding to the demand of the
defendants under said circumstances or living in misery. Of course, she
was free to choose between the devil and the deep sea, but whichever
side she chose, her choice could not be legally considered as done with
her free will and volition.</p>
<p> I am, therefore, of the opinion that the decision appealed from should be reversed.</p></div>
