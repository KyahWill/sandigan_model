				<H3>IN RE WILL OF FRANCISCO VARELA CALDERON, DECEASED. FRANCISCO CABMELO VARELA, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. MIGUEL VARELA CALDERON ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I SI O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by Miguel Varela Calderon, Angel Varela Calderon, 
Jesus Varela Calderon, Trinidad Varela Calderon, Paula Varela Calderon, Pilar 
Varela Calderon and Maria Varela Calderon from the judgment rendered by the 
Honorable Mariano A. Albert, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
ordering the allowance and probate of the document marked Exhibit B as the last 
will and testament of the late Francisco Varela Calderon. 
<p>The deceased, a physician by profession, was a Filipino citizen resident of 
the City of Manila where he owned real properties assessed at P188,017.81. He 
traveled abroad for his health and temporarily resided in Hendaye-Plage, France. 
Not feeling very well, but in the full enjoyment of his mental faculties, he 
decided to make his last will and testament (Exhibit B), on April 14, 1930, in 
Paris, France, with the assistance of attorneys F. de Roussy de Sales, Gething 
C. Miller and Henri Gadd. Sometime later, that is on July 15, 1930, he died in 
the Grand-Hotel de Leysln Sanatorium in Switzerland. </p>
<p>On September 20, 1930, the herein petitioner-appellee, Francisco Carmelo 
Varela, filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila, 
praying that said will be admitted to probate. Said petition was opposed by the 
deceased's brothers Jose, Miguel, Angel, Jesus, Trinidad, Paula, Pilar and 
Maria, surnamed Varela Calderon, although, later on, the first mentioned 
opponent withdrew his opposition giving as his reason therefor that it was out 
of respect for the testator's wishes because the will was executed in his own 
handwriting. The grounds of the opposition are as follows: (a) That the will 
sought to be probated was not holographic in character and did not comply with 
the requisites prescribed by article 970 of the French Civil Code; (e) that the 
witnesses to the will did not possess the qualifications required by article 980 
of the French Civil Code; (c) that for not having complied with the requisites 
prescribed by the French law, said will is null and void; (d) that neither has 
it the character of an open will, not having been executed in accordance with 
article 1001 of the French Civil Code; and (e) that the provisions of article 
1007 of the same Code relative to the recording of wills were not complied with 
in connection with the will in question. </p>
<p>The appellants assign the following errors alleged to have been committed by 
the trial court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The trial court erred in declaring that Exhibit B, purporting to be the 
last will and testament of the deceased Francisco Varela Calderon, was a valid 
holographic will made and executed, in accordance with the laws of the French 
Republic. </p>
<p>"2. The trial court, therefore, erred in allowing and admitting to probate 
said document Exhibit B, as the last will and testament of the deceased 
Francisco Varela Calderon." In view of the nature of both assignments of error 
and of the arguments advanced in their support, we shall discuss them jointly. 
</p>
<p>The will in question, Exhibit B, as translated into English reads as follows: 
</p>
<p>"I. FRANCISCO VARELA CALDERON, DOCTOR IN MEDICINE, bachelor, citizen of the 
Philippine Islands and subject of the United States of America, borne and 
domiciled at Manila, Philippine Islands, and actually residing temporarily at 
Hendaye-Plage, France, I declare that the followings are my act of last wills 
and my testament: </p>
<p>"1. I revoke all testamentary dispositions made by myself before this day. 
</p>
<p>"2. I desire that the inhumation of my body be made without any ceremony. 
</p>
<p>"3. I give and bequeath to my children FRANCISCO Carmelo Varela borne at 
Madrid on the twenty fourth of November nineteen hundred five and to Carmen 
Varela borne at Manila, Philippine Islands, on the fourth of October nineteen 
hundred seven who live both actually with me, the totality of my personal 
properties, real estates and mixed including those on which I could have the 
power of disposition or designation whatsoever, by equal parts in all 
properties, instituting them my residuary legatee.</p>
<p>"4. I name for my testamentary executor, without bail, my son, Francisco 
Carmelo Varela, to his default my daughter Carmen Varela, to the default of this 
one my brother Miguel Varela Calderon and to the default of my brother, Mr. 
Antonio Gutierrez del Campo.</p>
<p>"In witness whereof I have in this one my act of last wills and testament, 
written dated and signed entirely by my hand, applied my signature and my seal 
at Paris, this fourteenth of April nineteen hundred thirty. </p></blockquote>

<p>"Pour traduction certified conforme, </p>
<p>"Manille, le 15 September 1930."</p></blockquote>
<p>The original will was executed in the French language and had been written, 
dated and signed by the testator with his own hand, with the exception of the 
attestation clause which appears at the bottom of the document. This fact is 
proved by the testimony of the appellee and his other witnesses, including the 
depositions, and is admitted by the appellants. </p>
<p>The petition for the allowance and probate of said will is based on the 
provisions of article 970 of the French Civil Code which considers as a 
holographic will that which is made or executed, dated and signed by the 
testator in his own handwriting without the necessity of any other formality, 
and on section 635 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force in this jurisdiction 
which provides that a will made out of the Philippine Islands in accordance with 
the laws in force in the country in which it was made and which may be allowed 
and admitted to probate therein, may, also be proved, allowed and recorded in 
the Philippine Islands in the same manner and with the same effect as if 
executed in the latter country. Both provisions of law literally copied from the 
English text, read as follows: "</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">(Article 970, French Civil Code)</p>
<p>"A holographic will is not valid unless it is entirely written, dated, and 
signed by the testator. No other formality is required. "(Article 635, Code of 
Civil Procedure)</p>
<p>"Will made out of the Philippine, Islands.-A will made out of the Philippine 
Islands which might be proved and allowed by the laws of the state or country in 
which it was made, may be proved, allowed, and recorded in the Philippine 
Islands, and shall have the same effect as if executed according to the laws of 
these Islands." </p></blockquote>
<p>As we have already said, it is an admitted fact that the will was written, 
dated and signed by the deceased testator, for which reason, there is no doubt 
that it had been made and executed in accordance with article 970 of the French 
Civil Code were it nof for the attestation clause which appears at the bottom of 
the document. </p>
<p>The appellants contend that the addition of said clause has entirely vitiated 
the will, because it ceased to be a holographic will, neither does it possess 
the requisites of a public or open will in accordance with the French law. The 
court which originally took cognizance of the case decided that such 
circumstance does not invalidate the will. We concur in said opinion and hold 
that a clause drawn up in such manner is superfluous and does not affect in any 
way the essential requisites prescribed for holographic wills by the French law, 
and, consequently, it has not invalidated the will nor deprived it of its 
holographic character. In reaching this conclusion, we base our opinion not only 
on the clear and conclusive provisions of article 970 of the French Civil Code 
and on the decisions of the French Court of Appeals cited in the appellee's 
brief, but principally on the fact established in the depositions made by 
practicing attorneys F. de Roussy de Sales, Gething C. Miller and Henri Gadd of 
Paris, France, who emphatically declared that the will in question did not lose 
its holographic character by the addition of the aforementioned attestation 
clause and that it may be allowed to probate in conformity with the French laws 
under which it had been made and executed.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we believe it unnecessary to consider and pass upon 
the other grounds invoked by the opposition consisting in the incapacity of the 
three witnesses who signed at the end of the attestation clause and the absence 
of the requisites prescribed by the French Civil Code for the execution of open 
wills, inasmuch as the attorney for the appellee has conclusively proved that 
the will in question is holographic, and we have so held and decided. </p>
<p>The order appealed from, being in conformity with the law, is hereby affirmed 
in toto, with costs against the appellants. So ordered. </p>
<p>Avancena, C. J., Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Hull, 
Vickers, and Butte, JJ., concur. </p></div>
