				G.R. No. 20159, March 05, 1923</h4>
				<H3>HILARION TIMBOL, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE ANACLETO DIAZ, JUDGE OF THE SIXTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT, THE SHERIFF OF TARLAC AND HIS DEPUTY, THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF CONCEPCION, TARLAC, AND PEDRO N. LIONGSON, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record of the present case that the respondent Pedro N. 
Liongson holds a Torrens certificate of title for a tract of land including lot 
No. 802 of the cadaster of the municipality of Concepcion, Tarlac, which 
certificate is based on a decree of the Court of Land Registration in an 
ordinary land registration proceeding. The petitioner Hilarion Timbol holds a 
certificate of title based on a free patent issued under Chapter 4 of Act No. 
926.
<p>At the beginning of the cadastral registration which embraced said lot No. 
802, both Hilarion Timbol and Pedro N. Liongson appeared and laid claim to the 
ownership of the lot on the strength of their respective certificates of title. 
The trial court held that the title shown by the certificate of Liongson 
prevailed over the free patent certificate of title presented by Timbol and in a 
decision dated June 29, 1922, adjudicated the land to the former. Timbol 
excepted to the decision and filed a motion for a new trial but failed to bring 
the motion to the attention of the court and did not appeal. On September 6, 
1922, the court, on motion of Liongson, declared the decision final and ordered 
that a final decree for said lot No. 802 be issued and that thereafter a writ of 
possession be issued in favor of Liongson. At the hearing of the motion Timbol 
appeared by his co.unsel in opposition, but again failed to appeal.</p>
<p>Timbol as petitioner in the present case alleges that the court below 
exceeded its jurisdiction in attempting, in a cadastral proceeding, to pass upon 
the title to land already registered and in ordering that a final decree of 
registration be issued for such land. He therefore asks that a writ of 
certiorari issue directing the respondent judge to forward to this Court for 
review a certified copy of such portions of the record of the aforesaid 
cadastral proceedings as relate to lot No. 802; that, thereupon, the decisions, 
orders, and decrees of said Court of First Instance of Tarlac, relative to 
cadastral lot No. 802 be declared null and void and in excess of its legal 
powers and jurisdiction; and that the petitioner Hilarion Timbol be declared the 
absolute and exclusive owner of said cadastral lot No. 802, with the crops and 
improvements thereon.</p>
<p>The petition must be denied for two reasons. In the first place, the 
petitioner appeared in the cadastral case and had an adequate remedy by appeal. 
Under such circumstances, certiorari will not lie.</p>
<p>In the second place, we do not think the court below exceeded its 
jurisdiction in undertaking, in a cadastral case, to determine the relative rank 
of the two certificates of title in question and, in its ultimate analysis, that 
is the effect of the court's action. The court erred in ordering the issuance of 
a new final decree in favor of the respondent Liongson; it should have limited 
itself to ordering the cancellation of both certificates of title and the 
issuance of a new transfer certificate of title in favor of Liongson, in which 
new certificate the land should be described in accordance with the results of 
the cadastral survey. But the new decree rests on the former decree which is not 
reopened or set aside; the error of the court therefore does not go to the 
jurisdiction and cannot be reached by certiorari.</p>
<p>The petitioner may have been misled by our statement in the case of Pamintuan 
<i>vs</i>. San Agustin (43 Phil., 558) that "in cadastral cases the jurisdiction 
of the court over lands already registered is limited to the necessary 
correction of technical errors in the description of the lands, provided such 
corrections do not impair the substantial rights of the registered owner, and 
that such jurisdiction cannot operate to deprive a registered owner of his 
title."</p>
<p>This statement while in the main true is, perhaps, a little too broad in so 
far as it may be construed to exclude from the jurisdiction of the court the 
power to determine the priority of over-lapping or over-lying registered titles. 
An examination of the decision in which the statement occurs will show that it 
is based on the self-evident proposition that when a title has been finally and 
definitely settled in a registration proceeding by a decree of a court of 
competent jurisdiction, the decree cannot be reopened in a cadastral case, a 
proceeding of the same general character. There is nothing in this proposition 
which militates against allowing the court in a cadastral case to determine 
which one of several conflicting registered titles shall prevail. This power 
would seem to be necessary for a complete settlement of the title to the land, 
the express purpose of cadastral proceedings, and must therefore be considered 
to be within the jurisdiction of the court in such proceedings. And, as already 
stated, no final decree of registration was reopened or set aside by the court 
below in the present instance.</p>

a patent, see De los Reyes <i>vs</i>. Razon (38 Phil., 480).</p>
<p>The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied without costs.</p><i>Araullo,
