				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 16,  1917, Carlos  N. Francisco  sold the  land belonging to him, described in transfer certificate of title No. 3598 to Telesforo Calasan with a right of repurchase, which was noted  on the back thereof on  May 16,  1917. Telesforo Calasan, in turn, sold this land to Ponciano Medel on December 4, 1926.<br><br>On January 17, 1927 Ponciano Medel brought this action in the Court of First Instance for the purpose of compelling the register of  deeds to cancel the  notation of the right of repurchase on the title to this land on  account of the time  within which to exercise said right having expired, Ponciano Medel contends that the period within which to exercise this right is four years while Carlos N. Francisco, on the other hand, contends that it is ten  years.  The trial court admitting that the period is ten years and it  not having expired yet when this action was filed,  denied the petition.<br><br>The only question involved in this appeal  is whether the period for the repurchase of  the land, which Carlos N. Francisco reserved the right to do when the  sale was made, is four or ten years.   The stipulation is noted on the title in the following terms:<br><br><blockquote>"This  sale is  made with  the condition that the vendor Carlos N. Francisco  reserves the right to  repurchase,  at the cost price of this sale, a fourth part of the land above described from  which he can remove  earth for  the sole and exclusive use of his earthen jar factory when,  the same is established."</blockquote><br>According to  article 1508 of the Civil Code, the  right of repurchase,  in the absence of any express agreement, lasts  four years  and, in  case  of stipulation,  the period shall  not exceed ten years.<br><br>A term means  a period of time within  which an act may,  or must, be performed or a fact take place.   Applied to the right of repurchase, it  is the time within which this right may be exercised.  It necessarily  involves  a beginning and an  end of time.  The clause of the contract quoted does  not express,  in  this sense, a  stipulation  of time.   According to its terms, the vendor Carlos N. Francisco  reserved the right to redeem the land <i>when he might have  an  earthen jar factory</i>.  This does not mean that  he could repurchase  the  land any time before he  had the earthen  jar factory,  but <i>when  he had  it </i>.  That  is especially so when it  is taken into  consideration that there is a condition imposed for the repurchase of the land, to wit that it is to be used solely and exclusively for the manufacture of earthen jars.  According to  this clause of the contract, it is evident that the establishment of  an earthen jar factory is the fact that would give  birth to the right of repurchase.   In this sense, what is really stipulated  in the clause is  the suspension of  the right of  repurchase until the earthen jar factory has been established.   If this is all, the meaning of this clause is  then clear  that the parties did not stipulate any time for exercising the right of repurchase; and, in accordance with  the law, the right lasts no  longer than four years from the date of the contract, which period has  already  expired without having been  made use  of.<br><br>These  four years must be counted from the date of the contract  notwithstanding the suspension of the  exercise  of the right of repurchase, because the stipulation of this suspension  is null  and void,  it having  exceeded  four years, which constitutes  the legal period of this right.   (Santos vs.  Heirs of  Crisostomo and Tiongson,  41  Phil., 342.)<br><br>The judgment appealed from is reversed and it is held that the  right of repurchase reserved by the vendor Carlos N. Francisco has expired, and the cancellation by the register of deeds of the notation  of this right on the title must be, as it is hereby,  ordered, without special pronouncement as to costs.  So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson,  Street,  Malcolm,  Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
