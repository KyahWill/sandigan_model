				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition to review case No. 27378 of the Public Service Commission, filed by Esteban C. Espiritu who does not agree with the decision of said commission denying his application for a certificate&nbsp; of public convenience to construct and establish an ice plant capable of producing five tons daily, in the&nbsp; municipality of Rosario, Province&nbsp; of Cavite, and to sell ice not only in said municipality but also in those of Caridad, Noveleta,&nbsp; Imus, Kawit, Bacoor, General Trias, Tanza, Naic and Indang.&nbsp; His petition is based upon the fact that, according to him, the commission erred: (1)&nbsp; In denying his motion for a new trial; (2) in not declaring that there can be&nbsp; no ruinous competition in&nbsp; the ice business;&nbsp; (3) in not declaring&nbsp; that&nbsp; the ice deposits established by his oppositors in the municipalities stated by them in their pleadings are&nbsp; not beyond the supervision of the commission;&nbsp; (4) in not&nbsp; declaring that the public convenience demands&nbsp; the establishment of an ice&nbsp; plant&nbsp; in the municipality of Rosafio; and (5) in denying his petition to be permitted to&nbsp; establish,&nbsp; erect&nbsp; and operate an ice plant in the municipality of Rosario, Province of Cavite, to sell said commodity therein and in&nbsp; the municipalities of Noveleta,&nbsp; Caridad, Bacoor,&nbsp; Kawit, Imus,&nbsp; General Trias, Tanza, Naic and Indang all within said province.<br><br>When the applicant filed his&nbsp; pleading that gave&nbsp; rise to case No. 27378 of the Public Service&nbsp; Commission, seeking permission, to erect and establish an ice plant capable of producing&nbsp; five tons&nbsp; of ice daily, in said municipality, for the purpose of selling it in said&nbsp; municipalities at the rate of 2 centavos a kilo when sold at the plant and at 2 1/2 centavos when delivered at the homes of the consumers, the following persons filed opposition: (1) Fortunate G. Lapid, owner of the Rizal Ice Plant established in the municipality of Paranaque, Rizal, who claimed he&nbsp; could supply a&nbsp; sufficient quantity of ice to take care of his customers residing: in the municipalities where&nbsp; the applicant proposes to establish&nbsp; said&nbsp; service;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Lapid&nbsp; &amp; Flores&nbsp; who, in turn, claimed to have&nbsp; another&nbsp; ice plant formerly called&nbsp; Cavite Ice Plant Company established in Cavite, now&nbsp; known&nbsp; as the Cavite Ice Plant Co., Inc., stated that&nbsp; said ice plant produces ten tons of ice daily; that it has always had on hand, daily, two hundred and fifty blocks in its <i>bodegas</i> at the disposition of its customers; and that for the convenience of the latter it&nbsp; has established deposits of said commodity in&nbsp; each and&nbsp; every one of the&nbsp; municipalities of Salinas, Rosario, Tanza, Malabon or General Trias, Imus, Bacoor&nbsp; and Naic; and (3) that the San Miguel Brewery claimed to have ice&nbsp; distributors in each and every&nbsp; one of the municipalities mentioned by the applicant in his application.<br><br>The Public Service Commission, after&nbsp; hearing the interested parties, decided to deny the applicant's petition and ordered the dismissal of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; instituted by him&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that it was neither necessary nor prudent to permit the establishment of a new plant in the Province&nbsp; of Cavite,&nbsp; to avoid&nbsp; a ruinous&nbsp; competition which&nbsp; would destroy the ice&nbsp; business actually existing in said province or, at least, in the municipalities stated by the applicant, wherein the oppositors who already have established factories and deposits have invested a&nbsp; considerable capital.<br><br>The first error relied upon by the applicant in his brief cannot be taken&nbsp; into consideration on account of his own abandonment and neglect. If it is true that the oppositor Cavite Ice Plant&nbsp; Co., Inc., failed to maintain&nbsp; its ice deposits in&nbsp; said municipalities on&nbsp; account of&nbsp; having transferred them to the oppositor San Miguel Brewery after the rendition&nbsp; of the decision the&nbsp; review of which is&nbsp; sought, as affirmed by him in his motion for&nbsp; a new hearing, he should have opportunely informed the Public Service Commission thereof and&nbsp; not&nbsp; fold&nbsp; his arms, as he did,&nbsp; letting almost two years pass before&nbsp; filing his said motion.&nbsp; Public interest requires that proceedings already terminated should not be altered at every step.&nbsp; The rule of <i>non quieta movere</i> prescribes that what has already been terminated should not be disturbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the&nbsp; law provides that motions for new trial be filed within thirty days after notice of the&nbsp; decision and judgment&nbsp; (sec.&nbsp; 145, Act No.&nbsp; 190), or within a reasonable time if filed for the first time in this court, after a&nbsp; showing that the alleged newly&nbsp; discovered evidence constituting the basis of said motions could not have been discovered before notwithstanding the exercise of due diligence (sec. 497, Act No. 190).&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be&nbsp; noted that the applicant's motion was not presented&nbsp; in&nbsp; this court but in the&nbsp; Public Service Commission&nbsp; and it gives no explanation&nbsp; why it was not filed on time but after the lapse of almost two years.&nbsp; The decision of the Public Service Commission was promulgated&nbsp; on February 29,&nbsp; 1936; the last hearing took place on October 5, 1934, and said motion for a new hearing was filed only&nbsp; on April 17,&nbsp; 1936.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the applicant was aware&nbsp; of the alleged&nbsp; transfer of&nbsp; the Cavite Ice Plant during the&nbsp; pendency of the case,&nbsp; as claimed in his motion, to Gustav Mattman, a Swiss, who incorporated it, named it Cavite Ice Plant Co., Inc., and later established the ice deposits in the municipalities above stated; and if he was aware of the assignment or transfer of said&nbsp; company's business to the oppositor San Miguel Brewery, which facts certainly do not appear <i>prima&nbsp; face</i> in his motion alleging nothing but a&nbsp; mere conclusion, and yet&nbsp; kept silent until April 17,&nbsp; 1936, he undoubtedly incurred&nbsp; neglect and this neither vested&nbsp; him with any right to&nbsp; nor justifies the alteration of the decision and judgment in&nbsp; question.<br><br>The fact that Gustav Mattman is not a Filipino citizen is of no avail because he&nbsp; acquired his rights&nbsp; in the former Cavite&nbsp; Ice Plant long before the case&nbsp; under consideration was submitted to&nbsp; the Public Service Commission&nbsp; for decision which, as stated,&nbsp; took place on October 5,&nbsp; 1934; and consequently long before the taking effect of the Constitution of the Philippines containing the prohibition against all persons not Filipino citizens to establish or operate a public&nbsp; service (Art. XIII, sec.&nbsp; 8, of the Constitution).&nbsp;&nbsp; The universally accepted rule is that a constitution, as any other statute, has no retroactive effect except when it so expressly provides&nbsp; and the Constitution of the&nbsp; Philippines certainly does not do so,&nbsp; much less&nbsp; if it affects vested&nbsp; rights (6 R. C. L., 33, 34,&nbsp; 310; art. 3, Civil Code; <i>In re</i> Will of Riosa, 39&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 23).&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; Gustav Mattman is&nbsp; not an applicant in said case but&nbsp; a mere oppositor.<br><br>The second error attributed by the applicant to the commission is based upon false premises.&nbsp; In the ice business as in every public service&nbsp; business there&nbsp; can be ruinous competition, not because the commission&nbsp; which exercises direct supervision over the companies engaged in said&nbsp; business may prevent it by prescribing therefor&nbsp; a fixed rate for observance by everybody under the same circumstances or operating in the same locality or within the same territory, but&nbsp; because if&nbsp; the production&nbsp; of said article becomes greater than&nbsp; the&nbsp; demand&nbsp; and the&nbsp; applicant is permitted to share&nbsp; in the business,&nbsp; there&nbsp; being already more&nbsp; than two ice plants in the same territory, the latter would go to ruin and&nbsp; the applicant would&nbsp; not in the&nbsp; least&nbsp; profit thereby.<br><br>The last three errors assigned by the applicant are not more justified than the former two.<br><br>In fact if the oppositors Cavite Ice Plant Co., Inc., and San Miguel Brewery have ice deposits and ice&nbsp; distributors, respectively, in the municipalities where the applicant proposes to establish the same business, as&nbsp; the two are under the supervision&nbsp; and authority of the&nbsp; commission, so also necessarily are their agencies, deposits,&nbsp; distributors, properties or&nbsp; whatever&nbsp; they may be,&nbsp; in&nbsp; said municipalities, as expressly provided by section 13&nbsp; of Act No. 3108 which reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 13. The Commission shall have general supervision and regulation of, jurisdiction and control&nbsp; over, all public utilities, and&nbsp; also&nbsp; over their property, property rights, equipment, facilities and franchises so far as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this Act.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"</blockquote>The evidence conclusively shows that the oppositor Cavite Ice Plant Co., Inc., has at all times a deposit of two hundred&nbsp; and fifty blocks of&nbsp; ice in its plant and a sufficient quantity thereof in&nbsp; its deposits, which&nbsp; are&nbsp; open day and night, established in the municipalities of Salinas, Rosario, Tanza, Malabon&nbsp; or General Trias, Imus, Bacoor and Cavite, all&nbsp; at the disposal&nbsp; of its customers; that the latter have never experienced the lack of said commodity; and that the oppositors Rizal Ice Plant and San Miguel&nbsp; Brewery likewise send their&nbsp; ice&nbsp; to said points or to the majority thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following conclusion of the commission&nbsp; is supported by the evidence:<br><blockquote>"The conditions obtaining in the municipality of Rosario, Province&nbsp; of Cavite,&nbsp; and in the other&nbsp; municipalities above stated&nbsp; * *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; are such&nbsp; that&nbsp; they do not warrant the grant of the certificate of public convenience sought for the establishment and operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; ice plant. *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; we are convinced that the production of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Cavite Ice Plant&nbsp; in the&nbsp; municipality of&nbsp; Caridad&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * and said plant's supply of ice thus&nbsp; produced in the municipality of Rosario and others already stated are more than sufficient to take care of the needs of the inhabitants thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"</blockquote>This&nbsp; being&nbsp; so, and as&nbsp; our authority to modify or&nbsp; set aside a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; or order of the Public Service Commission is limited by law to cases in which said decision or order is not&nbsp; clearly supported&nbsp; by&nbsp; sufficient evidence (sec.&nbsp; 35, Act No. 3108), it follows&nbsp; that, the&nbsp; errors attributed to&nbsp; the commission by the applicant being&nbsp; groundless, his application must be denied and the commission's decision affirmed in all respects.<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; application is denied, thus affirming the decision of the Public Service Commission, with costs to said applicant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
