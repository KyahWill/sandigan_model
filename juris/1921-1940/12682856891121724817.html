				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants are&nbsp; accused of the crime of murder, the information alleging "that on or about June 17,&nbsp; 1924, in the municipality of Lumbang, Province of Laguna, Philippine Islands, the&nbsp; accused, being father&nbsp; and son, voluntarily, illegally and criminally, with premeditation and treachery, conspiring together and aiding each other and&nbsp; with deliberate intention&nbsp; to kill, attacked and&nbsp; assaulted Perfecto Abiog with bolos which they were carrying&nbsp; and with the aid and cooperation of&nbsp; four dogs belonging to them, inflicting on said Perfecto Abiog various wounds, necessarily mortal,&nbsp; in the head and on different part's of the body, which wounds&nbsp; were the direct&nbsp; and only cause of the immediate death&nbsp; of said Perfecto Abiog."&nbsp; The court below found them guilty of homicide and sentenced each of them to suffer&nbsp; fourteen years, eight months and one day&nbsp; of r<span style="font-style: italic;">eclusion&nbsp; temporal,</span> with the&nbsp; accessory penalties prescribed by law, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased Perfecto Abiog in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; From this sentence both of the defendants appealed to this&nbsp; court.<br><br>Though the defendants assert that the fatal wounds were inflicted by Alfredo Somonte only, there can&nbsp; be no doubt whatever that both of them participated in the commission of the crime and the only question for&nbsp; determination is whether the killing of the deceased was justified&nbsp; on the ground of self&nbsp; defense.<br><br>The crime was committed in the evening&nbsp; of June 17, 1924.&nbsp; Earlier&nbsp; in the day the deceased and the defendants were aiding some of&nbsp; their neighbors in planting rice in adjoining fields.&nbsp; While they were resting after the noon meal, the defendant Bruno Somonte accused Perfecto Abiog, the deceased, of having allowed his carabaos to destroy his,&nbsp; Bruno's, cornfield.&nbsp; Abiog answered that that could hardly be possible because Bruno's dogs had driven the carabaos away before any damage&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; done to the cornfield.&nbsp; After some further rather acrimonious remarks Bruno drew his bolo and attacked Abiog with it, but only succeeded in striking Abiog's hat (<span style="font-style: italic;">salacot</span>) which fell to the ground.&nbsp; Through the intervention of the other persons present, Bruno and Abiog were separated from each other.&nbsp; There is some testimony&nbsp; to the effect that upon being so separated, Bruno said to Abiog: "You will have supper in heaven tonight" and that he&nbsp; said&nbsp; to his son, the other defendant Alfredo Somonte, who was then present: "If you cannot fight Perfecto Abiog, I will kill you."<br><br>About 6 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day Abiog, after caring for his carabaos and picketing them on his land a short distance from the house of the accused, went over to the house of one Teodora Mercado in the same vicinity. Upon arriving there he seated himself on a bamboo&nbsp; bench or <span style="font-style: italic;">lancape&nbsp; </span>under the house and asked Teodora for some <span style="font-style: italic;">buyo&nbsp; </span>which&nbsp; he&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; to chew.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution, while Abiog was sitting on the bench, the two accused armed with bolos came to the house.&nbsp; Bruno approached Abiog and began to renew the quarrel had earlier in the day.&nbsp; During the ensuing&nbsp; discussion, he saw his&nbsp; chance to&nbsp; grasp the&nbsp; handle of Abiog's bolo, a fighting bolo about 15 inches long, and drawing it from&nbsp; its scabbard&nbsp; dealt Abiog a blow with it on the&nbsp; left&nbsp; cheek.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abiog succeeded&nbsp; in picking up&nbsp; a dull working bolo belonging to Teodora Mercado with which he&nbsp; defended himself, but being attacked from behind by Alfredo Somonte&nbsp; and&nbsp; molested by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants' dogs, he&nbsp; finally fell to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; While he&nbsp; was lying&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground, Alfredo continued to inflict wounds upon him and he&nbsp; died almost&nbsp; instantly.&nbsp; The body of the deceased&nbsp; exhibited fourteen wounds and ten dog bites.&nbsp; Seven of the bolo wounds were in the back of&nbsp; the head, each of them necessarily fatal.<br><br>The defendants' story is to the effect that Abiog harbored resentment against them because they had set their dogs on&nbsp; his carabaos as a result of which the carabaos were badly wounded, and that Abiog was the aggressor on both of the occasions referred to in the evidence for the prosecution.&nbsp; As to what happened at the house of Teodora Mercado,&nbsp; they&nbsp; testify that&nbsp; while&nbsp; looking&nbsp; for two&nbsp; of&nbsp; his dogs, Bruno came to Teodora's&nbsp; house and found&nbsp; Abiog there; that not finding the dogs Bruno was about to leave the house when&nbsp; Abiog arose and placing his hands&nbsp; on&nbsp; the handle of his bolo, said: "It is a happy coincidence that&nbsp; I have seen you again;" that Abiog thereupon drew the bolo and attacked Bruno who defended himself with&nbsp; his own bolo; that&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of the lack of headroom under the house and the consequent difficulty of swinging their bolos, neither of the two were wounded during the struggle which took place there;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Bruno stumbling&nbsp; over a pile of wood, fell outside&nbsp; of the house where the fight continued and&nbsp; that Abiog&nbsp; there succeeded in inflicting two wounds on&nbsp; him, one on&nbsp; the right shoulder and the other on the left side of the&nbsp; face; that from the effect&nbsp; of these wounds Bruno&nbsp; began to stagger&nbsp; and dropped&nbsp; his&nbsp; bolo&nbsp; without having been able to wound&nbsp; Abiog; that at&nbsp; that&nbsp; moment Alfredo arrived and seeing his father in danger of being killed drew his bolo and attacked Abiog; and that during the ensuing struggle between them Alfredo succeeded in disarming Abiog by applying a jiu jitsu trick which Abiog himself had taught him; that&nbsp; Abiog then reached for Bruno's bolo and knowing that Abiog was an&nbsp; expert fencer and that he might&nbsp; be victorious if the struggle continued, Alfredo gave him a bolo cut in the back of&nbsp; the head and Abiog fell to&nbsp; the ground where Alfredo inflicted several more wounds upon him so as to be sure of incapacitating him for further aggression.&nbsp; Alfredo&nbsp; also states that in disarming Abiog it was necessary&nbsp; for him&nbsp; to grasp the blade of the latter's bolo and that in doing so, three of the fingers&nbsp; of his left hand were wounded.&nbsp; The&nbsp; wounds&nbsp; were not serious and, according to the certificate of the physician who examined&nbsp; them, would&nbsp; require only twelve days for their&nbsp; healing.<br><br>For various reasons&nbsp; we cannot accept the defendants' version of the occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in conflict with their statements made to the justice of the peace and the chief of police immediately&nbsp; after the&nbsp; commission of the crime and is otherwise somewhat improbable. It&nbsp; is shown by the defendants' own uncontradicted testimony that the deceased was an expert bolo fencer and&nbsp; had been giving lessons in the&nbsp; art to a class&nbsp; of which&nbsp; Alfredo&nbsp; Somonte was&nbsp; a member for several months.&nbsp; It is also shown and not contradicted that his bolo was very sharp and being a fighting bolo, it must have had a sharp point.&nbsp; If so, it seems incredible that Abiog should&nbsp; have been unable to&nbsp; wound Bruno during the struggle downstairs in the house if&nbsp; he had been&nbsp; armed with his own bolo and had&nbsp; the intention of&nbsp; injuring the latter.&nbsp; The vertical&nbsp; distance from the ground to the&nbsp; floor of the upper story was sufficient to enable a man of ordinary height to stand upright.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances an expert fencer could, and undoubtedly would, have used the point of the bolo.&nbsp; The testimony for the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; that during the struggle Abiog was armed only&nbsp; with Teodora Mercado's working bolo, seems much more&nbsp; probable.<br><br>It is also to be noted that the defendants claim that Abiog was using his&nbsp; own&nbsp; bolo, which&nbsp; had a very&nbsp; sharp edge, and&nbsp; that he was unwounded at the time&nbsp; Alfredo&nbsp; entered into the struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, it seems rather&nbsp; improbable that Alfredo could have&nbsp; grasped the blade of that bolo and wrested it&nbsp; from his adversary&nbsp; without&nbsp; receiving more serious cuts on&nbsp; the inside of his hand than those exhibited by him; it is more likely that&nbsp; the bolo he grasped was a dull&nbsp; working bolo and that Abiog was in&nbsp; a wounded condition when the bolo was taken away from him.<br><br>The dog bites found on&nbsp; the&nbsp; body of the deceased also show that the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; did&nbsp; not tell the truth&nbsp; on the witness stand.&nbsp; Their counsel suggest that the bites might have been inflicted by hungry dogs after the death of Abiog and&nbsp; while his body was&nbsp; lying&nbsp; oh the&nbsp; ground in&nbsp; front of Teodora Mercado's house, but if that had been the case the wounds would have had a different appearance and would not have been&nbsp; found only&nbsp; on the legs of the body.<br><br>Counsel for the defendants call attention to various discrepancies and minor contradictions in the&nbsp; testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and insist&nbsp; that for this reason their testimony should be disregarded.&nbsp; We do not think so.&nbsp; It is possible that some of the witnesses allowed their imagination too wide a range and made positive statements as&nbsp; to facts of which they were not certain from their own observation, but after&nbsp; a careful examination of the record we&nbsp; are&nbsp; convinced that they in the main told the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolute&nbsp; accuracy in statement of details can hardly be expected from&nbsp; comparatively ignorant witnesses.<br><br>That&nbsp; Teodora Mercado at first failed to disclose all the facts to which she afterwards testified does not necessarily render her testimony unworthy of&nbsp; belief.&nbsp; The crime was committed at her house; her bolo was used by one of the contending parties and probably had blood on it;&nbsp; and upon the arrival of the chief of&nbsp; police at her house for the purpose of investigating the crime, she&nbsp; was threatened with being handcuffed.&nbsp; In these circumstances, it is no wonder&nbsp; if she, as she states,&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; make&nbsp; a complete statement&nbsp; of the facts&nbsp; for fear of becoming involved in the case.<br><br>Citing section 343 of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure, it is also argued by counsel for defense that no sufficient foundation was laid for the admission in evidence of Exhibits J and K and that therefore these documents should not have been taken into consideration&nbsp; by the court below.&nbsp; This contention is&nbsp; not&nbsp; tenable.&nbsp; The exhibits&nbsp; in question are signed statements&nbsp; made by the defendants to the justice of the peace shortly after the commission of the crime.<br><br>The documents were shown&nbsp; to the defendants and&nbsp; their authenticity&nbsp; admitted before&nbsp; any questions were&nbsp; asked concerning their contents, and full opportunity was given the defendants to&nbsp; explain.&nbsp; That, in our opinion, is a sufficient&nbsp; compliance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; section&nbsp;&nbsp; cited where&nbsp; the statements sought to be introduced&nbsp; for&nbsp; the purpose of impeaching the witness are in writing.<br><br>The defendants having failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish their plea of self-defense, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed with one-half of the costs of this instance against each of&nbsp; the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Street. Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
