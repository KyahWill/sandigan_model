				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff and the defendant both appeal from a judgment of the
Court of First Instance of Manila which condemned the defendant to pay
to the plaintiff the sum of P23,319.93, together with P3,309.49 to
cover the back interest until September 24, 1924, with interest at 10
per cent per annum on the capital beginning with September 25, 1924,
and with 5 per cent of the capital for attorney's fees and judicial
costs.
  <p align="center">    DEFENDANT'S APPEAL</p>
  <p>    The answer of the defendant interposed one special defense only, <em>viz</em>.
that the action was prematurely brought. This same point is again
raised in this court in defendant's first assignment of error. The
defense of usury is not now available since not pleaded in the lower
court. (Usury Law, Act No. 2655 as amended, sec. 9; Robinson <i>vs.</i> Sackermann de Macleod and Postal Savings Bank [1924], 46 Phil., 539.)</p>
  <p>
The promissory note matured on July 1, 1923. On October 6, 1923,
Attorneys Araneta and Zaragoza made formal demand on Mr. Green for the
payment of the note (Exhibit 7). Thereafter, however, the defendant was
permitted to make partial payments aggregating P9,188.46. The last
payment on the debt was made on January 16, 1924. It is further
emphasized by the defendant that while the vice-president and general
manager of the Philippine Engineering Co. by a communication dated
September 10, 1924, addressed to Mr. Green gave the latter until
September 30, 1924, to make remittance in full settlement of the
account (Exhibit 8), the complaint was filed on September 24, 1925.
However, as appears from another letter of the vice-president and
general manager of the Philippine Engineering Co. dated September 18,
1924, the previous letter of the 10th instant was cancelled.</p>
  <p>
It cannot be fairly said, therefore, that the action was prematurely
brought. The complaint was not filed until fourteen months after the
maturity of the obligation, and not until eight months after the last
partial payment. The delay was more nearly akin to leniency than
otherwise.</p>
  <p> It is also claimed that the time of payment of
the note was extended by a verbal understanding. It is well settled
that the time of payment of a bill or note may be extended by an oral
agreement, but that an agreement to extend the time of payment in order
to be valid must be for a definite time. (8 C. J., 425-429.) Here we
have only the defendant's statement as to the purported agreement for
an indefinite period of grace, with one now dead. Such proof falls far
short of satisfying the rules of evidence.</p>
  <p align="center">    PLAINTIFF'S APPEAL</p>
  <p>
The plaintiff assigns as error the failure of the trial judge to allow
the sum of P3,250.84, provided in the note, for expenses and attorney's
fees. A number of decisions have sanctioned stipulations for attorney's
fees in negotiable instruments where the stipulations have not been
found to be unconscionable or unreasonable. (Bachrach <i>vs.</i> Golingco [1918], 39 Phil., 138; Bachrach Garage and Taxicab Co. <i>vs.</i> Golingco [1919], 39 Phil., 912; Laureano <i>vs.</i> Kilayco and Lizares de Kilayco [1915], 32 Phil., 194; Warrington <i>vs.</i>
De la Rama [1923], 46 Phil., 881.) The apparent object was here to fix
the collection fees at approximately 10 per cent of the face of the
loan. Inasmuch as the debt has been considerably reduced to P23,319.93,
it would only be fair to reduce the attorney's fees in the same
proportion. Instead of 5 per cent allowed by the trial judge and
instead of the sum of P3,250.84 claimed by the plaintiff, we are
willing to concede to the plaintiff 10 per cent of P23,319.93, or
P2,332.</p>
  <p> The plaintiff further assigns as error the allowance
by the trial court to the plaintiff of the sum of P3,309.49 for
accumulated interest when the amount should have been P3,315.87. Just
why the trial judge was induced to make a deduction of about six pesos
in the total granted for interest, is not quite clear. Just why the
manager of the Philippine Engineering Co. in Exhibit 8-1 only claimed
P2,835.91 for interest when in Exhibit C the same company claimed
P3,315.87, is also not quite clear. However, it does appear from the
record that Exhibit C was admitted without objection on the part of
counsel for the defendant. The amount for interest should, therefore,
be fixed at P3,315.87. This sum should bear legal interest from
September 25, 1924, the day following the filing of the complaint.
(Civil Code, art. 1109; Usury Law, sec. 5; Robinson <i>vs.</i> Sackermann de Macleod and Postal Savings Bank, supra; China Banking Corporation <i>vs.</i> Lichauco [1924], 46 Phil., 460.)</p>
  <p>
Counsel finally attacks the judgment because it does not allow costs to
the plaintiff. Attention is invited to the clause of the note by which
the debtor agrees to pay the costs taxable under the Code of Civil
Procedure. Not for this reason particularly, but because the plaintiff
has had to carry the burden of litigation should it have been allowed
its court costs.</p>
  <p> The judgment appealed from shall be
modified so that it reads as follows: The defendant B. A. Green is
condemned to pay the plaintiff the sum of P23,319.93, with P3,315.87
for accrued interest until September 24, 1924; with interest at 10 per
cent per annum on the capital beginning with September 25,1924, and
continuing until payment, and with legal interest on the accrued
interest beginning with September 25, 1924, and continuing until
payment; with P2,332 for attorney's fees for collection; and with costs
against the defendant. It is so ordered without special pronouncement
as to costs in this instance.</p>
  <p>    <i>Avance√±a, C. J., Street, Johns, Romualdez</i>, and <i>Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur. </p>
  <p><i>    Ostrand, J</i>.,
concurring in part: I concur in the decision of the court except in so
far as it increases the allowance for attorney's fees fixed by the
trial court. </p>
