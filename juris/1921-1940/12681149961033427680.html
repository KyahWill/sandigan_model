				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendants&nbsp; Lua&nbsp; Chu and Uy Se Tieng appeal from the judgment of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Cebu convicting them of the illegal importation of opium, and sentencing them each to four years' imprisonment,&nbsp; a fine of P10,000, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to pay the proportional costs.<br><br>In support of their appeal, the appellants assign the following alleged&nbsp; errors as&nbsp; committed by the court&nbsp; below in its judgment, to wit:<br><blockquote>"The lower court erred:<br><ol><li>In refusing to compel the Hon.&nbsp; Secretary of Finance or the Insular Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs to&nbsp; exhibit&nbsp; in court the&nbsp; record&nbsp; of the&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; investigation against Joaquin Natividad, collector of customs of Cebu, and Juan Samson, supervising customs secret service agent of Cebu, both of whom&nbsp; have since been&nbsp; dismissed from service.<br></li><li>In holding&nbsp; it as a fact that&nbsp; 'no doubt many times opium&nbsp; consignments&nbsp; have passed&nbsp; thru&nbsp; the customhouse without the knowledge of the customs secret service.<br></li><li>In rejecting&nbsp; the defendants' theory&nbsp; that&nbsp; the said Juan Samson in denouncing the accused&nbsp; was actuated&nbsp; by a desire to protect himself and&nbsp; to injure ex-collector Joaquin Natividad,&nbsp; his&nbsp; bitter enemy, who was partly instrumental in the dismissal of&nbsp; Samson from the service.<br></li><li>In finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; of Juan&nbsp; Samson, dismissed chief customs secret service agent of Cebu, is above reproach&nbsp; and&nbsp; utterly&nbsp; irreconcilable with&nbsp; the&nbsp; corrupt motives attributed to him&nbsp; by the accused.<br></li><li>In permitting Juan&nbsp; Samson, prosecution star witness, to remain in the court room while&nbsp; other prosecution witnesses&nbsp; were testifying, despite&nbsp; the previous&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the court&nbsp; excluding the&nbsp; Government witnesses from&nbsp; the court room, and in refusing to allow the defense to inquire from Insular&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs&nbsp; Aldanese regarding the official conduct of Juan Samson&nbsp; as supervising customs secret service agent of Cebu.<br></li><li>In giving full credit to the testimony&nbsp; of said Juan Samson.<br></li><li>In refusing to hold that Juan Samson induced the defendant Uy Se Tieng to order the opium from Hongkong.<br></li><li>in accepting Exhibits E and E-1 as the true and correct&nbsp; transcript of the conversation between Juan Samson and the appellant Uy Se Tieng.<br></li><li>In accepting Exhibit F as the true and correct transcript of the conversation between Juan Samson and the appellant&nbsp; Lua Chu. <br></li><li>In finding each of the appellants Uy Se Tieng and Lua&nbsp; Chu&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of the crime of&nbsp; illegal importation of opium,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; sentencing each to suffer four&nbsp; years' imprisonment&nbsp; and to pay a fine of P10,000&nbsp; and the costs, despite&nbsp; the presumption of innocence which has not been overcome, despite the unlawful inducement, despite the inherent&nbsp; weakness&nbsp; of the evidence presented by the prosecution, emanating from a&nbsp; spirit of revenge and&nbsp; from a contaminated, polluted&nbsp; source."</li></ol></blockquote>The following are uncontradicted facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt&nbsp; at the trial:<br><br><blockquote>About the middle of the month of November, 1929, the accused Uy Se Tieng wrote to his correspondent in Hongkong to send him a shipment of opium.<br><br>About November 4, 1929, after the chief&nbsp; of the customs secret service of&nbsp; Cebu, Juan Samson,&nbsp; had&nbsp; returned from a vacation in Europe, he called upon the then collector of customs for the Port of Cebu, Joaquin Natividad, at his office, and the&nbsp; latter,&nbsp; after a short&nbsp; conversation, asked him&nbsp; how much&nbsp; his trip had&nbsp; cost him.&nbsp; When the chief of the secret&nbsp; service told him he had spent P2,500, the said collector of&nbsp; customs took from&nbsp; a&nbsp; drawer in&nbsp; his table, the amount of P300,&nbsp; in paper money, and&nbsp; handed it&nbsp; to him, saying: "This&nbsp; is&nbsp; for&nbsp; you,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a shipment&nbsp; will&nbsp; arrive shortly, and you will soon be able&nbsp; to recoup&nbsp; your travelling expenses."&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Samson took the money, left,&nbsp; and put it into the safe in his&nbsp; office to be kept until he delivered it to the provincial treasurer of Cebu.&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later, Natividad&nbsp; called Samson&nbsp; and told him that the shipment he had&nbsp; referred to consisted&nbsp; of opium,&nbsp; that it&nbsp; was about to arrive, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the owner would go&nbsp; to Samson's&nbsp; house to see him.&nbsp; That very&nbsp; night Uy Se Tieng went to Sam- son's house&nbsp; and&nbsp; told him he had come by&nbsp; order of Natividad to talk to him about the opium.&nbsp; The said accused informed&nbsp; Samson that&nbsp; the&nbsp; opium shipment consisted&nbsp; of 3,000 tins, and that he had agreed to pay Natividad P6,000 or P2&nbsp; a tin, and that the opium had&nbsp; been&nbsp; in&nbsp; Hongkong since the beginning of October awaiting a ship that would go direct to Cebu.<br><br>At about&nbsp; 6 o'clock in the afternoon of&nbsp; November 22, 1929, one Nam Tai loaded on the steamship Kolambugan, which the <i>Naviera Filipina</i>â€”a shipping company in Cebu had&nbsp; had built&nbsp; in Hongkong, 38 cases consigned&nbsp; to&nbsp; Uy Seheng and marked "U. L. H."&nbsp; About the&nbsp; same&nbsp; date Natividad informed Samson that the opium had&nbsp; already been put on board the steamship <i>Kolambugan</i>,&nbsp; and it was agreed between them that&nbsp; Samson would receive P2,000, Natividad P2,000, and the remaining P2,000&nbsp; would be distributed among certain employees in the customhouse.</blockquote>Meanwhile, Uy Se Tieng continued his interviews with Samson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards the&nbsp; end of November,&nbsp; Natividad informed&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter that&nbsp; the <i>Kolambugan</i>&nbsp; had returned&nbsp; to Hongkong on&nbsp; account of certain engine trouble, and remained&nbsp; there until December 7th.&nbsp; In view of this, the shipper several times attempted to&nbsp; unload&nbsp; the shipment, but he was told&nbsp; each&nbsp; time by the&nbsp; captain, who needed the cargo for ballast, that the ship was about to sail, and the 30 cases remained on board.<br><br>The&nbsp; <i>Kolambugan</i> arrived at&nbsp; Cebu on the morning&nbsp; of December 14,&nbsp; 1929.&nbsp; While he&nbsp; was examining the&nbsp; manifests, Samson detailed&nbsp; one of his men to watch the ship. After conferring with Natividad, the&nbsp; latter instructed him to do everything possible to have the cargo unloaded, and to require Uy Se Tieng to pay over&nbsp; the&nbsp; P6,000.&nbsp; On the morning of&nbsp; November&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1929, Natividad&nbsp; told Samson that Uy Se&nbsp; Tieng already had the papers ready to with- draw the cases marked "U. L. H." from the customhouse. Samson then told Natividad it would be better for Uy Se Tieng to go to his&nbsp; house to have a talk with him.&nbsp; Uy Se Tieng went to Samson's house that night and&nbsp; was told that he must pay over theP6,000 before taking the opium out of the&nbsp; customhouse.&nbsp; Uy Se Tieng showed&nbsp; Samson the bill of lading and on leaving said: "I will tell the owner, and see whether we can take the money to you tomorrow." The following&nbsp; day&nbsp; Samson&nbsp; informed&nbsp; Colonel Francisco of the Constabulary, of&nbsp; all that had&nbsp; taken&nbsp; place, and the said colonel instructed the provincial commander, Captain Buenconsejo, to discuss the capture of the&nbsp; opium owners with&nbsp; Samson.&nbsp; Buenconsejo and Samson agreed&nbsp; to meet at the latter's house that same&nbsp; night.&nbsp; That afternoon Samson went to the office of the .provincial fiscal,&nbsp; reported the case to the fiscal, and asked&nbsp; for a stenographer to take down the conversation he would have with Uy Se Tieng that night&nbsp; in the&nbsp; presence of&nbsp; Captain Buenconsejo.&nbsp; As the fiscal did not&nbsp; have&nbsp; a good&nbsp; stenographer&nbsp; available, Samson got one Jumapao,&nbsp; of the law&nbsp; firm of Rodriguez &amp; Zacarias,&nbsp; on the recommendation of the court stenographer. On the evening of December&nbsp; 17, 1929, as agreed, Captain Buenconsejo, Lieutenant Fernando, and&nbsp; the stenographer went to Samson's house and concealed themselves behind a curtain made of strips of wood which hung from the window overlooking&nbsp; the entrance to the house on the ground floor.&nbsp; As soon as the accused Uy Se Tieng arrived, Samson asked&nbsp; him&nbsp; if he had&nbsp; brought the money.&nbsp; He replied that he had&nbsp; not, saying that the owner of the opium, who was Lua Chu, was afraid of him.&nbsp; Samson then told him to tell Lua Chu not&nbsp; to be&nbsp; afraid, and&nbsp; that he might come&nbsp; to&nbsp; Samson's&nbsp; house.&nbsp; After pointing&nbsp; out to Uy Se Tieng a back door&nbsp; entrance into the garden, he asked him where the&nbsp; opium was, and&nbsp; Uy Se Tieng answered&nbsp; that it was in the cases numbered 11&nbsp; to 18, and that there were 3,252 tins.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uy Se&nbsp; Tieng returned at&nbsp; about 10 o'clock that night accompanied&nbsp; by his codefendant Lua Chu, who said he was not the sole owner of the opium, but that a man from Manila, named Tan, and another&nbsp; in Amoy were also owners.&nbsp; Samson then asked&nbsp; Lua Chu when he was going to get the opium, and the latter answered that Uy Se Tieng would take charge of that.&nbsp; On being asked if he had brought the P6,000, Lua Chu answered, no, but&nbsp; promised to deliver it when the opium was, in Uy Se Tieng's warehouse.&nbsp; After this conversation, which&nbsp; was taken down in shorthand,&nbsp; Samson took the&nbsp; accused Lua Chu aside and asked him: "I say, old fellow, why didn't you tell&nbsp; me about this before&nbsp; bringing the opium here?'*&nbsp; Lua Chu answered: "Impossible, sir; you were not here, you were in&nbsp; Spain&nbsp; on: vacation."&nbsp; On&nbsp; being asked by&nbsp; Samson how he had come to bring in the opium,&nbsp; Lua&nbsp; Chu answered: "I was in a cockpit one Sunday when the collector called me aside and said&nbsp; there&nbsp; was good&nbsp; business,&nbsp; because opium brought a good price, and he needed money."&nbsp; All this conversation was&nbsp; overheard by Captain&nbsp; Buenconsejo.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; then agreed that Uy Se Tieng should take the papers with him at 10 o'clock next morning.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the appointed hour, Uy Se Tieng and one Uy Ay&nbsp; arrived at Samson's house, and as Uy Se Tieng was&nbsp; handing certain papers over to his companion, Uy Ay, Captain&nbsp; Buenconsejo, who had been hiding, appeared&nbsp; and&nbsp; arrested the two Chinamen,&nbsp; taking the aforementioned papers,&nbsp; which consisted of bills&nbsp; of lading (Exhibits&nbsp; B and B-1), and an&nbsp; invoice written&nbsp; in Chinese characters, and relating to the articles described in Exhibit&nbsp; B.&nbsp; After&nbsp; having&nbsp; taken&nbsp; Uy Se Tieng and Uy Ay&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Constabulary&nbsp; headquarters, and notified the fiscal, Captain Buenconsejo and Samson went to Lua Chu's home to&nbsp; search it and&nbsp; arrest him.&nbsp; In the pocket of&nbsp; a coat&nbsp; hanging on a wall, which Lua Chu said belonged&nbsp; to him,&nbsp; they found five letters written in&nbsp; Chinese characters relating to&nbsp; the opium&nbsp; (Exhibits G to K).&nbsp; Captain Buenconsejo and Samson also took&nbsp; Lua Chu to the Constabulary headquarters, and&nbsp; then went to the customhouse to examine the cases marked&nbsp; "U. L. H." In the cases marked Nos. 11 to 18, they found 3,252 opium tins&nbsp; hidden away in a quantity of dry fish.&nbsp; The value of the opium confiscated amounted&nbsp; to P50,000.<br><br>In the afternoon&nbsp; of December 18, 1929, Captain Buenconsejo&nbsp; approached&nbsp; Lua&nbsp; Chu and asked&nbsp; him to tell the truth as to who was the owner of the opium.&nbsp; Lua Chu answered as follows: "Captain, it is useless to ask me any questions,&nbsp; for I am&nbsp; not going to answer them.&nbsp; The only thing I will say is that whoever the owner of this contraband may be, he is&nbsp; not such a fool as to bring it in here without the&nbsp; knowledge of thoseâ€”" pointing towards the customhouse.<br><br>The defense attempted&nbsp; to show that after Juan Samson had obtained a loan&nbsp; of P200 from Uy Se Tieng, he induced him&nbsp; to order the opium from&nbsp; Hongkong&nbsp; saying that&nbsp; it only cost from P2 to P3 a tin there, while in Cebu&nbsp; it cost from P18&nbsp; to P20, and that he could make a good deal of money by bringing in&nbsp; a shipment&nbsp; of that drug; that Samson told Uy Se&nbsp; Tieng, furthermore, that there would be no&nbsp; danger,&nbsp; because he&nbsp; and&nbsp; the collector of customs would protect him;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Uy Se Tieng&nbsp; went to&nbsp; see Natividad, who told him&nbsp; he had no objection, if Somson agreed; that Uy Se Tieng&nbsp; then wrote&nbsp; to his correspondent in Hongkong to forward the opium; that after he had ordered it, Samson went to&nbsp; Uy Se Tieng's store, in the name of Natividad, and demanded the payment of P6,000; that Uy Se Tieng then wrote to his Hongkong correspondent cancelling the order, but the latter answered that the opium had already been loaded and the captain of the <i>Kolambugan</i> refused to let him unload it; that when the opium arrived, Samson insisted upon the payment of the P6,000; that as Uy Se Tieng did not have that amount, he went to&nbsp; Lua Chu on the night of December 14th, and&nbsp; proposed that he participate; that at first Lua Chu was unwilling to accept Uy Se&nbsp; Tieng's proposition, but&nbsp; he finally agreed to pay P6,000 when the opium had passed the customhouse; that Lua&nbsp; Chu went to&nbsp; Samson's house on the&nbsp; night of December 17th, because Samson at&nbsp; last&nbsp; agreed to&nbsp; deliver the opium without first receiving the P6,000, provided Lua Chu personally promised to&nbsp; pay him&nbsp; that amount.<br><br>The appellants make ten assignments&nbsp; of error as committed by the trial court in its&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; Some refer to the refusal of the trial judge to&nbsp; permit the presentation of certain documentary evidence, and, to the exclusion of Juan Samson,&nbsp; the principal witness for the Government, from the court room during&nbsp; the hearing;&nbsp; offers refer to&nbsp; the admission of the alleged statements of the accused taken in shorthand; and the others to the sufficiency of the evidence of the prosecution to establish the guilt of the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt.<br><br>With respect to the presentation of the record of&nbsp; the administrative proceedings against Joaquin Natividad, collector of customs of Cebu, and Juan Samson, supervising customs secret service agent of Cebu, who were dismissed from the service, the trial court did not err in&nbsp; not&nbsp; permitting it, for, whatever the result of those proceedings, they&nbsp; cannot serve to impeach the witness Juan Samson, for it is not one of the means prescribed in section 342 of the Code of Civil Procedure to that end.<br><br>With regard to the trial judge's refusal&nbsp; to order&nbsp; the exclusion&nbsp; of Juan&nbsp; Samson, the principal witness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Government, from the court room during the hearing, it is within the power of said judge to do so or not, and it does not appear that he has&nbsp; abused&nbsp; his discretion (16&nbsp; Corpus Juris, 842).<br><br>Neither did the&nbsp; trial judge&nbsp; err when he admitted&nbsp; in evidence&nbsp; the transcript&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; stenographic notes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendants' statements, since they contain admissions made by themselves, and the person who took them in shorthand attested at the trial that they were faithfully taken down. Besides the contents are corroborated by&nbsp; un-impeached witnesses who heard the statements.<br><br>As to whether the probatory facts&nbsp; are sufficient to establish the facts alleged in&nbsp; the information, we find that&nbsp; the testimony given by the witnesses for the prosecution should be believed, because the officers of the Constabulary and the chief of the customs secret service, who gave it, only did their duty.&nbsp; Aside from this, the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; do&nbsp; not deny&nbsp; their participation in the illegal importation of the opium, though the accused Lua Chu pretends that he was only&nbsp; a guarantor to secure the payment of the gratuity which the former collector of customs, Joaquin Natividad, had asked of him for Juan Samson and certain customs employees.&nbsp; This assertion,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; is&nbsp; contradicted&nbsp; by his own&nbsp; statement made to Juan&nbsp; Samson and overheard by Captain Buenconsejo, that he was one of the owners of the opium that had been unlawfully imported.<br><br>But the defendants'&nbsp; principal defense is&nbsp; that they were induced by&nbsp; Juan Samson&nbsp; to&nbsp; import the opium&nbsp; in question.&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Samson denies this,&nbsp; and his conduct in connection&nbsp; with the introduction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prohibited drug into the port of Cebu, bears&nbsp; him out.&nbsp; A public official who induces a person to commit a crime for purposes of gain, does&nbsp; not take the steps necessary to seize the instruments of the crime and to&nbsp; arrest the offender, before having obtained the profit he&nbsp; had in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; true that Juan Samson smoothed the way for the introduction of the prohibited drug,&nbsp; but that was after the accused had already planned&nbsp; its importation and&nbsp; ordered said drug,&nbsp; leaving only&nbsp; its&nbsp; introduction into&nbsp; the&nbsp; country through the Cebu customhouse to be managed, and&nbsp; he&nbsp; did not do so to help them&nbsp; carry their plan&nbsp; to a successful issue, but rather to assure the seizure of&nbsp; the&nbsp; imported&nbsp; drug and the arrest of the smugglers.<br><br>The doctrines referring to the&nbsp; entrapment of offenders and instigation to commit crime, as laid down by the courts of the United States, are summarized in 16 Corpus Juris, page&nbsp; 88,&nbsp; section 57,&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"ENTRAPMENT AND INSTIGATION.â€”While it has been said that the practice of entrapping persons into crime for the purpose of instituting&nbsp; criminal prosecutions is to be deplored, and while instigation, as distinguished from mere entrapment, has often been condemned and has sometimes been held to prevent the act from being criminal or punishable, the general rule&nbsp; is that it is&nbsp; no defense to the perpetrator of a crime that facilities for its commission were purposely&nbsp; placed in his way, or that the criminal act was done at the 'decoy&nbsp; solicitation' of persons&nbsp; seeking to expose the criminal, or&nbsp; that&nbsp; detectives feigning complicity in&nbsp; the&nbsp; act were present&nbsp; and apparently assisting in its commission.&nbsp; Especially is this true in that class of cases where the offense is one&nbsp; of a kind&nbsp; habitually committed, and the solicitation&nbsp; merely furnishes evidence&nbsp; of a course of conduct.&nbsp; Mere deception by the detective will not shield defendant, if the offense was committed by&nbsp; him free from the&nbsp; influence or the instigation of the detective.&nbsp; The fact that an agent of an owner acts as a&nbsp; supposed&nbsp; confederate of a thief is no defense to the latter in a prosecution for larceny, provided the original&nbsp; design&nbsp; was formed independently of such agent;&nbsp; and where&nbsp; a person&nbsp; approached by the thief as his confederate notifies the owner or the public authorities, and, being authorized by them to do so, assists the thief in carrying out the&nbsp; plan, the larceny is nevertheless committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is generally held that it is no defense to a prosecution for an illegal sale of liquor that the purchase was made&nbsp; by a 'spotter,' detective, or hired informer; but there are cases&nbsp; holding the&nbsp; contrary."</blockquote>As we have seen,&nbsp; Juan Samson neither induced&nbsp; nor instigated&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; defendants-appellants&nbsp; to&nbsp; import the opium in question, as the&nbsp; latter contend, but pretended to have an understanding with the&nbsp; collector of customs, Joaquin Natividadâ€”who had promised them that he would re- move all the difficulties&nbsp; in the way of their enterprise so far&nbsp; as the&nbsp; customhouse was concernedâ€”not to&nbsp; gain the P2,000 intended for him out of the transaction, but in order the better to assure the seizure of the prohibited drug and the arrest&nbsp; of the surreptitious importers.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is certainly nothing immoral in this or against the public&nbsp; good which should prevent the Government from prosecuting and punishing the culprits, for this is not a case where an innocent person is induced to commit a crime&nbsp; merely to prosecute him, but it is simply a trap set to catch a criminal.<br><br>Wherefore, we are of opinion and so hold, that the mere fact that the chief of the customs secret service pretended to agree to a plan for smuggling illegally imported opium through the customhouse, in order&nbsp; the better&nbsp; to assure the seizure of said opium and the arrest of its&nbsp; importers, is no bar&nbsp; to the prosecution and conviction of&nbsp; the latter.<br><br>By virtue whereof, finding no error&nbsp; in the judgment appealed&nbsp; from, the&nbsp; same&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against the appellants.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>AvanceÃ±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
