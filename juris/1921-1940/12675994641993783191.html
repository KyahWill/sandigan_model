				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>E. Vesnan applied to the Public Service Commission
for a certificate of public convenience with authority to operate two
hundred small taxicabs in the City of Manila and its suburbs.
<p align="justify"> After due hearing, the Public Service Commission
granted a certificate authorizing nine small taxicabs but refused
authority to place in operation two hundred. From the orders of the
Public Service Commission refusing to grant the authority for the two
hundred cars, applicant brings this appeal.</p>
<p align="justify"> The appellees are existing taxicab operators in the
City of Manila who opposed any grant to applicant. In a companion case
promulgated this date, G. R. No. 40317,<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> we discussed the right of applicant to have the certificate for the operation of nine cars.</p>
<p align="justify"> On the whole record we find no abuse of authority
in the commission's denying her application for two hundred cars. There
is, however, a middle ground that has given us considerable concern.
Originally appellant had a provisional permit for the operation of
fifty-five midget taxicabs. With the knowledge and approval of the then
members of the Public Service Commission, she purchased and ordered
from over seas twenty small cars of a new type. As fast as they arrived
appellant placed the cars in service, and at the time that this court
acted on the question of the validity of the provisional permits she
had nine cars in operation. Shortly thereafter the eleven other cars
arrived, which she could not place in operation under her provisional
permit due to the limitations which this court placed upon the holder
of the permit in that decision. The cars have been in storage awaiting
the result of these proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify"> The number of cars that an operator should operate
is obviously one that pertains especially to the jurisdiction of the
Public Service Commission; but as the cars were actually purchased with
the knowledge and consent of the then Public Service Commission, were
bought in good faith, and could be used in supplying a demand by the
public for transportation, that has been demonstrated to exist, we
believe under the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case that we
are justified in modifying the orders of the Public Service Commission
to the extent that appellant be permitted to operate the twenty
taxicabs which she hasalready purchased.</p>
<p align="justify"> As thus modified the orders of the Public Service Commission are affirmed. No pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>MALCOLM</strong> and <strong>BUTTE,</strong> <em>JJ., </em>concurring in part and dissenting: in part:</p>
<p align="justify"> We think that the decision of the Public Service
Commission in these seven cases should be sustained without change.
This means concurrence with the majority opinion in the cases of the
Austin Taxicab Company <em>vs.</em> Manila Yellow Taxicab CoCmpany, G. R. No. 40241, p. 923, <em>post;</em> Silos <em>vs.</em> Manila Yellow Taxicab Company, G. R. No. 40425, p. 802, post; Manila Yellow Taxicab Company <em>vs.</em> Vesnanr G. R. No. 40317, p. 775, <em>ante</em>; and Sabellano <em>vs.</em>
Manila Yellow Taxicab Company, G. R. No. 40335, p. 923, post, arid
dissent from the majority opinion in the cases of Manila Yellow Taxicab
Company <em>vs.</em> Austin Taxicab Company, G. R. No. 40315, p. 771, <em>ante</em>; Manila Yellow Taxicab Company <em>vs.</em> Sabellano, G. R. No. 40316, p. 773, <em>ante</em>; and Vesnan <em>vs.</em> Manila Yellow Taxicab Company, G. R. No. 40319, p. 787, <em>ante</em>. Our position will bear a brief word of explanation.</p>
<p align="justify"> The Public Service Commission Act, No. 3108, as
amended, created a Public Service Commission and vested it with the
powers and duties therein specified (sec. 1). Among other things, the
law gave to the commission general supervision and regulation of,
jurisdiction and control over, all public utilities (sec. 13). The
various powers of the commission were enumerated, and included the
right to grant certificates of public convenience (sees. 14 and 15).
Finally, provision was made for the taking of cases from the Public
Service Commission to the Supreme Court, which was given jurisdiction
to review an order of the commission "and to modify or set aside such
order when it clearly appears that there was no evidence before the
commission to support reasonably such order, or that the same was
without the jurisdiction of the commission" (sec. 35).</p>
<p align="justify"> In connection with the provisions of the law which
have been cited, this court has time without number emphasized that the
court will refrain from substituting its discretion for the discretion
of the Public Service Commission on questions of fact and will only
reverse or modify orders of the Public Service Commission when it
clearly appears that the evidence is insufficient to support their
conclusions, or otherwise stated, the court will not attempt to
substitute its judgment for the judgment of the Public Service
Commission if there is any evidence before it reasonably supporting its
order. (Phil. Shipowners' Ass'n. <em>vs.</em> Public Utility Commissioner and Board of Appeal [1922], 43 Phil., 328; Ynchausti Steamship Co. <em>vs.</em> Public Utility Commissioner and Board of Appeal [1923], 44 Phil., 363; Mejica <em>vs.</em> Public Utility Commission [1926], 49 Phil., 774; Phil. Shipowners* Ass'n. <em>vs.</em> Public Utility Commission [1926], 51 Phil., 957; San Miguel Brewery <em>vs.</em> Lapid [1929], 53 Phil., 539; Calabia <em>vs.</em> Orlanes &amp; Banaag Transportation Co. [1931], 55 Phil., 659; Manila Yellow Taxicab Co. and Aero Taxicab Co. <em>vs.</em>
Danon [1933], 58 Phil., 75.) The basic decision with reference to the
granting of certificates of public convenience for taxicab service in
the City of Manila is found in the case of Carmelo and Oriol <em>vs.</em>
Monserrat &lt;[1931], 55 Phil., 644), where the point was stressed that
in the granting or refusal of a certificate of public convenience, all
things considered, the question is what is for the best interests of
the public.</p>
<p align="justify"> In the cases before us we find a well-written
decision prepared by the commissioner and concurred in by the two
associate commissioners. In the decision it was said that the principal
issue for determination by the commission was whether or not applicants
should be granted permanent certificates of public convenience. It was
then stated that the applicants and opponents presented both oral and
documentary evidence. Specific findings were made with reference to the
cases of the Austin Taxicab Company, Panfilo Sabellano and E. Vesnan,
which are the cases where this court substitutes its findings for the
findings of the commission. The commission gave consideration to the
proposition that the applicants by reason of their temporary permits
have made investments in good faith for the operation of their
thirty-nine units which the commission could not in equity ignore. Then
after premising its conclusions on a careful review of the evidence,
the commission announced that it would authorize the Austin Taxicab
Company to operate twenty units, Panfilo Sabellano ten units, and E.
Vesnan nine units.</p>
<p align="justify"> We, therefore, are unable to understand how this
court can state "that there was no evidence before the commission to
support reasonably" its order. Instead we find this court telling the
commission that in the Austin Taxicab Company case it should not have
allowed the company to operate twenty units; telling the commission in
the Sabellano case that it should not have allowed the applicant to
operate ten units, and telling the commission in the Vesnan case that
instead of allowing Vesnan to operate nine units it should have allowed
her to operate twenty units. Peculiarly unjust do we find these
pronouncements in the Austin Taxicab Company case, for there we have a
company permitted to be incorporated by the Government, and which the
Government has taken no steps to dissolve, now in a collateral manner
deprived of valuable property rights without due process of law. We
sincerely believe that the question of how many taxicabs should be
permitted to operate in Manila and what companies should operate those
taxicabs can safely be left for determination by the Public Service
Commission; that every time the commission makes a finding of fact
predicated on evidence on such questions, the losing party should not
be encouraged to bring the case to the Supreme Court for review, and
that the Supreme Court should not transform itself into a supervisory
Public Service Commission and thus usurp functions which are not
granted it by law.</p><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>GODDARD</strong>, <em>J.,</em></p>
<p align="justify"> I dissent.</p>
<p align="justify"> I hold that the primary purpose of public utility
laws is to secure adequate, efficient and economical service for the
public and, as a means to that end, public service commissions should
protect the investment and the business of established utilities which
are adequately and economically serving the public. That the only way
to accomplish this purpose is by effective regulation of such utilities
and by a denial of applications for certificates of public necessity in
sections already adequately served. I also hold that when the Public
Service Commission finds that Established utilities are not rendering
adequate and economical service to the public that it is the duty of
the commission to give such utilities the opportunity to reconstruct
and make such improvements in their plant, system, facilities,
including the extension thereof, as will enable them to adequately meet
the needs of the public. But, in case the established utilities decide
not to make such improvements and extensions, including the
establishment of lower rates, or are unable to do so, then and then
only should the commission grant certificates of public necessity to
others who are able and willing to adequately and economically serve
the public by furnishing such improvements, extensions and lower rates.
(PUR, 1920B, pp. 337-339.) I also hold that public service commissions
have another duty to perform, aside from obliging public utilities to
render good service at reasonable rates, which is just as important for
the public interest, and that is to allow public utilities to charge
reasonable rates for the service rendered. Unreasonable demands by the
public or unreasonable offers by others to supply the service at lower
rates should be rejected. The granting of such demands or acceptance of
such offers would lead to bankruptcy and the public would be deprived
of the service entirely. (PUR, 1918F, pp. 592, 600.)</p>
<p align="justify"> The writer has tried to give the substance of the above citations from the Public Utility Reports.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>In Re</em> Lawrence Park Heat, L. &amp; P. Co., the Public Service Commission of New York, Second District, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "* * * that in the great majority
of cases competition between utility companies operating in a single
field was producing very bad results indeed from the points of view
both of the public and the competing companies. It was recognized that
this kind of competition almost invariably resulted in the partial or
complete crippling of enterprises which were subject to it, with the
inevitable result that utility companies generally were not giving
anything like as good service to the people as they might reasonably be
expected to give under happier and saner conditions. This evil of
cutthroat competition between utility companies was not, of course, the
only reason for the passage of the Public Service Commission Law. Other
obvious defects in the existing system clamored to be corrected. But
that the legislature and the governor, approaching the matter entirely
from the public standpoint and certainly without the slightest desire
to protect vested interests at the expense of the people, gave
particular thought to the question here referred to, there can be no
doubt whatever. And they concluded, from their study of conditions in
every department of the utility field, that better results than any
which had been secured in the past could be had in the future by
substituting for the foolish and wasteful competition of former years a
system of state regulation and control, under which whatever good there
might be in the competitive system could be preserved without any of
its resulting waste and public loss. The newly created Public Service
Commissions, therefore, while by no means restrained from permitting
competitive conditions to exist in cases where the public interest
seemed to require it, were charged with the duty of protecting
established companies which had demonstrated their willingness and
ability to serve the people well against such ultimate disasters as
seemed under the competitive system sooner or later to overtake nearly
all of these enterprises. With this in view, the power to pass upon
applications like the one now before us, and the duty to deny such
applications whenever it seemed likely that the conditions from which
the people were trying to be relieved would be perpetuated by granting
them, was lodged with the commissions. It is beyond dispute that the
whole situation has vastly improved under the new system, and that
whatever the trend of future legislation on this subject may be, it
will not be toward any return to the competitive conditions of earlier
days." (PUR, 1918A, pp. 113, 119, 120.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> This court in the case of Batangas Transportation Co. <em>vs.</em> Orlanes (52 Phil., 455), quoted with approval section 775 of Pond on Public Utilities as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> " ' The policy of regulation, upon
which our present public utility commission plan is based and which
tends to do away with competition among public utilities as they are
natural monopolies, is at once the reason and the justification for the
holding of our courts that the regulation of an existing system of
transportation, which is properly serving a given field or may be
required to do so, is to be preferred to competition among several
independent systems. While requiring a proper service from a single
system for a city or territory in consideration for protecting it as a
monopoly for all the service required and in conserving its resources,
no economic waste results and service may be furnished at the minimum
cost. The prime object and real purpose of commission control is to
secure adequate sustained service for the public at the least possible
cost, and to protect and conserve investments already made for this
purpose. Experience has demonstrated beyond any question that
competition among natural monopolies is wasteful economically and
results finally in insufficient and unsatisfactory service and
extravagant rates. Neither the number of the individuals demanding
other service nor the question of the fares constitutes the entire
question, but rather what the proper agency should be to furnish the
best service to the public generally and continuously at the least
cost. Anything which tends to cripple seriously or destroy an
established system of transportation that is necessary to a community
is not a convenience and necessity for the public and its introduction
would be a handicap rather than a help ultimately in such a field/ "
(Pp. 471, 472.) And then said:</p>
  <p align="justify"> "That is the legal construction which should be placed on paragraph (<em>e</em>) of section 14, and paragraphs (6) and (<em>c</em>) of section 15 of the Public Service Law.</p>
  <p align="justify">
"We are clearly of the opinion that the order of the commission
granting the petition of Orlanes in question, for the reasons therein
stated, is null and void, and that it is in direct conflict with the
underlying and fundamental principles for which the commission was
created." (P. 472.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In Bohol Land Transportation Company <em>vs.</em> Jureidini (53 Phil., 560), this court held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "1. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION;
ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OP PUBLIC NECESSITY AND CONVENIENCE TO
TRANSPORTATION COMPANY OR LAND CARRIER.—Before granting a certificate
of public necessity and convenience to a transportation company or
common carrier on land, there being another with a proper certificate,
the latter should be given an opportunity to improve its service, if
deficient or inadequate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In Mangubat <em>vs.</em> Silang Traffic Co. (G. R. No. 31556, promulgated November 22,1929, not reported), this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "We are clearly of the opinion that
the Public Service Commission had no legal authority to issue the
license in question, and that the order in question is null and void.
If it be a fact that the public interests require a change in the
schedule of the Silang Traffic Co., Inc., to accommodate early-morning
passengers from Dasmarinas to Imus, the Public Service Commission would
have the power to make that order on the petition of parties in
interest or even on its own motion, after notice to the Silang Traffic
Co., Inc., and a hearing, and if, for any reason, the Silang Traffic
Co., Inc., then failed to comply with a reasonable order of the
commission as to a change in its schedule, then a license to another
operator between those points should be granted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In another Batangas Transportation Co. <em>vs.</em>
Orlanes and Orlanes &amp; Banaag Transportation Co. case (G. R. No.
36245, 57 Phil., 997), this court, referring to the original Batangas
Transportation Co. <em>vs.</em> Orlanes decision (52 Phil., 455), said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "That decision laid down certain
fundamental rules for the guidance of the Public Service Commission and
of competing bus lines. It was written during a time of prosperity. It
was written to protect the real public interest and not those of a
passing moment. The financial depression which we have suffered, and
from which we are now suffering, furnishes a complete and unanswerable
verification of the soundness of the principles therein announced. To
permit the present orders of the Public Service Commission to stand
would be a practical reversal of that decision.</p>
  <p align="justify">
"This court is more concerned with the substance than the form. We
cannot, so far as it lies within our power, permit ruinous competition
to the manifest detriment of the public. Half empty motor buses engaged
in ruinous competition, destroying our provincial roads, causing
disaster to each other is not a sign of enlightened competition, and
such practices are bound to bring injury to the public."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The last decision cited above was promulgated after the decision in the first taxicab case, Carmelo and Oriol <em>vs.</em> Monserrat (55 Phil., 644).</p>
<p align="justify"> In the Monserrat case this court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "The business of the taxicab is new
and the public here is not yet accustomed to that kind of service, and
like other innovations, it is one more or less of education. Even so,
in all cities in the United States of the size of Manila, taxicabs are
in general use and are very convenient to the traveling public, and in
so far as we are advised there is no city of the size of Manila that
does not have at least two or more taxicab companies in actual
operation.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "Everything else being equal, the
real, primary question involved is whether it is better and more
convenient for the travelling public in the City of Manila to have two
taxicab companies in operation than it is to have one, and whether in
truth and in fact the granting of another similar license to the
petitioners would operate as a real injury to Monserrat." (Pp. 647,
648.)</p>
  <p align="justify"> "* * * counsel have not cited decision
of any court in which the exclusive rights of a prior operator of a
taxicab company in a city of the size of the City of Manila have been
sustained, * * *." (Carmelo and Oriol <em>vs.</em> Monserrat, <em>supra</em>, p. 650.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> At the time that decision was promulgated Monserrat
(now Manila Yellow Taxicab Co.) was operating about twenty-six (26)
taxicabs in the City of Manila. The situation now is quite different.
At the time the Public Service Commission granted this petitioner,
Esmeralda Vesnan, a certificate, there were six (6) taxicab operators,
who were operating three hundred one (301) taxies. These six operators
adopted a resolution previous to the hearing of this case and presented
it to the commission (Exhibit 18) in which they stated that they
believed that the present number of taxicabs operated in Manila is
sufficient, but that if the commission believed that an increase is
necessary for the public convenience, they were prepared and ready to
put into operation the increased number; and asked the commission to
fix the number which it believed should be operated and to define its
policy with regard to pending and future applications for taxicab
service with a view to protecting the interests of the public, as well
as those of the then operators.</p>
<p align="justify"> Since the promulgation of the Monserrat decision
the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission has rendered a decision in
the case Re Universal Cab Company (PUR, 1930D, p. 178):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "<em>Monopoly and, competition</em>—<em>Policy of the Commission</em>— <em>Taxicabs</em>.
2.—The policy of the commission in dealing with taxicabs, considering
solely the administrative standpoint, is that such service is not
exempt from the fundamental principle of regulation which is that the
public interest must be efficiently served by well-regulated utilities
protected against destructive competition, p. 180."</p>
  <p align="justify"> "<em>Monopoly and competition—Taxicabs—Adequacy of existing service—Local policy.</em>
3.—Authority to operate a city-wide taxi service was denied where
adequate service was being rendered by a responsible operator at
reasonable rates, and where the local municipal policy, like the
commission policy, appeared to be opposed to destructive competition,
p. 182."</p>
  <p align="justify"> "<em>Public utility—Application of regulatory principles— Taxicabs</em>.—The
Public Service Company Law does not sanction the application of one set
of administrative principles to one utility and the application of
another set to other utilities, nor does it differentiate in this
respect between taxicabs and motor buses or any other form of
transportation, p. 182."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In the body of that decision the commission said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "As a matter of fact, there is
nothing in any of the provisions of the Public Service Company Law
which sanctions the application of one set of administrative principles
to one utility and the application of another set of administrative
principles to other utilities, or which would differentiate in this
respect between taxicabs and motor buses or any other form of
transportation. Taxicab companies and individual operators are obliged
to conform to all of the statutory requirements which are applicable to
other public utilities. They are required under the law to maintain a
uniform system of accounts prescribed by the commission, to file annual
reports, reports of accidents, and comply with all other provisions of
the statute and rules of the commission applicable to public
utilities.. There is nothing in the act or in the regulations of the
commission which would justify protection of utilities in general, and
of the public interests which they serve, from destructive competition,
which does not and should not at the same time have equal application
to taxicabs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The application for certificate was denied.</p>
<p align="justify"> This decision of the Pennsylvania Public Service Commission was affirmed on appeal by the Pennsylvania Superior Court (Hoffman <em>vs.</em> Public Service Commission, PUR, 1931 A, p. 122).</p>
<p align="justify"> The Superior Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> " 'The term "common carrier" as
used in this act, includes any and all common carriers, whether
corporations or persons, engaged for profit in the conveyance of
passengers or property, or both, between points within this
commonwealth by, through, over, above, or under land or water, or both/
Appellants' proposition is that the words 'between points within this
commonwealth,' as used in part of the act above quoted, limit the
application of the act to common carriers operating over fixed routes
and between definite points; and that when a taxicab picks up
passengers wherever it can and transports them wherever they desire to
go, it is not operating 'between points' within the meaning of those
words. This contention is without substance. This court was required to
interpret the phrase 'between points within this commonwealth,' in
Scranton R. Co. <em>vs.</em> Fiorucci ([1917], 66 Pa. Super. Ct, 475,
477). The contention was made in that appeal that the words 'between
points' did not apply to operators confined to the limits of a city or
town. In refusing to adopt such a construction, this court held .that
the Public Service Company Law of 1913 'was designed to regulate all
public carriers and the legislative intention was not to make an
exempted class of public carriers operating wholly within the limits of
a city and including those who ran beyond. * * *'</p>
  <p align="justify">
"We find nothing in the Public Service Company Law or in the business
of operating taxicab service on call and demand that warrants the
conclusion that such a utility should be exempt from the application of
the noncompetitive policy."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Another significant statement in this decision is
"It is not for us to interfere with their finding" (the finding of the
commission) "when there is <em>sufficient</em> evidence to sustain
their conclusion." With all due respect to the members of this court
who would use the word "some" instead of "sufficient", I am constrained
to say I prefer the latter.</p>
<p align="justify"> The Pennsylvania Commission also dismissed
applications for incorporation, organization and operation of taxicab
companies proposing to operate 400 taxicabs in Pittsburgh, where there
was no showing that the present operators were not furnishing adequate
facilities. In a case from Reading, Pa., the commission denied
authority to operate taxicabs in that city, stating that "It has been
and is the consistent policy of the commission to protect the service
of the public from wasteful and destructive competition of all kinds."</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the material changes which have taken
place as to the conditions in Manila, with regard to the taxicab
service, since the Monserrat decision, the doctrine set forth in the
decisions of the Pennsylvania Commission and the offer of the six
taxicab operators to put in operation the number of taxicabs which the
commission may find are necessary to supply the public necessity, I am
of the opinion that the application of Esmeralda Vesnan should have
been denied.</p>
<p align="justify"> This opinion is further strengthened by the
following statement in the last paragraph of the decision of the
commission which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "While the commission is satisfied
that the present number of taxicab operators, including those herein
granted certificates, taking into account the resources at their
command, is sufficient to fill public need for the time being,
nevertheless with the data before us we do not feel justified just now
in making a definite announcement as to the number of operators and
units of taxicabs that should be authorized until a more thorough
investigation can be made on that point,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> It also appears that the only grounds upon which
the commission granted certificates of public convenience to the herein
petitioner are: (1) That from the evidence adduced and the report of
the verification made by the auditor of the commission, the latter was
convinced that the present number of taxicabs of operators holding
permanent and temporary permits could be operated with a reasonable
margin of profit; and (2) that the applicants by reason of their
temporary permits (granted without authority of law) had made
investments in good faith on the operation of their 39 units. From
these premises the commission concluded that public convenience would
be promoted by the granting of permanent certificates to the
applicants, excepting Ramon Silos.</p>
<p align="justify"> I submit that this conclusion based on such grounds
is illogical and that the commission is not authorized to grant a
certificate of public convenience for such reasons.</p>
<p align="justify"> If the Public Service Commission and this court
continue to follow the doctrine of the Monserrat decision and approve
this and other applications for the operation of taxicabs in Manila,
the inevitable result will be the total destruction of the taxicab
service now established in that city. The present operators should be
given an opportunity to supply any future public necessity for
additional taxicabs. If they do not choose to do this, then the
applications of other responsible persons or companies should be
approved.<br>
