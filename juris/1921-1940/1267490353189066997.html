				<H3>EUFEMIA MERCADO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE MUNICIPAL PRESIDENT OP MACABEBE, PAMPANGA, AND THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE AND COMMUNICATIONS, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal taken by Eufemia Mercado
from a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Pampanga
dismissing her appeal from an order of the Secretary of Commerce and
Communications wherein said official directed Romulo Mercado, the
appellant's predecessor in interest, to remove the two dikes which he
had constructed at both ends of the creek named Batasan-Limasan or
Pinac Bungalun, which traverses part of the <em>hacienda</em>
described in certificate of title No. 329 of the registry of deeds of
Pampanga, and formerly belonging to said Romulo Mercado, but which now
belongs to the appellant by virtue of a formal donation made to her by
said Romulo Mercado, after the institution of this action.
<p> After due trial, the court a quo held that the creek in question is property of the public domain.</p>
<p> The contention of the appellant's predecessor in interest in the
record of the investigation conducted by the Secretary of Commerce and
Communications, through his agents, and that of the appellant, both in
the court a quo and in this court, is that the said Batasan-Limasan or
Pinac Bungalun creek is not a natural but an artificial creek which had
been developed on his <em>hacienda</em> by means of excavations made
by his men on two different occasions, the former before the revolution
or during the Spanish regime, and the latter after the revolution.</p>
<p> The appellees, in turn, contend that the creek in question is a natural navigable creek which already existed on the said <em>hacienda</em> of the appellant not only long before the revolution but also from the time immemorial.</p>
<p> The evidence presented by the appellant shows that formerly when her so-called <em>hacienda</em>
still belonged to her grandfather Mariano Mercado, the portion of the
said creek, indicated on the plan Exhibit 2 by two parallel lines in
black ink drawn from the point marked 3 towards the center until it
turns northwards, was but a recess or arm then called Bungalun, of the
Nasi River, which arm was lost on the <em>hacienda</em>. It extended
close to a small creek called Batasan-Limasan which derived its waters,
particularly during high tide, from the large creek called Limasan
indicated on the aforesaid plan.</p>
<p> Mariano Mercado, the original owner of the <em>hacienda</em>, in order to facilitate the cutting and transportation of firewood and other products, produced on the said <em>hacienda</em>,
towards the Nasi River on the east or towards Limasan creek on the
west, connected the two recesses or bodies of water in question by
means of excavations and, after having so connected them, made other
excavations at both ends towards the said river and creek, thus
constructing a sort of canal directly connecting both bodies of water,
and which later became known as the Batasan-Limasan or Pinac Bungalun
creek.</p>
<p> The said Batasan-Limasan or Pinac Bungalun creek or canal already
existed at the time of the institution of the registration proceedings
wherein judgment was rendered resulting in the issuance of certificate
of title No. 329 in favor of Romulo Mercado. On the plan of the land,
which was presented in the said case, the aforesaid creek appears; and
at the time the case was tried as well as when the certificate of title
was issued in favor of the applicant Romulo Mercado, none of the herein
defendants nor the Insular Government filed opposition or objection
thereto.</p>
<p> Once the said Batasan-Limasan or Pinac Bungalun creek or canal was
opened from the Nasi River to Limasan creek, not only the residents of
the <em>hacienda</em> and those who visited it but also some of the
residents of the nearby barrios and municipalities began to use it as a
means of communication in attending to their needs, sometimes with the
permission of the owners of the <em>hacienda</em>, and at other times
without even the latter's knowledge. It was then that Romulo Mercado,
the appellant's predecessor in interest, decided to convert the said
creek into a fish pond and with that object in view, in 1928 he closed
the two openings thereof towards the Nasi River on one side and Limasan
creek on the other side.</p>
<p> The appellant's witnesses, Romulo Mercado, Maximo de la Pena and
Andres Limin testified that the creek in ques1tion became navigable
only from the time Mariano Mercado had excavated both ends and the
junction of the former two recesses from which said creek had been
formed; that the former owners of the <em>hacienda</em> had employed
about 60 men for a period of two weeks in order to perform such task,
and that during the revolution and for about ten years, in view of the
fact that many people entered the <em>hacienda</em> to cut or carry
away firewood without permission, Romulo Mercado ordered the creek
closed in order to prevent the entrance into and passage of strangers
through it.</p>
<p> On the other hand, the appellees tried to prove by means of their
witnesses Castor Quiambao, Maximino Guintu and Lorenzo Magat, that the
creek in question has existed on the appellant's <em>hacienda</em>
from time immemorial, and that they had been passing through and
fishing in it, as others had done, as often as they wished, long before
the revolution until it was closed by the appellant's predecessor in
interest in 1928. To that effect, they presented resolution No. 6 of
the municipal council of Macabebe, Pampanga, placing at public auction
the privilege of fishing in the Batasan-Limasan creek (Exhibit 6),
among other rivers and creeks. However, they failed to establish that
anybody had ever obtained such privilege, for which reason said
evidence cannot be given any weight, there being no doubt, as there can
be no doubt, that a mere notice, as Exhibit 6, does not constitute
sufficient evidence that the creek in question is the property of the
public domain.</p>
<p> The testimony of the said witnesses for the appellees seems
insufficient to overcome that of the witnesses for the appellant on the
ground that Castor Quiambao is relatively young and he himself admitted
that in his youth, as he remembered, he used to pass through the creek
in question only once or twice a month. The other witnesses, not being
residents of the place, were in no better position to know what the
appellant's witnesses knew as to the true nature, conditions and
changes which the said creek had undergone, inasmuch as the latter
witnesses had lived and worked in that same place for many years.</p>
<p> However, considering that the evidence of both parties is
equiponderant, could not the question be decided by taking into
consideration only, or mainly, the undisputed fact that the creek in
question, both during the first years of its existence, when it was but
a small creek formed by the channels or recesses called Batasan-Limasan
and Bungalun by some witnesses, and after it had been converted into
said creek, whether naturally or artificially, that is, by means of
man's labor, with openings toward the Nasi River and toward the Limasan
creek, derived its waters from the aforesaid river and creek, which
unquestionably belong to the public domain?</p>
<p> The lower court, invoking the provisions of articles 339, 407 and
408 of the Civil Code, decided the question mainly by taking said fact
into consideration.</p>
<p> The pertinent parts of the aforesaid three articles provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Property of public ownership isâ€”</p>
  <p> "1.
That devoted to public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents,
ports and bridges constructed by the State, riverbanks, shores,
roadsteads, and that of a similar character." (Art. 339.)</p>
  <p>"The following are of public ownership:</p>
  <p>"1. Rivers and their natural channels;</p>
  <p> "2. Continuous or intermittent waters from springs or brooks running in their natural channels and the channels themselves;</p>
  <p> "3. Waters rising continuously or intermittently on lands of public ownership;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "8. Waters which flow continuously or
intermittently from lands belonging to private parties, to the State,
to provinces, or to towns, from the moment they leave such lands."
(Art. 407.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> 'The following are of private ownership:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "1. Waters, either continuous or intermittent rising on private estates, while they run through them;</p>
  <p> "2. Lakes and ponds and their beds when formed by nature on said estates;</p>
  <p> "3. Subterranean waters found on the same;</p>
  <p> "4. Rain waters falling thereon as long as they remain within their boundaries;</p>
  <p>
"5. The channels of flowing streams, continuous or intermittent, formed
by rain water, and those of brooks crossing estates which are not of
public ownership.</p>
  <p> "The water, bed, banks, and floodgates of
a ditch or aqueduct are deemed to be an integral part of the estate or
building for which the waters are intended. The owners of estates
through or along the boundaries of which the aqueduct passes can assert
no ownership over it, nor any right to make use of its beds or banks,
unless they base their claim on title deeds which specify the right or
the ownership claimed." (Art. 408.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It will be noted that the appellant cannot invoke in her favor the
article last quoted on the ground that although it is true that the
Batasan-Limasan or Pinac Bungalun creek passes through her <em>hacienda</em>,
it is none the less true that it is not included in any of the kinds of
private property therein enumerated. The appellant and her predecessors
in interest, in closing the two openings of the said creek and
converting it into a fish pond, not only appropriated for themselves
the channel of the said creek but also the creek itself; and a creek is
not a brook because the latter is but a short, almost continuous stream
of water (<em>Diccionario de la Real Academia Espanola</em>), while the former is a recess or arm extending from a river, which participates in the ebb and flow of the sea. (15 <em>Enciclopedia Juridica Espanola</em>, 216.)</p>
<p> On the other hand, the aforecited article 339 provides that canals,
rivers, torrents, * * * and those of a similar character are property
of public ownership, and the similarity between rivers, canals, and
creeks is undoubtedly obvious on the ground that, as has been stated, a
creek is no other than an arm extending from a river. Furthermore,
under article 407, the Batasan-Limasan or Pinac Bungalun creek may be
considered as belonging to the class of property enumerated in
paragraph 8 thereof. And, in addition to the foregoing, the Contentious
Court of Spain (<em>Tribunal Contencioso de Espana</em>) in a decision dated June 25, 1890, laid down the doctrine that creeks are property of the public domain (15 <em>Enciclopedia Juridica Espanola</em>, 216).</p>
<p> And even granting that the Batasan-Limasan creek acquired the
proportions which it had, before it was closed, as a result of
excavations made by laborers of the appellant's predecessor in
interest, it being a fact that, since the time it was opened as a water
route between the Nasi River and Limasan creek, the owners thereof as
well as strangers, that is, both the residents of the <em>hacienda</em> and those of other nearby barrios and municipalities, had been using it not only for their <em>bancas</em>
to pass through but also for fishing purposes, and it being also a fact
that such was the condition of the creek at least since 1906 until it
was closed in 1928, if the appellant and her predecessors in interest
had acquired any right to the creek in question by virtue of
excavations which they had made thereon, they had lost such right
through prescription inasmuch as they failed to obtain, and in fact
they have not obtained, the necessary authorization to devote it to
their own use to the exclusion of all others. The use and enjoyment of
a creek, as any other property susceptible of appropriation, may be
acquired or lost through prescription, and the appellant and her
predecessors in interest certainly lost such right through the said
cause, and they cannot now claim it exclusively for themselves after
the general public had been openly using the same from 1906 to 1928.
When two different interests, one being private and the other public,
are in conflict with one another, the former should yield to the latter.</p>
<p> It is useless for the appellant now to allege that she has obtained
certificate of title No. 329 in her favor because the said certificate
does not confer upon her any right to the creek in question, inasmuch
as the said creek, being of the public domain, is included among the
various exceptions enumerated in section 39 of Act No. 496 to which the
said certificate is subject by express provision of the law, and
furthermore, because it so appears in the certificate itself.</p>
<p> The doctrine laid down in the case of the Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em>
Santos (G. R. No. 27202, promulgated September 2, 1927, not reported),
which the appellant invokes in her favor, is not applicable herein
because the subject matter in that case is not of the same nature as
the Batasan-Limasan or Pinac Bungalun creek. The thing involved therein
was simply a date or, in the words of the trial court, a low depression
on the defendant's land where there was a waterway passable by <em>bancas</em>
at high tide, but which completely dried up at low tide and during the
dry season. From what has been hereinbefore stated, it may be inferred
that the Batasan-Limasan creek is perfectly navigable by <em>bancas</em>
throughout the year, inasmuch as at the time it was measured in
November by employees and agents of the Bureau of Lands, it was more
than two meters deep at its mouth and around a meter and a half deep at
its shallow parts. Furthermore, in the case of Urbano Santos, the creek
in question was closed a few years after excavations had been made in
the land under consideration.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Street, Malcolm, Abad Santos, </em>and<em> Butte, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
