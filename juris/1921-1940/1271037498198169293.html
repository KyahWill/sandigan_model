				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> A scheme for the liquidation of the conjugal partnership of the 
deceased Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera and his surviving spouse Concepcion 
Cembrano, having been presented by the administrator of the estate, to the Court 
of First Instance of Manila, the latter, on March 15, 1927, decreed the 
following:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the inventories filed by the administrator are 
approved after the correction of the clerical error in item 11 of the first 
inventory substituting 50 for 30 so that 50 obligations of the Ice Factory 
appear instead of 30, and also the accounts rendered by the administrator to 
date; the administrator's motion of November 18, 1926, to include the fruits and 
rents of the property at Nos. 77 and 33 San Vicente St., Binondo, Manila, is 
denied; the scheme for the liquidation of the conjugal partnerships-presented by 
the administrator is disapproved and he is ordered to liquidate the conjugal 
partnership in the manner indicated herein, in pursuance whereof, he shall 
present the due liquidation and partition of the conjugal property at the time 
of the decedent's decease within the period of fifteen days, including therein 
the fruits or income of said property from his death, and the collation which 
each of the afore mentioned children is bound to make."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dissatisfied with said decree, the administrator appealed 
therefrom, alleging that the trial court erred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(1) In holding that Concepcion Cembrano, Tavera's widow, was 
entitled to an allowance for subsistence from the conjugal partnership from 1913 
to 1925, in spite of the fact that during that time she lived away from the 
conjugal dwelling against her husband's will and without judicial sanction.</p>
<p align="justify">"(2) In holding that such allowance amounted to eight hundred 
pesos (P800) a month.</p>
<p align="justify">"(3) In holding that during said separation the late husband, 
Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera, managed his wife's paraphernal property and ordered 
the payment of an allowance for subsistence to her.</p>
<p align="justify">"(4) In failing to find that any rigjit the wife may have had 
to a claim for support from the conjugal partnership has already prescribed.</p>
<p align="justify">"(5) In failing to hold that the rents from the wife's 
paraphernal property received by her during the separation must be returned to 
the conjugal partnership.</p>
<p align="justify">"(6) In failing to hold that the rents from said paraphernal 
property, even after the husband's death, should continue to go to the conjugal 
partnership until the liquidation is finally effected. </p>
<p align="justify">"(7) In failing to require Concepcion Cemibrano to reimburse 
the conjugal partnership in the sum of P3,660.71, which was delivered to her by 
Jose V. Ramirez from the partnership funds, in excess of the income of her 
paraphernal property.</p>
<p align="justify">"(8) In holding that Dr. Tavera's children, Carlos, Alfredo, 
and Carman, must reimburse the conjugal partnership, various sums delivered to 
them by the said decedent, totalling P31,952.97.</p>
<p align="justify">"(9) In disapproving the liquidation presented by the appellant 
administrator.</p>
<p align="justify">"(10) In issuing its appealed order of March 15, 1927, setting 
a new basis for the liquidation, and awarding Concepcion Cembrano a 
participation in the partnership property greater than that given to the husband 
or heirs by P53,313.77."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In 1884 Dr. Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera and Concepcion Cembrano 
contracted marriage, each having property. Three children were born of this 
union Carlos, Alfredo, and Carmen. During a part of Doctor Tavera's life, his 
wife left the conjugal roof, but the regime of the legal conjugal partnership to 
which the spouses had submitted was not altered, nor was there a separation of 
property. With the marriage subsisting, he died on March 26, 1925, survived by 
her and their three children.</p>
<p align="justify">The first question raised is whether while living, as we have 
said, away from the conjugal roof, the wife was entitled to support chargeable 
to the conjugal partnership.</p>
<p align="justify">Paragraph 5, article 1408 of the Civil Code says that the 
support of the family is chargeable to the conjugal partnership. Here is what 
Manresa says in explaining the reason for this provision, its scope and those 
included in this family support.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The support of the family includes the satisfaction of all its 
needs,<em> the duty to supply food</em> or sustenance, dwelling, clothing and 
medical attendance as provided in article 142. Mutual help and assistance is as 
much a duty of <em>and between the spouses</em>, as it is a duty of parents to 
support and educate their children. It is but logical and natural that the 
products of the labor and the fruits of the property, of the conjugal 
partnership be applied to the fulfillment of these obligations.</p>
<p align="justify">"This is the <em>most sacred and important</em> of all the 
obligations imposed in article 1408. The others may some times fail, this one, 
never. It does not matter that the children may or may not have property the 
usufruct where of may appertain to the parents, just as it matters not whether 
one of the spouses has any private property. The duty to support the family and 
provide for the education of the children is absolutely indispensable and is 
imposed upon the parents with overwhelming reality." (Italics ours.) (9 Manresa, 
Civil Code, 627, 628, Second Edition.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">While the marriage and the legal conjugal partnership subsist, 
the support of the spouses is a charge against the partnership, "the most sacred 
and important of all the obligations imposed in article 1408," to use Manresa's 
language.</p>
<p align="justify">The rights established in said article of the Civil Code must 
be acknowledged and respected, unless the law provides otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">The mere fact of living away from the conjugal roof which 
cannot be presumed culpable when, as in the instant case, there is no evidence 
of any fault or guilt on the part of the one who so lived, does not constitute a 
reason for annulling the right to support granted in the aforementioned article 
1408 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p align="justify">Even with respect to the support which the spouses owe each 
other, provided elsewhere in the said Code (art. 143), the fact of living apart, 
when it is not proved to be culpable does not extinguish the obligation to 
support (art. 152, do., and correlative articles).</p>
<p align="justify">But we are not here concerned with the personal obligation of 
one spouse to support the other. We are concerned with a wife's right enshrined 
by article 1408 of the Civil Code to receive support chargeable to the conjugal 
partnership while the marriage subsists and the legal regime of the conjugal 
partnership prevails.</p>
<p align="justify">It is an undisputed fact of record that while, during her 
husband's lifetime, Concepcion Cembrano did not live under the conjugal roof 
their marriage subsisted and the legal regime of the conjugal partnership 
prevailed.</p>
<p align="justify">The fact of not living under the conjugal roof is not one of 
the cases where the law relieves the conjugal partnership from the obligations 
imposed in article 1408 of the Civil Code, as may be seen from an examination of 
the different provisions contained in said fourth section (where the said art. 
1408 is), Chapter V, Title III, Book IV of the Civil Code, which deals with 
charges and obligations of the conjugal partnership, and includes the articles 
from 1408 to 1411, inclusive.</p>
<p align="justify">Doctor Tavera must so have understood it when, at the time that 
his wife was already living away from they conjugal dwelling, he himself, as 
shown by the record, willed that a monthly allowance be paid to her, as in fact 
it was paid.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true that at first this monthly allowance was paid out of 
the appellee's paraphernal property but when those funds ran short, the other 
funds under administration Were drawn upon, "to continue giving the monthly 
sum," as Mr. Ramirez said (p. 38, t. s. n.). So much so that, as the management 
of the paraphernal property was carried in a separate account, a time came when 
said account showed a debit balance, which indicates Doctor Tavera's resolute 
intention that his wife's monthly allowance should never fail. The fact that the 
amount of the allowance was sometimes reduced by order of Doctor Tavera in order 
the better to regulate the management of the conjugal part nership, does mot in 
the least constitute a proof against his resolution carried into effect to pay 
Concepcion Cembrano a monthly allowance for the latter's expenses.</p>
<p align="justify">This act of Doctor Tavera's constitutes a recognition of the 
appellee's right to receive support chargeable to the conjugal partnership, and 
as such is a bar to the prescrip tion alleged by the appellant (art. 1948, Civil 
Code; sec. 50, Code of Civil Procedure). Besides, in regard to the argument of 
prescription, it must be considered, as counsel for Concepcion Cembrano 
observes, this is not, an action for support not paid, but for the compensation 
thereof with the amounts paid to her as fruits and rents of her paraphernal 
property.</p>
<p align="justify">At has not been proved that Doctor Tavera discontinued managing 
his wife's paraphernal property. The terms of document Exhibit A do not lead to 
this conclusion. The fact that a separate account was opened for said property 
at Doctor Tavera's direction in 1915, does not signify that he stopped managing 
it.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court did not err, in our opinion, when it held that 
Concepcion Cembrano was entitled to receive support from the conjugal 
partnership from the year 1913 to the year 1925. And considering the social 
position of said family and the amount of the funds of the conjugal partnership, 
we find no sufficient reason to change the amount fixed by the trial court as a 
reasonable monthly allowance for the maintenance, dwelling, clothing and medical 
attendance of the appellee.</p>
<p align="justify">Passing now to the sums advanced to the three children of said 
marriage, Carlos, Alfredo, and Carmen it appears from summaries K, L, and M 
admitted as evidence that they are found in the private account of the late 
Doctor Tavera. As is pointed out in the appellant's brief (p. 61.) it does not 
appear that said sums were taken from the conjugal partnership funds, and that 
according to said summaries, we must infer that the aforementioned sums were 
taken, not from the partnership property of the spouses, but from the private 
funds of the said deceased.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, these three children cannot be required to bring 
into collation the respective sums they received which are detailed in said 
summaries Exhibits E, L, and M.</p>
<p align="justify">We find no merit in the appellant's assignments of error except 
in the eighth, which we find to be well taken, refer ring to the sums received 
from the deceased by his three children.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, with the modification of the order appealed from 
that the three children shall not be required to bring the P31,952.97 referred 
to in said judgment into collation, the same is hereby affirmed in all other 
respects, without costs. So ordered.</p> <em>Johnson, Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns,</em> and <em>Villa-Real, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
