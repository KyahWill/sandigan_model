				G.R. No. 21755, December 29, 1924</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF ANTONIO MOJAL, DECEASED. FILOMENA NAYVE, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. LEONA MOJAL AND LUCIANA AGUILAR, OPPONENTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a proceeding for the probate of the will of the deceased Antonio 
Mojal, instituted by his surviving spouse, Filomena Nayve. The probate is 
opposed by Leona Mojal and Luciana Aguilar, sister and niece, respectively, of 
the deceased.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Albay, which tried the case, overruled the 
objections to the will, and ordered the probate thereof, holding; that the 
document in controversy was the last will and testament of Antonio Mojal, 
executed in accordance with law. From this judgment the opponents appeal, 
assigning error to the decree of the court allowing the will to probate and 
overruling their opposition.</p>
<p>The will in question, Exhibit A, is composed of four sheets with written 
matter on only one side of each, that is, four pages written on four sheets. The 
four sides or pages containing written matter are paged "Pag. 1," "Pag. 2," 
"Pag. 3," "Pag. 4," successively. Each of the first two sides or pages, which 
was used, was signed by the testator and the three witnesses on the margin, left 
side of the reader. On the third page actually used, the signatures of the three 
witnesses appear also on, the margin, left side of the reader, but the signature 
of the testator is not on the margin, but about the middle of the page, at the 
end of the will and before the attestation clause. On the fourth page, the 
signatures of the witnesses do not appear on the margin, but at the bottom of 
the attestation clause, it being the signature of the testator that is on the 
margin, left side of the reader.</p>
<p>The defects attributed to the will are:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) The fact of not having been signed by the testator and the 
witnesses on each and every sheet on the left margin; (<em>b</em>) the fact of 
the sheets of the document not being paged with letters; (<em>c</em>) the fact 
that the attestation clause does not state the number of sheets or pages 
actually used of the will; and (<em>d</em>) the fact that the testator does not 
appear to have signed all the sheets in the presence of the three witnesses, and 
the latter to have attested and signed all the sheets in the presence of the 
testator and of each other.</p>
<p>As to the signatures on the margin, it is true, as above stated, that the 
third page actually used was signed by the testator, not on the left margin, as 
it was by the witnesses, but about the middle of the page and at the end of the 
will; and that the fourth page was signed by the witnesses, not on the left 
margin, as it was by the testator, but about the middle of the page and at the 
end of the attestation clause.</p>
<p>In this respect the holding of this court in the case of Avera vs. Garcia and 
Rodriguez (42 Phil., 145), is applicable, wherein the will in question was 
signed by the testator and the witnesses, not on the left, but right, margin. 
The rule laid down in that case is that the document contained the necessary 
signatures on each page, whereby each page of the will was authenticated and 
safeguarded against any possible alteration. In that case, the validity of the 
will was sustained, and consequently it was allowed to probate.</p>
<p>Applying that doctrine to the instant case, we hold that, as each and every 
page used of the will bears the signatures of the testator and the witnesses, 
the fact that said signatures do not all appear on the left margin of each page 
does not detract from the validity of the will.</p>
<p>Turning to the second defect alleged, that is to say, the fact that the 
sheets of the document are not paged with letters, suffice it to cite the case 
of Unson vs. Abella (43 Phil., 494), where this court held that paging with 
Arabic numerals and not with letters, as in the case before us, is within the 
spirit of the law and is just as valid as paging with letters.</p>
<p>As to the proposition that the attestation clause does not state the number 
of sheets or pages of the will, which is the third defect assigned, it must be 
noted that the last paragraph of the will here in question and the attestation 
clause, coming next to-it, are of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In witness whereof, I set my hand unto this will here in the town of 
Camalig, Albay, Philippine Islands, this 26th day of November, nineteen hundred 
and eighteen, composed of four sheets, including the next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"ANTONIO MOJAL</p></blockquote>
<p>"(Signed and declared by the testator Don Antonio Mojal to be his last will 
and testament in the presence of each of us, and at the request of said testator 
Don Antonio Mojal, we signed this will in the presence of each other and of the 
testator.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"PEDRO CARO<br>"SILVERIO MORCO<br>"ZOILO 
MASINAS"</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>As may be seen, the number of sheets is stated in said last paragraph of the 
will. It is true that in the case of Uy Coque vs. Navas L. Sioca (43 Phil., 
405), it was held that the attestation clause must state the number of sheets or 
pages composing the will; but when, as in the case before us, such fact, while 
it is not stated in the attestation clause, appears at the end of the will 
proper, so that no proof <em>aliunde</em> is necessary of the number of the 
sheets of the will, then there can be no doubt that it complies with the 
intention of the law that the number of sheets of which the will is composed be 
shown by the document itself, to prevent the number of the sheets of the will 
from being unduly increased or decreased.</p>
<p>With regard to the last defect pointed out, namely, that the testator does 
not appear to have signed on all the sheets of the will in the presence of the 
three witnesses, and the latter to have attested and signed on all the sheets in 
the presence of the testator and of each other, it must be noted that in the 
attestation clause above set out it is said that the testator signed the will 
<em>"in the presence of each of the witnesses</em>" and the latter signed 
<em>"in the presence of each other and of the testator.</em>" So that, as to 
whether the testator and the attesting witnesses saw each other sign the will, 
such a requirement was clearly and sufficiently complied with. What is not 
stated in this clause is whether the testator and the witnesses signed all the 
sheets of the will.</p>
<p>The act of the testator and the witnesses seeing reciprocally the signing of 
the will is one which cannot be proven by the mere exhibition of the will unless 
it is stated in the document. And this fact is expressly stated in the 
attestation clause now before us. But the fact of the testator and the witnesses 
having signed all the sheets of the will may be proven by the mere examination 
of the document, although it does not say anything about this, and if that is 
the fact, as it is in the instant case, the danger of fraud in this respect, 
which is what the law tries to avoid, does not exist.</p>
<p>Therefore, as in the instant case the fact that the testator and the 
witnesses signed each and every page of the will is proven by the mere 
examination of the signatures in the will, the omission to expressly state such 
evident fact does not invalidate the will nor prevent its probate. </p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed with the costs against the appellants. So 
ordered.</p><em>Johnson, Malcolm</em> and <em>Villamor, JJ.</em>, concur.

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION </em></p>
<p><strong>AVANCEÑA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and the probate of 
the will denied on the ground that the number of sheets or pages composing the 
will is not stated in the attestation clause.</p>The attestation clause is 
necessary and essential for the validity of the will (<em>In re</em> Estate at 
Neumark, 46 Phil., 841). The law requires that the attestation clause should 
state the number of sheets or pages of the will and In re Will of Andrada (42 
Phil., 180) it was held that a document said to be the will of a deceased person 
cannot be probated when the attestation clause does not state the number of 
sheets or pages composing the will. The fact that in the will proper the number 
of pages composing it is stated, does not cure the defect of it not having been 
stated in the attestation clause. The intention of the law in providing that it 
should be stated necessarily in the attestation clause is undoubtedly that the 
attesting witnesses and not the testator should certify this fact. As held in 
the case of Abangan vs. Abangan (40 Phil., 476), the attestation clause pertains 
to the attesting witnesses and it is not necessary that the testator should also 
sign it. On the other hand the will proper pertains to the testator, and not to 
the attesting witnesses and it is not necessary also that the latter should sign 
it (In re Will of Tan Diuco, 45 Phil., 807), as in fact they did not sign it in 
the instant case. Therefore, the statement of the number of sheets or pages of 
the will in the will proper is not a compliance with the law, for in that way it 
is only the testator who states the fact and not the attesting witnesses, as 
required by the law. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION </em></p>
<p><strong>OSTRAND, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Avanceña. The majority 
opinion is directly contrary to the decisions of this court in the cases of 
<em>In re</em> Will of Andrada (42 Phil., 180) and Uy Coque vs. Navas L. Sioca 
(43 Phil., 405) and violates the well-konwn rule that statutes prescribing the 
formalities to be observed in the execution of wills must be strictly construed. 
And this is done in the face of the fact that the attestation clause in the will 
before us evidently is drawn in accordance with the original text of section 618 
of the Code of Civil Procedure which the Legislature, by Act No. 2645, found' it 
necessary to amend and strengthen by adding precisely the requirements which the 
court now virtually declares non-essential.</p>
<p><strong>STREET, J.</strong>, concurs in the dissenting opinions of Justices 
Avanceña and Ostrand.</p>
