				<H3>PEDRO LACASTE, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF  LANDS,  OPPOSITOR AND  APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Director of Lands opposed the application for registration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land described in the&nbsp; plan Exhibit&nbsp; A. The court&nbsp; overruled the opposition; declared the applicant Pedro Lacaste and his sisters Ramona, Agustina and Concepcion owners of the land,&nbsp; as sole heirs of the deceased Nicolas Lacaste; ordered its registration as applied for,&nbsp; and declared the free patent No.&nbsp; 18007 issued by the Director of Lands in favor of Agustin Root over&nbsp; a portion of this land, null and void.<br><br>The land here in question was in the possession of, and cultivated by,&nbsp; Nicolas Lacaste&nbsp; from 1883 up to&nbsp; his death in&nbsp; 1927, and&nbsp; from&nbsp; this&nbsp; latter date&nbsp; the said&nbsp; possession passed to his son Pedro Lacaste.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1895 Nicolas Lacaste commenced and obtained a possessory information, which was duly registered, over the land in question,&nbsp; and from 1906 he paid the land tax thereon up to his death.&nbsp; These facts have been fully established and no evidence&nbsp; to&nbsp; the contrary has been adduced.&nbsp; By force of this possession, the land became private property.&nbsp; (De los Reyes vs. Razon, 38 Phil., 480; Susi vs. Razon and Director of Lands, 48 Phil., 424; National Bank vs. Ortiz Luis, 53 Phil., 649.)<br><br>The Solicitor-General directs attention to the circumstance that the possessory information presented as evidence in this case refers to several&nbsp; parcels of land&nbsp; measuring in the aggregate&nbsp; 8 hectares, 71 ares and 77 centiares only, whereas the&nbsp; area of the land applied for is&nbsp; 41&nbsp; hectares, 87 ares and 23 centiares.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brief of the Solicitor-General reproduces the description and area of the parcels of land covered by the possessory information, giving a total area of 8 hectares, 71 ares and 77 centiares.&nbsp; However, we note that parcel No. 5, to which the brief of the Solicitor-General attributes an area of 3 hectares and 5 ares only, appears in the possessory information Exhibit X as containing&nbsp; an area of 23&nbsp; hectares&nbsp; and&nbsp; 55&nbsp; ares.&nbsp; This error has an important bearing on this aspect of the case brought out by the Solicitor-General, because it&nbsp; discloses that the difference&nbsp; between the area of the&nbsp; parcels covered by the possessory information and that of the land applied for, is not so great as to affect the identity of the land.<br><br>On the&nbsp; other hand, it appears that in 1928 this land was applied for as a homestead by Agustin Root and Salvador Gangani.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1923, while Gangani's application was still pending,&nbsp; free patent&nbsp; No. 18007&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued in favor&nbsp; of Root.&nbsp; According to applicant Pedro Lacaste,&nbsp; both Root and Gangani were his tenants&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; after his father's death, and that in 1928,&nbsp; 1929 and 1930, they gave him a share of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fruits&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; by&nbsp; way&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>canon</i>. Thereafter and without his consent, Root and Gangani applied for the land as a homestead, whereupon&nbsp; he filed his opposition with the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp; The evidence for the government corroborates the&nbsp; fact that Pedro&nbsp; Lacaste actually filed his opposition, although the same was later denied.<br><br>If the land applied for had ceased to be&nbsp; public and has passed to&nbsp; private ownership, the Director of Lands could not grant a free patent therefor,&nbsp; and having done so, the title thus&nbsp; issued is&nbsp; null and void.<br><br>It must be&nbsp; noted that there&nbsp; is no evidence&nbsp; counter to the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; established by the applicant.&nbsp; The only fact proven by the government, as&nbsp; oppositor,&nbsp; through its lone witness Fernando Bernardo, is&nbsp; that before title was issued to Root and before&nbsp; Gangani's application was approved, an investigation had been made by subordinate employees of the bureau who had not&nbsp; been&nbsp; put upon the witness stand in this case.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the appealed judgment is affirmed, without special pronouncement as to the costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
