				G.R. No. 22399, December 12, 1924</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE WILL OF LAUREANA ANTONIO, DECEASED. MARIANO ANTONIO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. SANTIAGO ANTONIO ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLEES, AND JORGE R. NERI ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a proceeding for the probate of the will of Laureana Antonio. The 
lower court denied the probate of this will on the ground that it was not 
executed with the solemnities prescribed by the law.</p>
<p>The will in question consists of seven pages actually used. It is not denied 
that its first six pages are in accordance with the law, but there is a dispute 
as to the last page 7. In this page the will ends, and at the bottom thereof 
there appear the signatures of the testator and the three witnesses to the will, 
after which comes the attestation clause signed also at the bottom by the three 
witnesses. No signature whatever appears on either margin of this page, and the 
lower court denied the probate of the will on account of the testator and the 
three subscribing witnesses not having signed on the left margin.</p>
<p>The decision of this court in the case of Abangan <em>vs.</em> Abangan (40 
Phil., 476), is square in point. In that case the will had but twq pages. The 
first contained entirely the whole text of the will, and the second contained 
the last part of the attestation clause. The first page was signed by the 
testator at the bottom of the text of the will with the three attesting 
witnesses, and the second was also signed at the bottom of the attestation 
clause by the three witnesses. In none of said pages was there any signature on 
either margin. In that case this court held that the will should be admitted to 
probate. On principle there is no difference between the instant, and the 
Abangan case. If there is any, as in fact there is, as to certain details, it is 
in favor of the probate of the will in the instant case. It must not be 
forgotten that the object of the law in prescribing ceritain solemnities for the 
execution of wills is to insure and safeguard their authenticity, and 
consequently the courts, in deciding the various cases that may present 
themselves on this matter, must not lose sight of this object of the law. In the 
instant case, as above indicated, the attesting witnesses signed twice on the 
last page of the will of Laureana Antonio, while in the Abangan case the 
witnesses signed only once in each of its two pages. So that the only possible 
objection to this page of the will of Laureana Antonio is that it was not signed 
on the left margin by the testator and the three attesting witnesses, it having 
been signed only at the bottom of the text of the will and the attestation 
clause. This is exactly the rule laid down in the Abangan case to the effect 
that under such circumstances the absence of the signatures of the testator and 
the attesting witnesses from the left margin is not such a defect as would 
justify the denial of its probate.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the will of Laureana Antonio 
admitted to probate, without special finding as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, </em>and 
<em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
