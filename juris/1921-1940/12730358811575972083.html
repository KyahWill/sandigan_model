				<H3>ESTATE OF THE DECEASED FRUTO SANTOS MACARIO SULIT, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. FAUSTA SANTOS ET AL., OPPOSITORS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from orders of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, 
disallowing certain items of the account rendered by the executor of the estate 
of the deceased Fruto Santos. A legal question which has not heretofore been 
decided in this jurisdiction is presented, and is whether the expenses incurred 
by an executor or administrator to procure a bond is a proper charge against the 
estate.
<p>One of the contested items in the account of the administrator which invites 
but brief comment has to do with a claim of P500 for attorney's fees, which the 
trial judge reduced to P250. The action of the presiding judge was predicated on 
the failure of the executor to secure authority from the court for the incurring 
of expenses for. legal services, and on the fact that some of the services 
performed by the attorney should have been performed by the executor personally. 
It is well settled that the Court of First Instance has a discretionary right to 
fix attorney's fees in testamentary proceedings pending before it, and no 
improper misuse of that discretion is here disclosed.</p>
<p>The trial judge further refused to permit the executor of the estate to 
secure reimbursement from the estate for money paid as premium on the bond filed 
by him as special administrator, and for the preparation, filing, and 
substitution of his bond as such and as executor of the estate, all totalling 
P173.95. These are the facts from which arise the question suggested in the 
beginning of this decision.</p>
<p>Our Code of Civil Procedure provides that "Before an executor, or an 
administrator, enters upon the execution of his trust, and letters testamentary 
or of administration are issued, the person to whom they are issued shall give a 
bond in such reasonable sum as the court directs, with one or more sufficient 
sureties, * * *" (sec. 643). In the event an executor neglects to give a bond, 
the court may grant letters testamentary to another (sec. 646). Finally, section 
680 of the Code provides that "The executor or administrator shall be allowed 
necessary expenses in the care, management, and settlement of the estate, * * *, 
and for his services certain specified per diems and percent ages. The case of 
the Testamentaria de la Finada Felipa. Alonzo y de Mesa, trusteeship of the 
"Institute Burgos",: Luis Lauchengco, trustee and appellee, <em>vs.</em> Vicente 
E. Reyes, executor and appellant, No. 24699,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> which the trial court refused to follow, tout 
which the appellant contends is decisive of the appeal, was a case in division 
which related to the construction of a will in determining if the premium for 
the bonds and attorney's fees should be allowed, and so is neither in point nor" 
controlling in this instance. In the case of Lizarraga Hermanos <em>vs</em>. 
Abada ([1919], 40 Phil., 124), this court deduced that the expenses of 
administration are those necessary for the management of the property, for 
protecting it against destruction or deterioration, and possibly for the 
production of fruits.</p>
<p>Turning to the authorities, we find the rule relative to the bond of the 
executor or administrator announced in Corpus Juris in the following 
language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In some states the statutes allow the expense of procuring a bond for the 
representative to be charged against the estate; but in the absence of such a 
statute it is well settled as a general rule that the amount paid by the 
personal representative to a guaranty or indemnity company or to individual 
bondsmen, in order to procure" sureties on his official bond is not chargeable 
against the estate, in addition to his usual recompense, although a contrary 
view has been expressed." (24 C. J., 112.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Woerner in his treatise on the American Law of Administration states the rule 
even more tersely as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unless the statute in terms so provides, (and such is now the case in a 
number of States) an administrator or executor will not be entitled to charge 
the estate with money which he paid a surety corporation or trust company for 
becoming surety on his bond." (Vol. 3, p. 1775.)</p></blockquote>
<p>We are shown no good reason for not accepting in this jurisdiction the 
general rule, but out of caution will examine some of the authorities more 
closely.</p>
<p>The State of California, as an example, in 1905 adopted a statute reading: 
"Any * * * executor required by law or by order of court to give a bond as such, 
shall be allowed as part of the lawful expense of executing his trust, the sum 
paid for such bond, not exceeding, however, one-half (1/2) or one (1) per cent, 
of the amount of such bond, for each year that the same shall remain in force." 
The question arose if this law should be given a retrospective effect, but the 
appellate court held that it should not be thus construed, and that before the 
act was enacted the expenditure could not have been legally allowed. (In re 
Richmond's Estate [1908], 99 Pac, 554.) In Missouri, likewise, it Was the 
holding of the Court of Appeals of that State that the law of 1917, allowing 
administrators a reasonable cost for a surety company bond, does not apply where 
the bond was secured and the account approved by the probate court before the 
act was adopted. (In re Buck's Estate [1920], 220 S. W., 714.)</p>
<p>In the State of Texas, the law provided that before the issuance of letters 
testamentary or of administration the person to whom such letters are granted 
must enter into bond with at least two good and sufficient sureties. The law 
further provided for commissions to executors and administrators. Article 3623 
of the Civil Statutes specifically provided this: "Executors and administrators 
shall also be allowed all reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by them in 
the preservation, safe keeping and management of the estate, and all reasonable 
attorney's fees that may be necessarily incurred by them in the course of the 
administration:" The Court of Appeals observed "that it is under the last-cited 
article, if at all, that statutory authority must be found for charging the 
estate" with the premium paid for the making of the administrator's bond. The 
court ruled (1) That in the absence of some statutory authority, a premium paid 
for the making of an administrator's bond is not a proper charge against the 
estate, but should be borne by the administrator, and (2) that the Civil 
Statutes, including article 3623, do not authorize the administrator to charge 
against the estate a premium paid for the making of his bond. (Jarvis 
<em>vs.</em> Drew [1919], 215 S. W., 970.) The close analogy between the Texas 
statute and the Philippine statute will not escape attention.</p>
<p>The aforementioned cases, in reality, seem superfluous in ascertaining the 
true principle. The position of an executor or administrator is one of trust. In 
fact, the Philippine Code of Civil Procedure so mentions it is proper for the 
law to safeguard the estates of deceased persons by requiring the executor or 
administrator to give a suitable bond. The ability to give this bond is in the 
nature of a qualification for the office. The execution and approval of the bond 
constitute a condition precedent to acceptance of the responsibilities of the 
trust. If an individual does not desire to assume the position of executor or 
administrator, he may refuse to do so. On the other hand, when the individual 
profers an adequate bond and has it approved by the probate court, he thereby 
admits the adequacy of the compensation which ia permitted him pursuant to law. 
It would be a very far-fetched construction to deduce, that the giving of a bond 
in order to qualify for the office of executor or administrator is a necessary 
expense in the care, management, and settlement of the estate within the meaning 
of section 680 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for these are expenses incurred 
after the executor or administrator has met the requirements of the law and has 
entered upon the performance of his duties. (See In re Eby's Estate [1894], 30 
Atl, 124.)</p>
<p>We feel that the orders of Judge Mapa in this case rested on a fine sense of 
official duty, sometimes lacking in cases of this character, to protect the 
residue of the estate of a deceased person from unjustifiable inroads by an 
executor, and that as these orders conform to the facts and the law, they1 are 
entitled to be fortified by an explicit pronouncement from this court. We rule 
that the expense incurred by an executor or administrator to procure a bond is 
not a proper charge against the estate, and that section 680 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure does not authorize the executor or administrator to charge 
against the estate the money spent for the presentation, filing, and 
substitution of a bond. Accordingly, the orders appealed from will be affirmed 
in all particulars, with the costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>

<p><em>Imperial, J.,</em> with whom concur <em>Villamor</em> and <em>Villa 
Real., JJ.,</em> concurring and dissenting in part:</p>
<p>We concur with the majority in so far as the attorney's fees are concerned. 
But for the reasons hereinafter stated, we are of opinion that the appellant 
should be credited with the sum of P173.95, which he paid for the premium, 
preparation, and filing of his bond as administrator and substitution 
thereof.</p>
<p>We agree that the Code of Civil Procedure does not expressly authorize the 
reimbursement, by way of administration expenses, of the premium the 
administrator or executor has had to pay upon the bond; but the same is true of 
attorney's fees, and yet we have uniformly held that such fees constitute legal 
expenses of administration, for which the administrator is entitled to 
reimbursement. Since the same reason exists (in both cases), we do not see why 
they should not be decided the same way.</p>
<p>The law in this jurisdiction defining1 and regulating the expenses of 
judicial administration is set forth in section 680 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, reading in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>How Allowed, for Services.</em>—The executor or administrator shall be 
allowed necessary expenses in the care, management, and settlement of the 
estate, * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>It is evident that by expenses of administration we are to understand those 
made for the benefit of an hereditary estate, its care and preservation, and the 
prevention of deterioration. (Lizarraga-Hermanos <em>vs.</em> Abada, 40 Phil., 
124.) Undoubtedly the bond upon which the administrator or executor pays the 
premium is given for the benefit of the inheritance, answering as it does 
directly for the faithful performance of the charge, to wit, the good care, 
custody, and preservation of the inheritance. The nature and purpose of the 
expenses must determine whether or not it is an expense of administration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * In some states it is provided by statute that any executor or 
administrator required to give bond may include as a part of the lawful expense 
of executing his trust the sum paid a bonding corporation for the premium on the 
administration bond. The rule has been laid down in broad terms that whenever 
any statute or other law imposes a personal duty upon an executor or 
administrator to pay money for the benefit of the estate in his care, it follows 
under the general principles of jurisprudence, without special statutory 
provision, that the money so paid will be chargeable to the estate, and that in 
equity at least he will be entitled to reimbursement. * * *" (11 R. C. L., par. 
263, p. 235.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In our opinion, the item of expense under discussion should have been 
approved as were the attorney's fees.</p>
