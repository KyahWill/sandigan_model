<p>Antonio Tanpoco died in the year 1920 and left a will dividing his estate of 
over P300,000 among four sons, one-half of which he bequeathed to Tan Kim Hong, 
the claimant, whom he described in his will as his legitimate son, and the other 
half he left in equal shares to his three adopted sons, Tan Kimco, Tan Kimbio 
and Tan Kim Choo, and appointed Go Siu San, a resident of Manila, as executor of 
his will, which provided that no bond should be required.</p>
<p>November 22, 1920, two Chinese named Tan Kim Lay and Te Sue, one of Tarlac 
and the other of Manila, were appointed and qualified as commissioners, and 
later they published the usual notice to creditors to present their claims 
within six months at the office of Attorney M. G. Goyena, of Manila.</p>
<p>June 29, 1921, the commissioners presented their report to the court in 
which, among others, they reported the allowance of the claim here in 
question.</p>
<p>At that time all of the heirs, including Tan Kim Hong, were minors and had 
lived in China since the death of Antonio Tanpoco, as also had the widow of the 
deceased.</p>
<p>On June 29, 1921, the date the commissioners' report was filed, the executor 
filed a motion asking for the appointment of an attorney of his own choice as 
<em>curador ad litem</em> for the minor heirs which, among other things, recites 
as follows:</p>
<p>"2. That the heirs who are interested in the estate of the above entitled 
action are all minors, to wit: Tan Kimco, age 20; Tan Kim Hong, age 12; Tan 
Kimbio, age 11; and Tan Kim Choo, age 4; and that all the above heirs are now in 
China, and the day of their return to the Islands is unknown to the 
administrator of the estate."</p>
<p>The court ignored the request of the executor, and on July 2,1921, upon its 
own motion, appointed Mr. Felipe Canillas, who treated his appointment as a 
formality and did not make any investigation of the facts, and hence the report 
of the commissioners was approved on July 14, 1922.</p>
<p>During all of this time the minor heirs were still in China. In September, 
1922, they arrived in Manila and employed counsel to represent and protect their 
interests, and it was then that Chan Seng learned for the first time of the 
allowance of the claim in favor of Tan Kim Hong. Upon her motion, on November 
27, 1922, Judge Harvey ordered an investigation of the administration of Go Siu 
San as executor, which was made by Mr. Felipe Canillas, who still held the 
position of <em>curador ad litem</em> of all the minor heirs, including the 
claimant, who made a written report to the court, the material portion of which 
is as follows:</p>
<p>"In the salary ledger of 1920 there appears to have been credited, without 
expressing their origin,- in favor of Tan Kim Hong the following sums:</p>
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="middle" valign="top" width="38%">January 25 </td>
<td width="23%">
<p align="right">P20,000.00</p></td>

<td valign="bottom">
<div align="right">Total </div></td>
<td valign="bottom">
<p align="right">40,000.00</p></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>and in the salary ledger of 1921 this amount was reduced to the sum of 
P38,766.69 (P33,766.69) which is exactly the amount of the claim which is said 
to have been presented and admitted against the estate (see the report of the 
commissioners) . Now, who is this Tan Kim Hong? He is just one of the children 
of the deceased, a minor who is now 13 years old and who has been made the heir 
to one-half of all the property mentioned in clause 'A' of the will of the 
deceased. Insofar as the basis of this claim is concerned and insofar as the 
person who pretends to have represented the minor in the presentation of the 
claim is concerned nothing is explained in the record nor in the books of the 
administrator. Therefore, this claim should be discarded by reason of its 
illegality and nullity and the administrator required to explain its 
presentation and admission. If, as the administrator pretends, this sum was 
credited in the books by the deceased himself in favor of his boy Tan Kim Hong 
by reason of his being a favorite son, and if the latter legally accepted the 
donation, such an act could only amount to a donation 'inter vivos' and the 
authority to determine the rights of the donee are not within the attributes of 
commissioners on valuation and claims."</p>
<p>The report concluded with a recommendation for the removal of the executor 
for gross misconduct and fraud, and the annulment of the claim of Tan Kim Hong. 
</p>
<p>After the report was filed, a hearing was had and testimony was taken, and 
Judge Harvey removed Go Siu San as executor, and in his order of removal, among 
other things, said:</p>
<p>"The commissioner Te Sue said that he had not received any claim; that the 
claims which appear in the report were taken from the books of the business of 
the deceased, Antonio Tanpoco (p. 16, s. n.); nevertheless, the claim of Tan 
Peng Sue does not appear in the report of these commissioners on claims although 
it appears in the books and was afterwards accepted by the commissioners last 
appointed. In the report of the first commissioners on valuation and claims 
there appears a claim of Tan Kim Ho (Tan Kim Hong) for the sum of P38,766.69 
without any voucher (pp. 11-12, s. n.). This claimant is a minor and was not 
represented by any guardian or <em>curador</em>. The commissioner Te Sue 
testified that he had gone to Tarlac but once and in the year 1922 to attend the 
claims, but the report of the commissioners bears date previous to that time 
which demonstrates evidently that the administrator Go Siu San was the person 
who furnished the data upon which the supposed claims which appear in the report 
of the commissioners were based notwithstanding the fact that they received no 
claims."</p>
<p>After such proceedings, nothing was further done until November 14, 1923, 
when the present administrator applied to the court for authority, among other 
things, to pay the claim in question, to which the appellee appeared and 
objected. The court denied the application of the present guardian of the 
claimant to require the administrator to pay the claim in question upon the 
ground that it was void and fictitious, from which Tan Kim Hong appeals, 
contending that the lower court erred in hearing and sustaining the objections 
to the allowance of the claim, and in denying the motion of the administrator 
for authority to pay the claim.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The appellant cites and relies upon sections 773, 774 and 775 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure as follows:</p>
<p>"SEC. 773. <em>An appeal from allowance or disallowance of claim</em>.—Any 
executor or administrator may appeal to the Court of First Instance from the 
allowance of any claim against the estate by the committee appointed for the 
purpose of allowing claims against the estate of deceased persons, or from the 
disallowance, in whole or in part, of any offset presented by the executor or 
administrator to such claim; any creditor may appeal to the Court of First 
Instance from the disallowance of the whole or any part of his claim by such 
committee, or the allowance of the whole or a part of any claim in offset to his 
claim against the estate by such committee.</p>
<p>"SEC. 774.<em> If administrator does not appeal, heir or creditor 
may.</em>—If the executor or administrator does not appeal from the allowance of 
any claim against the estate by the committee, or the disallowance in whole or 
in part by it of any offset in behalf of the estate against such claim, any heir 
or creditor may appeal to the Court of First Instance from such allowance or 
disallowance, and prosecute the appeal in the name of the executor or 
administrator, upon filing in court a bond to the administrator or executor, to 
be approved by the court, conditioned that he will prosecute the appeal to 
effect, and indemnify the administrator or executor against all costs and 
expenses, by reason of the appeal, and will likewise pay to the claimant such 
costs as may be ultimately awarded to him by reason of such appeal. The bond 
shall be available for such claimant as well as for the executor or 
administrator.</p>
<p>"SEC. 775. <em>Perfecting appeal.</em>—The appeal provided in the two 
preceding sections shall be perfected by filing with the clerk of the Court of 
First Instance that has jurisdiction of the estate, within twenty-five days 
after the committee's report is filed therein, a statement that the person so 
appealing is dissatisfied with the action of the committee in respect to the 
item or items complained of, and appeals therefrom to the court."</p>
<p>He points out that the report of the committee allowing the claim was made 
and filed on June 29, 1921, and contends that it became automatically final on 
July 14, 1921; that the opponent should have made her opposition within the time 
specified in the Code, and that her failure to take the statutory appeal is a 
bar to all defenses, citing and relying upon the case of De los Santos vs. Reyes 
(37 Phil., 104) the syllabus of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"1. DESCENT AND DISTRIBUTION; CLAIMS AGAINST ESTATES OP DECEASED PERSONS.—It 
is not sufficient to plead on the part of an objector, to the allowance by the 
committee of appraisal of a credit against a testate or intestate succession, 
that he had a good defense, but he must plead it in due time and set forth the 
facts and grounds on which he intends to rest it, especially when the credit 
allowed appears to have been proven at trial by means of documents which were 
neither contradicted nor assailed as false, criminally or civilly.</p>
<p>"2. ID. ; ID.—Any error, fraud, credit, defect, or vice, of a substantial 
nature and productive of annulment, found in the committee's report, may serve 
as a ground for appeal. be pleaded in the trial had in the Court of First 
Instance, and be a subject-matter of the final judgment rendered in the 
proceedings, provided that the person who believed himself to have been 
prejudiced shall have appealed from the report of the commissioners and from the 
order approving it, for, if he does not do so, after the lapse of the period 
fixed by law, all claims made for reasons of the annulment of the proceedings 
had, will be valid."</p>
<p>On page 113 of the opinion in that case, the court says: </p>
<p>"From the careful examination made of the record in this case it appears that 
the proceedings had by the trial court, as well as those by the committee of 
appraisal and claims, were in accordance with law, as the preinserted provisions 
and others of the Code of Civil Procedure were substantially complied with, and 
it cannot be affirmed on good grounds that the irregularities complained of by 
counsel for the minor Alfredo Ocampo were essentially such or that they in any 
manner prejudiced his rights and interests, for both he and his mother Gervasia 
de los Santos, as well as their attorneys, knew positively and certainly that 
two commissioners of appraisal had been appointed, had commenced to discharge 
their duties, had published notices, by means of edicts posted in public places; 
including the pueblo of Binan, and by publications in the newspaper La 
Vanguardia, calling the creditors of the estate of the decedent Ramon Ocampo. If 
the mother of the minor Ocampo had actually had justifiable grounds whereupon to 
oppose by a just and good defense the claim presented by the administrator of 
the estate of the deceased wife of the decedent Ocampo, in behalf of the rights 
and interests of her minor son, she would have filed her objections opportunely 
during the period of the six months fixed by the commissioners and on the day 
and hour set by them. * * *" (37 Phil., 113.)</p>
<p>In other words, the court found as a fact that in the De los Santos vs. Reyes 
case, supra, there was a substantial compliance with all of the statutory 
requirements, and the decision in that case was based upon that fact. But there 
is a marked distinction between the facts there and those in the instant case. 
Here, all of the parties in interest were minors. The evidence is conclusive 
that at the time the alleged claim was allowed, Tan Kim Hong was only twelve 
years of age, and that all of the other parties were minors. There is no claim 
or pretense that Tan Kim Hong had a guardian or that anyone had the legal 
authority to appear for and present his claim or to represent him, or that his 
claim was ever presented. There is no claim or pretense that any of the parties 
in interest had any knowledge of the fact that the claim was presented and 
allowed before they came to Manila from China in September, 1922. As a matter of 
fact, there is no evidence that the claim in question in any manner, shape or 
form was ever presented to the commissioners by anyone. For aught that appears 
in the record, the claim was allowed by the commissioners on their own motion 
and of their own volition. It also appears that the entries which were made in 
the books of the deceased were made by his bookkeeper, and there is nothing to 
show that they were made by the authority of the deceased. It is very 
significant that the will of the deceased was made sometime after the entries 
were made, and that no reference whatever is made in the will to the claim in 
question.</p>
<p>The authorities cited by the appellant upon the question of <em>res 
judicata</em> are good law, but are not in point. Here, there was no claim 
presented to the commissioners. Hence, there was nothing for them to adjudicate. 
Neither the claimant nor anyone on his behalf made or presented a claim. Hence, 
it must follow that the commissioners did not have any authority to allow or 
reject the claim, and that they were without jurisdiction to act in the 
premises. Neither is the evidence in the record sufficient to sustain the claim. 
Outside of the fact that the above entries' were made in the books of the 
deceased by his bookkeeper, there is nothing in the record upon which to base 
the claim, and it does not even appear that such entries were authorized by the 
deceased.</p>
<p>Giving full force and effect to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure 
above quoted, all of the prerequisites and essential elements of a judgment are 
wanting.</p>
<p>Ruling Case Law, volume 15, page 569, says:</p>
<p>"A judgment is the law's last word in a judicial controversy. It may 
therefore be defined as the final consideration and determination of a court of 
competent jurisdiction upon the matters submitted to it, in an action or 
proceeding. A more precise definition is that a judgment is the conclusion of 
the law upon the matters contained in the record, or the application of the law 
to the pleadings and to the facts, as found by the court or admitted by the 
parties, or deemed to exist upon their default in a course of judicial 
proceedings. It should be noted that that only is a judgment which is pronounced 
between the parties to an action upon the matters submitted to the court for 
decision. * * *"</p>
<p>In the instant case there was no claim made, filed or presented by anyone. 
Legally speaking, the allowance of the claim would be like rendering a judgment 
without the filing of a complaint, or even the making or presentment of a 
claim.</p>
<p>Upon the facts shown, to legalize the allowance of the claim with all of the 
formalities and requisites of a final judgment, would be a travesty upon 
justice. It appears from the record before us that the commissioners did not 
have any jurisdiction to allow the claim; that as to the claim in question their 
proceedings were null and void ab initio, and hence they were not res judicata, 
and in addition to that, it clearly appears that the allowance of the claim was 
a fraud upon the appellee.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Street, Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor, Ostrand, </em>and <em>Romualdez, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
