				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action has been brought to secure damages pursuant to the
provisions of the Land Registration Law. In the Court of First Instance
of Tayabas, fourteen plaintiffs were successful in their attempt for
there a judgment was handed down which awarded them an aggregate total
of P42,942. On appeal from this judgment, various questions are
submitted, but we will confine discussion to. the basic preliminary
question presented relating to the applicability of section 107 of the
Land Registration Law (Act No. 496).
<p> Without going into all the <span style="font-style: italic;">minutise</span> of the facts, it is sufficient
to note, as to the defendants, that they possess a Torrens title to the
land decreed in their favor in regular registration proceedings and
later confirmed in the <span style="font-style: italic;">cadastre</span> case. As against this incontestable
title, the plaintiffs offer a weak case. The contracts on which they
rely to protect their alleged interests in the coconut trees on the
land are attempted to be proved by oral testimony in possible
contravention of the Statute of Frauds. The man with whom those alleged
contracts were made is dead and cannot speak to rebut any of the
testimony offered to prove the existence of the agreements. The
plaintiffs moreover stood calmly by and permitted a certificate of
title to be issued in the name of the defendants without entering
opposition and without asking for the revision of the decree on the
ground of fraud. Now after the passage of all these years, and relying
on a further alleged oral promise to the effect that the defendants
would not jeopardize the property rights of the plaintiffs when title
was obtained, they bring this action to secure damages. To say the
least, the plaintiffs have been negligent in the vindication of their
rights. </p>
<p> The prerequisites to the successful maintenance of an action for
damages for the wrongful deprivation of land or of any estate or
interest therein, were pointed out in the case of Estrellado and
Alcantara vs. Martinez ([1925], 48 Phil., 256). It was there announced
that in cases of this character it must be established, first, that the
person is in reality wrongfully deprived of his land by the
registration in the name of another of the land by actual or
constructive fraud; second, that there was no negligence on his part;
third, that he is barred or in any way precluded from bringing an
action for the recovery of the land or interest therein; and, fourth,
that the action for compensation has not prescribed. In amplification
of these rules, there should be taken into view section 107 of the Land
Registration Law providing "All actions for compensation under this Act
by reason of any loss or damage or deprivation of land or any estate or
interest therein shall be begun within the period of six years from the
time when the right to bring or take such action or proceeding first
accrued, and not afterwards: * * *" Now placing the admitted facts
before this provision of law, we have the following: Decision rendered
in the regular registration proceedings on May 27, 1920; decree issued
on August 25, 1920; certificate of title issued on August 30, 1920;
writ of possession granted on June 15, 1923; decision in the cadastre
rendered on March 30, 1925; and the complaint in this case filed on
September 24, 1926. </p>
<p> The above outline of the law and the facts suggests two questions.
The first is whether the fulfillment of the provisions of section 107
of the Land Registration Law is a condition precedent to the action, or
whether the section names a mere prescriptive period, which must be
pleaded. The second question relates to the starting point for the
computation of the period of time.</p>
<p> Concerning the first question, counsel for the appellees brings to
our attention the fact that the defense of prescription was not
pleaded. He then says that there applies the well-known principle that
the defense of prescription is not available unless specially pleaded
by answer. There are numerous cases to this effect, but these cases
concern the Code of Civil Procedure. That Code, in speaking of
prescription, makes use of the phraseology "can only be brought within"
(Code of Civil Procedure, sees. 40, 43, 44). In contrast, the Land
Registration Law makes use of the phrase "shall be begun within," and
then reinforces it by the negative expression "and not afterwards." It
would require legislation, judicial or otherwise, to enable the ,courts
to disregard the phrase last quoted. The burden is upon him who attacks
a Torrens title to show that he comes within one or more of the cases
which exempt him from being bound by its collusiveness. The law refers
to the right and not to the remedy. </p>
<p> As to the second question, it will be recalled that the law deems
the period of six years to commence "from the time when the right to
bring or take such action or proceeding first accrued." In the only
available authority discoverable on this point, we find the New Zealand
court holding that the date of the deprivation of the land is the date
of the issue of the certificate of title, and the action must be
brought within the period of limitation from that time (Rutu Peehi <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.
Davy [1890], 9 N. Z. L. R., 134; Niblack, Analysis of the Torrens
System, pp. 318, 319). We see no good reason for disregarding this
precedent, particularly as the plaintiffs were aware of the pendency of
the land registration proceedings and have not proved actual fraud. </p>
<p> The result will be to hold that this action for damages was not
begun within the period of six years from the time when the right to
bring or take such action or proceeding first accrued. Hence without
further discussion of the other questions submitted, the complaint must
be dismissed. </p>
<p> For the foregoing reasons, the judgment appealed from will be
reversed and the complaint dismissed, without special pronouncement as
to the costs. </p>
