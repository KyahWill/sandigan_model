				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of&nbsp; this action&nbsp; was to foreclose a&nbsp; certain mortgage given to secure future advancements for the sum of P12,000, interest, commissions, damages, and such other amounts as may be due at the time of&nbsp; maturity.&nbsp; It was executed&nbsp; and delivered to Lim Julian by Tiburcio&nbsp; Lutero and his wife Asuncion Magalona on the&nbsp; 15th&nbsp; day of April, 1920.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; duly&nbsp; registered in the office of the registrar of deeds of the Province of Iloilo on the 16th day of June, 1920.&nbsp; It was executed&nbsp; to secure future "advancements" to be made by Lim Julian to the mortgagors to cover expenses "incurred by the mortgagors in the cultivation and harvesting of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agricultural crops&nbsp; for the year 1920-1921."&nbsp; To be a&nbsp; little&nbsp; more specific concerning the purposes of the said "advancements," reference may be made to the mortgage&nbsp; itself.&nbsp; The mortgage&nbsp; recites "that&nbsp; said credit (for future advancements) is given to the mortgagors exclusively for the purpose of being employed in the&nbsp; cultivation and care of the sugar plantations and the milling and production of sugar from said sugar plantations&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the purchase&nbsp; of&nbsp; animals for the work in connection therewith and all expenses that may be necessary for the work concerning said sugar plantations."<br><br>The&nbsp; mortgage covered the following&nbsp; property: <br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; Three parcels of land particularly described in paragraph 2&nbsp; of the complaint, containing an area of 755,706 square meters more or less;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; Twenty-four vacunos and twelve carabaos;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; One steam engine;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; One battery with two furnaces and eight tanks;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)&nbsp; A house of strong&nbsp; material,&nbsp; with galvanized iron roof; <br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>)&nbsp; A storehouse&nbsp; for the stems of sugar cane, of light material;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>)&nbsp; A milling&nbsp; shed of mixed material, with nipa roof;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>)&nbsp; A number of houses for the laborers; <br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">i</span>)&nbsp; All the&nbsp; sugar&nbsp; cane estimated at 3,000 piculs for the crop of 1920-1921, to be produced upon said lands,&nbsp; which were known as the "Hacienda San Ramon" situated in the municipality&nbsp; of Janiuay.<br><br>The&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; that there was still due&nbsp; and&nbsp; unpaid on said mortgage (a)&nbsp; the sum of P22,807.09&nbsp; with interest at 12 per cent&nbsp; per annum from the 27th day of June, 1921, until paid; and (b) the sum of P2,000 as penalty for failure on the part of the defendants to comply with their contract.&nbsp; The plaintiff prayed&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; judgment for said amounts, and that in case of a failure on their part to pay the&nbsp; same,&nbsp; that an order be&nbsp; issued for the sale of the&nbsp; mortgaged premises.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff also prayed for a judgment for costs.<br><br>The action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the&nbsp; Province of Iloilo on the 8th day of March,&nbsp; 1922. On&nbsp; the 6th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; April,&nbsp; 1922,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; Tiburcio Lutero and Asuncion Magalona filed their answer, <span style="font-style: italic;">denying each and all&nbsp; of the allegations</span> of the complaint.<br><br>On the&nbsp; 25th day of September,&nbsp; 1922, the "Hospital de San&nbsp; Pablo de Iloilo" presented a petition for intervention, which&nbsp; was granted.<br><br>The&nbsp; defendant Rafael Lutero was made a defendant in the action&nbsp; simply because he&nbsp; was a tenant occupying and cultivating the three parcels of land in question.<br><br>The&nbsp; "Hospital&nbsp; de San&nbsp; Pablo de Iloilo" was permitted to intervene,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; its&nbsp; allegation that it had a prior mortgage upon the property in question (Exhibit AA)&nbsp; for the sum&nbsp; of P22,400.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said alleged mortgage was executed on the 17th day of&nbsp; June, 1920.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was executed before a notary but was never registered in the registry of property. Said document cannot be considered a mortgage therefore. (Art.&nbsp; 1875, Civil Code.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; will be remembered that the, mortgage&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff herein was executed upon the 15th day of April,&nbsp; 1920, nearly two months before Exhibit&nbsp; AA was executed and delivered.&nbsp; The&nbsp; mortgage held by the plaintiff was actually&nbsp; registered in the office of the registrar of&nbsp; deeds on&nbsp; the 16th day of June, 1920,&nbsp; or&nbsp; one&nbsp; day before the&nbsp; alleged mortgage of the <i>intervenor</i>&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed.&nbsp; More will be said concerning the contention of&nbsp; the intervenor when we come to&nbsp; discuss the rights which&nbsp; they claim in the present action.<br><br>On the 25th day of March, 1925, or <i>nearly&nbsp; four years after</i> the present action was commenced,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants Tiburcio&nbsp; Lutero&nbsp; and his wife&nbsp; Asuncion&nbsp; Magalona filed <i>another answer</i> to the petition, in&nbsp; which they alleged, in addition to a&nbsp; general denial,&nbsp; and after admitting the execution and delivery of the mortgage in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff, that&nbsp; said mortgage&nbsp; had been paid and that whatever indebtedness still existed against them and&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff was&nbsp; an ordinary debt.<br><br>Upon the issue thus presented by the petition, the second answer of the defendants and the petition of the&nbsp; intervenor, the cause was&nbsp; brought&nbsp; on for trial.&nbsp; After hearing the evidence the&nbsp; Honorable Fernando&nbsp; Salas, judge,&nbsp; reached the following conclusions; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the complaint against Tiburcio Lutero and&nbsp; Asuncion Magalona should be dismissed with costs against the plaintiff;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that Rafael Lutero, the tenant, should be absolved from all liability under the complaint with costs against the plaintiff;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) that the registrar of deeds of the Province of Iloilo should cancel the mortgage lien in favor of the plaintiff, which fact should be noted upon the certificate of title No. 6667;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; that the mortgage executed and delivered by Tiburcio&nbsp; Lutero and Asuncion Magalona on the 17th day of June, 1920,&nbsp; in favor of the "Hospital de San Pablo" should be&nbsp; registered in the registry of property of the Province of&nbsp; Iloilo as the first lien upon the real property in question; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)&nbsp; that the mortgage executed in favor of the "Hospital de San Pablo" on the 17th day of June, 1920,&nbsp; should take preference over the mortgage&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by said mortgagors&nbsp; to the plaintiff herein on the 15th day of April, 1920.&nbsp; From that judgment the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>In discussing the rights of&nbsp; the respective parties to the present action we are&nbsp; of the opinion that we should discuss the rights&nbsp; of the&nbsp; original parties first and then the rights of the intervenor.<br><br>The plaintiff-appellant alleged in his first assignment&nbsp; of error that the lower court committed an error&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) in holding that his mortgage&nbsp; was paid, (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; in ordering its&nbsp; cancellation and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) in dismissing the complaint against Rafael Lutero.,&nbsp; In order to fully understand&nbsp; that assignment&nbsp; of error a&nbsp; full statement of the entire transaction between the mortgagors and the plaintiff becomes necessary.<br><br>The defendants Tiburcio Lutero and Asuncion&nbsp; Magalona executed the mortgage in question covering the property described in the complaint, with the following pertinent provisions:<br><br>(1) That the said parcels of land were subject to a first mortgage in favor of the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank for the sum of P9,500, payable with&nbsp; interest&nbsp; at&nbsp; 8&nbsp; per cent per annum for the period of ten years, payable&nbsp; by annual instalments ;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; That the said mortgagors have applied to and obtained from&nbsp; Lim Julian a credit&nbsp; of P12,000, Philippine currency, with interest at 12 per cent per annum upon the following conditions: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That&nbsp; said&nbsp; credit is given to the mortgagors exclusively&nbsp; for the purpose of being employed in the cultivation and care of the sugar plantations aforementioned, in the milling and&nbsp; production of sugar from said sugar plantations and in the purchase of animals for the work in connection therewith, and all&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; that may be necessary for the work concerning said sugar plantations; that said credit may&nbsp; be taken by the mortgagors little&nbsp; by&nbsp; little from the creditor or mortgagee at the rate of P1,500, Philippine currency,&nbsp; per month,&nbsp; until the sum is totally taken, and shall earn&nbsp; interest only&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date or dates when the amounts are taken, as shown by the vales or receipts which shall&nbsp; be executed in each case by the mortgagors, who must execute the same every time that they take the&nbsp; monthly&nbsp; amounts;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; that&nbsp; the sugar to be produced from the sugar-cane plantations, and as&nbsp; it is produced by the mortgagors, shall be shipped by the latter for their account and risk to the mortgagee, to the city of Iloilo,&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that the latter&nbsp; may&nbsp; sell the same&nbsp; at the current price in the market or deposit the same in the warehouses of foreign firms in&nbsp; the&nbsp; City of Manila,&nbsp; or in his warehouses, that is, in&nbsp; the warehouses of the&nbsp; mortgagee in this city, Iloilo, as he may&nbsp; deem suitable to the interest of the mortgagors, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">quedans </span>of which,&nbsp; in case of deposit, shall be issued.in the name of the mortgagors, and the latter shall immediately indorse the same to the mortgagee; that the mortgagee shall&nbsp; receive said sugar&nbsp; cane arid take care thereof with the diligence of a good father of a family, trying his best to obtain the best price&nbsp; in the market or at least the price in the&nbsp; Iloilo market; that said mortgagee is authorized to receive or collect the value of said sugar; that the mortgagee is authorized to purchase the sugar for himself with preference in case&nbsp; of&nbsp; equal price and conditions; that the mortgagee shall, on account of his work in receiving,&nbsp; taking care of, and trying&nbsp; to obtain a good price for, said sugar, receive as compensation for that work, whether the sugar is sold or purchased by him, 2 per cent of the gross value of said sugar.&nbsp; The mortgagee was also authorized&nbsp; to&nbsp; retain such part of the value of said sugar as&nbsp; may be deemed fit in order that he may make payment to himself of the 2 per cent compensation and of said credit and the interest therein.<br><br>Immediately upon the execution of said mortgage, with the foregoing&nbsp; conditions and even&nbsp; before its execution, the plaintiff&nbsp; began&nbsp; to&nbsp; make advancements for the&nbsp; purpose mentioned in&nbsp; said mortgage to the defendants, as appears from Exhibit B,&nbsp; of both money and effects or supplies.&nbsp; All of the parties agree that Exhibit&nbsp; B is&nbsp; a true and correct statement of all&nbsp; advancements of money, effects&nbsp; or merchandise paid and delivered by the plaintiff to&nbsp; the defendants between the 11th day of March,&nbsp; 1920 and the 19th day of&nbsp; May, 1921, including the interest on the&nbsp; various&nbsp; advancements during said period.&nbsp; They also agree that said Exhibit B, with some exceptions perhaps, shows the true and exact amount of sugar and cash delivered and paid&nbsp; by the defendants to the plaintiff&nbsp; between the 16th&nbsp; day&nbsp; of March, 1920, and the 27th day of June, 1921.&nbsp; By reference to Exhibit B it will be found that&nbsp; the plaintiff and the defendants have agreed that the advancements, merchandise and accrued interest account&nbsp; during the period amount to P36,964.27 while the sugar&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; and&nbsp; the payments made by the defendants&nbsp; to the plaintiff amounted to P14,157,18, leaving&nbsp; a balance due&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff in the sum ofP22,807.09.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; amount&nbsp; represents&nbsp; the amount claimed in the present action&nbsp; with 12 per cent from the 27th day of June, 1921, together with the sum of P2,000 as a penalty for the&nbsp; failure&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants to comply with their contract.<br><br>The mortgagors contend that the mortgage was for the sum of P12,000 with interest only; that inasmuch as they have paid more than P14,000, the mortgage&nbsp; debt has been paid and that they are therefore not liable for any other amount on said mortgage; that whatever other amount of indebtedness exists against them is&nbsp; an ordinary indebtedness and cannot be recovered in an action to foreclose the mortgage;&nbsp; that they are entitled to have said&nbsp; mortgage cancelled.<br><br>In making that contention the mortgagors have evidently overlooked paragraph 10 of their mortgage, which provides "that <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>the obligations of the mortgagors and&nbsp; all the conditions stipulated in this document must and shall be&nbsp; fulfilled on or before the&nbsp; 30th&nbsp; day of April, 1921, the date when said sugar plantations are to be harvested or converted into sugar and shipped&nbsp; to the mortgagee, and the credit and its interest aforementioned,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">and such other amounts as may be then due</span> from the mortgagors to the mortgagee shall be totally paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the mortgagors."&nbsp;&nbsp; By reference to paragraph&nbsp; 12 of the mortgage it will be seen&nbsp; that if the mortgagors, their heirs,&nbsp; assigns and successors in interest shall fail to fulfill all <span style="font-style: italic;">the conditions and obligation</span>s of said mortgage, <span style="font-style: italic;">that the&nbsp; same shall remain in full force and effect and may be enforcible in accordance with law.</span><br><br>If it had been the intention of&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; to said mortgage to make it a mortgage for the security of the payment of P12,000 given for "future&nbsp; advancements" only,&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">no more</span>, with interest and damages, then what&nbsp; was the occasion or purpose of adding in&nbsp; said paragraph&nbsp; 10 "and such <span style="font-style: italic;">other </span>amounts as may be then due?"&nbsp; If P12,000 was the limit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the obligation&nbsp; incurred&nbsp; by the obligors, and <span style="font-style: italic;">no more</span>, then&nbsp; what did the parties to the contract have in mind when&nbsp; they said "and such other&nbsp; amounts as may be then due from the mortgagors to the&nbsp; mortgagee?" Is it not a reasonable presumption that the parties had in mind that, for some reason or other, the mortgagors&nbsp; might need more money during the year to be employed directly or indirectly in the cultivation and care of the sugar plantations covered by the mortgage, or that more money might be necessary for the proper milling and production of sugar from said sugar plantations and in the purchase of animals for work&nbsp; in connection with the cultivation&nbsp; of said plantations, or&nbsp; for&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; that&nbsp; might&nbsp; be necessary for the proper working and cultivation of said sugar plantations?<br><br>Contracts for future advancements (mortgages) like the present were known at Common Law.&nbsp; They are very common not only in&nbsp; the Philippine Islands but elsewhere in agricultural countries.&nbsp; Contracts&nbsp; for&nbsp; the advancement of money to&nbsp; assist agriculturists for the&nbsp; cultivation and harvesting of crops are&nbsp; well known in all agricultural countries.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; such&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; of&nbsp; "advancements"&nbsp; the agriculturist is permitted to take the money as it is needed and&nbsp; thus&nbsp; avoid the necessity of paying interest until the necessity&nbsp; for its use actually arises.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; not uncommon that said&nbsp; contracts are executed for a&nbsp; larger amount than is necessary and sometimes&nbsp; they are&nbsp; executed for&nbsp; a&nbsp; less amount than is found to be necessary for the economic and efficient cultivation&nbsp; of the land.<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case the mortgagors evidently believed that P1,500 per month would be sufficient to supply all of their demands for the efficient and economic cultivation of their <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda&nbsp; </span>for the year 1920-1921.&nbsp; They were to receive the money<span style="font-style: italic;"> little by little</span> until the P12,000 was taken. If some&nbsp; favorable&nbsp; condition&nbsp; had&nbsp; arisen during&nbsp; the year so that the sum of P1,500&nbsp; was unnecessary, we cannot bring ourselves to believe&nbsp; that the&nbsp; mortgagee could have compelled them to have received during the year the full P12,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that event could the mortgagee have insisted upon a foreclosure of the mortgage&nbsp; for P12,000?&nbsp; Such a result would have been unconscionable.&nbsp; The courts would not&nbsp; have permitted the foreclosure of a&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; for P12,00.0 when,&nbsp; for example, but P6,000 had been actually delivered to&nbsp; the mortgagors.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, it is well known that in contracts of "advancements" many conditions may arise during the agricultural year&nbsp; which would necessitate, for the efficient and economic cultivation of the crops, the use of&nbsp; more&nbsp; money than either of the&nbsp; parties to the contract had contemplated; such as floods, storm, disease among animals which might decimate them, all of which conditions&nbsp; would make it necessary to use more money than&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; had&nbsp; contemplated.&nbsp; Conditions might arise during the year which would render absolutely useless the expenditure of the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of money mentioned in the contract of advancements unless additional amounts are expended.<br><br>The best proof in the&nbsp; present case, that the mortgagors needed more money for the efficient and economic cultivation of their <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda </span>than they had contemplated at the time of&nbsp; making said mortgage, is found&nbsp; in&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; B. Under Exhibit A they were only entitled to receive P1,500 per&nbsp; month.&nbsp; By reference to Exhibit B,&nbsp; it will&nbsp; be seen that&nbsp; during&nbsp; the very first&nbsp; month&nbsp; after the execution&nbsp; of said contract, or between the&nbsp; 15th day of April, 1920 and 18th day of&nbsp; May, 1920,&nbsp; they&nbsp; received the sum of P2,500 in cash instead of&nbsp; P1,500.&nbsp; The&nbsp; same condition is shown in other&nbsp; months.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; admitted that during the year the mortgagors&nbsp; received in cash and&nbsp; effects the sum&nbsp; of P34,245.29.&nbsp; They admit that the plaintiff had no other security for the&nbsp; payment of the&nbsp; difference between the P34,245.29 plus the interest, and&nbsp; the P12,000 unless said difference&nbsp; was covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant contends that the phrase in paragraph 10 "and such other amounts&nbsp; as may be then due"&nbsp; (in addition to the P12,000) was inserted&nbsp; in said mortgage for the very purpose&nbsp; of covering any&nbsp; amount or amounts received by the mortgagors over and above the P12,000.&nbsp; It is also admitted' that by Exhibit&nbsp; B there is still&nbsp; due&nbsp; the amount of P22,807:09. Whether or not that amount should be reduced by payments represented by Exhibits 1, 2, and 3 will be discussed later.<br><br>This&nbsp; action was&nbsp; not begun until nearly one year after the termination of the&nbsp; contract, and yet the mortgagors admit that they continued to receive advancements during that period.&nbsp; They admit that they never called the attention of the mortgagee to the fact that the advancements received by them, over and above the P12,000, were not covered by the mortgage.&nbsp; They admit that they did not ask for&nbsp; a cancellation of the mortgage at the time the amounts&nbsp; paid&nbsp; equalled&nbsp; P12,000.&nbsp; They&nbsp; admit that they made no&nbsp; claim nor representation to the mortgagee that the mortgage had been paid,&nbsp; until nearly four years after the action had been&nbsp; commenced.&nbsp; Their only&nbsp; excuse for not making that&nbsp; representation to the mortgagee was the fear&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; would not received more advancements.<br><br>In other words the mortgagors were trying to deceive the mortgagee and to increase their indebtedness to him believing that he had no&nbsp; security for advancements amounting to more&nbsp; than P22,000.<br><br>The rule, of course,&nbsp; is well&nbsp; settled that an action to foreclose a mortgage must be limited to the amount mentioned in the mortgage.&nbsp; The exact&nbsp; amount, however, for&nbsp; which the mortgage is given need not always be specifically named. The amount for which the mortgage is given may be stated in definite or general&nbsp; terms,&nbsp; as&nbsp; is frequently the case in mortgages to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; future&nbsp; advancements.&nbsp; The amount named in&nbsp; the mortgage does not&nbsp; limit the amount for which it may stand as security,&nbsp; if,&nbsp; from the four corners of the document, the&nbsp; intent to secure future indebtedness or future&nbsp; advancements is&nbsp; apparent.&nbsp; Where the plain terms, of the mortgage, evidence such an intent, they will control as against a&nbsp; contention of the mortgagor that it was the&nbsp; understanding of the parties that the mortgage was security only for the specific amount named.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Citizens'&nbsp; Savings&nbsp; Bank <i>vs.</i> Kock, 117&nbsp; Mich., 225.)&nbsp; In that case the amount&nbsp; mentioned in the&nbsp; mortgage was $7,000.<br><br>The mortgage, however, contained a provision&nbsp; that&nbsp; "the mortgagors agree to pay said mortgagee any sum of money which they may now or hereafter owe said mortgagee." At the time the action of foreclosure was brought the mortgagors owed the mortgagee the sum of P21,522. The defendants contended that the amount to&nbsp; be recovered in an action to foreclose should be&nbsp; limited to the amount&nbsp; named in the mortgage.&nbsp; The court held&nbsp; that the amount&nbsp; named as consideration for the mortgage did not limit the amount for which the mortgage stood&nbsp; as security, if, from the whole instrument the intent to secure future&nbsp; indebtedness could be&nbsp; gathered.&nbsp; The court held&nbsp; that a&nbsp; mortgage to cover future advances&nbsp; is valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Michigan&nbsp; Insurance Co. <i>vs.</i> Brown, 11 Mich., 265; Jones on&nbsp; Mortgages, 1, sec.&nbsp; 373; Keyes <i>vs.</i> Bump's Administrator,&nbsp; 59&nbsp; Vt., 391;&nbsp; Fisher <i>vs.</i> Otis,&nbsp; 3 Pin., 78; Brown <i>vs.</i> Kiefer, 71 N. Y., 610; Douglas <i>vs.</i> Reynolds,&nbsp; 7 Peters [U. S.], 113; Shores <i>vs.</i> Doherty, 65 Wis., 153.)<br><br>Literal accuracy in describing the amount due, secured by a&nbsp; mortgage, is not required, but the description&nbsp; of the debt must be correct and full enough to direct attention to the sources of correct information in&nbsp; regard to&nbsp; it, and be such as not to mislead or deceive as to the amount of it, by the language used.&nbsp; Reading&nbsp; the mortgage before us from its four corners, we find that&nbsp; the description of the debt is full enough to give information concerning the amount due. The mortgage recites&nbsp; that it&nbsp; is given to secure the sum of P12,000, interest, commissions, damages, and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>other amounts which may be found to be due at maturity.&nbsp; The terms of the contract are sufficiently clear to put&nbsp; all parties who may have occasion to deal with the property mortgaged upon&nbsp; inquiry.&nbsp; The parties themselves from the very terms of the mortgage could not be in ignorance at any time of the amount of their&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; and the security held to guarantee the payment.<br><br>When a mortgage is given&nbsp; for future advancements and the money is paid to the mortgagor "little by little" and repayments are made from time to time, the advancements and the&nbsp; repayments must be considered together for the purpose of ascertaining the amount due upon the mortgage at maturity.&nbsp; Courts of equity will not permit the&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of the repayments only for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; determining the balance due upon the&nbsp; mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Luengo &amp; Martinez <i>vs.</i> Moreno, 26 Phil., 111.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere&nbsp; fact that in contract of&nbsp; advancements the repayments at any one time exceeds the&nbsp; specific amount mentioned in the&nbsp; mortgage, will not have the effect of discharging the mortgage when the advancements at that particular time are greatly in excess&nbsp; of the repayments; especially is this true when the contract of advancement or mortgage contains&nbsp; a specific provision&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage shall cover all&nbsp; "such other amounts&nbsp; as may be then due."&nbsp; Such a provision is&nbsp; added to the contract of advancements or mortgage for the express purpose of covering advancements in excess of the amount mentioned in the mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Luengo &amp; Martinez <i>vs.</i> Moreno, <i>supra</i>.)<br><br>The sum found to be owing by the debtor at the termination of the contract of advancements between&nbsp; him and the mortgagee,, during continuing credit, is still secured by the mortgage on the debtor's&nbsp; property, and the mortgagee is entitled to bring the proper action for the collection of the amounts still&nbsp; due and to request the sale of the property covered by the mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Luengo &amp; Martinez <i>vs.</i> Moreno, supra; Russell <i>vs.</i> Davey, 7 Grant Ch., 13; Patterson First National Bank <i>vs.</i> Byard, 26 N. J. Equity, 225.)<br><br>Under a mortgage to secure the&nbsp; payment of future advancements, the mere fact that the repayments on a particular day equal&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of the&nbsp; mortgage will not discharge the mortgage before maturity so long as&nbsp; advancements may be demanded and are being received.&nbsp; (Luengo &amp; Martinez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Moreno, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.)<br><br>We now come to the questions&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; What was the real amount of the mortgage given to secure the "advancements" and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) What amount or amounts have been paid and the balance due, if any? The appellant contends that the&nbsp; advancements including the interest secured by the mortgage amounts to P36,964.27. The mortgagors admit that the advancements including the interest was equal to&nbsp; that amount.&nbsp; They also admit that the payments&nbsp; amounted to P14,157.18.&nbsp;&nbsp; They admit that there is a balance due from them to the appellant in the sum of P22,807.09.&nbsp; They contend, however, that the mortgage only secures the repayment of the sum of P12,000 and interest and damages.&nbsp; They also contend that the payments already made have been more than sufficient to pay the full amount of the mortgage.<br><br>Contracts must be interpreted from&nbsp; their four corners. It will be observed from what has been said above, that the contract of advancements was given to secure the payment of (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) P12,000, interest, commissions&nbsp; and damages, etc., and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">"such other amounts as may be then due"</span> (at the termination of the contract), from the mortgagors to the mortgagee.&nbsp; In our judgment the contract of advancements (Exhibit A)&nbsp; therefore not only covers the P12,000, etc., but also all "such other amounts as may be then due" at the termination of the contract.&nbsp; It has been settled by a long line of decisions&nbsp; that mortgages given to secure <span style="font-style: italic;">future&nbsp; advancements</span> are valid&nbsp; and legal contract; that the amounts named as consideration in said contracts of mortgage do not limit the amount for which the mortgage may stand as security, if,&nbsp; from the whole instrument, the intent to secure future and other indebtedness can be gathered.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Michigan Insurance Co. <i>vs.</i> Brown, 11 Mich., 265; Keyes <i>vs.</i> Bump's Administrator, 59 Vt., 391; Citizens' Savings Bank <i>vs.</i> Kock, 117 Mich., 225; Jones on Mortgages, sees. 364-378; 27 Cyc, pp. 1069-1073 and cases cited; Fisher <i>vs.</i> Otis, 3 Pin., 78; Brown <i>vs.</i> Kiefer, 71 N. Y., 610; Hellyer <i>vs.</i> Briggs, 55 Iowa, 185.)<br><br>It has been&nbsp; decided in many cases that the consideration named in a mortgage for future advancements&nbsp; does&nbsp; not limit the amount&nbsp; for&nbsp; which such contract&nbsp; may&nbsp; stand as security, if, from the four corners&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; document,&nbsp; the intent to secure future indebtedness is&nbsp; apparent.&nbsp; Where, by the plain terms of the&nbsp; contract, such an intent is&nbsp; evident, it will control as against the contention of the mortgagor that&nbsp; it was the intention of the parties&nbsp; that&nbsp; the mortgage was secured only for the consideration expressly named.&nbsp; (Citizens' Savings Bank <i>vs.</i> Kock,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.) <br><br>And it has been held also that oral proof may be adduced for the purpose of showing the real intent of the parties in contracts&nbsp; of advancements.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case of the&nbsp; Citizens Savings Bank <i>vs.</i> Kock the original contract for future advancements&nbsp; was&nbsp; for the&nbsp; sum of $7,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; contract, however,&nbsp; contained&nbsp; the&nbsp; provision "that said mortgagors agree to pay said mortgagee any sum of money<span style="font-style: italic;"> which they may now or hereafter owe."</span>&nbsp; An action was brought upon said contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time the&nbsp; action was&nbsp; brought there had been advanced to&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgagors more than $21,000. The mortgagors contended that but $7,000&nbsp; could be&nbsp; collected.&nbsp; The court held that, by the terms of the mortgage, the mortgagors, were liable for the&nbsp; $21,000&nbsp; and&nbsp; rendered a&nbsp; judgment in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; that conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Newkirk <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Newkirk, 56&nbsp; Mich., 525; Reed <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Rochford, 62 N. J. Equity,&nbsp; 186; Bowen <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Ratcliff, 140 Ind., 393.)<br><br>A mortgage given to secure advancements is a continuing security and is not discharged by repayment.of the amount named in the bond or mortgage until the&nbsp; full amount of the advancements are paid.&nbsp; (Shores <i>vs.</i> Doherty, 65 Wis., 153.)<br><br>From a full consideration of the&nbsp; terms of the&nbsp; contract or mortgage for advancements and the law applicable to such contracts, we must conclude that the&nbsp; said mortgage not only covers the P12,000 with interest, commissions and damages, but&nbsp; also all&nbsp; the&nbsp; advancements which had been made thereunder.&nbsp; From that conclusion it must&nbsp; follow from the admission of the parties themselves that there is still due and unpaid&nbsp; upon said mortgage, due to the&nbsp; advancements, the sum of P22,807.09.&nbsp; That&nbsp; amount, however, may be modified when we come to&nbsp; a consideration of Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.&nbsp; That conclusion disposes of the first assignment of error.<br><br>We now come to a discussion of the second assignment of error.&nbsp; The appellant contends that the lower court committed an error in giving priority to the mortgage executed and delivered in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; "Hospital&nbsp; de&nbsp; San Pablo&nbsp; de Iloilo."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit AA.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place it may be noted that the alleged&nbsp; mortgage claimed by&nbsp; said hospital was not executed until&nbsp; long after the mortgage was executed in favor of the appellant&nbsp; and was never registered.&nbsp; It is not a mortgage at all and could not, by any possibility, therefore be given priority over a former mortgage&nbsp; legally executed and recorded.&nbsp; The&nbsp; contention&nbsp; of the hospital would, of course, therefore be given but little consideration except for the fact that it claims that it was given priority over the mortgage&nbsp; held by the appellant by virtue&nbsp; of an oral agreement or&nbsp; understanding.<br><br>The facts are not disputed that the plaintiff's mortgage was executed on the 15th day of April, 1920, and presented to the registrar of&nbsp; deeds&nbsp; on the 20th day of April, 1920, and actually registered on the 16th day of June, 1920, while the mortgage in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Hospital&nbsp; was not executed until the 17th day&nbsp; of June, 1920.&nbsp; With reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the alleged&nbsp; oral&nbsp; agreement between a&nbsp; representative&nbsp; of&nbsp; the appellant and the attorneys for the hospital, it may be said that the lower court&nbsp; committed an error in allowing oral evidence upon that question.&nbsp; But even though the evidence admitted may be considered, yet in&nbsp; our opinion it is&nbsp; too indefinite&nbsp; and uncertain to justify the conclusion that&nbsp; the appellant did consent to waive the priority of the lien which he held.&nbsp; We are of the opinion that, aside from the question of the admissibility of such proof, it is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the appellant waived the priority of his lien.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proof is not&nbsp; sufficient to show that the alleged representative of&nbsp; the appellant was authorized to act for him in the month of June,&nbsp; 1920.&nbsp;&nbsp; What we have said in relation to the second assignment of error constitutes an answer to&nbsp; the third and fourth assignments of error.<br><br>Our conclusions upon this branch of the case are:<br><br>First. That the alleged oral agreement did not give the alleged second mortgage of the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo" a priority over the mortgage of the plaintiff. <br><br>Second. That whatever&nbsp; may&nbsp; be the rule in other jurisdictions, in this jurisdiction it is an indispensable statutory requirement,&nbsp; in order that a mortgage may be validly constituted, that the instrument by which it is created be recorded in the registry of deeds.&nbsp; (Art.. 1875 of the Civil Code;&nbsp; Tobias <i>vs.</i> Enrico,&nbsp; 22 Phil.,&nbsp; 394,&nbsp; 396;&nbsp; Lozano <i>vs.</i> Tan Suico, 23 Phil., 16; Borcelis <i>vs.</i> Golingco, 27 Phil., 560.) In this case (Borcelis <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Golingco)&nbsp; the late Chief Justice Arellano said: "This Supreme&nbsp; Court has repeatedly declared that to make a mortgage valid it is necessary that the document constituting it be inscribed in the property registry."&nbsp; Such documents, however, are valid subsisting obligations between&nbsp; the parties thereto and may&nbsp; be used as evidence or proof of such obligations. They do not, however, constitute a mortgage in this jurisdiction.<br><br>We now come to a discussion&nbsp; of the mortgage in favor of the Philippine National Bank for the sum of P9,500 for the purpose of determining whether or not said mortgage takes priority over the mortgage of the plaintiff.,&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be&nbsp; remembered that the&nbsp;&nbsp; mortgage of the plaintiff was taken with the express understanding that it was&nbsp; subject to a first mortgage in favor of the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank for the sum of P9,500 with interest&nbsp; at 8 per cent per annum for the period of ten years, payable by annual installments.&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; thus recognized the existence of said mortgage as a prior lien.&nbsp; The record shows that the said mortgage of the Philippine National Bank was paid by the intervenor, the&nbsp; "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo," with its money.&nbsp;&nbsp; The intervenor, the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo" therefore stands in the shoes of the Philippine National Bank and has a right to be paid by the plaintiff out of the proceeds of&nbsp; the foreclosure whatever sum or&nbsp; sums it paid to the&nbsp; Philippine National&nbsp; Bank, with&nbsp; interest thereon at 8 per cent from the date of payment until&nbsp; paid.<br><br>We find upon an examination of the record three Exhibits (1, 2, and 3) representing&nbsp; payments amounting to P11,088.68 made by the defendant Tiburcio Lutero to the plaintiff Lim Julian.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; 1 represents a&nbsp; payment of P6,306.64 for 709.07 picos of&nbsp; sugar.&nbsp; This payment&nbsp; was made on the 24th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; January,&nbsp; 1921, or more than a year&nbsp; before&nbsp; the commencement&nbsp; of the present&nbsp; action. Exhibit 2 represents a payment of P4,000 for 469.55&nbsp; picos of sugar.&nbsp; This payment was made on the 20th day of August, 1924, during the pendency&nbsp; of the present action. Exhibit 3 represents a payment of&nbsp; P782.04 made by Lutero to&nbsp; the plaintiff to apply on his debt of a&nbsp; larger&nbsp; sum.<br><br>No reference is made to such exhibits in Exhibit B.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellee Tiburcio Lutero and&nbsp; his wife made no claim either in the court below&nbsp; or in this court that the payments represented by Exhibits 1, 2, and 3&nbsp; should be applied to the reduction of&nbsp; their&nbsp; total&nbsp; indebtedness in&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P22,807.09.&nbsp; The record furnishes no explanation for&nbsp; their failure&nbsp; to insist upon the application of said&nbsp; payments to the reduction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; total&nbsp; indebtedness.&nbsp; Their failure so to do cannot&nbsp; be understood, if&nbsp; in&nbsp; fact said&nbsp; exhibits do represent payments made in&nbsp; liquidation of their indebtedness in the sum of P11,088.68.&nbsp;&nbsp; If in fact&nbsp; said payments were made to apply on the indebtedness then&nbsp; they should be applied for the purpose of reducing the total&nbsp; amount due of&nbsp; principal,&nbsp;&nbsp; interest,&nbsp; commission&nbsp; and&nbsp; damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mortgagors make no&nbsp; point with reference to the said payments.&nbsp; In the interest of justice,&nbsp; however, and to the end that a&nbsp; final&nbsp; determination of the question between the parties&nbsp; hereto&nbsp; may be reached, we deem&nbsp; it necessary to take note of the payments&nbsp; represented by&nbsp; Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.<br><br>After a careful examination of the entire record and the issues presented we have arrived at the following conclusions :<br><br>First. That the mortgage&nbsp; (Exhibit A)&nbsp; executed by Tiburcio Lutero and&nbsp; Asuncion Magalona, his wife, to&nbsp; the plaintiff constitutes&nbsp; a lien upon the property mortgaged and is a prior lien over the alleged&nbsp; mortgage executed by the same parties to the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo," provided, however, that the&nbsp; "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo" shall have a lien&nbsp; prior to that of the plaintiff in whatever sum or sums it paid, together with 8 per cent interest on the mortgage held&nbsp; by the Philippine National Bank.<br><br>Second. That there is still due and unpaid on said mortgage the sum of P22,807.09, which amount perhaps&nbsp; may be reduced by the payments made and represented by Exhibits 1, 2, and 3.<br><br>Third. That the cause&nbsp; is remanded to the court whence it came&nbsp; for&nbsp; the purpose of having&nbsp; determined by the lower court whether&nbsp; or not&nbsp; such payments&nbsp; should be&nbsp; applied to the liquidation of the said&nbsp; sum of P22,807.09.<br><br>Fourth. That the cause be remanded to the lower court for the purpose of determining the amount paid by the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo" for the mortgage held by the Philippine National Bank.<br><br>Subject to the conditions herein stated, it is hereby ordered and decreed (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) that the judgment of the lower court be and is hereby revoked;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that a judgment be rendered in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; and against&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; Tiburcio&nbsp; Lutero and&nbsp; Asuncion Magalona for the sum of P22,807.09, with&nbsp; interest&nbsp; until paid;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; that the record be returned to the&nbsp; court whence it came for the purpose of having&nbsp; finally determined whether or&nbsp; not said sum (P22,807.09)&nbsp; should be reduced by the payments made by the defendants to the plaintiff, represented by Exhibits 1, 2, and&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; If the lower court shall&nbsp; find, upon such investigation, that said payments should be applied to said sum (P22,807.09) then and in that&nbsp; case&nbsp; it is&nbsp; hereby ordered that a judgment be rendered for whatever&nbsp; balance may be due; (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) that a judgment be entered in favor of the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo," giving it a prior lien on the property in question over that&nbsp; held&nbsp; by the plaintiff for whatever sum or sums it paid for the mortgage held by the Philippine National Bank, with&nbsp; interest; (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) that the record be&nbsp; returned to&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of determining the amount paid by the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo" for said mortgage, and when that amount is determined, let a&nbsp; judgment be entered&nbsp; by the lower court for the&nbsp; sum as a prior lien upon the property&nbsp; in question to that held by the plaintiff;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>) that after the&nbsp; lower court has complied with the conditions herein imposed, that a judgment be entered requiring the defendants Tiburcio Lutero and Asuncion Magalona to deposit with the clerk of the Court of First Instance of the Province of&nbsp; Iloilo whatever sum or sums&nbsp; may be found&nbsp; to be still due the plaintiff within a period of 90 days,&nbsp; and in default of compliance therewith, that an order be issued, that the property mortgaged be sold, subject to the prior lien in favor of the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo."&nbsp; In case, however, that the property is&nbsp; sold free from said&nbsp; lien then and in that case the "Hospital de San Pablo de Iloilo" shall receive whatever sum or&nbsp; sums with interest at 8 per cent which it paid or caused to be paid for the mortgage in favor of the Philippine National&nbsp; Bank, before any payments&nbsp; are made out of the proceeds&nbsp; to the plaintiff.<br><br>There being nothing in the record&nbsp; to show any liability on&nbsp; the part of Rafael Lutero, he is hereby absolved from all&nbsp; liability under the complaint. Let a judgment be entered in&nbsp; accordance herewith, without any finding as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Villamor, Romualdez</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Ostrand, J.,</i> concurs in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;JOHNS, J.,</span> dissenting in part:<br><br>There are&nbsp; two statements made&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; carefully prepared and well written opinion of Justice&nbsp; Johnson, with which I cannot agree.&nbsp; First, on page 3 (p. 707, ante),&nbsp; it is said:<br><blockquote>"It was executed before a notary but was never registered in the registry of property.&nbsp; Said document cannot be considered a&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; therefore.&nbsp; (Art. 1875,&nbsp; Civil Code.)"<br></blockquote>Again on pages 16 and 17 (p. 719, ante), it is said:<br><blockquote>"In the first place it may be noted that the&nbsp; alleged mortgage claimed by said hospital was not executed until long&nbsp; after&nbsp; the mortgage was&nbsp; executed in favor&nbsp; of the appellant and was never registered..&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a mortgage at all and could not, by any possibility,&nbsp; therefore be given priority over&nbsp; a former mortgage legally executed and recorded.&nbsp; The&nbsp; contention of the hospital would, of&nbsp; course, therefore be given but little consideration except for the fact that it claims that it was given priority&nbsp; over the mortgage held by the appellant by virtue of an oral agreement or understanding."<br></blockquote>The record is conclusive that plaintiff's mortgage is prior in both time and right to the one in favor of the "hospital." Assuming and conceding that to be true,&nbsp; without being registered, the mortgage of the "hospital" is a legal and valid&nbsp; mortgage as between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and&nbsp; third&nbsp; parties who have actual&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of the existence of the mortgage.<br><br>Article 1875 of the Civil Code is as follows:<br><blockquote>"In addition to the requisites&nbsp; mentioned in article 1857, it shall be indispensable, in order that a mortgage may be validly&nbsp; constituted,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the instrument by which it is created be recorded in&nbsp; the registry&nbsp; of&nbsp; deeds."<br></blockquote>Under this&nbsp; section, a number of decisions of this court are cited, the&nbsp; first of which is the United States <i>vs.</i> Mendezona (1 Phil, 696, 703), and the last Legarda and Prieto <i>vs.</i> Saleeby (31 Phil., 590, 601).<br><br>In the Preface to the Civil Code it is said that:<br><blockquote>"In May, 1889, the Civil Code was promulgated in Spain. In July of the same year, by Royal Decree, it was extended to the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Code was published in the Manila Gazette and took effect&nbsp; as a law on December&nbsp; 8, 1889."<br></blockquote>With one exception,&nbsp; those decisions&nbsp; hold in legal&nbsp; effect that an unregistered mortgage&nbsp; is void&nbsp; as to third parties, and in the final analysis and upon the facts therein stated, that is all they do&nbsp; hold.&nbsp; That is&nbsp; good&nbsp; law, but in the instant case, we are dealing with the legal force&nbsp; and&nbsp; effect of an&nbsp; unregistered mortgage as&nbsp; between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and third persons with actual notice of the mortgage.<br><br>This&nbsp; court has never held that an&nbsp; unregistered&nbsp; mortgage is void as between the mortgagor&nbsp; and the mortgagee, or third parties&nbsp; with&nbsp; actual&nbsp; notice.<br><br>In the case of Obras Pias <i>vs.</i> Devera Ignacio (17&nbsp; Phil., 45), published on September 16, 1910, this court, speaking through Justice&nbsp; Johnson,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; syllabus of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion, says:<br><blockquote>"The effect of actual&nbsp; notice of the existence of said&nbsp; mortgage is equivalent to the registration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; under the provisions&nbsp; of the Mortgage&nbsp; Law."<br></blockquote>And, on page 47 of the opinion, says:<br><blockquote>"The purpose&nbsp; of registering&nbsp; an instrument relating to land, annuities, mortgages, liens, or any other&nbsp; class of real rights&nbsp; is to give notice to persons interested of the&nbsp; existence of these various liens against the property.&nbsp; If the parties interested&nbsp; have <span style="font-style: italic;">actual&nbsp; notice</span>&nbsp; of the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of such liens, then the necessity for registration does not exist. Neither can one who has actual notice&nbsp; of existing liens acquire any rights&nbsp; in such property free from such&nbsp; liens&nbsp; by the mere fact that such liens have not been recorded."<br></blockquote>That is also good law, and it is&nbsp; sustained by all standard text writers&nbsp; and the unanimous decisions of at least all of American courts.<br><br>In the case of Patterson <i>vs.</i> De la Ronde (19 Law. ed., 417), the Supreme Court of the United States says:<br><blockquote>"Besides, the&nbsp; object of all&nbsp; registry laws is to impart information to parties&nbsp; dealing with property&nbsp; respecting its transfers and incumbrances, and thus to protect them from the prior secret conveyances and liens.&nbsp; It is to the registry, therefore, that purchasers, or other desirous of ascertaining the condition of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; must&nbsp; look, and&nbsp; if not otherwise informed, they can rely upon the knowledge there obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if they have notice of the existence&nbsp; of unregistered&nbsp; conveyances and mortgages,&nbsp; they cannot, in truth, complain&nbsp; that&nbsp; they are, in any respect,&nbsp; prejudiced by&nbsp; the want of registry.&nbsp; In equity,&nbsp; and in this country generally&nbsp; at law, they are not permitted to&nbsp; defeat,&nbsp; under such circumstances, the rights of prior grantees or incumbrancers,&nbsp; but are required to take the title or security in subordination to their rights.&nbsp; The general doctrine is that knowledge of an existing conveyance or mortgage&nbsp; is, in legal effect, the&nbsp; equivalent to notice&nbsp; by the registry.&nbsp; And such is the law of Louisiana as expounded by the decisions of her highest court.&nbsp; Thus, in Robinett <i>vs.</i> Compton, 2 La. Ann., 854, that&nbsp; court said:&nbsp; The doctrine is&nbsp; now well settled, that&nbsp; the actual knowledge by a purchaser of an existing mortgage or title is&nbsp; equivalent to a notice resulting from the&nbsp; registry.&nbsp; The formality of&nbsp; recording is for the benefit of the public,&nbsp; and&nbsp; for the purpose of giving&nbsp; notice to individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if a party have knowledge 6f that of which it is the purpose of the law to notify him by causing an&nbsp; act, instrument or lien to be recorded, the effect is the same, and he is as much bound by his personal knowledge as if his&nbsp; information was derived&nbsp; from&nbsp; an&nbsp; inspection of the record.' "<br></blockquote>In the instant case, it is admitted&nbsp; that on the 17th of June, 1920, the "hospital" took its mortgage to the office of the register of deeds for the purpose of having it registered as a first mortgage on the property, and that&nbsp; it was not registered as such, because it appeared from the records in that office that&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; mortgage was registered&nbsp; on the 16th of June, 1920.&nbsp; The register of deeds declined to register the&nbsp; "hospital" mortgage as a first mortgage, and the "hospital" declined to have it registered&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; second mortgage,&nbsp; and it was for&nbsp; that reason only that the "hospital" mortgage was not registered.&nbsp; That is an undisputed fact.<br><br>During the trial of the case, Tiburcio Lutero admitted the execution of the mortgage to&nbsp; the "hospital,"&nbsp; and that instrument is in the record.&nbsp; It is duly signed,&nbsp; witnessed and acknowledged before a notary public, and, as between the parties, recites, and shows&nbsp; upon its face that in both form and substance it is a real mortgage on the property in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lutero and his&nbsp; wife do not seek to have the mortgage as to them declared&nbsp; void for want of registration. In fact they admit that it is a good&nbsp; and valid mortgage without registration.<br><br>The only issue between the plaintiff and the "hospital" is as to the priority of the two mortgages, and&nbsp; upon that point this&nbsp; court holds that the mortgage of&nbsp; the plaintiff is prior in both time&nbsp; and&nbsp; right to the mortgage in favor of the&nbsp; "hospital."&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming that to be true, the fact that the mortgage of the "hospital" was not registered becomes wholly immaterial&nbsp; as&nbsp; between the plaintiff and the "hospital."&nbsp; That is to&nbsp; say, the question of the validity of&nbsp; an unrecorded mortgage between the parties is not raised&nbsp; or presented by&nbsp; any pleading or by any assignment of error by any party to this action, and the real parties in interest admit the execution of the mortgage to the "hospital" and its&nbsp; validity without registration.<br><br>Hence, as to all of that portion of the opinion above quoted, we vigorously dissent.<br><br>Under all of the authorities, as between&nbsp; the mortgagor and the mortgagee&nbsp; and third&nbsp; parties with actual notice,&nbsp; an unrecorded mortgage is valid.<br><br>As the Supreme Court of the United States says:<br><blockquote>"The general doctrine is that knowledge of an existing conveyance or mortgage is, in legal&nbsp; effect, the equivalent to notice by the registry."<br></blockquote>In other words, that&nbsp; as&nbsp; between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the mortgage&nbsp; is "validly constituted" within the meaning of article&nbsp; 1875&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; and the same thing is true as to third parties with actual notice.<br><br>When a person executes&nbsp; a mortgage, he has actual, personal knowledge of that fact, and is estopped to deny or assert that he signed the mortgage.&nbsp; As to him, the record of that mortgage would be notice only of a fact which he personally knew when he signed&nbsp; the mortgage.<br><br>Under all of the authorities, the same&nbsp; principle applies to third parties with actual&nbsp; notice, and as to all of such parties, the mortgage from&nbsp; Lutero&nbsp; and&nbsp; his wife to the "hospital"&nbsp; is a good&nbsp; and&nbsp; valid mortgage, and as such&nbsp; it ought to be recognized and enforced.<br><br>It will be noted that the present Civil&nbsp; Code took effect on December 8, 1889, and that the opinion of this court by Justice Johnson above quoted was rendered on September 16, 1910.&nbsp; That is to say at the time that opinion was written, article&nbsp; 1875 of the Civil Code&nbsp; had&nbsp; been a law for more than&nbsp; twenty years.<br><br>Within the meaning of that article, and&nbsp; upon the facts shown&nbsp; in&nbsp; the record, the&nbsp; mortgage from Lutero and his wife was a "validly constituted" mortgage as between them and the "hospital," and it was also a valid mortgage as to third parties with actual&nbsp; notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In legal effect, that&nbsp; is the decision of this court in Obras Pias <i>vs.</i> Devera Ignacio.<br><br>For&nbsp; such reasons, we vigorously dissent from that portion&nbsp; of the opinion which&nbsp; says that the&nbsp; mortgage of the "hospital"&nbsp; "cannot be considered a mortgage," and that "it is not a mortgage at all&nbsp; and could&nbsp; not, by any&nbsp; possibility, therefore be given priority&nbsp; over a former mortgage legally executed and recorded."&nbsp; In all other respects, we agree with the opinion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court as written.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> By P.

J.,&nbsp; with whom concurs STREET, J.,&nbsp; dissenting:<br><br>Even though&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of the majority contains&nbsp; a detailed exposition of&nbsp; the facts, I shall&nbsp; refer,&nbsp; however, to those that are pertinent to my point of view.<br><br>The defendants&nbsp; spouses, Tiburcio Lutero&nbsp; and Asuncion Magalona, executed a&nbsp; first mortgage in favor of&nbsp; the National Bank, on the lands which are the subject of this action, in the sum of P9,500.&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 15, 1920,&nbsp; while this mortgage was&nbsp; still in force, the defendants applied and obtained a loan of P12,000&nbsp; from the plaintiff&nbsp; Lim Julian, with&nbsp; a second mortgage on the&nbsp; same&nbsp; lands&nbsp; (Exhibit A).&nbsp; Subsequently, the defendants obtained another loan of&nbsp; P22,400 from the St. Paul's Hospital of Iloilo, with a first mortgage on the same lands.&nbsp; A part of this money&nbsp; loaned by&nbsp; the St. Paul's Hospital&nbsp; was used to pay the&nbsp; loan and cancel the mortgage in favor of the National Bank..&nbsp; Before&nbsp; obtaining this loan&nbsp; from St.&nbsp; Paul's Hospital, the&nbsp; plaintiff, according to the defendants, consented to a first mortgage on the lands in favor of the hospital after the&nbsp; cancellation of the mortgage in favor of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp; While the plaintiff denied having given such&nbsp; consent,&nbsp; yet, it is true,&nbsp; at least, that at&nbsp; that time he had knowledge of&nbsp; the mortgage in favor of&nbsp; the hospital.&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; did&nbsp; not register the mortgage in his favor until after the mortgage in favor of the National Bank had been cancelled, that is, on June 16, 1920.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following day, the 17th,&nbsp; the mortgage deed was executed in favor of St. Paul's Hospital, and when this institution&nbsp; attempted to register it as a first mortgage, the register of deeds refused to do so in view of the fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; mortgage in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff had already been registered.<br><br>It also&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that prior to April 15, 1920,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the mortgage in favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; was executed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; already&nbsp; owed him the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P5,008.04; that from April 15,&nbsp; 1920 to October 22d of the same year,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; received a&nbsp; loan of P12,000 from the plaintiff; that from October 22, 1920, to May 31, 1921, the defendants&nbsp; borrowed other&nbsp; sums&nbsp; from the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; which, together with the sums previously&nbsp; received and the corresponding interest, amounted to P36,964.27.&nbsp; Up&nbsp; to&nbsp; June 21, ,1921, the defendants paid the plaintiff, in cash and in sugar, the amount&nbsp; of P14,157.18, leaving a&nbsp; balance of P22,807.09.<br><br>I dissent from the majority opinion where it finds that, in&nbsp; accordance with the contract (Exhibit A)&nbsp; between the defendants&nbsp; and the plaintiff,&nbsp; the mortgage&nbsp; which the former executed on the lands&nbsp; in question, it includes all the amounts borrowed by them from the plaintiff.&nbsp; In my opinion,&nbsp; this&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; was made for&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; only P12,000.&nbsp; As this question depends&nbsp; upon the interpretation of&nbsp; the contract entered&nbsp; into between&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants and the plaintiff, I deem it wise to quote the same, which,&nbsp; eliminating paragraph 1 which refers to the statement of the ownership of&nbsp; the mortgage land, reads as follows:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><blockquote>"II. That said mortgagors have applied and obtained from&nbsp; the said Lim Julian a loan of twelve thousand pesos (P12,000), with interest at twelve per cent per annum (12%),&nbsp; under&nbsp; the following conditions: That said loan is to be used by the mortgagors in the cultivation and care of the sugar-cane plantations above mentioned, for the milling and&nbsp; production of sugar from said sugar-cane plantations,&nbsp; and for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; of&nbsp; work, animals&nbsp; and&nbsp; all expenses&nbsp; necessary for the activities&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; sugar-cane plantations.<br><br>"III. That&nbsp; said mortgagors may draw upon&nbsp; the mortgagee&nbsp; at the&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of one thousand&nbsp; five&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; pesos (P1,500),&nbsp; Philippine currency,&nbsp; a month,&nbsp; until the&nbsp; total amount of the loan is&nbsp; received, and interest thereon&nbsp; shall be earned only from the date or dates that appear on the chit or receipt to be issued by the mortgagors in each&nbsp; case, said mortgagors being under the&nbsp; obligation to issue the same whenever they receive said monthly payment.<br><br>"IV. That the sugar produced by the mortgagors from said sugar-cane plantations must be shipped, as it is produced, for their account&nbsp; and risk to the mortgagee in the City of Iloilo, in order that the latter might sell it at the current market price, or store it in foreign warehouses in the City of Iloilo or in his&nbsp; own warehouses in said city, as he may deem best for the interests of the mortgagors,&nbsp; and the quedans, in case of storage, shall be issued in the name of the mortgagors&nbsp; who shall immediately endorse the same in favor of the mortgagee.&nbsp; The mortgagee shall receive said sugar and take care of it with the diligence of a good father of a family, endeavoring to obtain for it&nbsp; the best market price in each instance, or, at least the current market price of Iloilo, said mortgagee being further authorized to receive and collect the&nbsp; value of said sugar.<br><br>"V., The mortgagee is hereby authorized&nbsp; to&nbsp; purchase said sugar for himself,&nbsp; with preference, all things being equal.<br><br>"VI.&nbsp; The mortgagee, for his services of receiving, caring and procuring a good price for said&nbsp; sugar, shall receive, as&nbsp; compensation, whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; sugar&nbsp; is sold or bought by himself, two per cent&nbsp; (2%) of the&nbsp; gross value of&nbsp; said sugar.<br><br>"VII. The mortgagee is&nbsp; also hereby authorized to&nbsp; retain from the value of said sugar, such amount or amounts as he may deem proper in order to obtain the payment of the said two&nbsp; per cent (2%)&nbsp; compensation and of said&nbsp; loan and interest thereon.<br><br>"VIII. The mortgagors hereby bind themselves to keep, take&nbsp; care of and protect&nbsp; said sugar-cane plantations as good agriculturists, and to gather&nbsp; the cane in due season and without delay.<br><br>"IX. The mortgagors also bind themselves to pay the mortgagee a sum not less than two thousand pesos&nbsp; (P2,000) by way of&nbsp; damages and penalty, in&nbsp; case the mortgagors or any one of them should infringe any of the conditions hereof and compel the&nbsp; mortgagee to engage&nbsp; the services of a lawyer, or to apply to the courts of justice for the enforcement of&nbsp; said obligation."<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>According to the clauses just quoted,&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan applied for and granted the defendants&nbsp; by the plaintiff,&nbsp; was for P12,000 and no more, and&nbsp; as&nbsp; the lands in question were mortgaged only to&nbsp; secure the fulfillment&nbsp; of the obligation which the defendants contracted by virtue of said contract (Exhibit A),&nbsp; no liability can be enforced upon this mortgage in excess of the sum of P12,000.&nbsp; Any amount which the plaintiff might&nbsp; have given the defendants in&nbsp; excess thereof was not within the terms of the contract and constitutes a mere&nbsp; ordinary loan which cannot be considered as secured by the mortgage.<br><br>But&nbsp; it is said that, according to the tenth clause which follows,&nbsp; the loan granted the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff was not only for the sum of P12,000, but for any&nbsp; other amount in excess thereof, and, consequently, all the&nbsp; amounts received by the&nbsp; defendants must be considered as secured by the mortgage.&nbsp; The tenth clause reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"That all of the&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; of the mortgagors and the conditions&nbsp; herein stipulated must&nbsp; and shall&nbsp; be complied with on or before the thirtieth&nbsp; day of April, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, the date&nbsp; when said&nbsp; sugar-cane plantations must be&nbsp; harvested or milled into sugar and sent to the mortgagee,&nbsp; and the loan,&nbsp; together with&nbsp; the&nbsp; interest thereon above-mentioned and such other amount as the defendants might&nbsp; be owing to&nbsp; the mortgagee, must&nbsp; be fully paid."<br></blockquote>It may be noted at a glance that this clause does not state that the defendants were granted an amount in excess of the P12,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing in this clause which might be construed as creating an obligation on the part of the plaintiff to grant the defendants more than the P12,000. If, after having paid the defendants the loan of P12,000 the plaintiff should refuse to pay them any more, and the defendants should try to force him to do so, invoking this clause of the contract, I do not believe there is anyone who would contend that they had any reason for doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tenth clause alone cannot be interpreted as evidencing a contract between the defendants and the plaintiff for a future loan of any amount in excess of the P12,000.&nbsp; If such had been their intention they&nbsp; would have&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; it instead&nbsp; of referring&nbsp; only and specifically to the&nbsp; P12,000.&nbsp; However general the terms of a contract may be, it shall not be construed as&nbsp; including things and cases different from those with&nbsp; respect to&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons&nbsp; interested&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 1283, Civil Code.)&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was no such contract there can be no mortgage in regard to this excess. A mortgage is an accessory contract&nbsp; which cannot&nbsp; exist without the principal one&nbsp; (art. 1857, Civil Code).&nbsp; If the plaintiff, however,&nbsp; paid the defendants other&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; in excess of the loan of P12,000, -it was not done by virtue&nbsp; of the contract Exhibit A, and, consequently,&nbsp; said amounts cannot be&nbsp; considered as secured by the mortgage, which was executed by the&nbsp; defendants to assure only their obligation which&nbsp; they&nbsp; incurred in accordance with said contract.<br><br>Attention is called to the fact that mention is made&nbsp; in the tenth clause not only of the loan&nbsp; (P12,000)&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">but also&nbsp; of such&nbsp; other amount as the</span> defendants might be owing the plaintiff at the expiration of the&nbsp; contract; and it is said that this cannot&nbsp; be accounted for except by the fact that there was&nbsp; an understanding between the parties that the defendants could borrow more than the P12,000 from the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; inference is not necessary if&nbsp; it is&nbsp; taken into consideration that, before the contract was&nbsp; entered into,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; already owed the plaintiff P5,008.04 which, at most,&nbsp; might&nbsp; be the&nbsp; amount referred to&nbsp; in the tenth clause, since the&nbsp; same might not be paid, but in no way any other amount in excess of the P12,000 which the parties, upon entering into the contract, did not think the defendants might borrow.,<br><br>This&nbsp; is not the&nbsp; only interpretation that the&nbsp; contract permits of, but&nbsp; is the very one given by the plaintiff, in his brief.&nbsp; The plaintiff does not claim that the mortgage secures the payment&nbsp; of more than&nbsp; P12,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; His only contention in this instance&nbsp; is that the defendants having received P36,964.27 in all,&nbsp; notwithstanding the&nbsp; payment of P14,157.18 made by them, and&nbsp; still owing P22,807.09, the mortgage&nbsp; must be considered as still subsisting as to P12,000 of the P22,807.09, because that payment must not necessarily be applied to the mortgage loan.&nbsp; That is why the plaintiff,&nbsp; in his brief, only prays for judgment against the defendants for the payment of the P12,000,&nbsp; as a mortgage debt, and for the balance of the P22,807.09, as an&nbsp; ordinary debt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The least that can&nbsp; be said about the tenth clause of the contract, to which reference is here made, is that it is very vaguely worded.&nbsp; Hence, it is the duty of the court to interpret it in accordance with the intention of the contracting parties.&nbsp; However, notwithstanding the fact that the parties, in their&nbsp; briefs, are agreed that the mortgage covers only the amount of P12,000, the majority of&nbsp; this court insist that there was&nbsp; another intention in executing the contract,&nbsp; and that the mortgage includes all of&nbsp; the&nbsp; amounts borrowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff's brief says:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><blockquote>"If at the time the defendants made their advance, payments they had stated that the payments should be applied to&nbsp; the&nbsp; secured&nbsp; debt, this could would never have come into the courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; (P. 26.)<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"He (the plaintiff) knew that his mortgage was for only P12,000, with interest, and that he would&nbsp; have to take&nbsp; a chance on the balance that was not secured.&nbsp; (P. 30.)<br><br>"While it is true that the mortgage, Exhibit A, does not contain any provision relative to&nbsp; a continuous loan, there can be no doubt that&nbsp; the parties, by their conduct, considered their agreement thus, and that Exhibit A must be considered as amended&nbsp; in this sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; (P. 31.)<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"The judgment must be set aside&nbsp; and one&nbsp; entered in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff in the&nbsp; foreclosure of the mortgage for the sum of P12,000, accumulated interest, penalty, and for the balance of the debt."&nbsp; (P. 48.)<br></blockquote>At any rate, even supposing that the interpretation given to the&nbsp; contract by the majority is correct, in the sense that the defendants mortgaged the lands to secure the payment of not only the loan&nbsp; of P12,000 specifically granted them, but also any other indefinite amount that they might borrow in excess thereof,&nbsp; this mortgage&nbsp; is&nbsp; worthless and of no effect.&nbsp; A mortgage&nbsp; may secure a future obligation, but it cannot benefit or prejudice a third party until the&nbsp; obligation is in fact contracted.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 1861,&nbsp; Civil Code and art. 142, Mortgage&nbsp; Law.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And it must be so inasmuch as the mortgage, as an accessory contract, cannot come into existence before&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal&nbsp; obligation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; fulfillment of which&nbsp; is secured by it, because then it would have no&nbsp; object.<br><br>This is clearer&nbsp; in a contract of loan, as the one now before us, which, being&nbsp; real&nbsp; in its&nbsp; nature, does&nbsp; not come into existence until the delivery of the thing, but, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; not enough that the obligation be in fact contracted, or&nbsp; that it is carried into effect, in order that the mortgage may be effective,&nbsp; but it is also necessary that it be noted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the registry.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 143, Mortgage&nbsp; Law).&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is likewise clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there can&nbsp; be no&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; without&nbsp; a principal obligation (art. 1857, Civil Code) and&nbsp; registration being necessary, in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Mortgage Law, for the efficacy of the mortgage, the act that gives life and&nbsp; reality to the principal obligation must be recorded and noted.&nbsp; No notation was made in the registry that the defendants had borrowed any amount in excess of the P12,000 from the plaintiff, and, for this reason, the mortgage to secure the payment of this excess is not, by any means, effective.<br><br>My conclusion is that&nbsp; the lands in question&nbsp; can be considered mortgaged only&nbsp; to secure the amount of P12,000 owed by the defendants to the plaintiff and that any amount in excess thereof must be considered as an ordinary debt only.<br><br>This being so the only question would be that upon which the trial court based its finding, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>: To what part of the defendants' debt must the payment of P14,157.18 be applied?<br><br>The&nbsp; plaintiff's loan being partly a mortgage and partly an ordinary loan, and the application of this payment not having been stated, the same must be deemed to have been made on account of the most burdensome debt&nbsp; (art. 1174, Civil Code),&nbsp; that is, the mortgage loan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This payment being in excess of the mortgage loan of P12,000, the same should be cancelled, without prejudice to rendering judgment against the defendants for&nbsp; the balance of&nbsp; an ordinary debt.<br><br>After&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage in favor of the plaintiff is cancelled,&nbsp; the intervenor, St. Paul's Hospital, has&nbsp; the right to register the mortgage in its&nbsp; favor as a&nbsp; first mortgage.<br><br>According to the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Johns, the mortgage, though not registered, is valid between the parties and even as to third parties who have actual knowledge thereof.&nbsp; If this opinion is correct, the&nbsp; mortgage in favor of St. Paul's Hospital is valid even as to the plaintiff inasmuch as&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; had knowledge&nbsp; of it.&nbsp; I&nbsp; do not, however,&nbsp; base my dissent upon&nbsp; that If Mr. Justice Johns, because, I believe, with&nbsp; all&nbsp; due&nbsp; respect to&nbsp; him,&nbsp; that it is erroneous. Article 1875 of the Civil Code&nbsp; clearly requires the registration of a mortgage in order to insure its validity.&nbsp; The doctrine enunciated by this court in the case of Obras&nbsp; Pias&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Devera&nbsp;&nbsp; Ignacio&nbsp; (17 Phil.,&nbsp; 45), to&nbsp; the effect that the actual knowledge of the existence of the mortgage is&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to its&nbsp; registration in accordance with the&nbsp; Mortgage Law, is not applicable to the present case.&nbsp; That case involved a mortgage made on August 16, 1861, before the Civil Code was in force, and which must be&nbsp; governed only by the Mortgage&nbsp; Law.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the Civil Code,&nbsp; which went into&nbsp; effect later, requires registration as an indispensable requisite for the validity of a mortgage. Commenting on this question, Manresa&nbsp; (vol. 12, p.&nbsp; 494, 1911 ed.)&nbsp; says:<br><blockquote>"It is enough to compare this provision with that of article 146 of the Mortgage Law, to understand that a very great&nbsp; difference exists between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mortgage Law requires this requisite of registration in order&nbsp; that the mortgage may prejudice a third party.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Civil Code establishes it as an indispensable requisite for the validity of the act which goes a little farther, because, without the registration the mortgage is null,&nbsp; even as&nbsp; between&nbsp; the parties."<br></blockquote>The contract&nbsp; in question must be governed by the Civil Code in this respect inasmuch as it was entered into when said Code was in force.<br><br>But, at&nbsp; any rate, even considering that the mortgage in favor of St. Paul's Hospital is not valid as such mortgage, it is, nevertheless, valid as a contract by which St.&nbsp; Paul's Hospital can compel the defendants to register the mortgage in order to make it valid..&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 1279,&nbsp; Civil Code.)<br><br>In my opinion, the judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; must be affirmed.</div>
