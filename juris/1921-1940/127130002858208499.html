				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The facts in this case are stated in the order appealed from, which reads thus:
  <blockquote>
    <p>"On
the 27th of November, last, a motion was filed in this proceeding by
the Attorney-General, praying for the issuance of an order declaring
the illegality and invalidity of the deed of transfer of December 6,
1922, executed by the judicial administrator, as well as of the order
dated December 2, 1922, authorizing said transfer.</p>
    <p>"On the 7th of this month, counsel for Jose Jaranilla filed an opposition to the motion of the Attorney-General.</p>
    <p>"The Attorney-General appeared on behalf of the Bureau of Education, <em>legatee</em>
in this proceeding, and as grounds of his motion, alleges that the
Director of Education had not been notified of the petition of the
administrator, praying for authorization to exchange lot No. 3780 of
the estate with lot No. 3554 of Jose Jaranilla; and in support of his
contention, he cites section 714 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the
case of Buenaventura <i>vs.</i> Ramos, Official Gazette of December 9, 1922.</p>
    <p>"Section
714 really provides that to the petition of the administrator there
must be attached the consent of the heirs, legatees, and other persons
interested; but section 722 of the same Code, which prescribes the
procedure to be followed in the granting of authority to sell, requires
in paragraph 3 the publication of the petition of the administrator in
a newspaper for three consecutive weeks, which publication may be
dispensed with if the parties interested are personally notified of the
petition of the administrator.</p>
    <p>"In this proceeding the
administrator filed his petition on October 23, 1922, and as no notice
thereof was given to the heirs and interested parties, the court
ordered the publication of said petition in the newspaper <em>El Adalid</em>.
The order of the court for the publication was issued October 25, 1922,
and the petition was set for hearing on December 2 of the same year. On
the day fixed for the hearing, December 2, 1922, the trial court after
hearing the administrator and Jose Jaranilla, the owner of the land to
be exchanged, granted the petition, authorizing the exchange of lot No.
3780 of the estate with lot No. 3554 of Jose Jaranilla.</p>
    <p>"In
granting this authority to make the exchange, the court took into
account the benefit alleged by the administrator that was to inure to
the estate. This benefit consists in that the lot or land of Mr.
Jaranilla is in a commercial center and may be worth one hundred
thousand pesos (P100,000), citing as a proof thereof page 97 of the
record, where lot No. 3548-A appears to have been sold by the deceased
Mr. Esteban Jalandoni to Catton-Neill &amp; Co., Ltd., for the price of
six pesos (P6) a square meter; and this lot No. 3548, of which lot No.
3548-A sold to the Catton-Neill &amp; Co., Ltd., is a part, is adjacent
to lot No. 3554 of Mr. Jose Jaranilla.</p>
    <p>"Another benefit
alleged is that lot No. 3554 of Mr. Jaranilla is adjoining the lands of
the deceased where the schoolhouses are built, while lot No. 3780 of
the estate is an isolated parcel and is far away from the other parcels
belonging to the deceased. An examination of the sketch made by a
surveyor of the Bureau of Lands, presented by counsel for Jose
Jaranilla in support of his opposition, shows that this allegation is
true. In this sketch the portion of the land sold to Catton-Neill &amp;
Co., Ltd., can be clearly seen, as well as lot No. 3554 of Mr. Jose
Jaranilla, which is adjacent to the large portion not sold of lot No.
3548 of the deceased, and on this lot No. 3548 the schoolhouse of the
deceased, Esteban Jalandoni, is built.</p>
    <p>"Attached to the
sketch, there also appears a certificate signed by the surveyor Mr.
Roman Ciliran, stating that lot No. 3780 of the estate is seven hundred
meters from lot No. 3548 where the school building of the deceased is
erected, and that lot No. 3554 is bounded on the western side by lot
No. 3548.</p>
    <p>"Another ground alleged by the administrator was
the contract or verbal promise to exchange said lots made in the
lifetime of the deceased, and which was not carried out on account of
his death, which fact was admitted by the administrator at the hearing
of the motion.</p>
    <p>"In view of the object of the deceased in
giving the rest of his estate to the Bureau of Education which is for
the building of a schoolhouse on the lands devised specially in the
municipality of La Paz, the court believes that the exchange of a land
adjacent to the land where the school erected by the deceased is built
for another one pertaining to the estate, but which is far away from
the place where the school is built, serves the purpose of the deceased
in making the legacy in favor of the Bureau of Education, aside from
the commercial value of the land of Mr. Jaranilla, lot No. 3554,
offered to be exchanged with lot No. 3780 of the estate.</p>
    <p>"On
folio 271 of the record is the land tax receipt issued in the name of
Jose Jaranilla in the year 1923 for the lot exchanged with a land of
the estate; and in this receipt it appears that the land of Mr. Jose
Jaranilla was assessed at eight hundred forty pesos (P840). This land
of Mr. Jaranilla contains sixteen thousand eight hundred twenty-two
square meters, and judging from the adjoining land of the deceased
Esteban Jalandoni sold to the Catton-Neill &amp; Co., Ltd., at six
pesos (P6) a square meter, the land of Mr. Jalandoni may be worth
P100,932, appraising it at P6 a square meter; but even supposing that
it is not worth six pesos a square meter, but only P3, even then its
total value would be more than P50,000.</p>
    <p>"On the other hand,
the land in Tabucan Viejo, which is lot No. 3780, according to the tax
receipt on folio 191 of the record, is actually assessed at P1,590 and
in their report, page 111 of the record, the commissioners increased
the value of lot No. 3780, fixing it at P3,400.</p>
    <p>"Besides
this material or economical advantage, which is great, they have taken
into account the benefit to be derived from this exchange in connection
with the purpose for which the legacy was made to the Bureau of
Education. Lot No. 3554 of Mr. Jaranilla would serve this purpose
better and more adequately than if the Bureau of Education should take
lot No. 3780 which is far from lot No. 3548 where the schoolhouse built
by the deceased in his lifetime is.</p>
    <p>"The Attorney-General
says that the exchange authorized by the court violates the provision
of clause 5 of the will that no land should be sold or transferred
except for public use. The exchange authorized by the court met this
condition, inasmuch as it was beneficial to the schoolhouse built on
lot No. 3548 adjoining the aforesaid lot No. 3548, and this is the
reason why the proposed exchange of lot No. 3554 was accepted.</p>
    <p>"The case cited by the Attorney-General has no application here. In Buenaventura <i>vs.</i>
Ramos the heirs of the deceased Buenaventura opposed the petition of
the administrator for authority to sell a fishery pertaining to the
deceased Buenaventura, and the court denied said petition; but the
administrator having renewed his petition, the court granted it and
gave him authority to sell the fishery as requested by the
administrator, in spite of the opposition presented by the heirs. This
order of the court was reversed by the Honorable Supreme Court on the
ground that the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased
has no power to sell any real property, when there are no debts or
obligations against the estate, without the consent and approval in
writing of the heirs interested in the property to be sold, because the
heirs become the owners of the property as soon as their ascendant
dies, and cannot be deprived thereof except in the manner provided by
the law, and through legal proceedings. The doctrine above cited has,
therefore, no application in the case now before us.</p>
    <p>"In
this proceeding the Bureau of Education is not an heir of the estate of
the deceased Esteban Jalandoni. The latter, in paragraph 2 of his will
probated in this proceeding, makes a specific legacy to the Bureau of
Education of the personal and real property mentioned in said
paragraph. Under the decision rendered in the case of Buenaventura <i>vs.</i>
Ramos, the heirs become the owners of the estate as soon as their
ascendant dies; but a legatee does not acquire the legal status of an
owner until the legacy is awarded to him.</p>
    <p>"With reference
to legacies, the law provides that in default of the property
bequeathed, the heir may comply with the will by delivering to the
legatee a thing identical to the one given that might have been lost.</p>
    <p>"As
a last ground, the Attorney-General alleges that the exchange made by
the administrator is not beneficial to the legatee or the estate.</p>
    <p>"The
benefit obtained by the estate or the Bureau of Education as legatee is
shown by the fact that the land of Mr. Jaranilla, that was exchanged,
has a commercial value which is estimated at P6 a square meter, this
being the price of the adjoining land sold to the Catton-Neill &amp;
Co., Ltd., which price lot No. 3780 does not, and cannot, bring, being
seven hundred meters from lot No. 3548 where the schoolhouse of the
deceased is built.</p>
    <p>"Another benefit derived by the estate
or the Bureau of Education as legatee from the acquisition of lot No.
3554 consists in that it is adjacent to lot No. 3548 donated by the
deceased to the Bureau of Education for educational purposes and on
which a schoolhouse is erected.</p>
    <p>"The court does not believe
it necessary to make a long discussion in order to show that a land,
such as lot No. 3554, adjoining the lands donated by the deceased
Esteban Jalandoni to the Bureau of Education for educational purposes,
is more beneficial to said Bureau than lot No. 3780, which is far away
from these lands, specially from lot No, 3548 where the school stands.</p>
    <p>"The
purpose for which this specific legacy was given to the Bureau of
Education, which is 'a legacy exclusively for school purposes,' in the
language used by the testator in his will, is accomplished and not
violated by the court in authorizing the exchange of lot No. 3554 of
Mr. Jaranilla with lot No. 3780 of the estate, the former being
adjacent to the land donated, to be used as school site, and on which
the school is erected, and the latter lot being far from the aforesaid
lands.</p>
    <p>"For all of the foregoing, the court denies the motion of the Attorney-General.</p>
    <p>"So ordered."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
From the foregoing order the Attorney-General appealed in behalf of the
Bureau of Education, and now alleges that the lower court erred in the
exercise of its powers in authorizing the administrator of the estate
of Esteban Jalandoni to exchange lot No. 3780 of the cadaster of
Iloilo, described in original certificate of title No. 15154 issued by
the register of deeds of the Province of Iloilo, in the name of Esteban
Jalandoni, with lot No. 3554 of said cadaster, described in original
certificate of title No. 15354 issued by the same register of deeds,
that is, the lot of Jose Jaranilla without having given a personal
notice of the motion of the administrator to the Bureau of Education of
the Government of the Philippine Islands, the successor in interest of
the deceased Esteban Jalandoni in said lot No. 3780, or to the school
superintendent of the Province of Iloilo, the representative of said
Bureau of Education in that province, and without first obtaining the
consent in writing of said Bureau of Education. He also alleges as a
ground of the appeal the fact of the lower court having denied the
motion of the appellant dated November 22, 1923, filed on behalf of the
Bureau of Education of the Government of the Philippine Islands in this
special proceeding.</p>
  <p> The question at issue in this appeal is
whether or not the probate court has authority to give permission to
the administrator to sell the whole or part of a real property under
administration, when said sale appears to be beneficial to the heirs,
donees, or legatees, without their consent.</p>
  <p>    This question has already been decided in the negative by this court in the case of Buenaventura and Del Rosario <i>vs.</i> Ramos (43 Phil., 704), wherein the following doctrine was laid down:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The
executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased person is without
authority to sell real estate, when there are no debts or obligations
existing against the estate, without the consent and approbation, in
writing, of the heirs who are interested in the estate to be sold."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Sections 714 and 718 of the Code of Civil Procedure, invoked in the judgment appealed from, provided:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Sec. 714. <em>Realty may be sold or encumbered though personalty not exhausted</em>.—When
the personal estate of the deceased is not sufficient to pay the debts
and charges of administration without injuring the business of those
interested in the estate, or otherwise prejudicing their interests, and
where a testator has not otherwise made sufficient provision for the
payment of such debts and charges, the court, on application of the
executor or administrator with the consent and approbation, in writing,
of the heirs, devisees, and legatees, residing in the Philippine
Islands, may grant a license to the executor or administrator to sell,
mortgage or otherwise encumber for that purpose real, in lieu of
personal estate, if it clearly appears that such sale, mortgaging or
encumbrance of real estate would be beneficial to the persons
interested and will not defeat any devise of land; in which case the
asset of the devisee shall be required."</p>
    <p>"Sec. 718.<em> Estate may be sold when beneficial to heirs</em>.—When
it appears to the court that it will be beneficial to the heirs,
devisees, or legatees, and those interested in an estate, by reason of
their residing out of the Islands or otherwise, that a part or the
whole of the personal estate, or a part or the whole of the real
estate, or both the real and personal estate, should be sold, the court
may, upon application of the administrator or executor, with the
consent and approbation, in writing, of the heirs, devisees, and
legatees who are interested in the estate to be sold, grant license to
sell the whole or a part of said estate, although not necessary to pay
debts, legacies, or charges of administration; but such license shall
not be granted if inconsistent with the provisions of a will. In case
of such sale, the proceeds shall be decreed and assigned to the persons
entitled to the estate, and in the same proportions."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
As may be seen, the lower court may, upon the petition of the
administrator, authorize the sale of, or the creating of an encumbrance
upon, real property, even though there may be personal property
sufficient to pay the debts and expenses of the proceeding, without
prejudice to the interest of the persons entitled to share in the
inheritance (sec. 714). The court may likewise authorize the sale of
any personal or real property of the estate upon the petition of the
administrator, although it may not be necessary for the payment of
debts, legacies, or charges of administration, when said sale appears
to be beneficial to the heirs, donees, or legatees and other persons
interested in the inheritance on account of their absence from the
Philippine Islands or for any other cause (sec. 718). But in either
case the law requires the consent in writing of the heirs, donees and
legatees and other persons interested in the inheritance. And so
section 722 which prescribes the rules to be observed in the giving of
permission to make the sale requires that in cases where the consent of
the heirs, donees and legatees is necessary, the executor or
administrator shall show to the court said consent in writing signed by
them or their guardians if minors or under guardianship. Not only the
convenience or advantage of the sale must the court take into
consideration in order that it may authorize said sale; but it must
consider chiefly the consent in writing of the heirs, who are the
persons entitled to the property sought to be sold, and cannot be
deprived thereof without due process of law.</p>
  <p> And what is
said of sale, may be applied to exchange, since in law the exchange of
real property is but a sale, in which the contracting parties agree
that the price be represented reciprocally by the properties exchanged.</p>
  <p>
For the foregoing, the order appealed from is reversed and it is hereby
declared that the order of December 22, 1922, authorizing the exchange
in question is void, as well as the document of exchange executed by
virtue of said order, without special pronouncement as to costs. So
ordered.</p>
