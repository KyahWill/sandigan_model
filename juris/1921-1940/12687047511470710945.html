				<H3>MATIAS A. FERNANDO, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. GUZCO TRANSIT, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Public Service Commission,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Guzco Transit Company asked for authority to increase the hours of service on the Norzagaray-Manila line,&nbsp; but&nbsp; was only partially successful since the commissioner conceded to the applicant the only disposable hours, which were 12:00 noon from Norzagaray and 5:30 P. M., from&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; The two errors assigned on appeal on behalf of Matias A. Fernando, the oppositor, attack the justice of the above-mentioned concession to the Guzco Transit Company.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, no time need be consumed in consideration&nbsp; of the appeal, for the reason that there is evidence in the record reasonably supporting the findings of the commissioner, and for the further very obvious reason that details of administration such as the granting of permission for additional service to operators naturally lie within the discretionary powers of the Public Service Commission. The petition for review is totally without merit.<br><br>Decision and order affirmed,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; costs of this instance against the petitioner.<br><br>Ten days from the publication of this&nbsp; decision, judgment will be entered, and five days thereafter,&nbsp; the record will he remanded to the court below.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Street, Romualdez,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
