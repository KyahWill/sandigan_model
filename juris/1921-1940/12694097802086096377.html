				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; is a capitalist and broker of the City of Iloilo who, for a number of years prior to the controversy which gave rise to this lawsuit; had been accustomed&nbsp; to make&nbsp; advances to the defendant Mariano Aguilar to enable him&nbsp; to grow sugar cane upon the hacienda San Agustin, in the municipality of Hinigaran, Province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Occidental&nbsp; Negros.&nbsp; The&nbsp; course of dealing between the two appears to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; that the plaintiff would advance money to the defendant upon credit of the latter's growing crop, while the defendant was expected to repay these loans out of the proceeds of sugar produced on&nbsp; the&nbsp; plantation.&nbsp; The defendant was also required to allow the plaintiff, in the capacity of broker, to market his sugar, for which service the plaintiff received a commission of 2 per centum upon the sales.&nbsp; On July 28, 1921, Mariano Aguilar and his wife, Dolores Siguenza de Aguilar,&nbsp; entered into a written contract with the plaintiff, whereby&nbsp; they mortgaged to him thirty head of carabao, thirty head of other cattle, and the crop of sugar cane then growing upon the hacienda, for the purpose of securing a liquidated prior indebtedness of P61,504.52,&nbsp; plus P13,495.48 of advances which it was agreed that the creditor would, or might, make to assist the mortgagors in cultivating and marketing the crop for the current year.&nbsp; The mortgagors&nbsp; not having complied with the terms of the mortgage within the period of two years from the date thereof, as contemplated in the agreement, the plaintiff instituted the present action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo for the purpose of foreclosing&nbsp; the chattel mortgage upon&nbsp; the carabao and other cattle described&nbsp; in the schedule attached&nbsp; to the mortgage.&nbsp; Upon hearing the cause the trial court found that the plaintiff had made out a case for relief, but instead of ordering the foreclosure of the mortgage, as&nbsp; asked in the complaint, his Honor declared the contract resolved for noncompliance on the part of the defendants with the stipulations of the contract&nbsp; and gave&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; for the&nbsp; plaintiff to recover from the defendants the sum of P88,274.93, plus the further sum of P8,827.49, pursuant to stipulation for the payment of an&nbsp; attorney's fee of 10 per cent of the indebtedness, and requiring the further payment of interest on the principal amount of P70,100.98, at&nbsp; the rate of 12 per centum per annum from June 12, 1925 (the date of the judgment) until the indebtedness should be satisfied.&nbsp; In&nbsp; view of the fact that the relief granted was not in conformity with the petitory part of the complaint, the court ordered the complaint to be amended; and&nbsp; in accordance with this requirement&nbsp; the plaintiff at once amended by asking in the alternative for the&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; of the contract or the foreclosure of&nbsp; the mortgage.&nbsp; From&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment entered in the sense of resolution, as&nbsp; above&nbsp; indicated, the defendants appealed.<br><br>The assignments of error contained in the brief of the appellants&nbsp; presented in this court raise two questions of a basic&nbsp; nature.&nbsp; These we shall proceed to examine in turn. The&nbsp; appellants'&nbsp; first proposition&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment declaring the resolution of the mortgage, Exhibit A, is in contravention of the express provisions of the&nbsp; contract. To the proper elucidation&nbsp; of this point&nbsp; a brief exposition of some of the more important stipulations in&nbsp; the contract is necessary.<br><br>At&nbsp; the time the mortgage was executed it was foreseen that the indebtedness would probably&nbsp; not be paid off from the produce of the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda San Agustin</span> during the first year, and it was accordingly stipulated that the mortgage should be&nbsp; renewed from year to year so as to cover the crop&nbsp; of&nbsp; each successive year&nbsp; (art. XVIII&nbsp; of mortgage), and still another stipulation&nbsp; was&nbsp; inserted by which the debtors&nbsp; obligated themselves&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver to&nbsp; the mortgagee not only the crop already planted upon the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda </span>but the crop&nbsp; for the year&nbsp; 1922-1923&nbsp; (art. VI&nbsp; of mortgage).&nbsp; It was also agreed that after the sugar grown upon the land for the current and succeeding year should have been delivered&nbsp; by the mortgagors to&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgagee, the latter should sell the sugar, under certain&nbsp; restrictions, and apply two-thirds of&nbsp; the proceeds towards&nbsp; the satisfaction of the mortgage debt, leaving&nbsp; one-third to the&nbsp; mortgagors&nbsp; for expenses&nbsp; (arts.&nbsp; VII, XI&nbsp; of&nbsp; mortgage).&nbsp; The mortgagors further undertook&nbsp; to deliver&nbsp; to the mortgagee&nbsp; annually during the life of the contract the amount of 6,000 piculs of muscovado sugar, or 3,000 piculs of centrifugal sugar (art VII of mortgage).&nbsp; This stipulation&nbsp; appears to have reflected an exaggerated notion of the productive capacity of the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda</span>,&nbsp; for the proof shows that even under the most&nbsp; favorable&nbsp; conditions the&nbsp; harvest&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; likely to reach the figures mentioned.&nbsp; In fact, from the harvest of 1921-1922, the mortgagors delivered to the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; only 3,024.11&nbsp; piculs&nbsp; of muscovado&nbsp; sugar&nbsp; of the&nbsp; value&nbsp; of P18,880.63; and&nbsp; the total crop did&nbsp; not&nbsp; reach the&nbsp; limit of 6,000 piculs.&nbsp; Testifying as a witness&nbsp; in&nbsp; his own behalf, the defendant Mariano Aguilar&nbsp; stated that he&nbsp; actually harvested from the farm during that year some 4,087 piculs of muscovado sugar.<br><br>In explanation of his short deliveries from the harvest of 1921-1922, Aguilar says that&nbsp; it was a bad-crop year, owing to destructive storms and floods.&nbsp; This explanation may be-accepted as explanatory of the failure of the hacienda to produce the full 6,000 piculs of sugar&nbsp; which the defendants had agreed to deliver during that year; but this did not relieve them from&nbsp; the obligation to deliver the entire produce of the&nbsp; farm during that year.&nbsp; As&nbsp; we&nbsp; have already&nbsp; seen, Aguilar retained in said season more&nbsp; than 1,000 piculs.&nbsp; This was an act of bad faith, in direct violation of the stipulations of the mortgage, and this breach of the contract affords in our opinion a sufficient basis for the resolution of the contract which was decreed by the&nbsp; trial court.&nbsp; From the language used in the appealed decision, it might seem that his Honor considered the defendants in default in the fact that they had not delivered for the year mentioned the total stipulated&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; sugar (6,000 piculs), but this is not quite accurate.&nbsp; The default was in the failure of&nbsp; the defendants to deliver the full amount of sugar&nbsp; resulting from the harvest.&nbsp; Under article 1124 of the Civil Code, the right of one of the obligors in&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract to insist upon a&nbsp; resolution upon the&nbsp; failure of the other obligor to comply with what is incumbent upon&nbsp; him is implied in every contract; and it is not necessary&nbsp; that there should be&nbsp; inserted in&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract any stipulation expressly&nbsp; allowing resolution.<br><br>But there are&nbsp; certain provisions in the contract&nbsp; which are relied upon by the&nbsp; defendants as negativing the right of the plaintiff to obtain a resolution of the contract.&nbsp; Thus, in clause IX, it is agreed that, if the debtors should not be able to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; entire&nbsp; indebtedness in the&nbsp; period of two years specified in the contract, then the mortgagee would extend the contract&nbsp; for another year upon the same&nbsp; conditions and terms&nbsp; as are expressed&nbsp; in the contract&nbsp; itself. Again, in clause&nbsp; XXII, it is&nbsp; stipulated that, if the mortgagee should fail to&nbsp; consign to the mortgagors any portion of the sugar which&nbsp; the mortgagors had agreed to deliver, the latter would&nbsp; pay the mortgagee a commission of 2 per centum upon the value&nbsp; of the sugar necessary to complete the 6,000&nbsp; piculs.<br><br>We are of the&nbsp; opinion that neither of these clauses&nbsp; has the effect&nbsp; of suppressing the right of the plaintiff to insist upon resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; These provisions&nbsp; contemplate&nbsp; the case where the creditor elects to insist upon performance,&nbsp; and they cannot be taken to affect a right of resolution when the creditor sees&nbsp; fit to&nbsp; insist&nbsp; upon resolution,â€”an alternative&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; expressly reserved&nbsp; to the creditor in&nbsp; the second paragraph of article&nbsp; 1124&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil Code even after he has requested fulfilment.&nbsp; It is also insisted&nbsp; for the defendants that article XXIV in the mortgage is&nbsp; inconsistent with the right of resolution, since said article provides especially that the mortgage should be cancelled upon compliance with its&nbsp; conditions.&nbsp; But this clause is nothing more than the ordinary resolutory&nbsp; clause commonly found in mortgages providing that it shall be of no effect upon payment of the secured debt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The insertion of this clause in the contract certainly is in no wise inconsistent with the exercise&nbsp; of the right&nbsp; of resolution&nbsp; to which reference is made in&nbsp; the&nbsp; article cited.<br><br>The second proposition&nbsp; advanced for the appellants is to the effect&nbsp; that the plaintiff himself had violated&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; by refusing&nbsp; to make&nbsp; advances&nbsp; to the defendants for their agricultural&nbsp; needs during&nbsp; the&nbsp; agricultural years 1922-1923 and 1923-1924.&nbsp; As a consequence of this alleged default on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the plaintiff, the defendants were compelled, so it is claimed, to seek financial&nbsp; assistance from other&nbsp; sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; a consequence, it&nbsp; is argued that the&nbsp; plaintiff is not entitled to insist upon&nbsp; the strict fulfilment of the obligations incumbent upon the defendants. The contention is in our opinion not&nbsp; sustained by the terms of the contract or by the facts appearing in&nbsp; evidence. There is&nbsp; no stipulation in the mortgage for other advances to be made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; plaintiff than&nbsp; those therein specified amounting to&nbsp; about&nbsp; P14,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; did advance&nbsp; to the defendants somewhat overP18,000,&nbsp; a&nbsp; sum considerably&nbsp; in excess of the advances which the plaintiff had&nbsp; obligated himself to&nbsp; make.&nbsp; It further appears&nbsp; that as the time approached for the planting of the crop for the agricultural year&nbsp; 1923-1924, an interview between Aguilar and&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff was held in&nbsp; which the latter&nbsp; agreed to furnish the defendants with some P26,000 for agricultural outlay by the defendants for said&nbsp; year.&nbsp; Pursuant&nbsp; to this agreement the plaintiff advanced some P1,500, after which he found that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Aguilar had already mortgaged the crop for that&nbsp; year to the Philippine&nbsp; National Bank,&nbsp; for advances to be received from it.&nbsp; In view of this discovery&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff withdrew&nbsp; from his commitment with respect to&nbsp; the making of advances for the year mentioned and the special contract that had been made for that&nbsp; year was abrogated by mutual consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time Aguilar returned the P1,500 then lately advanced to him&nbsp; by the plaintiff.<br><br>Before&nbsp; passing to the final phase of our discussion, attention should be directed to&nbsp; the fact that the original complaint in this case was filed after the expiration of the period of&nbsp; two&nbsp; years fixed for the payment of the mortgage debt; but as we have already seen, the mortgagee agreed, in clause IX, that if the mortgagors should be unable to pay all the debt by the termination of said period, he would extend the contract for another year.&nbsp; The action&nbsp; was instituted before this third year had passed.&nbsp; Upon this it is insisted&nbsp; for the appellants&nbsp; that the action was&nbsp; prematurely&nbsp; brought.<br><br>It&nbsp; is undoubtedly true that the&nbsp; stipulation above referred to would have&nbsp; been a serious&nbsp; and perhaps insuperable obstacle to the maintenance of the action to foreclose; but as the case was finally dealt with, the resolution of the contract was decreed.&nbsp; Of course in this aspect the defense of the prematurity of the action is not available,&nbsp; as resolution&nbsp; can be at once had upon the occurrence of the breach giving rise to the right&nbsp; to resolve.<br><br>From what&nbsp; has been&nbsp; said it results that the trial judge committed no&nbsp; fundamental error in granting a&nbsp; resolution upon the&nbsp; facts appearing before&nbsp; him; and it&nbsp; only remains to consider whether&nbsp; the different elements of the appealed judgment are compatible with the fundamental&nbsp; character of the relief which the court&nbsp; undertook to grant.&nbsp; Upon this&nbsp; point an&nbsp; analysis of the dispositive part of said decision will&nbsp; show that&nbsp; important errors&nbsp; were&nbsp; made&nbsp; in the solution of the problem before the court.&nbsp; In this connection it will be noted that the&nbsp; contract contains&nbsp; a&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp; for the payment by the debtors of interest at 12 per centum per annum&nbsp; upon the entire&nbsp; indebtedness.&nbsp; The mortgage also contains a stipulation for the payment of a 10 per&nbsp; centum attorney's fee, apart from legal costs, in case the debtors should default in the payment of the debt and&nbsp; it should become necessary for the mortgagee to employ an attorney.&nbsp; The trial judge allowed full interest at stipulated rate, as well as the stipulated attorney's fee.<br><br>The allowance of these items was of course fundamentally&nbsp; inconsistent&nbsp; with the notion of&nbsp; resolution.&nbsp; When a contract is resolved, rescinded, or annulled, it is the duty of the court to require the parties to surrender that which they have severally received and to place each as far&nbsp; as practicable in his original&nbsp; situation; and when a resolution is granted, it has the effect of abrogating the contract in all its parts.&nbsp; The party seeking resolution cannot have performance as to part and resolution as to the remainder.&nbsp; It results that when the contract in question was resolved, the plaintiff could no longer rely upon the stipulations with respect to the payment of interest and attorney's fee; and the sole duty incumbent upon the defendants is to restore what they have received from the plaintiff, with legal interest from the date when the benefits accruing to them were respectively conferred (Salas Rodriguez <i>vs.</i> Leuterio, 47 Phil., 818).<br><br>Applying the rule above announced to the case before us, the rights of the litigants may be defined as follows: The plaintiff is&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to recover from the defendants the original indebtedness, as liquidated upon July 28, 1921, in the amount of P61,504.52, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum from said date until said indebtedness shall have been satisfied.&nbsp; The plaintiff is also entitled to recover the additional amounts of money advanced by him to the defendants since July 28, 1921, with&nbsp; lawful interest upon the various advancements&nbsp; from the respective dates when made and until said indebtedness shall&nbsp; have been paid.&nbsp; The plaintiff is also entitled to recover from the defendants the amounts due him&nbsp; for&nbsp; merchandise, supplies, and other items of account, with lawful interest thereon from&nbsp; the dates&nbsp; when&nbsp; such obligations were&nbsp; incurred until&nbsp; the indebtedness shall have been satisfied.&nbsp; The defendants, on the other hand, are entitled to credit for&nbsp; the amount of P2,691, the proceeds of property belonging to the defendants which was attached and sold at the instance of the plaintiff soon after the action was instituted.&nbsp; The defendants&nbsp; are&nbsp; also entitled to credit for the sum of P18,880.63, the value of 3,024.11 piculs of muscovado sugar which they delivered to the plaintiff from the harvest of 1921-1922.&nbsp; The two items last above-mentioned should be deducted as partial payments upon the indebtedness as it existed upon the dates when said items respectively&nbsp; came to the hands of the plaintiff; or what amounts to the&nbsp; same thing, interest may be allowed upon said items from those dates, and the total&nbsp; deducted from the capital upon the date of final liquidation.<br><br>The statements of account submitted by the plaintiff in the form of exhibits in this action are not in conformity with the rule above stated, inasmuch as compound interest has been charged at the rate of 12 per centum per annum, and the interest charges are so involved in the account that it is not practicable or possible for this court upon the record before us to state an&nbsp; exact balance.<br><br>It will therefore be necessary to return the record to&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court for a liquidation of the account;&nbsp; and if the parties should be able to agree in the lower court upon a balance in&nbsp; harmony with the conclusions above stated, judgment in favor of the plaintiff shall be entered therefor. If, however, they should be unable to agree upon a balance, the plaintiff shall be required to submit a statement of account along the lines indicated, with liberty to the defendants to submit their exceptions to the same; and&nbsp; upon hearing the matter, the court will state a balance and enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff, requiring the defendants to pay the same.<br><br>Therefore, affirming the appealed judgment in the part consistent herewith and reversing the&nbsp; same in the parts inconsistent, the cause is hereby remanded to the court of origin,&nbsp; for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.&nbsp; So ordered,&nbsp; without express pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>AvanceÃ±a, C. J., Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real JJ.</i>, concur.<br></div>
