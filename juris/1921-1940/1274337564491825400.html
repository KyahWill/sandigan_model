				<H3>PROVINCIA DEL SANTISIMO NOMBRE DE JESUS DE FILIPINAS DE LA ORDEN DE ERMITAÑOS DE NUESTRO PADRE SAN AGUSTIN, COMUNMENTE CONOCIDA CON EL NOMBRE DE "CORPORACION DE PP. AGUSTINOS," PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LEON DEL REY ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a case involving a mortgage credit. The plaintiff corporation prays 
that judgment be rendered against the defendants to pay jointly and severally 
the sum of P41,670.87 with interest at 9 per cent per annum computed from June 
15, 1928, until it is paid, plus the legal rate of interest from the filing of 
the complaint, and P4,807.90 with the legal interest thereon-from the date on 
which this action was instituted, with costs.
<p>The plaintiff further prays that if the defendants fail to make such payments 
within three months from the date of judgment, the P75,000 mortgage credit of 
defendant Jose Marin against his co-defendant Felipa P. Alberto, secured by the 
property described in the complaint, be sold at public auction, and the proceeds 
applied to the judgment.</p>
<p>The defendants Leon del Rey and Jose Marin contend that the document sought 
to be enforced is null and void, and that the plaintiff owes them P6,997.89; 
wherefore they pray that said document be declared null and void, the 
corresponding entry in the proper certificate of title be ordered cancelled, and 
the plaintiff be sentenced to pay them the amount last mentioned and the costs. 
After the defendants had filed a specification of the amounts mentioned in their 
answer, to which the plaintiff replied in writing, and after the trial, the 
Court of First Instance having cognizance of the case rendered the following 
judgment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Held, that the defendants Del Rey and Marin are jointly and severally liable 
for the payment of the following sums to the plaintiff: P41,670.87 with interest 
at 9 per cent per annum from June 15, 1928, until the sum is fully paid; 
P4,807.90, with interest at 6 per cent per annum from January 12, 1929, until it 
is fully paid. They are ordered to deposit these sums, together with the 
interest, in the office of the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
within three months of the date of this judgment, under penalty of having the 
mortgage credit of P75,000 sold at public auction. They shall each pay half of 
the costs of the trial. The plaintiff is hereby absolved from the defendants' 
counterclaim." (Pp. 35 and 36, Bill of Exceptions.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendants impugn this judgment and assign the following alleged errors 
as committed by the trial court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) In not holding that the document executed on June 15, 1928 (Exhibit C), 
is null and void for having been obtained through coercion, threat, and 
intimidation practised on one of the subscribers, to wit, Leon del Rey.</p>
<p>"(2) In not holding that accountant Francisco Santiago's report (Exhibit 4) 
has been found to contain some errors in accounting inasmuch as Leon del Rey is 
charged with certain sums which he is not bound to pay the plaintiff, included 
in the specification filed by the defendants with their amended answer.</p>
<p>"(3) In rejecting the defendants' claim for Leon del Rey's expenses for 
repairing and painting the facade of the Church of St. Augustine at the request 
and approval of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>"(4) In denying the defendants' motion for a new trial on the ground that the 
evidence does not sustain the judgment, which, is contrary to the law.</p>
<p>"(5) In rendering judgment for the plaintiff corporation and against the 
defendants, with one-half of the costs against each of the latter, instead of 
absolving them with costs against the plaintiff."</p></blockquote>
<p>The defendants, Leon del Rey and Jose Marin, executed Exhibit C on June 15, 
1928, undertaking to pay the Compania Agricola de Ultramar jointly and severally 
the sum of P41,670.87 with interest at 9 per cent per annum, and the interest 
earned during the year 1927 on the company's funds deposited by Leon del Rey in 
his own name in certain banks. The payment of these sums was secured by a 
mortgage of the P75,000 mortgage credit held by Jose Marin against the property 
covered by transfer certificate No. 26823 of Manila, belonging to the defendant 
Felipa P. Alberto; and it was stipulated that in default of payment of the 
interest due upon the principal of P41,670.87 for six months, the credit would 
become due and the mortgage liable to foreclosure.</p>
<p>The debtors having failed to pay the stipulated interest for more than six 
months, the mortgagee instituted this action in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, with the result indicated above.</p>
<p>Before the case was decided the present plaintiff acquired the rights of the 
Compania Agricola de Ultramar, and was substituted in this case.</p>
<p>There is in the record no evidence of coercion, threat, or intimidation 
practised upon Leon del Rey to compel him to sign the mortgage deed mentioned 
above. Neither the estafa charge against him, nor Father Mariano Rodrigo's 
alleged remarks addressed to Jose Marin, nor Father Castrillo's alleged 
recommendation to Juan Larrazabal to have Leon del Rey, sigh the mortgage 
constitutes, either by itself or together, coercion, threat, or intimidation, 
vitiating the consent manifested in the execution of that contract. Even 
assuming that the defendants entered into this contract reluctantly, it cannot 
be annulled upon this ground. This court has so ruled in Martinez <em>vs</em>. 
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (15 Phil., 252) in holding that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is necessary to distinguish between real duress and the motive which is 
present when one gives his consent reluctantly. A contract is valid even though 
one of the parties entered into it against his wishes and desires or even 
against his better judgment."</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the evidence shows that the defendants had been leading up to 
the contract by a series of offers, and that upon its execution they regarded it 
as existing and acted accordingly, thereby confirming it beyond all doubt. In 
regard to the defendants' alleged error at the time or just prior to the 
execution of the contract, this has not been proven. They had discussed and gone 
over Exhibit 4, containing accountant Santiago's report.</p>
<p>The defendants are not entitled to a review of their accounts with the 
plaintiff's predecessor, which were liquidated with their consent as shown by 
the contract itself; for they cannot now be heard to deny their own acts. Barnes 
&amp; Co., 16 Phil., 423; Gutierrez Hermanos <em>vs.</em> Oria Hermanos &amp; 
Co., 30 Phil., 491.)</p>
<p>With reference to the expenses incurred in repairing and painting the facade 
of the Church of St. Augustine, these have neither been alleged nor claimed in 
due time in the first instance, and it does not appear that the plaintiff is 
under obligation to pay for them.</p>
<p>The two last assignments of error are mere consequences of the preceding 
ones.</p>
<p>There being no merit in this appeal, the judgment appealed from is hereby 
affirmed, with costs against the appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand 
Villa-Real,</em> and <em>Imperial, JJ.,</em> concur.<br><br></p></div>
