				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellants were charged with taking Cristina Biel away through force, 
violence and intimidation against her will and with lewd designs, prosecuted, 
tried, and convicted by the Court of First Instance of Manila found guilty of 
the crime of abduction with violence and each sentenced to fourteen years, eight 
months and one day <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, the accessory penalties, and one-third of 
the costs. 
<p>The three accused appeal from said judgment, each denying, in the memorandum 
presented by respective counsel, being guilty of the crime charged. </p>
<p>Cristina Biel, the offended party, asserts that in company with her two 
children of tender age, she was taken to Manila from Cavite by Ramon Cosca in an 
automobile, by force and with evident lewd designs; that in the car driven by 
one of the three defendants there were besides the latter and the offended party 
and her two children, two women, one named Ema and the other Catalina Daño; that 
upon arriving at Manila they went to Quiapo Church, where Ema alighted, and from 
there they went to a canteen belonging to David Thomas in the barrio of 
Sañgandaan, Rizal, where all alighted, the accused taking beer and Cosca wine, 
offering her some beer which she declined; that from said canteen they returned 
to Manila, stopping in front of a store on Rizal Avenue, and there Ramon Cosca 
frightened her with a pistol (which turned out to be a toy), and Vicente Salas 
with some bullets which he bought at said store, the defendant Santiago Mapalad 
warning her that if she did not accede to his wishes, everybody would die in the 
automobile; that she, both there and at other points along the way, started to 
shout but Ramon Cosca put his hand over her mouth; that from Rizal Avenue, they 
went and stopped in front of the Savoy Theater, the defendant Mapalad alighting 
to fetch Ema; that there, because the people were beginning to stare at the 
automobile on account of the shouts of the offended party, Ramon Cosca let her 
and her children go; that she went to an office in which there was a Spaniard or 
an American and asked him to defend her; that Ramon Cosca went up to her 
offering P50 if she would go back to Cavite, but she refused; that, in running 
about in her excitement she met a policeman, Dionisio Comendador, to whom she 
related the occurrence; that on the advice of said policeman, she and her two 
children went to the Meisic station.<br><br>There is no question in the case 
that the trip was made along that route and by all the persons mentioned by the 
offended party. What the defense contends is that the offended party, not only 
went with the defendants willingly, but that it is she who suggested to Ramon 
Cosca that they all take the ride to Manila on the afternoon in question. </p>
<p>At the outset, it seems rather strange that the defendants in thus abducting 
the offended party, allowed two other women to accompany them who were not shown 
to have any connection therewith, and headed for Manila, of all places, and went 
to the crowded sections of the City. </p>
<p>The offended party's testimony touching the force and violence and other 
attempts to which she was subjected, is not sufficiently corroborated in the 
record. While it is true that the witness Catalina Daño, in her declaration 
before the Constabulary (Exhibit C) in substance confirmed the offended party in 
her incriminating statements against the accused, yet, during the trial of the 
case upon being asked to explain her declaration to the Constabulary written in 
Exhibit C, declared that such statement given by her was untrue, taught to her 
by the offended party because the latter said her husband would kill her. </p>
<p>David Thomas and Casimira Thomas, the owners of the canteen named "Country 
Home," state that except for the fact that Cristina Biel seemed vexed or 
disgusted while in the canteen, and said: "What sort of men are these to make my 
husband appear as a cuckold!",—aside from this they say they noticed nothing 
out of the ordinary about her, nor did she ask for any help. Neither of these 
witnesses corroborates the offended party in her declaration that while there 
she asked for an auto for rent in which to return to Cavite. If it were true as 
she says that she was then the victim of the accused, she could have asked for 
help at that canteen, and remained there in order to separate herself from the 
defendants instead of again going with them of her own free will, according to 
the testimony of said owners of that establishment. </p>
<p>Policeman Comendador, indeed, testified that the offended party approached 
him and told him that she had been brought to Manila against her will by some 
men who ran away. But in view of the result of the proceeding, the story which 
she told the policeman must have been an accusation devised by her against the 
defendants on account of not having been able to obtain from Ramon Cosca the P50 
which she had repeatedly asked him for during the trip and which Cosca did not 
give her promising it to her when they got to Cavite; which, as shown by the 
evidence of the defense, seems worthier of credence being more probable and 
partially corroborated by the witnesses for the prosecution. For, Ramon Cosca 
testifies that at the time of the incident, he was having intimate relations 
with the offended party; although the latter denies it, she admits that for some 
time she has been separated from Constantino Teodosis, the man with whom she 
lived maritally and had children, and that she went to live in the house of Ema, 
one of her companions on the trip on the afternoon in question, and that the 
defendant Ramon Cosca used to visit her in that house. </p>
<p>Cosca testified that on the morning of the incident, the offended party asked 
him to take her for a ride to Manila, and that is why he told the old woman 
Catalina Daño to look for an automobile in the afternoon and pick up the 
offended party, passing later for him and Ema, who wished to go with them to 
Manila, all of which took place as stated. He is substantially corroborated in 
this not only by his codefendant Santiago Mapalad, but even by the witness for 
the prosecution Catalina Daño, especially as to the fact that it was the 
offended party who at that time wanted to come to Manila. </p>
<p>Ramon Cosca also states that upon reaching the Savoy Theater, he and his 
codefendants left the car to look for Ema; that on returning to it Cristina Biel 
and her two children were no longer there; that he and his companions got into 
the car again and drove around the place in search of the offended party and her 
children returning to the said Savoy Theater, where they were seen and arrested 
by a policeman. The fact that they returned to that place is corroborated by 
Policeman Comendador who is the one, upon having learned from Cristina Biel the 
number of the car, recognized it, stopped it and after having consulted his 
sergeant by telephone detained the three appellants and the old woman Daño. The 
fact in itself, thus confirmed, of having driven around from about 6 o'clock, 
when the offended party went up to Policeman Comendador, until about 8 o'clock, 
when the same policeman detained the defendants, according to the time fixed by 
him, tends to confirm the allegation of the defense that the defendants were 
really looking for the offended party. If it were true that, as she 
declared, being pursued by Ramon Cosca she entered the office of a Spaniard or 
American (who, to be sure, did not testify in this case) asking for help and 
that Ramon Gosca in order to silence her offered her P50 which she rejected, it 
would seem highly improbable that in the face of such conduct on the part of the 
offended party, the defendants should have still remained at the place, driving 
around there, instead of fleeing from Manila in order to cover up their guilt. 
<br><br>Considering all the circumstances of the case, we deem the defense's 
allegation worthy of credit, to the effect that during the trip in question she 
asked Ramon Cosea for P50 which the latter did not give her but promised to do 
so in Cavite, whereat she became displeased and made up her mind to go to the 
police and denounce the accused. </p>
<p>In cases like the present one wherein the offended party's story, the greater 
part of which is improbable, is not corroborated by the other evidence of the 
case as against the defendants, and wherein the allegations of the defense 
appear to be more in consonance with the normal and usual course of human 
events, and are partly confirmed by the evidence in the case, and even by the 
testimony of some of the witnesses for the prosecution, the best action to take, 
as justice demands, is to give more credit to the exculpatory testimony of the 
defendants applying in their favor, as subsisting and intact the presumption 
that a man is innocent until the contrary is shown.</p>
<p>For the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the appellants 
are acquitted with the costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> and other pronouncements in their favor, 
and it is ordered that Santiago Mapalad, one of said appellants, at present 
detained in this case, be immediately released. So ordered. </p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, 
JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
