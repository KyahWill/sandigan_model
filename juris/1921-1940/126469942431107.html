				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>It is asked in this appeal interposed by the plaintiffs and the municipality  of  San  Pedro that  we reverse  the  resolution entered by the Court of First Instance of Laguna on  May 29, 1936, dismissing the complaint of the former, with costs against them; holding premature and  also dismissing  the so-called cross-complaint of the municipality of San Pedro; ordering the striking out of the motion of Attorney Rustia  of May 1, 1936  and  that of Attorney Gomez of the  15th of the same month, and denying  the motions filed by the aforesaid municipality; and it is asked further that the case proceed to final judgment,  with  the costs of this instance to the appellees.</p>
  <p>  In the complaint by which the case was commenced, the plaintiffs allege:  that they appear  and bring  the action for themselves and  in  the name of  other five thousand persons; that all of them and their predecessors-in-interest from time immemorial, are in possession for many years of many lots, where they now have their houses, and many agricultural lands which they have continuously cultivated, lots, improvements and agricultural lands  which are found within the Hacienda  de San Pedro Tunasan,  situated in the municipality of San Pedro, Province  of Laguna; that they do not claim to be the owners of said lots and agricultural lands, but only  of the  improvements on the former, consisting of houses;  that they are entitled to occupy the lots and agricultural lands, the first because they have their houses thereon  wherein  they  and their predecessors-in-interest have always  lived, and the latter because they as well as  their predecessors-in-interest  have always cultivated the same; that  they recognize in favor  of someone their obligation to pay reasonable rent or <i>canon</i> for their occupation of the lots and  agricultural  lands, rent  and <i>canon</i> which they are willing to pay to the person or entity  which the court  may determine;  that the Commonwealth  of the  Philippines  is  the true  owner  of  the entire  Hacienda de San Pedro Tunasan  by the right of escheat;  that this title was acquired by the Commonwealth of the Philippines because of the death  of Don Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, the original owner of the hacienda, and  his  two minor daughters  without leaving any heir; that the Provincial Government of Laguna may have an interest  in the hacienda,  for the benefit  of the plaintiffs and  the  residents of  the municioality  of  San Pedro; that this  municipality, the plaintiffs are given to understand, will claim the ownership of the hacienda also by the right of escheat; that the Colegio de San Jose, without anv right, also claims to be the owner of the hacienda; and that Carlos Young, without any  known  right,  claims to  have an  interest in the same hacienda.  And the plaintiflfs conclude by asking  that the court order the defendants or interpleaders  to litigate among themselves  over the ownership or dominion of the hacienda and thereafter determine by judgment who is the rightful owner  thereof entitled to collect the rental from them.</p>
  <p>  In the complaint are joined as  defendants the Commonwealth  of  the  Philippines, the  Provincial Government  of Laguna, the municipality of San Pedro, the Colegio  de San Jose,  and  Carlos Young.  The municipality  of San Pedro filed its complaint of  interpleader wherein  it  is stated:  that according to the history of  the  Philippines, so it alleges, the Hacienda de San Pedro Tunasan  originally belonged to one, Don Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, who held the office of Governor and  Captain General of the Island of Mindanao and who executed a  will transferring in trust and for administration the entire hacienda aforesaid to  a charitable institution of  learning which was subsequently called the Colegio  de  San Jose, governed by the Fathers of the Company of Jesus, otherwise known as the Jesuit Fathers; that Rodriguez de Figueroa died  sometime in April, 1596, leaving as heirs his two minor daughters, who also died  without leaving any heirs;  that since then the Colegio de San Jose,  through  the Jesuit Fathers, had held and administered the hacienda and through the practice called "sustitucion  pupilar" by the  claimant, the Jesuit Fathers succeeded  in  appropriating the same, considering it from then on  as  their  property and as  a part of the temporal properties of the church; that the Jesuit Fathers were expelled from the Philippines in 1763 and their properties, together with the hacienda, were  confiscated by the Spanish Government; that by virtue  of the Treaty  of  Paris, the Organic  Law of the United  States Congress of July 1, 1902, the Jones Law, and finally the Tydings-McDuffie  Independence Law, the  aforesaid hacienda passed to the ownership of the  Commonwealth of the Philippines and  the  latter is at  present  the  owner thereof, which  should be  administered and conserved for the benefit and  advantage of the inhabitants of the  Philippines, particularly those of the municipality of San Pedro; that by the right of escheat the Commonwealth of the Philippines has likewise become the owner of the hacienda because  of the death of the daughters of Rodriguez de Figueroa without leaving  any heirs and because there is no one who  is legally entitled thereto;  that  the municipality  of San Pedro has a right to the hacienda for the exclusive benefit of its inhabitants;  and that the Colegio de San  Jose  should render an accounting of the rentals which it has  been collecting from  the hacienda, which should not be  less  than P60,000.  And for prayer it asks that it  be declared the owner of the Hacienda de San Pedro Tunasan and that the  Colegio de San Jose render an accounting and pay it the 'aforesaid sum of  P60,000.</p>
  <p>  Carlos Young appeared  and interposed  a  demurrer to the complaint  of the plaintiffs on the ground that it does not state facts constituting a cause of action and that its allegations are vague, ambiguous, and unintelligible;  and urged that  said  complaint  be finally dismissed  inasmuch as it is  not susceptible of amendment.  Immediately thereafter the same Carlos  Young filed a motion to dismiss the complaint of  interpleader of the municipality of San  Pedro, on the ground that the latter entity has no standing to bring the action, that the complaint of  interpleader is premature because the court has not yet ordered the parties therein  to litigate among themselves,  and that the attorney who represents the said  municipality has appeared and is acting as such in favor of two different parties with conflicting  interests.</p>
  <p>  The municipality of San Pedro filed another motion asking that the prayer of its  complaint be  deemed amended in the sense that  in the decision it be  ordered that  the rentals  and income produced by the hacienda be paid to it.  In another motion the  same municipality opposed the demurrer and  motion to strike filed  by Carlos Young.</p>
  <p>  The acting  Solicitor-General, in behalf of the  Commonwealth of the Philippines, appeared specially  by a motion wherein  it  is asked that  the complaint of the plaintiffs be dismissed.   As ground he  alleged that the  court lacked jurisdiction  over the said entity because,  it being the representative of sovereignty, it cannot  be sued  or compelled to litigate without its express consent, a consent which the complaint alleges has not been previously obtained.</p>
  <p>  In other motions the municipality  of  San Pedro  asked that the Colegio de San Jose and Carlos Young be declared in default, in connection with its complaint of interpleader, for failure to file either demurrers or answers within the prescribed period.</p>
  <p>  The Colegio de San Jose, Inc., interposed  a demurrer to the  plaintiff's complaint, upon the same grounds advanced by Carlos Young  in  his demurrer.  In  another motion filed it asked to strike out certain allegations contained in  paragraph IX, subparagraph  (3), pages  14 to 21  of the complaint of interpleader  of the municipality of San Pedro because they are  immaterial  and offensive. Subsequently it filed is answer to the complaint of  interpleader of the municipality of San Pedro, wherein it denied the  material allegations thereof  and  put up  the defense that the Hacienda de San  Pedro Tunasan is its  exclusive property and that its title has  been recognized by the government and the courts.</p>
  <p>  The provincial  fiscal,  in  behalf of  the acting Solicitor-General, presented a motion to strike out certain immaterial, unnecessary  and improper allegations in the answer of the plaintiffs to the motion to dismiss filed by the acting Solicitor-General.</p>
  <p>  The municipality  of San Pedro filed another motion to strike out  the demurrer and motion filed by Carlos Young and  the motion to strike filed by  the acting Solicitor-General.</p>
  <p>  The plaintiffs filed their  answer to  the demurrer  interposed by the Colegio de San Jose, Inc.  And on the  same date they  filed another motion asking that the court suspend the proceedings in the case on the ground  that the municipality of  San Pedro  commenced in the same  court civil case No. 3052,  wherein it is  asked that the Hacienda de San Pedro Tunasan be escheated to it.</p>
  <p>  Finally the court,  on May 29, 1936, entered the appealed resolution  dismissing  the  plaintiffs' complaint,  with  the costs against them,  holding further that the complaint of interpleader  of the  municipality  of   San Pedro is premature,  overruling all the motions filed by the latter and ordering the striking out from the record  of the pleadings filed by  Attorneys Rustia and Gomez on May 1 and 5, 1939, respectively.</p>
  <p>  The provincial government  of  Laguna  has neither  appeared nor filed a demurrer or answer in  the case.  From what appears, it has shown indifference and lack of any interest to intervene.</p>
  <p>  The foregoing is the  contents  in abridged form of all the pleadings presented in the case and reflects the theories of the parties as well as the  legal questions raised in  the assignments  of error which  shall hereafter be  resolved. We  have  omitted  other pleadings of minor importance which will have no influence  on the  resolution of the  appeal.</p>
  <p>  The appellants assign  in their  joint brief the following errors: "First.  In not  abstaining from deciding any incident in this case, and, consequently,  in entering the  appealed resolution  charged with prejudice and  partiality which Judge Buenaventura  Ocampo had  against the  attorney for the applicants, which  resolution is partial and unjust.  Second.  In  considering, without any  ground, that the  application  for interpleading is  equivalent to  a complaint in an ordinary action  which may  be demurred to, and consequently, in sustaining the demurrers of Carlos Young and of the Colegio de San Jose, Inc.  Third.  In holding that  the application (not complaint) of  interpleading is insufficient, and, consequently,  in dismissing it summarily and finally, with  the costs. Fourth: In sustaining the special appearance of the Solicitor-General, and, consequently, in ordering the  striking out of the motion of May 1, 1936  in reply to  said  special  appearance.  Fifth.  In declaring the cross-complaint  of  the municipality of  San Pedro premature, and, consequently, in not holding Carlos Young and the Colegio de San Jose (unincorporated) in default as defendants in the said cross-complaint  Sixth. And in ordering the striking out from the record of pages 14 and 21 of  the answer of  the municipality, corresponding to subparagraph  (3), paragraph IX, of the cross-complaint of the municipality of San  Pedro,  page 31 to 41 of the bill of exceptions.  Seventh.  In not overruling the said demurrers and petitions to strike out; and in not granting the petition to suspend the proceedings until the final resolution of the petition for escheat Exhibit A."</p>
  <ol>
    <li>     In the first assignment of error the appellants question the integrity and impartiality of the judge who entered the appealed resolution and contend that he should have abstained  from taking cognizance of the case and  from entering any resolution therein.<br>
      <br>
      The appellants  concede that they have not  duly  questioned, at any time, the judge who decided this  case.   The facts of record do not furnish  any evidence  in support of the  appellants'  contention.  The circumstance  pointed out by  the appellants that one  of their attorneys tiled a complaint and administrative charges against  the judge, and  that this naturally created  an  enmity between them, is not a sufficient ground for concluding that the judge acted partially.  As  we have stated, aside from this possible  animadversion,  there is nothing from which it may be inferred that the said judge acted partially in this case.<br>
      <br>
    The appellants  also assert that the appealed resolution was dratted  not  by the judge  but by  the attorney  for Young,  and that  the former merely signed it.  The assertion   is based  entirely on the circumstance that  the theories and reasoning of Attorney  Diokno are  reproduced and sustained as good and sound in the resolution.  It is true that the theories of said counsel are accepted in the resolution, but from  this  it does not inevitably  follow that the entire resolution was dratted by another, and not by the judge, and that the latter merely stamped his signature thereon.  We hold that the first assignment of error is without merit.<br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li> In  the appealed resolution the court sustained both the  demurrer of  Carlos  Young and that  of  the Colegio de  San Jose, Inc., to the complaint of the plaintiffs.  The latter contend in their second assignment of error that the resolution  is  consequently  erroneous since the  pleading which the court styles and considers a complaint is, under procedural law, a petition and as such cannot be demurred to.<p>
      The plaintiffs commenced the case under the provisions of section 120 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the English text of which reads:
      </p><blockquote>
        <p>"Sec.  120. <i>Interpleading</i>.—Whenever  conflicting  claims are or  may  be made upon a person for  or relating to personal property, or the performance of an obligation or any portion thereof, so  that he may be made subject to several  actions by different persons, unless the court intervenes, such person may bring an action against the conflicting claimants, disclaiming personal  interest  in the controversy, to compel them to  interplead and litigate their several  claims among themselves, and the court may order the conflicting claimants to interplead  with one another and thereupon proceed to determine the right of the several parties  to the interpleading to the personal property or the performance of the obligation in controversy and  shall determine the rights  of all parties in interest."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>

Pursuant to this section, the remedy  provided  for  may be  availed of by bringing an "action", for no other meaning may be  deduced from  the phrase "such person  may bring an action against the conflicting claimants" used to indicate the procedure to be followed  by one who would avail himself of its  provisions.  The word  "action" means the ordinary action denned in  section 1 of the  same Code and  should  be  commenced by complaint  which may be demurred to as provided in section 91 and upon the grounds therein  stated.  The pleading  which commences  an ordinary action  cannot be correctly  called an application or petition because these, generally,  are the  pleadings  used only  to commence  special proceedings.   (Sec.  1, Part II, Chapters XXV and XLI1, Code of Civil Procedure.)
      </p><p>

The  action  of interpleader,  under  section  120, is a remedy whereby a person who  has personal property in his possession, or an obligation to render wholly or partially, without  claiming  any right in both,  comes to court and asks that the persons who claim the said personal property or who consider themselves entitled to demand compliance with  the obligation, be  required to litigate among themselves, in order to determine finally who is entitled to one or the other thing.  The remedy is  afforded not to  protect a person against a double liability but to protect him against a double vexation in respect of one liability.  (33 C. J., sec. 21,  p.  438; Crawford <i>vs.</i> Fisher, 1 Hare,  436, 441;  Johnson <i>vs.</i> Blackmon,  201 Ala.,  537; Pfister <i>vs.</i> Wade, 56 Cal.,  43; Rauch <i>vs.</i> Ft. Dearborn  Nat. Bank, 233 111., 507; Gonia <i>vs.</i> O'Brien,  223 Mass.,  177;  McCormick <i>vs.</i> Supreme Council C. B. L., 39 N.  Y. S., 1010.)  When the court orders  that  the claimants litigate among themselves, there arises in reality a new action and the former are styled interpleaders, and  in  such  a case  the pleading which initiates the action is  called a complaint of interpleader and not a cross-complaint.<br>
<br>
From  the foregoing it follows that the court did not err in considering and resolving the demurrers, wherefore, the second assignment of error is  likewise without merit.
</p><p>    

    </p></li><li> The principal question is discussed  by the plaintiffs and by the municipality of San Pedro in  their third assignment of error.  It will be recalled that the court  sustained the demurrers  on the  ground that the complaint of the former does not allege sufficient facts to constitute a right or cause of action.   As  to the Commonwealth of the Philippines, because it cannot be compelled to litigate without its consent, and as to the Colegio de San Jose, Inc., and Carlos  Young, because according to the very allegations  of the complaint  there is no person or entity, outside of the Colegio  de San Jose,  Inc.,  who has conflicting or incompatible claims in connection with the obligation to pay rent or <i>canon</i> which plaintiffs admit devolves upon them. The appellants question  the  correctness  of these conclusions  reached by the court.<br>
      <br>
     
      Speaking of  the intervention of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, there is little to be  said.  The  question raised is already settled in this jurisdiction.  It is a fundamental principle that the Government of the Philippines, now the Commonwealth of the Philippines, as the supreme authority  which  represents in  this country the existing sovereignty, cannot be sued without its consent  (Merritt <i>vs.</i> Government of the Philippine  Islands,  34 Phil.,  311; L. S. Moon &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Burton Harrison, 43 Phil., 27; Compania General de Tabacos <i>vs.</i> Government of the Philippine Islands, 45 Phil., 663; Belarmino <i>vs.</i> Hammond and Director of Public Works, 56  Phil., 462).  The  prohibition holds true both in a case where it is joined as a defendant as well as in that where, as in the present,  it is being compelled to litigate against other persons without its consent.  There is no substantial difference between making it defend itself against its will in a case where it is a defendant and compelling it, without its consent, to interplead in an action commenced by another person.  In one and the other case it is compelled, without its consent, to maintain a suit or litigation, and this is what the legal principle prohibits.<br>
      <br>
      As to the other ground of the court, we have indicated, in summarizing the allegations  of  the complaint,  that the plaintiffs  maintain the view  that  the Commonwealth of the  Philippines  has become  the owner  of  the  Hacienda de San Pedro Tunasan by transfer or conveyance under the Tydings-McDuffie Law and by  way of escheat  upon the death of the daughters of Rodriguez de Figueroa without leaving any heirs.  On the other  hand, they allege  that the Colegio de San Jose, which for the purposes  of this case is  the  same El  Colegio de San  Jose, Inc., who has appeared  and is the  appellee,  likewise claims to be the owner of  the hacienda thereby  enjoying rights of ownership adverse to those of the Commonwealth  of the Philippines.   With the exclusion  of the  Commonwealth of the Philippines, because of its unwillingness to litigate or engage with anyone in  a suit over an hacienda the ownership of which is clearly defined and recognized, it becomes evident that the  action of interpleader is indefensible from any  standpoint for  lack of the basis of reason relied  upon by the plaintiffs in their complaint, namely, that there are two entities, the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the Colegio de  San Jose, contending over  the  hacienda and claiming to be entitled to collect the rent or canon coming therefrom.  We do not include  Carlos Young, because according to his own admissions,  he is a mere lessee of the Colegio de San Jose,  Inc., and does not claim any right of ownership adverse to the latter.<br>
      <br>
      In  reaching this conclusion we have not  lost sight  of the fact that  the  municipality  of San Pedro has already filed its complaint of interpleader wherein it  alleges a certain interest in the hacienda and in its rents; but apart from the fact that  in resolving the demurrers  only the allegations  of the plaintiffs' complaint should be taken into account  (sec. 91, Code of  Civil  Procedure),  because  the former are directed  only against it,  it  appears from the allegations  of said  complaint  of interpleader that  the municipality of San Pedro  also admits that the Commonwealth of the Philippines is the owner of  the hacienda  by transfer and right of  escheat.<br>
      <br>
      Another question raised by the appellants has to do  with the holding of the court  that the complaint of interpleader of the municipality of San Pedro is premature inasmuch as there has been  no  order yet that the defendants litigate among themselves.  In the  opinion of the court it is necessary that there be a declaration to  this effect before the defendants  may litigate  among  themselves and file a complaint of interpleader.   Section 120  of  the  Code of Civil Procedure in truth requires such step and good practice demands that the defendants  be not permitted  to file claims or complaints of  interpleader  until  after the court has ordered that they  should litigate among themselves.   This procedure  will do  away with groundless suits,  and will save the parties time, inconvenience, and  unnecessary expenses.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, it remains to be decided whether, the demurrers having been sustained, the plaintiffs are entitled to amend their  complaint, or whether the case  should  be dismissed. Section 101 of the Code  of Civil Procedure, prescribing the procedure to be followed in cases where a demurrer has been interposed, reads:
      <blockquote>
          <p>"Sec. 101. <i>Proceedings on demurrer</i>.—When a demurrer to any pleading is sustained, the party whose pleading is thus adjudged  defective may  amend his  pleading  within a time to be fixed by the court, with or without terms, as to the court shall seem just; but if the party fails to amend his pleading within the time limited or elects not to amend, the court shall render such judgment upon the subject matter involved in  the pleading and demurrer as the  law and the facts of the case as set forth in the pleadings warrant.   If the demurrer is overruled, the court shall proceed, it  no answer is filed, to render such judgment as the  law and the facts duly  pleaded warrant.  But alter  the overruling  of a demurrer to a complaint, the defendant  may answer within a time to be fixed by general rules  of court; and alter the overruling of a demurrer to an answer the plaintiff may amend his complaint,  if necessary, to meet new facts or counterclaims set forth in the answer."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>

Under this section the amendment of a pleading, after a demurrer is  sustained,  is not an  absolute  right  of  the pleader; the amendment rests rather in the sound  discretion of the court.   Generally when a demurrer is  sustained, the party who  presented the defective pleading is afforded an opportunity to amend it under  conditions which the court may fix; and this should be done  when it appears clearly that the defect is remediable by amendment (Molina <i>vs.</i> La  Electricista, 6 Phil., 519; Serrano <i>vs.</i> Serrano,  9 Phil., 142; Segovia <i>vs.</i> Provincial Board of Albay, 13 Phil., 331;  Balderrama <i>vs.</i> Compania General  de Tabacos, 13 Phil., 609;  Macapinlac <i>vs.</i> Gutierrez  Repide, 43 Phil., 770).   But when it is evident that  the court  has no jurisdiction  over the person and the subject matter, that the pleading is so fatally defective as not  to be susceptible of amendment, or that to permit such amendment would radically alter  the  theory  and the nature of the action, then the court may refuse  the amendment of the  defective pleading and order the dismissal of the case  (49 C. J., sec. 563, pp. 456, 457; San  Joaquin  etc., Canal, etc.,  Co. <i>vs.</i> Stanislaus County, 155 Cal., 21;  Bell <i>vs.</i> California Bank, 153 Cal., 284; Ridgway <i>vs.</i> Bogan, 2 Cal. Unrep. Cas., 718; Schiecnt <i>vs.</i> Schiecnt, 277 P., 1065; Beal <i>vs.</i> United Properties Co., 46 Cal. A., 287; Demartini <i>vs.</i> Marini,  45 Cal. A., 418; Lentz <i>vs.</i> Clough, 39  Cal.  A.,  430; Burki <i>vs.</i> Pleasanton  School Dist., 18  Cal.  A.,  493;  Patterson <i>vs.</i> Steele, 93 Neb., 209; Cox <i>vs.</i> Georgia R., etc. Co., 139 Ga., 532; Peo. <i>vs.</i> McHatton, 7 111., 731; Higgins <i>vs.</i> Gedney, 25 Misc., 248; 55 N. Y. S., 59; Wood <i>vs.</i> Anderson, 25 Pa., 407).  Section 101 authorizing the amendment of a defective pleading should be liberally  construed and the courts, whenever possible, should incline in favor of the  amendment; but when it appears  patent that the pleading is not susceptible of amendment upon the grounds  above  set out, the appellate courts should not hold that the former have abused  their  discretion in  not permitting the  amendment and in dismissing the case.<br>
<br>
In the present case the plaintiffs' complaint is fatally defective because its allegations  are insufficient to constitute a  cause  of  action, and to  permit  the  amendment thereof the plaintiffs would have to change their theory as well as the nature of the action which they have commenced.  For this reason  the court  did  not commit the error assigned in not permitting  the amendment and in finally dismissing the case. </p><p>     
    
    </p></li><li> In their fourth assigned error the appellants contend that the court erred in  sustaining the special appearance of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, in excluding the latter  from the  complaint, in dismissing it with respect thereto, and in striking out from  the record  the reply of the plaintiffs of May 1, 1936, to  the special appearance.<br>
      <br>
      In passing upon the third assignment  of error, we already said  that the Commonwealth of  the Philippines cannot, without its consent,  be compelled to litigate in  this action  of interpleader.  This being so,  the conclusion is inevitable that the court did not err in sustaining the special appearance of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and in ordering the dismissal of the complaint with respect to this party.   As to the striking out of the reply of May 1, 1936, we agree with the court that the step is justified in view of the fact that it is in truth a motion replete with allusions and statements reflecting on the acting Solicitor-General and Assistant Attorneys Quisumbing and Buenaventura, and it seems that it was filed for the sole premeditated purpose of molesting these government officials.<p>
    
    </p></li><li>  In their  fifth assigned  error  the  appellants  assert that  the filing of  the  complaint  of interpleader of the municipality of San Pedro should not have  been declared premature  and, consequently, the Colegio de  San Jose and Carlos Young should have been declared in default.<p>
      In resolving the third assignment of  error  we already expressed the  opinion that, in accordance with section 120 and good practice the court should order that the defendants  litigate among themselves before any  of them may file a complaint  of interpleader.   Applying this rule,  it is evident  that the first part of the assignment of error is without   merit.  With respect  to the  default  of the Colegio de  San Jose and Carlos Young, it suffices to state that  the first  and  El  Colegio  de  San Jose,  Inc., are the same entity and it, as well as Young, interposed demurrers within the  legal period.  For these reasons,  we  hold that the fifth assignment of error is untenable.
    </p><p>
    
    </p></li><li>  We find  no  merit in the sixth  assignment of error impugning  the striking out of pages 14 to 21  of the answer and complaint of interpleader  of the municipality of  San Pedro.  We have  already ruled that the  complaint  of interpleader was prematurely  interposed, at least before the court had  ordered that  the  defendants  litigate  among themselves, and it appears that the pages stricken out form a part of the former, wherefore, the  exclusion or striking out of the said pages was not error.<p>
    
    </p></li><li>        In the seventh and last assignment of error, the appellants contend that the court erred in not overruling the demurrers  and petitions to strike out, and in not suspending the proceedings in this case until the final resolution of the escheat case.<br>
      <br>
      In resolving the third and fourth assignments of error we already had occasion to state that in our opinion the court correctly  sustained the demurrers and  petitions to strike out, and as the appellants advance no new reasons, we do not feel bound to discuss extensively what is restated upon the same  points in the last assigned error.<br>
      <br>
      We  stated at the beginning that  before rendering the appealed  resolution, the municipality of San Pedro asked for the suspension of the  proceedings in this case for the purpose  of first  obtaining final  judgment in  the  other escheat case (Special Proceedings No.  3052) commenced by the same municipality. The denial of  the suspension is the  object of the second part of the last  assigned error. In view of the result reached  in deciding the whole case, we hold  that the said denial is not  error.  Moreover, there was no good reason to suspend the proceedings and to put off the resolution or  decision, when at any rate the same result would be reached, and this is the more  convincing in view of the decision rendered by this court  in the aforesaid escheat case (G. R. No. 45460, Feb. 25, 1938). At all events, the appellants  do not cite the  violation  of any law,  and the  suspension of the proceedings rests entirely in a sound judicial discretion, a discretion which the court exercised adversely to the municipality of San Pedro.</li>

  <p>    For all the reasons stated  herein, the appealed resolution is affirmed, with the  costs of this instance against all the appellants.  So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Avanceña, C. J., Villa-Real,  Abad Santos, Diaz, Laurel</i>, and <i>Concepcion, JJ</i>., concur. </p>
