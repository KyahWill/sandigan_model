				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT OP THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JOSE VACA Y GARRIDO AND ANA CALDERON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants, Jose Vaca y Garrido and Ana
Calderon, appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of First
Instance of Cavite, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p> "In view of all the foregoing, judgment is rendered:</p>
  <p> "On the first cause of action:</p>
  <p> "(<em>a</em>)
The defendants are ordered to pay to the plaintiff the total amount of
P46,693.39 plus the interest on the capital of P38,000 at 9 per cent
per annum computed semiannually from April 30, 1935, until fully paid,
together with compound interest at 9 per cent per annum on all
semi-annual interest xiue and unpaid from said date until fully paid;</p>
  <p> "(<em>b</em>)
The said defendants are likewise ordered to pay interest at 9 per cent
per annum on the total amount of 52,065.45, the insurance premiums and
land taxes advanced by the Philippine Postal Savings Bank on the
mortgaged properties, from April 30, 1935, until fully paid, and</p>
  <p> " (<em>c</em>) Likewise to pay the sum of P1,000 as costs, expenses and attorney's fees.<br>
      <br>
"On the second cause of action:</p>
  <p> " (<em>a</em>)
The defendants are ordered to pay to the plaintiff the total amount of
P3,024.63 plus the interest on the capital of P2,500 at 9 per cent per
annum computed semiannually from April 30,1935, until fully paid,
together with compound interest at 9 per cent per annum on all
semiannual interest due and unpaid from said date until fully paid;</p>
  <p> "(<em>b</em>) Likewise to pay the sum of P125 as costs, expenses and attorney's fees, and</p>
  <p> "(<em>c</em>)
Finally, said defendants are likewise ordered to pay to the plaintiff
any amount it might pay after April 29, 1935, as land taxes and
insurance premiums or expenses for the repair of the mortgaged
properties, plus interest at 9 per cent per annum on said sums, until
fully paid.<br>
      <br>
"The defendants shall pay to the plaintiff all the sums adjudicated to
the latter by virtue of this decision, within the period of 120 days
from the date this decision becomes final, otherwise the mortgaged
properties shall be sold in order to satisfy to the plaintiff, with the
proceeds thereof, all the sums to which it is entitled by virtue of
this decision. So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In support of their appeal, the appellants assign two alleged
errors as committed by the court a quo in its decision in question, to
wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "1. The lower court has fallen into error in
rendering judgment against defendants for the amount represented by 9
per cent per annum on semi-annual interest due and unpaid of the
capital loans of P38,000 and P2,500; and in sentencing defendants to
pay further the sum of P1,125 as attorney's fees.</p>
  <p> "2. The
lower court also has committed an error in not granting the defendants'
motion for a new trial based on statutory grounds."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The first question to be decided in the present appeal, which is
raised in the first assignment of alleged error, is whether or not the
court a quo erred in ordering the defendants to pay interest at 9 per
cent per annum on the semi-annual interest due and unpaid on the loans
of P38,000 and P2,500, respectively.</p>
<p> The appellants claim that the interest of 9 per cent per annum on
the semi-annual interest due and unpaid on the loans of P38,000 and
P2,500 is usurious.</p>
<p> The legal question herein raised has already been decided by this"
court in the case of the Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Conde (61 Phil., 714), which states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "It is well settled in this jurisdiction that when
there is an express agreement to charge interest on interest, such fact
should not be taken into consideration in determining whether or not
the stipulated interest exceeds the limit prescribed by the Usury Law.
(Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Schenkel and Gonzales, 43 Phil., 616; Villaruel <em>vs.</em> Alvayda and Vicencio, 46 Phil., 277; Valdezco <em>vs.</em> Francisco, 52 Phil., 350)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The appellants likewise maintain that the sums of P1,000 and P125,
stipulated as penalties for costs, collection expenses and attorney's
fees, are excessive and should be taken into consideration in
determining whether or not the Usury Law has been violated. This
question has likewise been decided by this court in the case of the
Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Macanaya (G., R. No. 40333 [60 Phil., 1049]), wherein this court stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The errors assigned will have to be sustained. In
the second paragraph of the note and in the mortgage contract, the
defendant agreed in case of nonpayment on demand to pay to the Postal
Savings Bank the sum of P1,000 in full, without any deduction, as and
for costs, expenses, and attorney's fees for collection whether
actually incurred or not. In other words, the defendant bound himself
to pay said amount regardless of the fact of whether it was actually
spent for attorney's fees or not. So whether the plaintiff was
represented by the provincial fiscal was not important, for this
official was in the service of the Government of the Philippine Islands
and was paid by it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the case of the Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Lim (61 Phil, 737), this court likewise stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In the promissory notes executed by the defendants
and incorporated in the mortgage deeds, they voluntarily undertook to
pay the sum of P1,300 as court costs, expenses of collection, and
attorney's fees, whether incurred or not. This. stipulation is a valid
and permissible penal clause, not contrary to any law, morals, or
public order, and is, therefore, strictly binding upon the defendants.
(Arts. 1091, 1152, and 1258, Civil Code; Lambert <em>vs.</em> Fox, 26 Phil., 588; Bachrach <em>vs.</em> Golingco, 39 Phil., 138; Compania General de Tabacos <em>vs.</em> Jalandoni, 50 Phil., 501; Bachrach Motor Co. <em>vs.</em> Espiritu, 52 Phil., 346; Manila Building and Loan Association <em>vs.</em>
Green, 54 Phil., 507.) It is neither excessive nor exorbitant, and the
defendants have not made any payment upon their principal obligations,
wherefore, the discretion conferred by article 1154 of the Civil Code
may not be exercised to reduce the penalty."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the light of the rulings above-cited, this court finds no merit in the foregoing assignments of error.</p>
<p> With respect to the costs, inasmuch as they are included in the
penalties of P1,000 and P125, respectively, stipulated by the parties
in the two mortgage contracts, the plaintiff's petition relative
thereto should not be granted (Garcia <em>vs.</em> Lim Chu Sing, 59 Phil., 562; Bank of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Yulo, 31 Phil., 476).</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing, and finding the appealed judgment in
accordance with the law, it is affirmed in toto, without special
pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, and Conception, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
