imprisoned for ten years and one day of<em> presidio mayor</em>, with the 
accessories prescribed by law, to indemnify Casimiro Abria jointly and severally 
in the sum of P10, and to- pay the costs.</p>
<p>The defendants are charged with the crime of arson committed, according to 
the complaint, as follows: "That on or about midnight of the 4th of May, 1923, 
in the sitio of Capipian, barrio of Lope de Vega, municipality of Catarman, 
Province of Samar, Philippine Islands, and within the jurisdiction of this 
court, the above named defendants with premeditation and confederating together, 
provided themselves with dynamite or other explosive substance, and did 
willfully, unlawfully and criminally place it and cause the same to explode on 
the door of the house inhabited by Casimiro Abria and his family, which dynamite 
or explosive substance exploded and burnt the ceiling of said house; as a result 
of which a part of said house was destroyed, the damage caused not exceeding 
6,250 <em>pesetas</em>.</p>
<p>"Contrary to law."</p>
<p>The appellants pray for the reversal of the judgment appealed from, while the 
Attorney-General prays for the modification thereof in the sense that the 
penalty of from four months and twenty-one days to six months of <em>arresto 
mayor</em> be imposed upon the defendants, under the provision of article 557, 
paragraph 1, of the Penal Code. After a careful study of the record, we are of 
the opinion, and so hold, that the guilt of the defendants does not appear duly 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt, as is required for the imposition of the 
penalty fixed by the law.</p>
<p>There is in the record no direct evidence of the commission of the crime by 
the defendants. None of the witnesses has seen the dynamite which, it is said, 
they caused to explode in the house of the offended Casimiro Abria. Indeed the 
Attorney-General says in his brief: "It is true that none of the witnesses for 
the prosecution has seen the defendants Felipe Dino and Fortunato Lauristo on 
the night of May 4, 1923, at the act of firing the dynamite that set fire to the 
ceiling of the house of Casimiro Abria and unnailed several boards from its 
wall, but the circumstances of record in this case are so clear and conclusive 
that no other conclusion is possible than that the herein appellants Felipe Dino 
and Fortunato Lauristo were the authors of the explosion that caused a part of 
the ceiling of the house of Casimiro Abria to burn."</p>
<p>What are these circumstances? They are made to consist in the facts testified 
to by Andres Borca and Enrique Horogon.</p>
<p>The witness Andres Borca says that about the month of February, 1923, the 
accused Felipe Dino proposed to him to cause a dynamite to explode in the house 
of Casimiro Abria, telling him, "Andres there is a dynamite here; fire it in the 
house of Casimiro Abria," which the witness refused to do, because he did not 
know how to fire a dynamite. This seems to indicate the guilt of the accused 
Felipe Dino; but if it is considered that the testimony of the witness Borca is 
not corroborated in any manner and is denied by the accused Felipe Dino, and 
that Borca has not seen any dynamite or other explosive substance in Felipe's 
possession, it cannot be said in reason that his testimony constitutes a strong 
and conclusive evidence of the guilt of the accused Felipe Dino.</p>
<p>The witness Enrique Horogon says that he was invited by Gabriel Dino on the 
night of the 4th of May, 1923, to go out fishing on a boat. This witness says, 
further, that upon their arrival at the place known as Iraya of the barrio of 
Lope de Vega his companions left them on the boat; that then he heard an 
explosion and a little later the accused came back in a hurry to the boat and in 
their return Felipe Dino warned him not to reveal to anybody that he (Felipe 
Dino) had ordered the accused Lauristo to fire a dynamite in the house of 
Casimiro Abria.</p>
<p>But is it true that Horogon was invited by Gabriel Dino on the night in 
question to go out on a boat with the defendants up to the place known as Iraya? 
The record does not disclose any confirmation of the testimony of Horogon; on 
the contrary it is denied by the Dino defendants and the circumstances of the 
voyage on the boat and of the warning that Horogon puts in the mouth of Felipe 
make it completely incredible. If after all, Horogon had no part to perform in 
connection with the supposed igniting of the dynamite, what necessity did the 
accused have to take him on the boat? If Horogon, at any rate, did not know 
where the defendants went after they had left him on the boat, nor did he see 
Lauristo fire the dynamite in the house of Abria, what necessity did Felipe have 
to caution him not to tell anything about what they (the defendants) had done? 
By instinct the criminal avoids the presence of witnesses who may denounce the 
commission of the crime; and the case now related by the witness Horogon is so 
rare that without a strong corroboration, as is the case here, we cannot believe 
it. And upon this ground, the case must be dismissed as to the defendant Gabriel 
Dino.</p>
<p>The fact itself of the explosion of the dynamite related by the offended 
Abria is not free from doubt. According to this witness, at about midnight of 
May 4, 1923, while he was sleeping in company with eight persons in his house 
situated in the sitio of Capipian, barrio of Lope de Vega, municipality of 
Catarman, Province of Samar, he was awakened by a strong explosion, which he 
supposed had burst out in his house; he immediately stood up, and went to the 
place where he believed the explosion had taken place, and found a part of the 
wall that was contiguous to the door destroyed, and the ceiling of thethouse 
burning; he called his servant and both of them succeeded in putting out the 
fire. As a result of said explosion, the hemp fiber baled and deposited behind 
the main door of the house was scattered and a part of the ceiling, which was of 
<em>anahaw</em>, burnt, thus presenting a hole which was one foot in diameter, 
four boards having been unnailed and a hole made on the wooden floor. On the 
next day he reported the matter to the municipal president of Catarman who 
repaired to the place of the event and saw that the damage caused by the 
explosion would amount to P10.</p>
<p>According to the testimnoy of the witness Abria the explosion seems to have 
taken place on the exterior part of his house near the main door, destroying the 
wall contiguous to the door through which it entered scattering the hemp fiber 
which was baled and deposited behind said door, and unnailing four boards of the 
wall; but such a hypothesis cannot be reconciled with the fact of an opening one 
foot in diameter having been made on the wooden floor of the house, and another 
of equal size on the ceiling of anahaw, unless it is granted that the explosion 
was so strong that a part of the explosive was thrown against the unnailed 
boards, another part against the floor, making an opening thereon, and still 
another against the ceiling. But then it cannot be explained how the eight 
persons who were sleeping in the same room, which contained an area of only 
about 12 square brazas and formed one single compartment, did not suffer the 
slightest injury.</p>
<p>Without the necessity of expounding other hypotheses which may be drawn from 
the testimony of Abria, and taking into account that the same witnesses, Borca 
and Horogon, have not seen any dynamite in possession of the defendants, or in 
the house of Felipe Dino, or in the boat on the night in question, we conclude 
that if the circumstances stated by said witnesses indicate anything, they are 
not so convincing or conclusive as to establish the guilt of the defendants 
beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>According to Rule 52 of the Provisional Law for the Application of the 
Provisions of the Penal Code, in order that a conviction may be sustained upon 
circumstantial evidence alone, it is necessary, first, that the circumstances be 
more than one; second, that the facts upon which they are based be proven; and 
third, that, taken together, they convince the mind in such a manner as not to 
leave any room for reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused in the 
natural and ordinary course of things. And this is substantially the same rule 
established by the jurisprudence of this court. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Perez, 2 
Phil., 171; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Douglass, 2 Phil., 461; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Reyes, 
3 Phil., 3; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Villos, 6 Phil., 510.)</p>
<p>For all of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and 
the appellants Felipe Dino and Fortunato Lauristo be, as they are hereby, 
acquitted with the costs de oficio. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Malcolm, AvanceÃ±a, Ostrand,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
