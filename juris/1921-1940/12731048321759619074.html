				<H3>MANUEL RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original petition for habeas corpus filed by prisoner Manuel 
Rodriguez, praying that after proper proceedings an order be issued requiring 
the respondent Director of Prisons to immediately set him at liberty, on the 
ground that he is illegally detained, inasmuch as he has already served the 
penalty corresponding to his offence under the provisions of the Revised Penal 
Code.
<p>The pertinent facts necessary for a solution of the question raised in the 
present petition are as follows:</p>
<p>Upon arraignment for the crime of <em>estafa</em> in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, the petitioner spontaneously pleaded guilty, whereupon the 
trial court rendered a judgment of conviction, and there being no circumstance 
to modify his criminal liability, imposed upon him the minimum of the medium 
degree of the penalty of <em>presidio correccional</em> in its minimum and 
medium degrees, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3, article 534 of 
the old Penal Code, that its, one year, eight months, and twenty-one days of 
presidio correctional, to pay an indemnity of P647.70, and to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency.<br><br>The first question to decide here is 
whether or not the provisions of the Revised Penal Code with reference to the 
crime of estafa, of which the petitioner was convicted, are more favorable to 
him than those of the old Penal Code.</p>
<p>The penalty of one year, eight months, and twenty-one days imposed upon said 
petitioner by the trial court is the minimum of the medium degree of the penalty 
of <em>presidio correccional</em> in its minimum and medium degrees, ranging 
from six months and one day to four years and two months, as provided in article 
534, paragraph 3, of the old Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3244. The penalty 
provided in the Revised Penal Code, article 315, paragraph 3, for the same 
offence is <em>arresto mayor</em> in the maximum degree to <em>prision 
correccional</em> in the minimum degree, that is, from four months and one day 
to two years and four months, of which the medium degree is from one year and 
one day to one year and eight months, which is more lenient and hence more 
favorable to the petitioner than the same degree of the penalty imposed by 
article 534, paragraph 3, of the former Penal Code cited above.<br><br>Article 
22 of the Revised Penal Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 22. Retroactive effect of penal laws.—Penal laws shall have a 
retroactive effect in so far as they favor the person guilty of a felony, who is 
not a habitual criminal, as this term is defined in rule 5 of article ,62 of 
this Code, although at the time of the publication of such laws a final sentence 
has been pronounced and the convict is serving the same."</p></blockquote>
<p>As the provisions of the aforementioned Revised Penal Code with reference to 
the crime of <em>estafa</em> here in question are more favorable to the said 
petitioner, and as the latter is not an habitual criminal, the more lenient 
penalty provided in the Revised Penal Code must be imposed upon him.</p>
<p>The second question to decide is whether or not in habeas corpus proceedings 
the mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt established for the 
first time in article 13, paragraph 7, of the Revised Penal Code, can be taken 
into consideration.</p>
<p>The mitigating circumstances, as their name indicates, serve to lessen the 
penalty fixed by law, and whenever they are present courts are bound to take 
them into consideration, according to article 77, in connection with article 80, 
paragraph 3, of the old Penal Code, and article 62, in connection with article 
64, paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>In the present case, the trial court could not legally take into account the 
mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt, established in article 
13, paragraph 7, of the new Penal Code, because it did not exist in the old 
Penal Code under which the petitioner herein was prosecuted and sentenced.</p>
<p>Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code, above quoted, extends its benefits even 
to convicts serving sentence, and the only legal remedy open to them to make use 
of such benefits is the writ of habeas corpus, inasmuch as, if the penalty 
imposed upon them under the former penal law was decreased by the revised code, 
and the latter has retroactive effect, the excess has become illegal. Now then, 
it appearing from the sentence that there was a voluntary confession of guilt, 
and that it has served as the basis of conviction, and taking into consideration 
that had such circumstance been classified by the old Penal Code as a mitigating 
circumstance, the trial court would have been bound to give it effect, could we 
now disregard it without failing in our duty in order to give effect to the 
positive provisions of the law which make all penal laws retroactive in so far 
as they favor the accused, who is not an habitual criminal, there being no 
necessity to review the proceeding? In the case before us, the voluntary 
confession of guilt appears in the sentence and has served as the basis of the 
defendant's conviction by the trial court; for which reason we must take it into 
account, in order to give retroactive effect to article 22, cited above, of the 
Revised Penal Code for the benefit of the petitioner herein.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the aforesaid petitioner was sentenced to one year, eight 
months, and twenty-one days of presidio correccional, to pay an indemnity of 
P647.70, and to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, which is 
the minimum of the medium degree (from one year, eight months, and twenty-one 
days to two years, eleven months, and ten days) of the penalty of <em>presidio 
correccional </em>in the minimum and medium degrees (from six months and one day 
to four years and two months), prescribed by article 534, paragraph 3, of the 
old Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3244. The penalty provided in article 315, 
paragraph 3, of the Revised Penal Code for the same crime is arresto mayor in 
the maximum degree to <em>prision correccional</em> in the minimum degree, that 
is, four months and one day to two years and four months, which is more lenient 
than that provided in the old Penal Code. Taking into account the mitigating 
circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt, without any aggravating 
circumstance to offset it, the penalty provided in the Revised Penal Code must 
be imposed in the minimum degree, that is, four months and one day to one year 
(article 80, paragraph 2, of the old Penal Code, and article 64 of the Revised 
Penal Code), and inasmuch as it is the practice of Courts of First Instance in 
the exercise of their discretion (article 81, paragraph 7, as amended by section 
1 of Act No. 2298) to fix the penalty in the minimum period, and the trial court 
having fixed the penalty imposed upon the petitioner in the minimum period of 
the medium degree, we must also fix it accordingly, that is, four months and one 
day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, which is the minimum period of the minimum degree 
of the penalty provided by the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>The herein petitioner having already served seven months and twenty-nine days 
of imprisonment, as against the penalty of four months and twenty-one days, with 
all possible allowances, in accordance with the Revised Penal Code, he has 
already more than served his sentence and is entitled to be released 
immediately.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, we are of opinion and hold that when in a 
sentence of conviction it appears that the defendant voluntarily confessed his 
guilt in court before the prosecution has presented its evidence, such voluntary 
confession shall be taken into account in a petition for habeas corpus to give 
effect to article 22 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the herein petitioner being illegally detained, the petition is 
granted and the respondent Director of Prisons is hereby ordered to set him at 
liberty immediately, without special pronouncement of costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña, C. J., Villamor, Abad Santos, Imperial,</em> and <em>Butte, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><br>MALCOLM, J., with whom concur STREET, OSTRAND, HULL, and VICKERS, JJ., 
<em>dissenting:</em><br><br><br>We stand squarely on the proposition that, after 
a court having jurisdiction of a criminal case has rendered a final judgment in 
that case and the convict has begun to serve his sentence in conformity with 
that judgment, the courts can not, in habeas corpus proceedings, enter upon a 
review of the decision or record to determine if a mitigating circumstance 
should be taken into account in order to obtain a reduction of the penalty and 
the liberation of the convict. Habeas corpus lies only to determine the question 
of the jurisdiction and lawful power of the custodian to hold the petitioner in 
custody, and is not available as a revisory remedy for the correction of errors 
either of law or fact. (29 C. J., 25; Trono Felipe <em>vs.</em> Director of 
Prisons [1913], 24 Phil., 121.) The Revised Penal Code provides that felonies 
and misdemeanors committed prior to the date of effectiveness of this Code shall 
be punished in accordance with the code or acts in force at the time of their 
commission, while retroactive effect may only be given to the Revised Penal Code 
for the benefit of the person guilty of a felony who is not a habitual criminal 
to determine the proper penalty as found under the old Penal Code and to 
contrast with it the penalty corresponding to the crime under the Revised Penal 
Code. But if the courts are to scrutinize the decision and the record to 
ascertain if mitigating circumstances now found for the first time in the 
Revised Penal Code are to be given effect, the courts will embark upon 
unchartered seas and unutterable confusion will result. We believe that the 
court should not now revise a final judgment by inserting in that judgment a 
finding relating to a mitigating circumstance, thus permitting the liberation of 
the accused. As a consequence, our vote is for the denial of the writ.</p>
