				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On April 8, 1930, the defendant presented himself at the complainant Francisco Barredo's barber shop, situated at No. 1950 Rizal Avenue, Manila, in search of employment. Barredo answered that he could not take him because the only job for an assistant was filled.&nbsp; As it was meal&nbsp; time he invited the accused to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter answered&nbsp; that he had already eaten, and offered to watch the barber shop. When&nbsp; Barredo returned after&nbsp; eating,&nbsp; he found that the defendant had gone, and with him an electric fan and some scissors that were in the barber shop.<br><br>He then set about inquiring of his neighbors the where-abouts of that man, and Toribio&nbsp; Rivera and Luis Pablo informed him that they had seen a man carrying an electric fan, leave the barber shop and get into a carromata.&nbsp; Barredo reported the matter to the police,&nbsp; and after some search, the electric fan was found in the "Palace Barber Shop"&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to one Pedro&nbsp; Bunac,&nbsp; who&nbsp; said he&nbsp; had bought it of the defendant&nbsp; for P20.&nbsp;&nbsp; A brother&nbsp; of the accused later took the scissors to the complainant's home. The electric fan and the scissors were worth P84.<br><br>The defendant had previously been convicted six times of theft by competent court, the last conviction having taken place on April 6,&nbsp; 1926.<br><br>In view of the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; set forth above, the defendant&nbsp; was accused of the crime of theft before the municipal court, convicted and sentenced to suffer four years, two months, and one day&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>, to return the stolen goods to the owner, and to defray the costs.&nbsp; The court also imposed upon him the additional penalty of twenty-one years for being an habitual offender.<br><br>The&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; appealed to the Court of First Instance and the latter also found him guilty of the crime charged in the information, and sentenced him to suffer four months and one day of <i>arresto mayor</i>, the accessories of law and the costs, besides an additional penalty of&nbsp; sixteen years in accordance with subsection (c) of Act No. 3586.&nbsp; The court also ordered him&nbsp; to return the&nbsp; stolen goods to the&nbsp; owner.<br><br>From this&nbsp; judgment also the defendant appealed,&nbsp; contending that the lower court erred in finding that he&nbsp; had already been previously convicted four times,&nbsp; and in imposing upon him the penalty of sixteen years imprisonment.<br><br>The evidence shows&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.&nbsp; That he had been previously convicted six times of theft is also shown by Exhibit G, of the record, which is the defendant's criminal record&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila police department.<br><br>In view of the evidence of record, the court below sentenced the accused to the penalty of four months and one day of&nbsp; <i>arresto&nbsp; mayor</i>, and&nbsp; sixteen years'&nbsp; additional imprisonment.&nbsp; We hold that the court below erred in both penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; above&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; the&nbsp; information charged the accused with the theft of goods valued at P84.&nbsp; The case, therefore, falls under article&nbsp; 518, case 4 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3244; but in view of the; recidivism, the defendant must be punished in accordance with article 520, No. 3,&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; which prescribes the penalty next higher&nbsp; in degree to that of&nbsp; article 518, case 4 of the Code, or four years, two months, and one day of <i>prision, correctional</i>,&nbsp; with the accessories of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is not a bar to this conclusion that the defendant, being an habitual criminal, is also to be punished with the additional penalty assigned by the law, for in People vs. Aguinaldo (47 Phil., 728), the rule was laid down&nbsp; that:<br><blockquote>"The penalties provided&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; for the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; theft or robbery&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; case may be,&nbsp; must first be applied without reference to&nbsp; the Habitual&nbsp; Delinquency Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; A determination of the penalty is arrived at independently of the provisions of the Habitual Delinquency Law even to&nbsp; the extent of considering recidivism either as a qualifying or an aggravating circumstance.&nbsp; Then to this penalty is added an additional penalty of one-half of the penalty imposed as provided by the Habitual Delinquency Law."</blockquote>The court below also erred in imposing the additional penalty of sixteen&nbsp; years, for, under&nbsp; Act No. 3397,&nbsp; subsection (d),&nbsp; as amended by&nbsp; Act No. 3586, the defendant must serve twenty-one&nbsp; years' imprisonment, by way&nbsp; of additional penalty.<br><br>With&nbsp; these modifications, the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from must be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Johnson,&nbsp; Street,&nbsp; Malcolm,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
