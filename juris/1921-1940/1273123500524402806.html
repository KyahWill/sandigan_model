				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, widower and executor of the  joint  last will and testament  of Victoriana  Saavedra and himself, presented said will for probate, which was ordered by the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga  in its decree of February 21, 1924.<br><br>This executor submitted a  scheme of partition and distribution of the property in  accordance with the terms of the  joint will, to which Juan Saavedra  and others filed an opposition. The executor rejoined insisting upon the approval  of the scheme and asking that the opposition of Juan Saavedra and others be overruled.<br><br>On March 25, 1926, the parties submitted a statement of facts, which reads  as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"1. That Victoriana Saavedra died in the municipality and Province of Zamboanga, P. I., without descendants or ascendants, being at  that time married to Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, both of them having executed a joint will, which joint will has been duly admitted to probate in this court.<br><br>"2. That  the only near relations of the said Victoriana Saavedra, with the right to inherit her estate are her brothers Juan and Segundo Saavedra; her nephews and nieces, Teofilo  Saavedra, Manuel  Saavedra, Victoriana Saavedra, Mariano Saavedra,  Froilan Saavedra, Josefa Saavedra, Encarnacion Carpio and Macra Carpio, in case that the said Victoriana Saavedra  died intestate, or did not dispose  of her property in said  will.<br><br>"3. That  aside from the estate  mentioned in the said last will and  testament,  duly probated by this Honorable Court, there  exists another parcel of land,  acquired by Ong Ham the year  1920,  by purchase  from Ong Tah, and  adjudicated to the said Ong Ham in  <i>Expediente</i> No. 6  (Cadastral).<br><br>"Lot No. 3057,  with the improvements thereon in  favor of the persons named below in the following proportions: Ong Ham, aged 65  years, married  to Victoriana Saavedra, 19/20 parts; Crispulo  Macoto Cruz, of legal age, 1/40 part; and Juan Mocoto, 1/40 part.<br><br>"4. That the interested  parties in this proceeding  herewith submit to this Honorable Court the rights of the respective parties in this estate, in accordance with the terms of this joint last  will and  testament of the spouses, Macario  Macrohon Ong  Ham, and of Victoriana Saavedra, deceased.<br><br>"5. That the  parties  representing  Macario  Macrohon Ong Ham admit that he sold lots Nos. 34 and 35, of <i>Expediente</i> No. 8196, for the  sum of P1,900, believing in  good faith that he could sell the same for his personal uses.<br><br>"6. That the party representing Juan Saavedra, and the other relations heretofore named hereby  withdraw  their opposition which they have presented to the final account of the surviving spouse, Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, and conform to the same, and ask that the Court approve the said final account."<br></blockquote><br>The will referred to in the statement of facts above quoted reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That we, Macario Macrohon Ong Ham and Victoriana Saavedra, both  residing at  San Roque, municipality and Province of Zamboanga, Philippine  Islands, and both of about 70 years of age, realizing that we  have  but a few more years to live, and each of us being in the full enjoyment of his intellectual faculties and not acting  by virtue of threats, force or undue influence,  individually and conjointly do hereby make public, declare, and execute this, our last will and testament, in the following terms:<br><br>"We hereby declare that we are husband and wife; that we have had no issue, nor have we  adopted children.<br><br>"We hereby likewise declare that Macario Macrohon Ong Ham is a native of China, having resided in Zamboanga, Philippine Islands for over 40 years, and that Victoriana Saavedra is a native of the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"We  furthermore  declare that Macario Macrohon Ong Ham has two nephews at present residing in Zamboanga, Philippine Islands, whom he has always treated as his own sons, following the custom of Amoy, China, whose names and ages are respectively as  follows:<br><br>"Ong  Ka Chiew,  residing  at San Roque, Zamboanga, P.

Arquiza, do  hereby certify that the  foregoing document consisting  of five (5) sheets  including the present, was  on the date  above-mentioned,  signed  by the  testators  Macario Macrohon Ong Ham and Victoriana Saavedra on all its sheets,  in our presence at their request, in their  presence, and in the presence of each other we have signed our names as witnesses on all the sheets of said will."</blockquote><br>The  lower court  solving  the  question  raised  by the parties  in their  agreement  of facts, held  that one-half of the property  described in the will, all of lot No. 3057, cadastral  case No. 6; one-half  of the cash balance of the final account to  be rendered by the  executor, and half of the proceeds of the sale of lots Nos. 34 and 35 of Proceeding No. 8196, belong to  Macario Macrohon Ong Ham; and as it appears from  the will quoted, as well as from the agreement dated March 25,  1926, that Victoriana Saave dra  left no legitimate  ascendants or descendants  at the time of her death, Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, her widower, is, according to the provisions of article  837 of the Civil Code, entitled to the  usufruct of one-half  of the estate of the said Victoriana Saavedra, consisting of one-half of  the  property described  in  the will, excluding lots Nos. 817 and 768 of proceeding No. 7880,  given to Segunda Saavedra with the consent of Macario Macrohon Ong Ham; of one-half  of the cash  balance of the executor's final account, and of half of the proceeds of the sale of lots Nos. 34 and 35 in proceeding  No. 8196, and said estate is adjudicated as follows: one-half of the same belongs in  usufruct to the widower Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, and the naked ownership of this half as well as the full ownership of the other half is adjudicated to Victoriana  Saavedra's  heirs, named in the said agreement dated March 25, 1926, in the following manner: sixteenths  of the naked ownership of the one-half in usufruct and sixteenths of the other half in full ownership, to Juan Saavedra; sixteenths of the naked ownership of the one-half in usufruct and sixteenths of the other half in full ownership, to Segunda Saavedra;  and, sixteenths of the naked ownership  of the one-half in  usufruct and sixteenths of the other half in full ownership to Teofilo Saavedra, Manuela Saavedra, Victoriana Saavedra, Mariano Saavedra, Froilan Saavedra and Josefa Saavedra, children of Mateo Saavedra, deceased brother of Victoriana Saavedra, in equal parts;  and  to Encarnacion  Carpio  and Macra Carpio, daughters  of Petrona Saavedra, deceased sister  of  Victoriana  Saavedra, sixteenths of the  naked ownership of the one-half in usufruct and sixteenths of the other half in full ownership, in equal parts.<br><br><blockquote>"As regards lots Nos.  817  and  768  of proceeding  No. 7880, given to Segunda  Saavedra,  the  court  adjudicates the same to the said Segunda Saavedra,  in accordance with the clauses on lines 99-111 of the will.<br><br>"Finally, the court orders that the executor, after paying the inheritance tax, distribute among Victoriana Saavedra's heirs named in the agreement of March 25, 1926, the part belonging  to each  of them as hereinabove stated, and after this  delivery is made and the inheritance  tax, if any,  is paid, this  proceeding is to be considered closed <i>ipso facto</i>."</blockquote><br>Counsel for the executor appealed from this decision and assigns in his brief the  following  alleged errors as committed by the lower court:<br><br><blockquote>"I.  In holding in its <i>auto</i>, of November 26, 1926,  that the deceased, Victoriana Saavedra, died  partially intestate, and did not dispose  of all her1 property by  the joint last  will  and  testament  executed  by  herself  and  her husband,  Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, and in  not finding that under the terms of the aforesaid joint will the legatees, Ong Ka  Chiew and Ong Ka Jian, named therein, were  entitled  to  receive her estate and  participation  in the sixteen parcels of land devised under the said joint will, by the said spouses.<br><br>"II.  In holding that the brother  and the sister of Victoriana Saavedra, by name, Juan Saavedra and  Segunda Saavedra, and  her nephews and  nieces, by name, Teofilo Saavedra, Manuela Saavedra,  Victoriano  Saavedra, Mariano  Saavedra, Froilan Saavedra, Josefa Saavedra, Encarnaeion Carpio  and Macra Carpio, her next of  kin were entitled to receive any part of her estate and participation in the said sixteen parcels of land, devised to the  above named legatees, Ong Ka Chiew and Ong Ka  Jian,  under the terms of the said joint last  will and testament."</blockquote><br>The parts of the will pertinent to  the questions raised by the appellant are:<br><br><blockquote>"We  do agree  jointly and individually  that our properties  above  described  be disposed of in the following manner:<br><br>"In  case of the death of Macario Macrohon Ong Ham before  Victoriana Saavedra, we hereby  order  that the properties hereinafter described be given to Ong Ka Chiew and Ong Ka Jian jointly, and should either of the two die before Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, we order that all the said properties be given to the survivor, which properties are described as follows:<br><br>"(Here.follows  a description of  16  of the 19  lots that are also described in the will as conjugal property of the testator  and testatrix.)<br><br>"In  case that Victoriana  Saavedra should survive Macario  Macrohon Ong  Ham,  the lands  and properties described  below  shall belong  exclusively  to Victoriana Saavedra, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Lot No.  838-A, proceeding 7880, certificate 1257<br>Lot No.  817, proceeding  7880, certificate 1247<br>Lot No.  768, proceeding 7880, certificate 1105</blockquote><br>"Should Victoriana Saavedra die before Macario Macrohon Ong Ham, we order that lot No. 817-A, proceeding No. 7880, certificate No. 1247, be adjudicated to  Segunda Sa- avedra, widow, sister  of  Victoriana Saavedra, free of all liens and encumbrances.<br><br>"We also order that lot No. 768, proceedings No. 7880, certificate No. 1105, be adjudicated to Segunda  Saavedra and  her  heirs,  on condition that she  devote the products of the same to having masses said for the repose of the soul  of Victoriana  Saavedra.<br><br>"In case of the death of either of us, we order that the surviving spouse be appointed executor of this our last will and  testament."</blockquote><br>Appellant  alleges  that  the  trial  court  erred in holding that Victoriana  Saavedra died partly intestate. Article 658 of the Civil Code  provides:<br><br><blockquote>"ART.  658. Succession  is effected either by the  will of man expressed by testament or, in  the absence of a testament, by operation of law.<br><br>"The first is called  testamentary, the second legal  succession.<br><br>"It may also be effected partly by  the  will of man and partly by operation  of law."</blockquote><br>According to this, there  are three ways in which  succession may be effected: by the will of man, by the law, or by both at the same time.  In the first case the succession is called  testamentary, because it is based on the last will and testament,  which  is the orderly  manifestation of the testator's will;  in the  second, it is  called legal, because it takes effect  by  operation of the  law; and the third is called mixed, because it partakes of the character of both testamentary and legal succession.<br><br>Commenting  on the thir.d mode  of effecting succession, Mr. Manresa says: "The  rule of indivisibility and incompatibility was transferred to  our laws from pure Romanism,  and it remained in them  until  the XV Century, when the law of the Ordenamiento previously cited repealed the maxim nemo pro parte testatus pro parte intestatus decedere potest.  This  same repeal is  confirmed in paragraph 3 of the article under consideration (658), which prescribes that it may also be effected partly by the will of man and partly by operation of law,  and  in articles 764 and 912 above cited  which  call the legal heirs to the enjoyment of the part of  the inheritance not disposed of by the testator in his will."  (Vol. 5, 1921 ed., pp. 326, 327.)<br><br>This is a  refutation of the  appellant's argument that no one who has executed a will can die partly intestate. That the rule  of  indivisibility  of the testator's will invoked by the appellant does not hold  good in this  jurisdiction, is shown,  moreover,  by articles 764  and  912 of the  Civil Code.  According to  the first of these articles, a  will is valid even though it does not  contain any institution of an heir, or if such  institution does not include the entire estate, and even though the  person instituted  does  not accept the inheritance  or  is disqualified  to inherit; according to the second, one of  the ways  in  which  legal succession may take place is when the will does  not institute an heir to all or part of the property, or does not dispose of all that belongs to the testator, in which case legal succession shall take place only with respect to  the property which the testator has not disposed of.<br><br>Assuming that the  joint will in question  is valid, it follows that the deceased Victoriana Saavedra specified therein that parcels 187 and  768  in proceeding No. 7880 be delivered as a legacy to her sister Segunda Saavedra, the first parcel free of all liens and encumbrances, and the  sec- ond on the condition  that the legatee devote the products of the same to  having masses said for the repose of the testatrix's soul.  As to the remaining sixteen parcels, the testatrix disposed of her part  in them conditionally, that is to say, in case her husband Macario Macrohon Ong Ham died before she did, said parcels were to be awarded to her husband's nephews, or to either of them in case one should have  died before the said Macario  Macrohon  Ong  Ham. The condition imposed in the will as  precedent to the vesting in  the  alleged  legatees Ong  Ka Ghiew and Ong Ka Jian of the right to the legacy, not  having been complied with, the trial court found that the  part of said property belonging to the  testatrix  should be partitioned among the persons called on to succeed her  under the law.  We are of the opinion that this finding is in accordance with the law, since, under article 791 of the  Civil  Code,  conditions imposed upon heirs and legatees shall  be governed by the rules  established  for conditional obligations in all matters not provided for by this  section (articles 790 to  805). And,  in accordance with article 1114 of the Code, in conditional obligations the acquisition  of rights, as well  as the extinction or loss of those already acquired, shall depend  upon  the occurrence of  the event constituting  the condition.<br><br>Another error  assigned  by the appellant consists in the trial court not having found that,  under the terms of the joint  will, the legatees Ong Ka  Chiew and Ong Ka Jian were entitled to receive the testatrix's share in the sixteen parcels  of land mentioned in said  will.<br><br>The part  of the will invoked by  the appellant, states:<br><br><blockquote>"In case  of the death of Macario Macrohon Ong Ham before  Victoriana Saavedra, we  hereby  order  that the properties hereinafter described  be  jointly given to  Ong Ka Chiew and Ong  Ka  Jian, and should either of the two die before Macario Macrohon Ong  Ham, we order that all the said properties be given to the survivor."</blockquote><br>The trial court, in interpreting this paragraph of the will in  regard to legatees Ong  Ka  Chiew and  Ong  Ka Jian,  reached the right conclusion,  and  rightly, in our opinion, that it provides  for the substitution  of legatees in case either of them should die before Macario Macrohon Ong  Ham; and that the acquisition by these legatees  of any right to  the property  described  in  the will depended on the condition that Macario Macrohon Ong Ham  died before Victoriana Saavedra.<br><br>The appellant also assigns as error the holding of the trial court that the opponents, the brother, sister, nephews, and nieces of the  testatrix, were entitled to receive her share in the said sixteen parcels of land, given to the legatees,  Ong Ka Chiew and Ong Ka Jian, under the terms of the said joint will.  Such a contention is untenable. As we have said, the acquisition of right by the alleged lega- tees depends  on  the occurrence of the event  constituting the condition,  that is, the death of Macario Macrohon  Ong Ham prior to that of his wife;  and this  condition not having been complied with, the  said Ong Ka Chiew  and Ong Ka Jian  have not acquired any right,  and therefore the testatrix's estate  is to be divided  among her heirs in accordance  with the law.<br><br>To the sixteen parcels of land to which reference is here made,  that is, those given  to the nephews of the testator, should be added lot No. 838-A, proceeding No. 7880,  certificate  1257,  which the testatrix  had reserved to  herself (together with lots 817 and 768),  in case she survived her husband Macario Macrohon Ong Ham.<br><br>One-half of these seventeen parcels of land belong to the widower,  Macario Macrohon Ong  Ham, and the trial court shall order the division  of  the other  half, that is, the estate of the deceased Victoriana Saavedra, being one-half of the conjugal property, between  the widower  and the opponents, as provided for in articles 945, 948  and 953 of the Civil Code.  With  this  modification, the order appealed from  is affirmed in all other respects.
