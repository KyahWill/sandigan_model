				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; relief under&nbsp; section 513 of&nbsp; the Code of Civil Procedure from a judgment in cadastral case No. 6 of the Province of Tayabas&nbsp; declaring lot No.&nbsp; 65 in that case public lands.<br><br>The&nbsp; petitioner alleges "that he, as well as his father Anselmo Montes, before him, were&nbsp; and are the owners of a tract of land situated in the said municipality and province and more particularly&nbsp; described in the document hereto attached marked Exhibit A and&nbsp; made&nbsp; a part hereof, said document&nbsp; being&nbsp; a certified copy of its original which said original was offered&nbsp; in evidence in&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 846, G.&nbsp; L. R. 0.&nbsp; Record No. 20471 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Tayabas, the particular tract of land in question&nbsp; being the second one described and mentioned in said Exhibit A;<br><blockquote>"That said tract of land together with a number of others was included in&nbsp; the cadastral survey made&nbsp; by the Government of the Philippine Islands in or about the year 1920, which&nbsp; survey was&nbsp; later made the basis for a cadastral case filed&nbsp; in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of the Province of Tayabas,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; 'The Government of the Philippine Islands <i>vs.</i> Anastacio Abadilla et al..' and registered therein as case No. 6,&nbsp; G. L. R. 0. Record No. 362, which case is generally known as the 'Bondoc Cadastre ;'<br><br>"That in the survey of the said tract of land made by the surveyors&nbsp; of the Bureau of Lands of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands same&nbsp; was,&nbsp; without the knowledge&nbsp; and consent of the petitioner, divided into a number of lots among&nbsp; which is lot No.&nbsp; 65 as&nbsp; shown by the plan of said survey, a copy of a portion of which covering and embracing&nbsp; the lands owned by the petitioner and his father&nbsp; is attached&nbsp; hereto marked Exhibit B and made a part hereof;<br><br>"That his father Anselmo Montes had been in possession of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; described&nbsp; in said Exhibit&nbsp; A&nbsp; from the year 1861&nbsp; to and&nbsp; including&nbsp; the date of his death, and that&nbsp; the petitioner inherited the same as&nbsp; the sole and only&nbsp; heir of his father&nbsp; upon the death of the latter and has continued to be the&nbsp; owner of all&nbsp; of&nbsp; said land&nbsp; except&nbsp; the&nbsp; portion thereof described upon&nbsp; said plan&nbsp; (Exhibit B) as lot No. 9, which parcel he&nbsp; sold to one Jorge Guerra, who later disposed of the same to&nbsp; other&nbsp; persons;<br><br>"That the possession of said&nbsp; lot No. 65 by the&nbsp; father of the petitioner as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; by the petitioner&nbsp; himself has been&nbsp; open, notorious, public, continuous, without interruption,&nbsp; and with claim&nbsp; and color&nbsp; of title since 1861&nbsp; to the present time."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; petitioner further alleges that&nbsp; the said&nbsp; case No. 6, G. L. R. O. Record&nbsp; No. 362,&nbsp; was begun on March&nbsp; 27, 1922, under&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Act No. 2874 by the filing by Mr. C. Carballo in his capacity as Assistant Director of Lands of a petition on behalf of the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Islands in, which all the lands&nbsp; embraced in said cadastral plan, including said lot No. 65, were alleged to be&nbsp; the property&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands;<br><br>That the petitioner is an ignorant man who&nbsp; can&nbsp; neither read&nbsp; nor write either&nbsp; English or Spanish,&nbsp; and that he is unable to fully understand plans and drawings having reference to locations of particular parcels of land;<br><br>That at the time when knowledge came to the petitioner of the fact&nbsp; that the Government of the Philippine Islands was claiming his land to be public land the original of the document Exhibit A was in the hands of one Meliton Brion of San Pablo, Laguna, to whom it had been delivered for use in attempting to make a sale of said property and that the petitioner placed the matter of his claim to&nbsp; said lands in the hands of Attorney&nbsp; Feliciano E. Zoleta of Lucena, Tayabas Province, who, through error and&nbsp; mistake, filed a claim on behalf of the petitioner to a portion only of the property belonging to him, such claim as so filed, cover ing only lot No.&nbsp; 10 of said cadastral case, no claim through such&nbsp; error and&nbsp; mistake having&nbsp; ever been filed by the petitioner for&nbsp; lot No. 65 of which he is and has been through his predecessors in interest the owner&nbsp; and possessor in good&nbsp; faith without interruption since 1861&nbsp; to the present time;<br><br>That he never received&nbsp; any notice either from the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Tayabas or any other&nbsp; governmental department&nbsp; or branch&nbsp; of the presentation of the above-mentioned cadastral case&nbsp; No. 846, nor was he ever in&nbsp; any way notified that a hearing would be had regarding lot No. 65, though he did&nbsp; have notice regarding the hearing as to lot No. 10 and appeared at such hearing, and that had he ever received&nbsp; any notice of the hearing regarding lot No. 65 he would have appeared thereat;<br><br>That for reasons known only&nbsp; to&nbsp; Mr. Meliton Brion the latter&nbsp; neglected&nbsp; and&nbsp; refused to return&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner the document of which Exhibit A is a copy so that he was unable to present it at the hearing regarding the ownership of lot No. 10 of&nbsp; said cadastral case and plan.<br><br>The petitioner further&nbsp; alleges that it&nbsp; was not until on or about September 15, 1925, when the petitioner came to Manila for the purpose of seeking a loan on lot No. 65 or finding a purchaser for same, that he first learned that by an order of the Court of First Instance of Tayabas made in said cadastral&nbsp; case No. 6 on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1922,&nbsp; said&nbsp; lot had&nbsp; been declared public&nbsp; lands for the reason&nbsp; that&nbsp; no private person had presented any&nbsp; claim for it, and that it was then for the first time that he discovered that through error and mistake&nbsp; his attorney had not filed&nbsp; a claim&nbsp; on his behalf for said lot No. 65;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,<br><br>That the order of said Court of First Instance of Tayabas of May 26,&nbsp; 1922, was made upon default and after a general default had been declared against&nbsp; all persons in said cadastral case No. 6 by the said Court of the Province of Tayabas, but that the&nbsp; petitioner had no knowledge or notice of such default or of the fact that his attorney had not filed a claim on his behalf for said lot No.&nbsp; 65&nbsp; until on or about September 15, 1925, when he came to Manila as above stated;<br><br>That the petitioner was&nbsp; unjustly deprived of a hearing upon whatever claim he&nbsp; has or may have to&nbsp; said lot No. 65 by&nbsp; mistake or excusable negligence as&nbsp; shown by the above stated facts.<br><br>Exhibit A referred to in the petition is a copy of the record of a summary information&nbsp; proceeding instituted by Anselmo Montes in the year 1872 and in which the land is described as one thousand pitch or tar trees, situated in the barrio of Lumboy&nbsp; of the&nbsp; town of Mulanay, bounded&nbsp; on the north, south and east by the sea and on the west with Mariano Rufo, no area being stated.<br><br>Exhibit B accompanying the petition is&nbsp; a&nbsp; blueprint of the plan of a portion of the Bondoc Cadaster and shows that lot&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 66&nbsp; embraces 905&nbsp; hectares,&nbsp; 57 ares and 20 centiares, and is separated by a water&nbsp; course from&nbsp; lot No. 10, which contains 277 hectares, 26 ares and 90 centiares,&nbsp; and that lot No. 9&nbsp; contains 401 hectares, 75 ares and 55 centiares, and is separated from lot&nbsp; No. 10 by Pao Creek.<br><br>To this petition the respondent, the Government of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, demurs on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts alleged do not state sufficient cause to entitle the petitioner to the relief prayed for.<br><br>In our opinion, the demurrer is well&nbsp; taken.&nbsp; Under section 513 of the&nbsp; Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure, the relief here prayed for can only be granted "when&nbsp; a judgment is rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; a Court of First Instance .upon&nbsp; default,&nbsp; and a party thereto is unjustly deprived of a hearing&nbsp; by&nbsp; fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence" and the petition for such relief is presented within sixty days after the petitioner learns of the rendition&nbsp; of the judgment.&nbsp; Exhibit A, the record of the summary information proceeding had in 1872, evidences no title to the land but only possession, at that time, of one thousand pitch trees in a certain location and the petitioner's claim to a decree&nbsp; for&nbsp; the land must therefore rest on subsection (b)&nbsp; of section 45 of the&nbsp; Public Land Act (Act No. 2874), which requires proof of&nbsp; "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession&nbsp; and occupation of agricultural lands of the&nbsp; public&nbsp; domain, under a <i>bona&nbsp; fide</i>&nbsp; claim of acquisition of&nbsp; ownership, except as against the Government, since July 26,&nbsp; 1894."&nbsp; Exhibit B, which also accompanies the petition and must be regarded as a part&nbsp; thereof, shows that lot No. 65 contains over 905 hectares of land and that the boundaries of the tract&nbsp; are indicated by monuments placed there by the cadastral surveyors. Assuming that the&nbsp; land was agricultural land and that the petitioner was in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and&nbsp; occupation of it&nbsp; sufficient to give him title under the Public Land Act,&nbsp; he&nbsp; was clearly guilty of inexcusable negligence&nbsp; in failing to ascertain that a tract of land&nbsp; of&nbsp; that area and importance had been surveyed and given a separate lot&nbsp; number.<br><br>He appeared in the case and presented his claim to lot No. 10 and as that lot and lot No. 65 were separated by a water course, it&nbsp; was to be expected that the two lots would be given separate numbers; that fact in&nbsp; itself was sufficient to put him upon notice.&nbsp; And if the land was agricultural and if he was in occupation&nbsp; of it as such, he must have had full knowledge of the cadastral survey and could readily have obtained the necessary information from the cadastral surveyors.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that he was an ignorant man cannot, in the&nbsp; circumstances, be regarded as a&nbsp; sufficient excuse; he was represented in the proceedings by a lawyer and was&nbsp; bound by the latter's&nbsp; mistake, if any. <br><br>The demurrer is therefore sustained and, as it is evident that the petitioner's lack of a&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; action cannot be cured&nbsp; by amendment, an&nbsp; order absolute&nbsp; will&nbsp; be entered dismissing&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; with&nbsp; the costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avancena, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor,&nbsp; Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
