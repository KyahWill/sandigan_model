				<H3>PEDRO SALDAÃ‘A, PROTESTANT AND APPELLANT, VS. TRANQUILINO NAVARRO, PROTESTEE AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Pedro Saldana appeals to this court from the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance of Bataan which reads as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Acting upon Attorney Vicente J. Francisco's 
motion for dismissal of the election protest filed by Pedro Saldafia 
against Tranquilino Navarro in the above entitled case, on the ground 
that it is not stated in said protest that the protestant or the 
protestee are 'duly registered candidates', which is an indispensable 
requisite prescribed by the Election Law to confer jurisdiction upon the
 courts to take cognizance of these cases, the court, after iiaving 
carefully examined all the pleadings for and against said motion, has 
arrived at the conclusion that said motion for dismissal should be 
granted. (See Tabada <em>vs.</em> Zandueta and Vergara, 47 Phil., 859.) 
Even granting that the word 'inscribed' is synonymous to 'registered', 
inasmuch as the law precisely requires that there be an allegation to 
the effect that the certificate of candidacy of a candidate has been 
'duly filed', and there being no such allegation in the motion of 
protest, the court lacks jurisdiction to take cognizance ofssdd case.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "Wherefore, the motion for dismissal filed by said
 Attorney Vicente J. Francisco, representing Tranquilino Navarro, the 
protestee in this case, is granted, and this case is dismissed, with 
costs against the protestant. So ordered." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In support of his appeal, the protestant assigns the 
following alleged errors as committed by the trial court in its said 
resolution, to wit;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "1. The lower court erred in declaring that the 
protestant should allege in his motion of protest that his certificate 
of candidacy was 'duly filed'.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "2. The lower court erred in ordering the 
dismissal of this case with costs against the protestant/'</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The only question to be decided in this appeal is 
whether or not the facts alleged in the motion of protest filed by the 
appellant Pedro Saldana are sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the 
Court of First Instance of Bataan to take cognizance of said case.</p>
<p align="justify"> Paragraph 2 of said motion of protest reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "2. That said protestant and protestee are 
qualified voters of the municipality of Samal, Province of Bataan, the 
only two inscribed candidates for the office of municipal president of 
said municipality, and that they were voted for for said office in the 
general elections held on June 5, 1934."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The trial court, in ordering the dismissal of the 
motion of protest under consideration, based its opinion on the ground 
that it did not allege that the certificate of candidacy has been "duly 
filed" as required by section 479 of Act No. 3834.</p>
<p align="justify"> In the case of Acerden <em>vs.</em> Tonolete (52 
Phil., 409), the motion of protest contained the following allegation of
 jurisdictional facts: "That in the general elections held on June 5, 
1928, the protestant and protestee were the only two candidates 
registered and voted for who contended for the office of municipal 
president of the municipality of Carigara." The question having been 
raised whether or not the above facts were sufficient to confer 
jurisdiction upon the court, with which said motion was filed, in order 
to take cognizance of the case, this court decided it in the 
affirmative.</p>
<p align="justify"> Between the allegation of jurisdictional facts 
contained in the motion of protest in the above cited case of Acerden <em><em>vs.</em></em>
 Tonolete and that contained in the motion of protest under 
consideration, there is no essential difference. Neither is there any 
essential difference between the word "registered" used in the motion of
 protest in the former case and "inscribed" used herein, inasmuch as 
they are synonymous. (IV Escriche, Dictionary of Law and Jurisprudence; 
Dictionary of the Spanish Language.)</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the foregoing consideration, we are of 
the opinion and so hold that the allegation "That said protestant and 
protestee are qualified voters of the municipality of Samal, Province of
 Bataan, the only two inscribed candidates for the office of municipal 
president of said municipality, and that they were voted for for said 
office in the general elections held on June 5,1934," contained in a 
motion of protest, substantially complies "with all the requisites 
prescribed by section 479 of Act No. 3834 to confer jurisdiction upon a 
Court of First Instance to take cognizance of an election protest.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is reversed 
and it is ordered that the motion of protest be reinstated and the 
proceedings therein continued, with costs against the appellee. So 
ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Imperial, Butte,</em> and <em>Goddard, 
JJ.,</em> concur.
