Fermin et al. induced, cajoled and prevailed upon said Timoteo Santos and Irene Santos not to register in the office of the register of deeds of Nueva Ecija the deeds of sale and mortgage executed in their favor, respectively, until further advice from him and, believing in his representations and promises, Irene Santos did not register said documents.<br><br>" (g) That in civil case No. 5129 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija entitled 'Donata Peralta et al. vs. Nicanor de Mesa', in which the plaintiff sought the rescission of the contract entered into by them on September 20, 1928, because of the there defendant and herein respondent's failure to honor his promissory note of August 31,1928, for the sum of P1,650, the respondent, knowing fully well that the parcel of land which was the object of the complaint had been sold by him to Timoteo Santos and that said Timoteo Santos, following his advice, had mortgaged said property to Irene Santos, agreed to the rescission of said contract sought in plaintiffs complaint and as a result of said agreement entered into by him, the court declared the deed of sale executed by Donata Peralta and others in his favor null and void and ordered the cancellation of certificate of Title No. 3163 which had been issued in his name and the issuance of another in the name of the plaintiffs Donata Peralta and others; and that respondent, by thus abusing his position as attorney and counsellor of, and the confidence reposed in him by, the complainant Irene Santos, defrauded the latter in the sum of P1,500.<br><br>"(h) That on October 21, 1929, and before Irene Santos actually knew the fraudulent acts perpetrated by the respondent in connection with the parcel of land mortgaged to her by Timoteo Santos, respondent, taking advantage of the confidence reposed in him by said Irene Santos who was his client in civil case No. 3608 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, by making her believe that he needed the sum of P500 just to show it in court in connection with a certain administrative case which he said he had, and that he would return the amount as soon as said purpose had been accomplished, succeeded in obtaining a loan of P500 from said Irene Santos promising to return same on or before November 30, 1929, but far from complying with his promise, he refused and still refuses to pay said amount.<br><br>"(i) That the respondent has concealed his property in order to defraud his creditors."</blockquote>Presentado el escrito de contestation por el recurrido, se nombrd, por resolution de este Tribunal, al Juez de Primera Instancia de Rizal comisionado para que procediera a hacer la investigation, informe y recomendaciOn que procedan. Se presentaron ante el Juez Gomisionado las pruebas de los recurrentes y cuando le correspondio al recurrido presenter las suyas, no comparecio, ni su abogado.<br><br>Se han probado todos los cargos alegados en la queja presentada por el Procurador General, y el Juez Gomisionado opind que, aun cuando los actos cometidos por el recurrido, no lo han sido en su capacidad de abogado, constituyen, con todo, una violation de su juramento de abogado, pues el juro que no cometeria ningun acto de falsedad, y demuestran ademas que le falta el buen caracter moral, que es una de las mas importantes cualificaciones requeridas para la profesion de abogado.<br><br>Convenimos en las anteriores consideraciones con el Juez Comisionado, y en su virtud, ordenamos que el recurrido sea inhabiHtado en el ejercicio de la profesion y que pague a Irene Santos, la cantidad de P2,000 por 61 ilegalmente apropiada, y, si no lo hiciere dentro del termino de un ano, se reserve a la recurrente el derecho de entablar la accion civil correspondiente.
