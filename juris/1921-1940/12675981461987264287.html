				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; February&nbsp; 14, 1930 the deputy&nbsp; provincial fiscal of &amp; Province&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija filed an information in&nbsp; the of the&nbsp; justice of the peace of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality of Carranglan of said province, charging&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants with crime of murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a preliminary&nbsp; investigation the justice of&nbsp; the peace found that there&nbsp; was&nbsp; reasonable ground&nbsp; for believing that the defendants committed&nbsp; the crime and held them for trial in the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of the Province of Nueva Ecija.<br><br>On the 28th day of February, 1930,&nbsp; an information was filed against the defendants charging them with the crime of murder,&nbsp; The information&nbsp; alleged:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 26th day of&nbsp; December,&nbsp; 1929, in the municipality of Carranglan, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippine Islands, and within the jurisdiction of this court, the above-named accused, Juan Alambra and Eleno Garcia <i>alias</i> Andoy, confederating with&nbsp; each&nbsp; other and mutually aiding one, another&nbsp; with treachery,&nbsp; evident premeditation and with cruelty by deliberately and inhumanly increasing the suffering of the offended party, and in an uninhabited place,&nbsp; did then and there with intent to kill voluntarily, maliciously, illegally, and criminally attack and bolo Fulgencio Casupartg <i>alias</i>&nbsp; Florencio inflicting&nbsp; upon the latter several mortal wounds on the different parts&nbsp; of the body, and as a consequence of which said Fulgencio Casupang <i>alias</i> Florencio&nbsp; died instantly.<br><br>"In the commission of the crime the aggravating circumstance of an uninhabited place concurred.<br><br>"Contrary to law."</blockquote>Upon&nbsp; arraignment the defendants&nbsp; pleaded&nbsp; not guilty, were tried, found guilty of the crime charged, with the qualifying circumstance&nbsp; of&nbsp; treachery,&nbsp; without&nbsp; any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sentenced to suffer the&nbsp; medium degree of&nbsp; the&nbsp; penalty provided&nbsp; by law, or <i>cadena perpetua</i>, with the accessory penalties, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased&nbsp; in the sum of P500&nbsp; and each to pay one-half part of the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court recommended a deduction of one-half of the time during which the defendants Were held as <span style="font-style: italic;">detention prisoners</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dispositive&nbsp; part of the decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"En su virtud, el Juzgado declarando a estos dos acusados culpables del delito de asesinato de que se&nbsp; halla&nbsp; acusados en la presente causa,&nbsp; por haber&nbsp; matado a Futgecio Casupang, concurriendo&nbsp; la&nbsp; circunstancia cualificativa, 1. del articulo 403 o sea, la alevosia, condena&nbsp; a cada urio de ellos a cadena perpetua,&nbsp; con las accesorias de ley; a&nbsp; pagar mancomunada y solidariamente una indemnizacion de quinientos pesos a la familia del occiso Fulgenciosin prision subsidiaria en caso de insolvencia vedad de la pena principal.&nbsp; Pagaran por mitac asupang, a la graas costas del proceso.&nbsp; En el cumplimiento de su conde les sera de abono la mitad&nbsp; del tiempo que hayan estado preventivamente presos."</blockquote>From that sentence the defendants appealed&nbsp;&nbsp; They now contend that: <br><blockquote><ol><li>The lower court erred in giving credit to the testimony of the witnesses for the&nbsp; prosecution, particularly Mercurio Tambuyac, a boy, 14 years of age; and<br><br></li><li>The lower&nbsp; court erred in considering Exhibit B&nbsp; as an admission of guilt by&nbsp; the appellant Juan Alambra.</li></ol></blockquote>We have carefully examined the testimony of the witnesses for&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution and the defense and&nbsp; find no reason for not sustaining the findings of fact and conclusions of the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; A close&nbsp; examination of&nbsp; the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution fails to disclose any material inconsistency, contradiction or any other defect which&nbsp; might reflect on the veracity or sincerity of said witnesses.&nbsp; In view&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; and taking into consideration that the lower court saw and heard the witnesses and had full opportunity to&nbsp; observe their&nbsp; conduct and demeanor on the stand&nbsp; and&nbsp; their manner of testifying, we are of the opinion that the trial judge committed no error in giving full credit to the testimony o$ the witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br>With reference to the boy Mercurio Tambuyac, 14&nbsp; years of age, who was&nbsp; the only eyewitness to the commission of the crime, we find that his testimony gives a clear and simple description of&nbsp; the manner how the&nbsp; appellants killed the deceased Fulgencio&nbsp; Casupang.&nbsp; Substantially he testified&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows: That he and the appellants were out in the country to fish; that the appellants, seeing that Casupang was&nbsp; coming, hid behind a tree and that, by&nbsp; order of the appellants, he (the witness) also hid in a thicket; that as Casupang passed&nbsp; by the appellants, the latter suddenly attacked him with clubs; that he (the witness) ran home; and that the next morning&nbsp; he was warned by the appellants not to&nbsp; say anything, for otherwise they would kill him.<br><br>Speaking of the reliability of this boy as a witness, the lower court said:<br><blockquote>"El juzgado que ha tenido en su presencia a este testigo, a&nbsp; este niño&nbsp; y a quien&nbsp; declare&nbsp; competente para declarar despues&nbsp; de&nbsp; haberle sometido a&nbsp; unas preguntas en forma de <i>intelligence test</i>, esta&nbsp; convencido de&nbsp; que este nino ha declarado aqui ingenuamente, con toda sinceridad, sin estar influenciado.&nbsp; Y con la experiencia que el Juzgado&nbsp; tiene en oir testigos y juzgar por su actitud y conducta ante el Juzgado hasta que grado de veracidad merece su testimonio, da toda la credibilidad que se merece este testigo.&nbsp; Los otros testigos del Gobierno corroboran, asi como sus otras pruebas, todo lo deelarado por este niño."</blockquote>Doctor Hans&nbsp; Gross, a well known Austrian jurist and expert in criminology, speaking of&nbsp; the weight to&nbsp; be attached to the testimony&nbsp; of the youths, says:<br><blockquote>"An intelligent&nbsp; boy is undoubtedly the best observer to be&nbsp; found.&nbsp; The world begins to take him by storm with its&nbsp; thousand matters of interest;&nbsp; what the school and his daily life furnish cannot satisfy his overflowing and generous&nbsp; heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; He lays hold&nbsp; of everything new, striking, strange; all&nbsp; his senses are on the stretch to assimilate it as far as possible.&nbsp; No one notices a change in the house, no&nbsp; one discovers the bird's nest, no one observes anything out of the way in the fields; but nothing of that sort escapes the boy; everything which emerges above the monotonous level of daily life gives, him a good&nbsp; opportunity for exercising his wits, for extending his knowledge, and for attracting the attention of his&nbsp; elders, to&nbsp; whom he communicates his discoveries.&nbsp; The spirit of the youth not having as yet been&nbsp; led astray by the&nbsp; necessities of life, its storms and battles, its&nbsp; factions and quarrels, he can freely abandon himself to everything which appears out&nbsp; of the way; his life has not yet been disturbed by&nbsp; education, though&nbsp; he often observes more clearly and accurately than any adult. Besides, he has already got some principles; lying is dis- tasteful to him, because he thinks it mean; he is no stranger to&nbsp; the&nbsp; sentiment&nbsp; of self-respect,&nbsp; and he never loses an opportunity of being right in what&nbsp; he affirms. Thus&nbsp; he is,&nbsp; as a rule, but little influenced by the suggestions&nbsp; of others, and he describes&nbsp; objects and occurrences as he has really seen&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We say again&nbsp; that an intelligent boy is as&nbsp; a rule&nbsp; the best witness in the world."&nbsp; (As&nbsp; quoted by this court in&nbsp; People vs. Bustos, 45 Phil, 9, 35, 36.)</blockquote>With reference&nbsp; to the contention that Exhibit B&nbsp; should not have been considered by the lower court as an&nbsp; admission of guilt on the part of the appellant Juan Alambra, we deem it unnecessary to discuss the probatory value of said exhibit.&nbsp; Suffice it to say&nbsp; that, independent of said Exhibit B, there is abundant proof showing beyond&nbsp; a reasonable doubt that the appellants acting treacherously, did at the time and place&nbsp; mentioned in&nbsp; the&nbsp; information, kill the deceased Fulgencio Casupang.<br><br>The Attorney-General in a very carefully prepared brief arrived at the conclusion that the appellants are guilty of the crime of murder as found by the lower court, and recommends&nbsp; that the sentence appealed&nbsp; from be affirmed.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of all of the foregoing, and in conformity with the recommendation of the Attorney-General, the sentence appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Street,&nbsp; Malcolm, Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
