				<H3>GERARDO GO BELTRAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. INOCENTES FERNANDEZ, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An action for  malpractice.<br><br>On January 21, 1936, complainant herein, Gerardo  Go Beltran, filed  with this  court a  complaint  for malpractice against respondent Inocentes Fernandez, a member of the Philippine Bar engaged in the practice of law in Talisayan, Oriental Misamis.  The  Solicitor-General, to which the case was referred for appropriate action,  filed, after due investigation,  the corresponding complaint,  charging respondent with having purchased a property of his client involved in a pending litigation  in which he appeared as counsel,  and prayed  that  appropriate  disciplinary action be taken against him.  On November 30, 1939, the Court of First Instance of  Oriental Misamis, to which the case was committed for investigation, submitted a report confirming in  substance the charge and reiterating the recommendation  of the Solicitor-General.<br><br>The evidence discloses that on or about  June  13, 1928, one Honorio Pajaron, with his spouse Natividad Ypan, conveyed to the complainant Gerardo Go  Beltran two  parcels of land situated  in Talisayan, Oriental Misamis and described in the deed of sale, Exhibit 3.  A misunderstanding thereafter  developed  between the parties with respect to the identity of the parcels of land so conveyed—Beltran claiming that the properties sold to him included (besides lots A and  B) lot C of the  sketch attached to the record as Exhibit 9;  Honorio Pajaron and Natividad Ypan claiming, on the other hand, that lot C was not a part thereof.  As a consequence of their conflicting claims to lot C, a series of suits, civil and criminal  (civil  cases Nos. 4602 and 4608 and criminal cases Nos. 6585 and  6586, Justice of the Peace Court of Talisayan)  were  instituted  by and between  the parties to the deed, and,  in all these suits, respondent Inocentes Fernandez appeared as counsel for the opponents of the complainant  herein.   On November  16, 1935, while criminal case No. 6586 aforementioned was pending appeal in the Court of  First Instance of Oriental Misamis,  respondent purchased from his client, Natividad Ypan, lot C in question. <br><br>Respondent claimed that the property purchased by him was not the one which constitutes the object of the series of litigations between the parties aforementioned.   In  the investigation, however, conducted by  the  provincial fiscal of Oriental Misamis,  respondent  made  the  following selfevident admission:<br><blockquote>"Cross-examination by Mr. Tan:<br><br>"Q. The  land involved in criminal case 6585 marked as Exhibit B-l is the same land described in Exhibit E signed by you as attorney of Natividad Ypan? <br><br>"Respondent: Yes, the same land.<br>"Q. The land involved in criminal case 6604, Exhibit C is the same land involved in criminal case 6585 Exhibit B-l and E?<br><br>"Respondent: Yes, the same land.<br>"Q. The land  which you bought from  Natividad Ypan Exhibit 1 is identical and the same land described in 2?<br><br>"Respondent: Yes, the same land.<br>"Q. And the land described  in Exhibits 1 and 2 is the same land involved in your criminal complaint 6604, Exhibit C  against Gerardo G. Beltran and others?<br><br>"Respondent : Yes, the same land.<br>"Q. So that you have now  then the  land involved in Criminal cases 6585, 6604 and  6587, Exhibit F-l and civil case 4608, Exhibit E are the  same,  which I have added Exhibit F-l for coercion? <br><br>"Respondent: Yes,  they are the same land.<br>"Q. And this is  the same  land  which you bought from Natividad Ypan described in Exhibits 1 and 2? <br><br>"Respondent: Yes, the same land.<br>"Q. It is also  true that you  were the attorney who appeared in  all these cases?<br><br>"Respondent: Yes, sure."</blockquote>Respondent has  accordingly  violated article 1459  of the Civil Code, in breach of professional  conduct.  In accordance with the exemplary punishment we have set forth in Hernandez vs. Villanueva  (40  Phil., 775), which involved a like breach of professional ethics,  respondent herein  is hereby  ordered suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months effective as of the date this judgment becomes final.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C.J., Imperial, Diaz, Laurel,</i> and <i>Concepcion, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Respondent suspended for six months.</i></div>
