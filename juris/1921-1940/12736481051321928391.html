				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On August 27, 1928, the plaintiff, Ladislao Afable, brought an action against 
the defendant, Carmen Belando, for the payment of a promissory note in the 
amount of P1,249.27. In the course of this action the plaintiff, on September 
4th of the same year, obtained a preliminary attachment against the defendant's 
property and certain rents on lands in Cavite leased to several persons. On 
January 18, 1929, judgment was rendered requiring the defendant to pay the 
plaintiff P1,109.27 with interest at 12 per cent per annum, and 12 per centum of 
this amount as penalty, and, in addition, P160 for certain expenses. In 
pursuance of the writ of execution, the rents on the lands aforementioned, which 
had been attached, were delivered to the plaintiff on April 3, 1929.</p>
<p>A few days after the delivery of the rents to the plaintiff, the association 
<span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> was admitted as intervenor in this case to recover said rents which 
had been delivered to the plaintiff. It appears that on August 5,1927, <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> 
brought suit against Carmen Belando for foreclosure of the mortgage, secured 
judgment in the Court of First Instance on January 14, 1928, against the 
defendant for payment of P49,162.62, and upon failure to make payment within 
three months, the mortgaged property was decreed for sale in satisfaction of 
this amount. Upon appeal the judgment was affirmed by this court on March 27, 
1929.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>It also appears that the rents delivered to the plaintiff by virtue of his 
judgment against the defendant were those collected on the property mortgaged to 
La Urbana.</p>
<p>In deciding the intervention of <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> the court below, in its brief and 
well-founded decision, rendered on May 9, 1929, ordered the sheriff to return 
the amount of P1,241.84 to the Bank of the Philippine Islands, the depositary 
appointed in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> against the defendant. This sum is the total 
amount of the rents delivered to the plaintiff in pursuance of his judgment 
against the same defendant, Carmen Belando. It is from this decision that the 
instant appeal has been taken.</p>
<p>The only question invoked in this case is purely a legal .one, namely, 
whether, according to article 1877 of the Civil Code and 111 of the Mortgage 
Law, the rents of. the property mortgaged to <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> could have been attached 
by the plaintiff in the course of his ordinary action against the defendant for 
the collection of a sum of money.</p>
<p>As we have said, when the plaintiff brought suit against the defendant on 
August 27, 1928, and when on September 4, 1928, a preliminary attachment of the, 
rents of the defendant's property was granted, <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> had already brought an 
action against the same defendant for the foreclosure of the mortgage (August 5, 
1927), and had secured judgment therein (January 14, 1928) which was affirmed by 
this court. Therefore, when the plaintiff attached these rents, the defendant's 
obligation to <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> had already fallen due. According to article 1877 of the 
Civil Code and 110 and 111 of the Mortgage Law, a mortgage includes all rents of 
the mortgaged property not collected when the obligation falls due, and all 
rents payable until the credit is satisfied. (Decision on motion for 
reconsideration in Hijos de I. de la Rama vs. Betia, 54 Phil., 991.) In 
accordance with this provision, when the rents were attached by the plaintiff, 
they were already liable for the mortgage in favor of <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span>, and could not 
have legally been attached by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>It is immaterial that the judgment in favor of <span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana</span> contained no mention 
of the rents, but only of the property itself, for after all, under the law, 
every mortgage includes the rents. So also is the fact that the court below 
excluded the P575, which is a part of the amount of P1,241.84, from the deposit 
inasmuch as that sum also comprises rents included in the mortgage in favor of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">La Urbana.</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, we find no merit in the plaintiff's contention that <span style="font-style: italic;">La 
Urbana</span> waived its rights under the Civil Code and the Mortgage Law respecting 
the rents from the mortgaged property, in that being entitled, according to its 
contract with the defendant, to take possession of the property, it abstained 
from doing so, and brought an action for foreclosure instead. We fail to see how 
this implies a waiver.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, the judgment appealed from is. affirmed 
with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez </i>and<i> 
Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.</p>
