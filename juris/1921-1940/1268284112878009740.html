				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>On February 18, 1918, the herein plaintiff
Manila Railroad Company instituted in the Court of First Instance of
Manila civil case No. 15873 against Asuncion Mitchel Viuda de Sy Quia
and others, to expropriate for public use, among other parcels of land,
the parcel situated at Nos. 973 to 999 Azcarraga, Manila, known as lot
No. 1, block No. 14, of the district of Tondo. After filing a bond for
P150,000, the plaintiff, on February 20th of the same year, took
possession of the land and thenceforth made use of it. On September 15,
1925, the court entered judgment declaring the plaintiff to be entitled
to the expropriation applied for and adjudicated to the defendant Viuda
de Sy Quia the sum of P439,395.53, by way of indemnity. The judgment
upon appeal, was affirmed by this court on December 24, 1926.[1]<div align="justify"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup>
<p>In February, 1927, the plaintiff paid said sum to the defendant and
certificate of title No. 27800 was issued in its favor for said
property.</p>
<p> From 1918 to 1926, inclusive, the defendant, as judicial
administratrix of the intestate estate of the deceased Pedro Sy Quia,
paid to the City of Manila the sum of P19,383.98 for taxes on said
property. Said defendant refused to pay the tax corresponding to the
year 1927, for which reason the City of Manila was compelled to bring
an action against her and the plaintiff Manila Railroad Company to
collect the same. Judgment was rendered in favor of the City of Manila,
providing that, in case of failure of the defendant administratrix to
pay the tax, the same could be made effective against the property
already adjudicated to the plaintiff. The judgment was affirmed on
appeal.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> Steps were taken
for the execution of the judgment and petitions had been filed in the
intestate proceedings of Pedro Sy Quia, but said petitions were denied.
The City of Manila then addressed a communication to the plaintiff,
with the information that, if the latter did not pay the amount of the
judgment, it would levy on the property acquired through condemnation
proceedings. To avoid the attachment of the property and its sale at
public auction, the plaintiff, on June 5, 1931, paid to the City of
Manila, under protest, the sum of P3,796, representing the total amount
due on the land for the tax and penalties.</p>
<p> To recover the amount paid by it, the plaintiff brought an action
against the heirs of Pedro Sy Quia, and not against the latter's
intestate estate in view of the fact that the same had already been
definitely closed and the property had been adjudicated to said heirs.
To recover the amount paid by the administratrix to the City of Manila
by way of taxes during the aforesaid period, the defendants, in turn,
set up a counterclaim in their answer. Both parties appealed from the
judgment absolving the defendants from the complaint and the plaintiff
from the counterclaim.</p>
<p> In absolving the defendants from the complaint, the trial court
based its decision on article 1158 of the Civil Code which provides
that any person who has made a payment for the account of another
cannot recover the amount of the payment when it had been made against
the express will of the latter. Upon this point the court held that it
bad been proven that the defendants, particularly the administratrix,
were opposed to the payment of the tax by the plaintiff.</p>
<p> However, in order to decide the question whether or not the
plaintiff is entitled to recover what it paid, it is not necessary to
apply said article or the other provisions of the same Code. Section
2493 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, provides that all
real estate and their improvements, situated in the City of Manila, are
subject to an annual tax of one and one-half per centum (1 1/2 %) which
shall be due and payable on or before the 30th day of June of each
year. Said section gives the taxpayer, if he so desires, an option to
pay the tax in two installments; the first, which consists of one per
centum (1%) of the assessed valuation of the property, must be paid on
or before the thirtieth day of June, and the balance of 1/2 per cent on
or before the 1st day of January of the following year. Although the
tax thus levied constitutes a superior lien on the property, in
conformity with the provisions of section 2497, the taxpayer is neither
in default or delinquent, nor subject to any penalty or surcharge until
the periods granted have expired. Applying these provisions to the
defendants' case, it appears that, even if the tax corresponding to the
year 1927 was fixed at the beginning of that year, they, however, had
the option to pay it until the 30th day of June of that year and the
1st day of January of the following year, and not until then could they
become delinquent or liable to any penalty. The plaintiff became the
owner of the real estate and obtained the certificate of title in
February, 1927. At that time the defendants were not yet bound to pay
the tax, because they were not then delinquent. If, at the expiration
of the periods granted by law for the payment, the plaintiff was
already the owner and possessor of the title to the land and its
improvements, it seems logical and just to hold that it was the
plaintiff who was bound to pay the tax in question and that it has no
cause of action against the herein defendants. And this becomes clearer
still if it is borne in mind that the plaintiff made the payment on
June 5,1931.</p>
<p> We have not overlooked the fact that, when this same question was raised twice before this court (G. R. Nos. 29010 <sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> and 32474 <sup><span style="color: red;">[2]</span></sup>),
it was said that the disputed tax was an indebtedness of and should be
paid by the intestate estate of the deceased Pedro Sy Quia. However, we
are now convinced that, interpreting section 2493 of the Revised
Administrative Code more logically and justly, it should be held that
it is the plaintiff, as above stated, who was obliged to make payment,
in view of the fact that the heirs of the original owner had not yet
been in default or delinquent.</p>
<p> As to the counterclaim, the court absolved the plaintiff because it
was of the opinion that the action had already prescribed. To decide
the dispute, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not the action
has prescribed. When the then administratrix voluntarily paid the taxes
corresponding to the years 1918 to 1926, inclusive, the property still
belonged to the intestate estate, and for this reason alone it is
evident that the plaintiff is not bound to reimburse the defendants.</p>
<p> We are also aware of the fact that the plaintiff immediately took
possession of the land and that the defendants were deprived of the use
thereof from February 20, 1918. Under such circumstances, it would seem
reasonable to obligate the plaintiff to pay the taxes corresponding to
said years, at least by way of indemnity. But in the judgment
adjudicating to the plaintiff the land it sought to expropriate, upon
payment of indemnity, the court awarded to the defendants, or to the
intestate estate of the deceased owner, legal interest on the total
amount of the indemnity from February 20, 1918, the date on which the
plaintiff deprived the defendants of their possession, until the date
of payment. This interest, which has already been paid, sufficiently
compensates the deprivation of the defendants' possession.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the appealed judgment is affirmed without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
