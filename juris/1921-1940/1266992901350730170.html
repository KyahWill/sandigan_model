				<BR><STRONG>LAUREL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a complaint for malpractice filed by Tranquilino Maravilla against Attorney&nbsp; Cornelio T.&nbsp; Villareal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint alleges that on or about the month of July, 1933, the complainant retained the services of the respondent&nbsp; in civil case No. 2221, Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Capiz, entitled "Tranquilino Maravilla, plaintiff, vs. Martiniano Bonifacio et al., defendants,"&nbsp; in which case Antonio Padios, son-in-law of the complainant, was&nbsp; receiver; that due&nbsp; to an objection filed against the approval of the account&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; receiver,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Capiz appointed a&nbsp; commissioner to ascertain the improvements and produce of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; which was the subject matter&nbsp; of the controversy in that case; that in&nbsp; the hearing on the report filed by the&nbsp; commissioner the&nbsp; respondent without any justifiable cause, failed to appear&nbsp; and as&nbsp; a result the report submitted by the&nbsp; said commissioner was&nbsp; approved by the court; and that due also&nbsp; to the negligence of the respondent, no appeal was taken from the order&nbsp; approving the report of the commissioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complainant also alleges that the respondent, while acting as counsel for the receiver in the case above referred&nbsp; to,&nbsp; betrayed&nbsp; the trust of his client by acting as counsel for Pedro Perlas who was claiming an interest adverse to that of the receiver, as evidenced by a communication addressed by the respondent to the provincial&nbsp; sheriff of Capiz a copy of which is attached to the complaint as Exhibit&nbsp; A.<br><br>By resolution of this court of August 17, 1936, the com- plaint was referred to the respondent for answer.<br><br>In&nbsp; his answer, bearing date of September 1, 1936, and filed with this court on the&nbsp; 10th of the&nbsp; same month, the respondent admits having been retained as counsel for the receiver, Antonio Padios,&nbsp; in the aforesaid civil case No. 2221, Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Capiz.&nbsp; He states&nbsp; that in order to&nbsp; clarify certain doubts regarding certain items in the account of the receiver, Antonio Padios, the parties in that&nbsp; case , agreed to&nbsp; appoint Agaton Ignacio, deputy clerk&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Capiz, as&nbsp; commissioner, the parties stipulating&nbsp; that&nbsp; the report to be submitted by the said commissioner was to be final and binding upon them; and that&nbsp; no appeal was taken from the order issued by&nbsp; the court approving the commissioner's report because of this stipulation.&nbsp; We find that this allegation of the respondent is borne out by Exhibit 2 attached to his answer, which exhibit&nbsp; is a copy of the order of the lower court&nbsp; of April 16, 1934 disapproving the account of the receiver, Antonio&nbsp; Padios,&nbsp; and&nbsp; reciting among other things the following:<br><blockquote>"Resulta de estas pruebas que el terreno cuestionado contiene&nbsp; una plantacidn de cocos con un numero&nbsp; considerable&nbsp; de&nbsp; fructlferos desde&nbsp; el afio 1924; que el depositario debi6 haber recogido de&nbsp; dichos cocos fructiferos&nbsp; desde el ano 1924 hasta el ano 1932, inclusive, coprax&nbsp; por valor de no menos de P500 como producto neto; y que dicho depositario dejo de pagar el amillaramiento del terreno durante su administration que importa&nbsp; P74.01,&nbsp; importe&nbsp; que los demandados hubieron de abonar cuando los ful devuelto el terreno.&nbsp; Por obviar toda duda sobre la produccion de los cocos en el terreno cuestionado durante el&nbsp; periodo de administracion del depositario judicial, por convenio de ambae paries,&nbsp; se nombro al escribano delegado de este juzgado como comisionado unico,&nbsp; cuyo&nbsp; informe&nbsp; iba&nbsp; de ser final para dichas partes, el cual, en presencia de&nbsp; las partes y de sus abogados, se constituyo en dioho terreno y obtuvo los datos que el Juzgado requirio en su orden&nbsp; de fecha 26 de febrero de 1934.&nbsp; El comisionado rindi6 su&nbsp; informe que se hace parte de esta decision, en el cual consta que, durante el periodo antes&nbsp; mencionado, el depositario judicial debid haber percibido del terreno cuestionado coprax&nbsp; por valor de no menos&nbsp; de P515."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.)&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondent denied having failed to appear at&nbsp; the hearing on the report of the commissioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the contrary,&nbsp; he alleges that "in fact and in truth he was present at the said hearing in behalf of his client."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Page 2, respondent's answer.)&nbsp; Whatever might have been the case, however, we are of&nbsp; the opinion that the respondent&nbsp; can&nbsp; not be held guilty of negligence or infidelity to his&nbsp; client for his failure, to appeal from the order of the court&nbsp; below approving the report of the&nbsp; commissioner and disapproving the account of the receiver in view&nbsp; of the agreement between the paties in civil case No. 2221 regarding the appointment of the commissioner&nbsp; and the&nbsp; acceptance of the&nbsp; commissioner's findings by the parties.&nbsp; The respondent could&nbsp; not properly&nbsp; have repudiated this agreement as counsel for one of the parties thereto.</blockquote>With reference to his intervention in the levy and execution of the properties of Pedro Perlas, one of the bondsmen of Antonio Padios, as shown by&nbsp; a copy of the letter addressed by&nbsp; him to the provincial sheriff&nbsp; of&nbsp; Capiz (Exhibit A), we&nbsp; find that&nbsp; all&nbsp; that the respondent did in&nbsp; this letter was to claim the benefit of exhaustion (excusion) in favor of the&nbsp; bondsman, Pedro&nbsp; Perlas, in view of the&nbsp; fact that the principal obligor, Antonio Padios, had sufficient properties which could&nbsp; be levied&nbsp; upon.&nbsp; We find nothing censurable in this conduct of the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; He called the attention&nbsp; of the sheriff to&nbsp; what, after all, is the&nbsp; law. While courts will not hesitate to mete out proper disciplinary punishment upon lawyers who fail to&nbsp; live up to their sworn&nbsp; duties&nbsp; they&nbsp; will, on the other&nbsp; hand, protect them from the&nbsp; unjust accusations of&nbsp; dissatisfied litigants.<br><br>The complaint against the respondent attorney is hereby dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Recto, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
