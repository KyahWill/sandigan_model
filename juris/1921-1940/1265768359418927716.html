				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was commenced in the Court of
First Instance of Davao for the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage
which was given as security for the payment of a loan of P40,000
obtained by the appellant from the appellee. Upon the evidence
presented by the parties in support of their respective pleadings, the
trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and appellee
for the sum of P42,492.18, with interest at the rate of twelve per cent
per annum from December 23, 1933 until the said amount is fully paid.
Defendant and appellant was also ordered to pay the plaintiff and
appellee the sum of P6,000 as attorney's fees.
<p>In support of this appeal, counsel for the appellant has assigned four errors which we shall presently discuss.</p>
<ol><li>It is contended for the appellant that the court below
erred in overruling the demurrer interposed By her on the ground that
the complaint filed by the plaintiff and appellee was ambiguous,,
unintelligible, and uncertain. We find no merit in this contention. Far
from being unintelligible and uncertain, the complaint goes to the
extent of giving an itemized statement of the indebtedness covered by
the mortgage. It states in a sufficiently clear language the
circumstances which constitute the plaintiff's cause of action. (Code
of Civil Procedure, see. 90.)<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>It is also
urged on behalf of the appellant that the principal amount claimed by
the plaintiff and appellee comes within the penal sanction of the Usury
Law. On the other hand, counsel for the appellee contend that the
appellant cannot now invoke the defense of usury in view of the fact
that the answer filed by her was not made under oath. This contention
seems to be based on the provisions of section 9 of the Usury Law (No.
2655) which reads as follows:</li></ol>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The person or corporation sued shall file its
answer in writing under oath to any complaint brought or filed against
said person or corporation before a competent court to recover the
money or other personal or real property, seeds or agricultural
products, charged or received in violation of the provisions of this
Act. The lack of taking an oath to an answer to a complaint will mean
the admission of the facts contained in the latter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It will be noticed upon careful examination that this section does
not apply to the present case. It has reference to an answer filed to a
complaint brought to recover money or other personal or real property
charged or received in violation of the provisions of the Usury Law. In
other words, where the victim of usury files an action to recover what
has been exacted from him in violation of the Usury Law, the answer to
such a complaint must be under oath, otherwise the facts alleged in the
complaint will be deemed admitted.</p>
<p> The question of usury is therefore properly raised by the answer,
and it becomes necessary to consider whether the charges included in
the principal amount awarded by the court below are usurious in
character. There can be no question that the interests expressly
stipulated in the contract of mortgage—namely, 10 per cent and 12 per
cent, according to whether the terms of the agreement are complied with
or not—are within the limits prescribed by law; and with respect to the
other charges covered by the agreement, the same are those usually made
by building and loan associations and which have received the sanction
of the law. (Lopez and Javelona vs. El Hogar Filipino, 47 Phil., 249.)</p>
<ol start="3"><li> The third error assigned by the appellant
relates to the admission of the depositions contained in Exhibit K and
of Exhibits A and B mentioned in the deposition of Luis Garcia
Aldeguer, the secretary of the plaintiff corporation. Exhibit A is the
deed of mortgage, while Exhibit B is a statement of the account of the
appellant with the appellee. Appellant claims that in the taking of the
depositions, the requirements of section 361 of the Code of Civil
Procedure were not complied with. The evidence shows, however, that
these depositions were taken in the City of Manila before a notary
public; that notice was served on the appellant eight days before the
time fixed for taking the depositions. The notice was served on the
appellant and not on her attorney, since, at the time of the sending of
such notice, the plaintiff had no knowledge of the appointment of the
latter.</li></ol>
<p> We find that there has been a substantial compliance with the
requirements of section 361 of the Code of Civil Procedure, regarding
the taking of depositions.</p>
<ol start="4"><li> The fourth assignment of error concerns, the
amount of P6,000 awarded by the court below as attorney's fees. While
it is true that the decision of the court in this respect is fully in
accord with the terms of the mortgage contract, £this court has held
that the amount stipulated by the parties as attorney's fees may be
reduced to what is considered a reasonable amount under the
circumstances attending the case. (Bachrach vs. Golingco, 39 Phil.,
138; Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. vs. Tamaraw Plantation Co., 47
Phil., 513.) Considering the circumstances of this case, we think that
the amount of P3,000 is a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees.</li></ol>
<p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed with the only modification
that the amount of P6,000 therein awarded as attorney's fees be reduced
to P3,000. Costs will be taxed against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
