				<H3>ELPIDIO JAVELLANA, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LA PAZ ICE PLANT AND COLD STORAGE CO., INC., OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The oppositor La Paz Ice&nbsp; Plant and Cold Storage Co., Inc.,&nbsp; appeals to this court for the review of the decision rendered by the Public Service Commission, the&nbsp; dispositive part of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Finding, therefore, after a careful consideration of all the evidence of record that the approval of this application will promote the public&nbsp; interests in a proper and suitable manner, as required by law, the opposition filed by the La Paz Ice Plant &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc., is hereby overruled and the&nbsp; applicant, Elpidio Javellana,&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; authorized to install an additional producing unit with a capacity of 4 to 5 tons of ice daily in his ice plant in the municipality of Iloilo,&nbsp; Province of Iloilo,&nbsp; provided that the applicant should within 30 days from the date of notification hereof furnish this commission&nbsp; with more detailed&nbsp; information on the specifications of the additional producing unit herein authorized.</blockquote>"This decision takes effect immediately." In support of its appeal the appellant assigns the following alleged errors as committed by the Public Service Commission in its decision in&nbsp; question, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li> The Public Service&nbsp; Commission erred in granting the applicant Elpidio Javellana authority to install an ice producing unit with a capacity of from four to five tons of ice daily in his ice plant in the municipality of Iloilo.<br><br></li><li> The Public&nbsp; Service Commission&nbsp; erred in overruling the opposition filed by the&nbsp; La Paz Ice Plant and Cold Storage Co., Inc., to the application of the respondent Elpidio Javellana.<br><br></li><li> The Public Service&nbsp; Commission erred in not granting the motion for new trial&nbsp; presented by the oppositor-appellant."</li></ol></blockquote>The applicant attempted to prove the following facts:<br><blockquote>That&nbsp; he is the sole owner and&nbsp; operator of an ice plant established in the municipality of Iloilo with a population of about&nbsp; five&nbsp; thousand inhabitants;&nbsp; that he is authorized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public Service Commission&nbsp; to&nbsp; produce 10 tons of ice daily&nbsp; to be sold&nbsp; not only&nbsp; in the municipality of Iloilo but also in&nbsp; the&nbsp; neighboring municipalities; that the daily capacity of the two producing units which he acquired from their former owner C. N. Hodges is only from 5 to 6 tons due to wear and tear thereof and to the scarcity of water for refrigeration; that the water used by him for refrigerating his&nbsp; machine is obtained from the Iloilo river by means of a pipe passing through the Iloilo pier; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; water reaching&nbsp; the plant through the pipe in&nbsp; question is&nbsp; insufficient for his needs; that said pipe cannot be replaced by a bigger one nor can an additional pipe be installed due to the fact that the pier is made of concrete;&nbsp; that the additional unit that the applicant plans to install, if his application is approved, will be driven by an electric motor which will not require refrigerating water; that the 5 or 6 tons of ice now produced daily in his plant are insufficient to meet the demand for ice from the municipalities served by him; that he often has to take incompletely formed blocks of ice from the refrigerating tank for the purpose of&nbsp; meeting urgent demands; and that he is&nbsp; the owner of 4 fishing motor launches, requiring about 120 tons of ice monthly which had to&nbsp; be tied up for lack of ice.<br><br>The oppositor La Paz Ice Plant and Cold&nbsp; Storage Co., Inc., attempted to prove that it produces approximately 30 tons of ice daily, which amount is sufficient to&nbsp; satisfy the needs of the ice-consuming public&nbsp; of Iloilo; that the applicant's producing units may be repaired in order&nbsp; to reach at least&nbsp; 95 per cent of their original producing capacity, although the repair of the two units&nbsp; would cost more than the installation of an entirely new producing unit.<br><br>There is no question that notwithstanding the installation by the applicant of the new ice producing unit with a producing capacity of 15 tons&nbsp; daily,&nbsp; he cannot produce&nbsp; more than&nbsp; 10 tons of ice daily because his certificate of public convenience does not authorize him to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question for the public&nbsp; and for the&nbsp; oppositor company is that the applicant, with the installation, of a new ice-producing unit, should not be authorized to produce a greater quantity of ice than what is fixed by his certificate.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact that the applicant, with the new unit, may abuse and produce&nbsp; up to 15 tons of ice daily—as any public service&nbsp; may abuse— is no reason to withhold from the applicant permission to improve&nbsp; his machinery in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; make his&nbsp; production reach the limit fixed by the&nbsp; Public Service Commission for the benefit of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should not be&nbsp; assumed that the applicant abuses his&nbsp; certificate and produces a greater quantity of ice than what&nbsp; he is authorized to produce; but should he do so there is the commission to discipline and penalize him by suspending his certificate.<br><br>The Public Service Commission stated in its decision that after a careful consideration of all the evidence of record, it is&nbsp; of the opinion that the approval of&nbsp; the application presented by Elpidio Javellana will promote&nbsp; the public interests in a proper and suitable manner, as required by law. Finding that&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; of record reasonably supports and warrants the conclusions of the Public&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Commission, this&nbsp; court, not being&nbsp; permitted in such&nbsp; case to substitute by&nbsp; its own decision that of&nbsp; said commission, is constrained by the law to sustain the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Manila Electric Company vs. Balagtas,&nbsp; 58 Phil.,&nbsp; 429; Ampil vs. Public Service Commission, 59 Phil., 556; Calabia vs. Orlanes &amp; Banaag Transportation Co., 55 Phil., 659;&nbsp; Aleosan Transportation Company vs.&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service Commission, page 523, <span style="font-style: italic;">ante </span>Mindanao Bus Company vs. Maria Cristina Transportation Co., G. R. No. 43628, promulgated September 9, 1935&nbsp; [62 Phil., 956] and cases cited in this last decision.)</blockquote>Wherefore, not finding any error in the appealed decision, it is affirmed in all its parts, with costs to the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
