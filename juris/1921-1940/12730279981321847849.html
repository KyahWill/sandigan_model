<p>And that the baled hemp covered by these warehouse receipts was worth 
P31,635; receipts numbers 1707,133,1722, 1723,1634, and 1702 being endorsed in 
blank by the plaintiff and Otto Ranft, and numbers 1918 and.2, by Otto Ranft 
alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"4. That in the night of June 25, 1926, said Otto Ranft died suddenly at his 
home in the City of Manila.</p>
<p>"5. That both parties submit this agreed statement of facts, but reserve 
their right to have in evidence upon other points not included herein, and upon 
which they cannot come to an agreement.</p>
<p>"Manila, August 7, 1929."</p></blockquote>
<p>The evidence shows that on June 25, 1926, Ranft called at the office of the 
herein plaintiff to purchase hemp (abaca), and he was offered the bales of hemp 
as described in the <em>quedans</em> above mentioned. The parties agreed to the 
afore-said price, and on the same date the quedans, together with the covering 
invoice, were sent to Ranft by the plaintiff, without having been paid for the 
hemp, but the plaintiff's understanding was that the payment would be made 
against the same, <em>quedans</em>, and it appears that in previous transactions 
of the same kind between the bank and the plaintiff, <em>quedans </em>were paid 
one or two days after their delivery to them.</p>
<p>In the evening of the day upon which the quedans in question were delivered 
to the herein defendant, Ranft died, and when the plaintiff found that such was 
the case, it immediately demanded the return of the quedans, or the payment of 
the value, but was told that the quedans had been sent to the herein defendant 
as soon as they were received by Ranft.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter the plaintiff filed a claim for the aforesaid sum of 
P31,645 in the intestate proceedings of the estate of the deceased Otto Ranft, 
which on an appeal from the decision of the committee on claims, was allowed by 
the Court of First Instance in case No. 31372 (City of Manila). In the meantime, 
demand had been made by the plaintiff on the defendant bank for the return of 
the queldans, or their value, which demand was refused by the bank on the ground 
that it was a holder of the quedans in due course. Thereupon the plaintiff filed 
its first complaint against the defendant, wherein it alleged that it had "sold" 
the <em>quedans</em> in question to the deceased O. Ranft for cash, but that the 
said 0. Ranft had not fulfilled the conditions of the sale. Later on, plaintiff 
filed an amended complaint, wherein they changed the word "sold" referred to in 
the first complaint to the words "attempted to sell".</p>
<p>Upon trial the judge of the court below rendered judgment in favor of the 
plaintiff principally on the ground that in the opinion of the court the 
defendant bank "could not have acted in good faith for the reason that according 
to the statement of its own witness, Thiele, the <em>quedans</em> were delivered 
to the bank in order to secure the debts of Ranft for the payment of their value 
and from which it might be deduced that the said bank knew that the value of the 
said que'dans was not as yet paid when the same were endorsed to it, and its 
alleged belief that Ranft was the owner of the said <em>quedans</em> was not in 
accordance with the facts proved at the time"; and that, moreover, the 
circumstances were such that "the bank knew, or should have known, that Ranft 
had not yet acquired the ownership of the said <em>quedans</em> and that it 
therefore could not invoke the presumption that it was acting in good faith and 
without negligence on its part".</p>
<p>In our opinion the judgment of the court below is not tenable. It may be 
noted, <em>first,</em> that the <em>quedans</em> in question were negotiable in 
form; <em>second,</em> that they were pledged by Otto Ranft to the defendant 
bank to secure the payment of his preexisting debts to said bank (paragraph 3 of 
the Stipulation of Facts); <em>third,</em> that such of the <em>quedans</em> as 
were issued in the name of the plaintiff were duly endorsed in blank by the 
plaintiff and by Otto Ranft; and <em>fourth,</em> that the two remaining quedans 
which were issued directly in the name of Otto Ranft were also duly endorsed in 
blank by him.</p>
<p>When these <em>quedans</em> were thus negotiated, Otto Ranft was indebted to 
the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation in the sum of P622,753.22, which 
indebtedness was partly covered by <em>quedans.</em> He was also being pressed 
to deposit additional payments as a further security to the bank, and there is 
no doubt that the <em>quedans</em> here in question were received by the bank to 
secure the payment of Ranft's preexisting debts; it is so stated in paragraph 3 
of the stipulation of facts agreed on by the parties and hereinbefore 
quoted.</p>
<p>It further appears that it has been the practice of the bank in its 
transactions with Ranft that the value of the <em>quedans</em> has been entered 
in the current accounts between Ranft and the bank, but there is no evidence to 
the effect that the bank was at any time bound to pay back to Ranft the amount 
of any of the <em>quedans</em>, and there is nothing in the record to show that 
the bank has promised to pay the value of the <em>quedans</em> neither to Ranft 
nor to the herein plaintiffs; on the contrary, as stated ,in the stipulation "of 
facts, the "negotiable warehouse receipts—were pledged by Otto Ranft to the 
defendant Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation to secure the payment of 
his preexisting debts to the latter", and taking into consideration that the 
quedans were negotiable in form and duly endorsed in blank by the plaintiff and 
by Otto Ranft, it follows that on the delivery of the <em>quedans</em> to the 
bank they were no longer the property of the indorser unless he liquidated his 
debt with the bank.</p>
<p>In his brief the plaintiff insists that the defendant, before the delivery of 
the <em>quedans,</em> should have ascertained whether Ranft had any authority to 
negotiate the <em>quedans.</em></p>
<p>We are unable to find anything in the record which in any manner would have 
compelled the bank to investigate the indorser. The bank had a perfect right to 
act as it did, and its action is in accordance with sections 47, 38, and 40 of 
the Warehouse Receipts Act {Act No. 2137), which read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 47. <em>When negotiation not impaired by fraud, mistake, or 
duress.</em>—The validity of the negotiation, of a receipt is not impaired by 
the fact that such negotiation was a breach of duty on the part of the person 
making the negotiation, or by the fact that the owner of the receipt was induced 
by fraud, mistake, or duress to intrust the possession or custody of the receipt 
to such person, if the person to whom the receipt was negotiated, or a person to 
whom the receipt was subsequently negotiated, paid value therefor, without 
notice of the breach of duty, or fraud, mistake, or duress."</p>
<p>"SEC. 38. <em>Negotiation of negotiable receipts by indorsement.</em>—A 
negotiable receipt may be negotiated by the indorsement of the person to whose 
order the goods are, by the terms of the receipt, deliverable. Such indorsement 
may be in blank, to bearer or to a specified person. * * * Subsequent 
negotiation may be made in like manner."</p>
<p>"SEC. 40. <em>Who may negotiate a receipt.</em>—A negotiable receipt may be 
negotiated:</p>
<p>" (a) By the owner thereof, or</p>
<p>"(b) By any person to whom the possession or custody of fthe receipt has been 
entrusted by the owner, if, by the terms of the receipt, the warehouseman 
undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of the person to whom the 
possession or custody of the receipt has been entrusted, or<em> if at the time 
of such entrusting the receipt is in such form that it may be negotiated by 
delivery."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The question as to the rights the defendant bank acquired over the aforesaid 
quedans after indorsement and delivery to it by Ranft, we find in section 41 of 
the Warehouse Receipts Act (Act No. 2137) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 41.<em> Rights of person to whom a rdceipt has been negotiated.</em>—A 
person to whom a negotiable receipt has been duly negotiated acquires 
thereby:</p>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) Such title to the goods as the person negotiating the receipt 
to him had or had ability to convey to a purchaser in good faith for value, 
<em>and also such title to the goods as the depositor of person to whose order 
the goods were to be delivered by thd terms of the receipt had or had ability to 
convey to a, purchaser in good faith, for value, and * * 
*."</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of the Commercial National Bank of New Orleans vs. 
Canal-Louisiana Bank &amp; Trust Co. (239 U. S., 520), Chief Justice Hughes said 
in regard to negotiation of receipts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It will be observed that 'one who takes by trespass or a finder is not 
included within the description of those who may negotiate.' (Report of 
Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, January 1, 1910, p. 204.) Aside from this, 
the intention is plain to facilitate the use of warehouse veceipts as documents 
of title. Under sec. 40, the person who may negotiate the receipt is either the 
'owner thereof', or a 'person to whom the possession or custody of the receipt 
has been intrusted by the owner' if the receipt is in the form described. The 
warehouse receipt represents the goods, but the intrusting of the receipt, as 
stated, is more than the mere delivery of the goods; it is a representation that 
the one to whom the possession of the receipt has been so intrusted has the 
title to the goods. By sec. 47, the negotiation of the receipt to a purchaser 
for value without notice is not impaired by the fact that it is a breach of 
duty, or that the owner of the receipt was induced 'by fraud, mistake, or 
duress' to intrust the receipt to the person who negotiated it. And, under sec. 
41, one to whom the negotiable receipt has been duly negotiated acquires such 
title to the goods as the person negotiating the receipt to him, or the 
depositor or person to whose order the goods were deliverable by the terms of 
the receipt, either had or 'had ability to convey to a purchaser in good faith 
for value.' The clear import of these provisions is that if the owner of the 
goods permits another to have the possession or custody of negotiable warehouse 
receipts running to the order of the latter, or to bearer, it is a 
representation of title upon which <em>bona fide</em> purchasers for value are 
entitled to rely, despite breaches of trust or violations of agreement on the 
part of the apparent owner."</p></blockquote>
<p>In its second assignment of error, the defendant-appellant maintains that the 
plaintiff-appellee is estopped to deny that the bank had a valid title to the 
<em>quedans</em> for the reason that the plaintiff had voluntarily clothed Ranft 
with all the attributes of ownership and upon which the defendant bank relied. 
In our opinion, the appellant's view is correct. In the National Safe Deposit 
<em>vs.</em> Hibbs (229 U. S., 391), certain certificates of stock were pledged 
as collateral by the defendant in error to the plaintiff bank, which 
certificates were converted by one of the trusted employees of the bank to his 
own use and sold by him. The stock certificates were unqualifiedly endorsed in 
blank by the defendant when delivered to the bank. The Supreme Court of the 
United States through Justice Day applied the familiar rule of equitable 
estoppel that where one of two innocent persons must suffer a loss he who by his 
conduct made the loss possible must bear it, using the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We think this ease correctly states the principle, and, applied to the case 
in hand, is decisive of it. Here one of two innocent persons must suffer and the 
question at last is, Where shall the loss fall? It is undeniable that the broker 
obtained the stock certificates, containing all the indicia of ownership and 
possible of ready transfer, from one who had possession with the bank's consent, 
and who brought the certificates to him, apparently clothed with the full 
ownership thereof by all the tests usually applied by business-men to gain 
knowledge upon the subject before making a purchase of such property. On the 
other hand, the bank, for a legitimate purpose, with confidence in one of its 
own employees, intrusted the certificates to him, with every evidence of title 
and transferability upon them. The bank's trusted agent, in gross breach of his 
duty, whether With technical criminality or not is unimportant, took such 
certificates, thus authenticated with evidence of title, to one who, in the 
ordinary course of business, sold them to parties who paid full value for them. 
In such case we think the principles which underlie equitable estoppel place the 
loss upon him whose misplaced confidence has made the wrong possible. * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>We regret that the plaintiff in this case has suffered the loss of the 
<em>quedans</em>, but as far as we can see, there is now no remedy available to 
the plaintiff. The bank is not responsible for the loss; the negotiable 
<em>quedans</em> were duly negotiated to the bank and as far as the record 
shows, there has been no fraud on the part of the defendant.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is reversed and the-appellant is absolved from the 
plaintiff's complaint. Without costs. So ordered.</p>
