				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>In mortgage foreclosure proceedings instituted in the Court of First Instance 
of Manila, the Postal Savings Bank of the Philippine Islands secured judgment 
against Carmen Sackermann de Macleod on its first mortgage of certain property 
belonging to the defendant, for P22,459.25, made up of T20,0Q0 capital, 2,393.36 
accrued interest, and ?65.89 premiums, with interest on the gross amount at 
seven per cent per annum beginning with the date of the judgment and continuing 
until payment, with costs. L. B. Robinson likewise was given judgment on his 
second mortgage, on the same property of the defendant, for P6,000, with 
interest at twelve per cent per annum beginning with October 28,1922, and 
continuing until payment, with costs. On appeal, the defendant asks for a 
modification of the first mentioned judgment, in that part which relates to the 
payment of interest, and for a complete reversal of the last mentioned judgment 
on the ground of usury.</p>
<p>The computation of interest occasionally presents intricate situations. Legal 
provisions on the subject of interest on interest are found in the Civil Code, 
article 1109, in the Usury Law (Act No. 2655), section 5, and in the Code of 
Civil Procedure, section 510, as well as in the Code of Commerce, article 317, 
which we do not here consider. Compound interest is allowed from the date when 
interest, although not expressly reserved, is judicially demanded. </p>
<p>Article 1109 of the Civil Code and section 5 of the Usury Law have been 
interpreted by Mr. Justice Avancefia, speaking for this Court in the case of 
Bachrach Garage and Taxicab Co. <em>vs.</em> Golingco ([1919], 39 Phil., 912, 
919), as follows: " * * * Article 1109 of the Civil Code only permits accrued 
interests to" earn legal interest from the time they have been judicially 
claimed. Section 5 of Act No. 2655 also prohibits accrued interests to earn 
interest, except when there has been an agreement or when they have been 
judicially claimed. * * * Section 5 of the above-cited Act No. 2655 only permits 
an interest of 6 per cent on accrued interests from the time they are judicially 
claimed." (<em>See further </em>Inchausti &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Yulo [1914], 34 
Phil., 978; Government of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Schenkel and 
Gonzales [1922], 43 Phil., 616; and II Kincaid, <em>Codigo Civil</em> Anotado, 
pp. 776-778.) Section 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply to a 
case where the obligation sued on bears interest. (Pepperell <em>vs.</em> Taylor 
[1906], 5 Phil., 536.)</p>
<p>The interest stipulated in the first mortgage was seven per cent per annum, 
payable semiannually. The mortgage contained no provision for compound interest. 
The judgment accordingly should have been for P20,000 with interest at seven per 
cent per annum from May 16, 1923, when the crosscomplaint was filed, and for the 
interest, P816.67, up to May 16, 1923, plus P65.89 premiums or P882.56, with 
interest at six per cent per annum from May 16, 1923. Beyond this, to sanction 
interest on interest computed at semiannual or other periods of time, it is not 
practicable to go.</p>
<p>The judgment of the trial court as to the second mortgage, with special 
reference to the pleadings, is correct. The defense of usury was not raised by 
the defendant in the trial court. Usury, as a defense, must be set up in the 
answer to entitle it to consideration. (Act No. 2655, sec. 9; Atlantic, 
Tennessee and Ohio Railroad Co. <em>vs.</em> Carolina National Bank of Columbia 
[1874], 86 U. S., 548.) Further, if need be, the court would be justified in 
ruling that, while the interest specified in the Usury Law' designates the 
permissible rate for mortgage loans as not higher than twelve per cent, this 
provision does not require interest to be computed at yearly intervals only. (27 
R. C. L., p. 229; Meyer &amp; Stucken <em>vs.</em> City of Muscatine [1864]. 1 
Wall., 384; 46 Am. St. Rep., 189, note.)</p>
<p>The judgment as to the Postal Savings Bank mortgage shall be modified in the 
sense that the defendant Carmen Sackermann de Macleod shall pay to the Postal 
Savings Bank of the Philippine Islands the sum of P20,000 with interest at seven 
per cent per annum from May 16, 1923, until payment, and P882.56 with interest 
at six per cent per annum from May 16, 1923, until payment. The judgment as to 
the Robinson mortgage shall be affirmed in all respects. Without special 
pronouncement as to costs in this instance, it is so ordered.</p>
