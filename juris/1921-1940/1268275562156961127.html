				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The information filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Laguna&nbsp; against Melecio A. Reyes, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; undersigned charges Melecio A. Reyes&nbsp; with&nbsp; the crime of&nbsp; '<span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> through&nbsp; falsification of a&nbsp; private&nbsp; document,' committed&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"That during the period from July 1, 1929, to July 31, 1929, both dates inclusive, in the municipality of&nbsp; Calamba, Province of Laguna,&nbsp; Philippine Islands,&nbsp; and within the jurisdiction of this court, the accused above-named, being then employed as timekeeper of the Calamba Sugar Estate, wilfully,&nbsp; unlawfully,&nbsp; and feloniously, with&nbsp; animus lucrandi and the deliberate intent of defrauding and injuring said Calamba Sugar Estate, made it appear in the time book prepared by said accused for the aforementioned period of time, to wit, from July 1, 1929 to July 31, 1929, both dates&nbsp; inclusive,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; day-laborer Ciriaco Sario had worked twenty-one days, whereas he was fully aware that Ciriaco Sario had worked&nbsp; but eleven&nbsp; days only during that period of&nbsp; time; thereby committing a falsehood in the narration of facts in said time book, and by means of this falsification,&nbsp; the aforesaid defendant appropriated the sum of ten pesos&nbsp; to his own use and&nbsp; personal benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the Calamba Sugar Estate in that amount, which&nbsp; is&nbsp; equivalent to fifty pesetas,<br><br>"Contrary to law."</blockquote></blockquote>The accused&nbsp; in this case&nbsp; was in&nbsp; charge&nbsp; of entering the laborers' workdays in the time book of the Calamba Sugar Estate.&nbsp; He is accused of having falsified the time book by making it appear that the laborer&nbsp; Ciriaco Sario worked twenty-one days during the month&nbsp; of July, 1929, when in reality he had only worked eleven; and having charged the wages of said laborer for twenty-one days, at the&nbsp; rate of Pi&nbsp; a day, he prejudiced the Calamba Sugar Estate in the amount of P10.<br><br>The evidence shows the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; But he defends himself, alleging&nbsp; that it was one Erquiza, who collected the wages appertaining to Sario.&nbsp; This individual, however,&nbsp; was not produced to testify in the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any event, it appears that the accused, knowing that&nbsp; Ciriaco Sario&nbsp; worked only&nbsp; eleven days, altered and falsified&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; book, putting down twenty-one workdays for Ciriaco Sario, and&nbsp; this&nbsp; constitutes the crime of falsification&nbsp; of a&nbsp; private document to the prejudice of&nbsp; a&nbsp; third person.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court found the accused guilty of the crime of <i>estafa</i> through falsification of a private document, and sentenced him to four years, two months, and one day of <i>prision&nbsp; correctional,</i> with&nbsp; the accessories of the law, to pay a fine of 250 <i>pesetas</i>,&nbsp; and to indemnify&nbsp; the Calamba Sugar Estate in the sum of P11, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency with reference to the fine&nbsp; and the indemnity.<br><br>The Attorney-General recommends the affirmance of the judgment&nbsp; appealed from with the modification&nbsp; that the fine should be&nbsp; imposed in the&nbsp; maximum degree, i&nbsp; e., in the amount of 6,250 <i>pesetas</i>, and that the indemnity be P10,&nbsp; taking into account article 89 of the Penal Code, in view&nbsp; of the fact that the offense is <i>estafa</i>, as defined and penalized in article 304 in&nbsp; connection with article 300, paragraphs 2 and 4, as amended, and article 535 of the Penal Code.<br><br>The accused appealed from&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; and his assignments&nbsp; of&nbsp; error refer to the weight of the evidence, with the exception of the fifth, which relates to the penalty of four years, two months, and one day&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>presidio correctional</i>, and the fine of 250&nbsp; <i>pesetas.</i><br><br>There is no question as to the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only difficulty in this appeal lies in the interpretation to&nbsp; be&nbsp; given to article 304 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; This article provides:<br><blockquote>"Any person who,&nbsp; to the&nbsp; damage of another, or with the intent to cause such damage,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; in any&nbsp; private document commit any of the acts&nbsp; of falsification enumerated in article three hundred shall suffer the penalty of <i>presidio correctional</i> in its minimum and medium&nbsp; degrees and be fined in a sum not less than six hundred and twentyfive and not more than six thousand two hundred and fifty <i>pesetas.</i>"</blockquote>This article has been interpreted by this court in several cases, apparently from different points of view.<br><br>In United States vs.&nbsp; De Castro and&nbsp; Aragon (18 Phil., 417),&nbsp; the accused was charged with the crime of <i>estafa</i> through falsification of&nbsp; a private document; he was convicted of <i>estafa</i>, and&nbsp; in imposing the penalty,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court took&nbsp; article&nbsp; 89 of the Penal Code into&nbsp; account.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the course of the decision, this court said:<br><blockquote>"The information alleges and&nbsp; the proofs show that&nbsp; the appellant in this case committed two distinct crimes,&nbsp; one of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa,</span> defined and punished under subdivision 1, article 535,&nbsp; of the Penal&nbsp; Code, and, the crime of falsification of a private document, defined and punished in article 304 of said&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; Inasmuch, however, as the one crime was a necessary means of committing the other, the accused&nbsp; can not be punished for both offenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the provisions of article 89 of the Penal Code, he must be&nbsp; punished in the maximum&nbsp; degree&nbsp; of the more serious crime.&nbsp; Falsification of a private document is the more serious of&nbsp; the two&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; it is punished not only by&nbsp; <i>presidio&nbsp; correctional</i> in its minimum and medium degrees, as <i>estafa</i> is punished, but also by a fine of from 625 to 6,250 <i>pesetas</i>. The&nbsp; maximum degree&nbsp; of <i>presidio correctional</i>&nbsp; in its&nbsp; minimum and medium degrees is from two years, eleven months, and eleven days to four years and two months.&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalty imposed&nbsp; by the learned trial court is, therefore, within&nbsp; the law."</blockquote>United States vs. Victoria&nbsp; (9 Phil., 81)&nbsp; was&nbsp; decided otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused was charged&nbsp; with&nbsp; falsification of a&nbsp; private document with prejudice to&nbsp; a third&nbsp; person, according to article 304 of the Penal Code,&nbsp; and was convicted and sentenced to the&nbsp; penalty fixed in said&nbsp; article, i.&nbsp; e., one year, eleven months,&nbsp; and twenty-one days&nbsp; of <i>presidio&nbsp; correctional</i> and a fine of 625 <i>pesetas</i>, to indemnify the&nbsp; offended party in the amount of P20, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the course of&nbsp; the decision,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"The fact that the agent informed his employer that the cost&nbsp; of the installation was P10, while he told the person desiring&nbsp; the installation that it would cost P30, subsequently&nbsp; altering the former's bill&nbsp; in order to recover a larger sum from the latter in pursuance of his deceitful purpose,&nbsp; involves the&nbsp; characteristics of the crime of&nbsp; <i>estafa</i>, besides that of&nbsp; falsification&nbsp; which served&nbsp; as the means for its&nbsp; commission,&nbsp; because by adopting deceitful means he obtained a price&nbsp; which he would not otherwise have secured by telling the truth."&nbsp; However, the&nbsp; offense was not considered to&nbsp; constitute the complex&nbsp; crime of <i>estafa</i> through falsification of a&nbsp; private document,&nbsp; nor was the rule contained in article&nbsp; 89 applied,&nbsp; so as to impose the penalty for the more serious offense in its maximum degree.<br><br>In United&nbsp; States vs. Chan Tiao (37 Phil.,&nbsp; 78), the accused was prosecuted for the crime of <i>estafa</i>&nbsp; through falsification&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; private document&nbsp; and sentenced to&nbsp; two years, eleven&nbsp; months, and ten days of <i>presidio correctional</i> (maximum of the medium&nbsp; degree)&nbsp; the accessories of the law, a fine of 2,000 <i>pesetas</i>, to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P315, which is the value&nbsp; of twenty-three sacks of sugar not recovered,&nbsp; and to pay the&nbsp; costs.</blockquote>Chan Tiao, desiring to profit in the amount of P2,055, which is the&nbsp; value of one hundred and fifty sacks of sugar belonging to&nbsp; the firm&nbsp; Smith, Bell &amp; Co., forged the document Exhibit A, purporting to be signed by the manager of the&nbsp; Chinese firm <i>Ortiga&nbsp; Hermanos</i>,&nbsp; presenting it with an&nbsp; authentic&nbsp; document of guarantee to the vendor firm, which would&nbsp; undoubtedly have refused to deliver the sugar on&nbsp; ten days' time, but for said forged document, for it was not issued by the manager of <i>Ortiga&nbsp; Hermanos</i>, and the signature appearing on it is not legitimate or genuine, which act certainly constitutes the crime&nbsp; of falsification of a private document, to the prejudice of the firm&nbsp; Smith, Bell &amp; Co., the owner of the sugar, a crime&nbsp; defined and penalized in article 304 of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the course of the decision, the court said:<br><blockquote>"The crime committed should be classified only as that of falsification of a private&nbsp; document,&nbsp; for the reason that the fraudulent gain obtained&nbsp; by the falsifier is involved in the harm caused—an essential and indispensable ingredient for&nbsp; the existence of the crime of falsification of a private document; and it cannot be classified as <i>estafa</i> with falsification, nor may the penalty for a more serious crime be applied, pursuant to the provision of article&nbsp; 89 of the Penal Code, inasmuch as the harm occasioned&nbsp; or intended by&nbsp; the perpetrator of the crime does not constitute <i>estafa</i>,"</blockquote>And&nbsp; in People&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Rosales&nbsp; (G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 19723,&nbsp; not reported)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>, the accused was prosecuted for the crime of&nbsp; <i>estafa</i>&nbsp; through falsification&nbsp; of a&nbsp; private&nbsp; document.&nbsp; The court convicted him&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>,&nbsp; but&nbsp; without applying&nbsp; the rule&nbsp; established in article 89&nbsp; of the Penal Code.&nbsp; In the course of the decision, the court said:<br><blockquote>"The Attorney-General contends that the foregoing facts constitute the crime of&nbsp; falsification defined in article 305 (should be 304)&nbsp; and that of <i>estafa</i> defined in article 535 of the Penal Code,&nbsp; the first as a necessary means for committing the&nbsp; second.&nbsp; Although the facts&nbsp; may constitute one&nbsp; or the other of these&nbsp; crimes, they cannot constitute both.&nbsp; As falsification according to article 305, an essential element of which is&nbsp; the animus lucrandi or the prejudice to a third person, it involves&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>estafa</i>. (Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain, April 10, 1889.) As <i>estafa</i>, of which deceit is the essential element, it also involves&nbsp; falsification&nbsp; under article 305, as the determinant of this deceit.<br><br>"The foregoing facts only constitute the crime of <i>estafa</i> defined and penalized in article 535, paragraph 1, in&nbsp; connection with article 534, paragraph 3, of the Penal Code, because the appellant appropriated the 2,500 electric light bulbs specified in this forged order,&nbsp; the value of which is 6,798.75 <i>pesetas</i>.<br><br>"Wherefore, the judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is modified, and the appellant sentenced to one year, eight months, and twenty-one days of <i>presidio correctional</i>, to indemnify the offended&nbsp; corporation in the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P1,359.75. or&nbsp; to undergo&nbsp; the subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of insolvency, and to pay the costs&nbsp; of the trial."</blockquote>Viada, in his Commentaries on the Spanish Penal Code, article 318 (related to 304&nbsp; of our Code), 5th ed., vol. 4, p. 130,&nbsp; propounds the following question:<br><blockquote>"<i>When a private document is&nbsp; forged to defraud a third person, is the crime</i> FALSIFICATION <i>under article 318,&nbsp; and also</i>&nbsp; ESTAFA <i>under article&nbsp; 548</i>?—The&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court answered the question in the negative,&nbsp; when&nbsp; it&nbsp; quashed&nbsp; a judgment of the Audience of Barcelona, holding the contrary : 'Whereas, considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense at bar as falsification of a private document,&nbsp; article&nbsp; 90 of the Code, in connection with No. 1, article 548, is&nbsp; not applicable, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; falsity&nbsp; and the fraud,&nbsp; or&nbsp; intent to prejudice another,&nbsp; are elements&nbsp; of the crime defined in article 318 so indispensably and precisely conjoined that they cannot be segregated,&nbsp; considering the falsification as a means to commit the <i>estafa</i>, and thereby&nbsp; raising the penalty to the maximum&nbsp; degree,&nbsp; etc.'&nbsp; (Decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; February 18, 1891, Gaceta of August&nbsp; 22.)</blockquote>"The&nbsp; same&nbsp; doctrine&nbsp; appears in&nbsp; a&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; case:<br><blockquote>'Whereas,&nbsp; in view of the&nbsp; falsification of a private document with the intent to prejudice a third person, the offense committed by&nbsp; German Gonzalez&nbsp; is merely the crime defined and penalized in article&nbsp; 318 of&nbsp; the Code, which in itself combines the two elements of falsity and prejudice to a third&nbsp; person;&nbsp; whence the trial&nbsp; court, holding that there are two&nbsp; crimes: falsification and <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>,&nbsp; one being the means of committing the&nbsp; other, has erred in&nbsp; point of law,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; (Decision of November 22, 1893,&nbsp; Gaceta of August 17, 1894.)"&nbsp; (<i>See&nbsp; also</i>,&nbsp; the decision of April 19, 1905.)</blockquote>A careful examination of the&nbsp; cases cited will show that in the De Castro case, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; the court considered the accused&nbsp; guilty of two different&nbsp; crimes:&nbsp; <i>Estafa,</i> defined&nbsp; and penalized in paragraph 1, article&nbsp; 535 of the Penal Code; and falsification of a private document, defined and penalized in article 304 of said Code.&nbsp; And, applying article 89 of the Penal Code, the court&nbsp; imposed the penalty fixed in article 304 in the maximum degree.&nbsp; In the Victoria case, article 304 of the Penal Code was applied, without taking&nbsp; into account the complex nature of the crime, or the provisions of article 89 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; In the Chan Tiao&nbsp; case, the penalty provided in article 304, Penal Code, was imposed but without taking article 89 into account,&nbsp; and in this case it was held that the&nbsp; prejudice occasioned or intended by&nbsp; the offender, does not constitute the&nbsp; crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>.&nbsp; And&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Rosales case, the accused was sentenced to the penalty fixed in article 534 of the Penal Code, but without applying article 89 of the Code.<br><br>Therefore,&nbsp; where the defendant is&nbsp; accused&nbsp; of <i>estafa</i> with falsification of&nbsp; a private document, or falsification of a private document&nbsp; with&nbsp; prejudice to a third person, the weight of authority&nbsp; favors the doctrine that there are not two&nbsp; distinct crimes committed, <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> and falsification, and&nbsp; that article&nbsp; 89 of the Penal Code is not&nbsp; applicable.&nbsp; And this is the doctrine followed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Spain in construing article 318 of the old Spanish Penal Code (art. 304 of ours).&nbsp; But it should be observed that although articles 304 and 534, paragraph 3, of our Penal Code, provide the same personal penalty, i. e., <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio&nbsp; correctional</span> in&nbsp; the minimum&nbsp; and medium degrees, the first of these&nbsp; articles further provides a&nbsp; fine ranging from 625 to 6,250 <i>pesetas</i>; and that&nbsp; article 534 was amended, on November 28, 1925, by&nbsp; section&nbsp; 2 of Act No. 3244, which adds&nbsp; paragraph 4, providing the penalty of <i>presidio correctional</i> in the maximum degree to <i>presidio mayor</i> in the minimum,&nbsp; if the fraud exceeds fifty thousand <i>pesetas</i>.&nbsp; In view of this amendment,&nbsp; we are of the opinion that if an&nbsp; information is filed charging the accused with the crime&nbsp; of <i>estafa</i> through falsification&nbsp; of a private document, and the value of the fraud exceeds 50,000 <i>pesetas</i>, all of which is proved at the trial, the proper penalty would be that&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; in paragraph 4, article 534, of the Penal Code.<br><br>By virtue of the foregoing considerations, we are of opinion and so hold that the defendant's falsification of the time&nbsp; book, with the intent of gain at the expense of the Calamba Sugar Estate&nbsp; constitutes the crime of falsification of a private&nbsp; document with prejudice to a third person, defined and penalized in article 304 of the Penal&nbsp; Code. Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is&nbsp; modified, and the accused sentenced&nbsp; to one&nbsp; year,&nbsp; eight months, and twenty-one days of <i>presidio correctional</i>,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the accessories of the law, a fine&nbsp; in the amount of 2,501 pesetas, and to indemnify&nbsp; the Calamba Sugar Estate in the amount of P10, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency with&nbsp; reference to the fine and&nbsp; the indemnity,&nbsp; not to exceed&nbsp; one-third of the&nbsp; principal penalty, and to&nbsp; pay the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Romualdez, Villa-Real</i>, and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> Promulgated September 20, 1923.</div>
