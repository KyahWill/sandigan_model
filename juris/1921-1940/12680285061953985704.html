				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The trial judge was right&nbsp; in convicting the accused for the theft of twelve phonograph records&nbsp; and one flashlight, valued at P30.30, and in considering the accused as an habitual delinquent.&nbsp; No consent, express or implied,&nbsp; on the part of the offended party for the accused to take the records and flashlight was established.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recidivism was properly taken into account as&nbsp; an aggravating circumstance, independently of the provisions of the Habitual Delinquent Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People vs. Aguinaldo [1925], 47 Phil., 728.)<br><br>The Habitual Delinquent Law, Act No. 3397, is attacked as an <i>ex post facto</i> law in&nbsp; violation of the&nbsp; Organic Act. This court has heretofore held&nbsp; the&nbsp; Habitual&nbsp; Delinquent Law valid&nbsp; as not inflicting&nbsp; cruel or&nbsp; unusual punishment, (People vs. Madrano [1928], 53 Phil., 860.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The present contention is equally unsustainable.&nbsp; Statutes which authorize a more severe punishment to be imposed upon one convicted of a second or subsequent offense are not objectionable upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that they are <i>ex&nbsp; post&nbsp; facto</i> laws. Such statutes, the United States&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court has&nbsp; said, do&nbsp; not impose&nbsp; any additional punishment for&nbsp; the&nbsp; former crimes, but simply impose a&nbsp; punishment on future crimes, the&nbsp; penalty therefor being&nbsp; enhanced&nbsp; on&nbsp; account of the criminal propensities of the accused.&nbsp; (McDonald vs. Massachusetts [1900], 180 U. S., 311.)<br><br>Conforming, therefore, with the pronouncements of the trial court, except that, as recommended by the Attorney-General, there must&nbsp; be a modification of the&nbsp; period of imprisonment, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed, it being understood that the defendant and appellant&nbsp; is sentenced to two&nbsp; years, four months, and one day&nbsp; imprisonment,&nbsp; <i>presidio&nbsp; correctional</i>, to&nbsp; indemnify the offended party in the amount of P30.30, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with&nbsp; the appropriate accessory penalties, and with the&nbsp; costs of both instances;&nbsp; and to an additional&nbsp; penalty of ten years' imprisonment as an habitual delinquent.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez, Villa-Real,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
