				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action brought by the provincial&nbsp; sheriff of Zamboanga&nbsp; to&nbsp; require the defendants&nbsp; to interplead and litigate their respective claims and rights to the net proceeds of the sale&nbsp; of personal property&nbsp; belonging to&nbsp; one Emilio Cano.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the case shapes up,&nbsp; the only question to be determined is as to which claim,&nbsp; that of the Government&nbsp; based&nbsp; on a tax lien,&nbsp; or that of Torrejon, Jurika &amp; Co., Inc., based on&nbsp; a final money judgment,&nbsp; is&nbsp; preferred, with reference to the funds in the possession of the sheriff.`<br><br>The amended complaint in connection with&nbsp; the exhibits disclose the following: Torrejon,&nbsp; Jurika &amp; Co., Inc., obtained a judgment against Emilio Cano for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P310.11 on April 11, 1932.&nbsp; No appeal&nbsp; having been taken from that judgment,&nbsp; it became final.&nbsp; Part of it, P130.32 exclusive of interest, and&nbsp; costs, has not yet been satisfied. Under Civil Code article 1924,&nbsp; paragraph 3&nbsp; (6), this is a preferred claim.<br><br>It further appears&nbsp; that on December&nbsp; 24, 1932, the merchandise of Emilio Cano was taken over by&nbsp; the provincial sheriff by virtue of a writ of preliminary attachment issued in a Pampanga case.&nbsp; On January 19,&nbsp; 1933,&nbsp; the Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; filed a third party claim, alleging that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was entitled to possession of the property under the provisions of section 1590 of the Administrative Code in view of the failure of Emilio Cano to pay certain internal&nbsp; revenue taxes to the&nbsp; Government.&nbsp; The property attached was sold at public auction on August 18,1933, and there was realized therefrom a net proceeds of P172.72. This would&nbsp; not be sufficient to satisfy the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the Government which amounts to P849.65.<br><br>It should&nbsp; finally be&nbsp; explained that the tax liability&nbsp; of Emilio Cano referred mainly to under declared sales from March 1, 1930&nbsp; to July, 1931, and for the fourth quarter of 1932, the first established by Exhibit I-A, dated January 16, 1933.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 1588&nbsp; of the Administrative&nbsp; Code provides&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"<i>Nature and extent of tax lien</i>.â€”Every internal-revenue tax on&nbsp; property&nbsp; or&nbsp; on any&nbsp; business&nbsp; or&nbsp; occupation&nbsp; and every tax on resources and receipts, and any increment&nbsp; to any of&nbsp; them incident&nbsp; to&nbsp; delinquency, shall constitute a lien superior to all other charges or liens not only on the property itself upon&nbsp; which such tax may be imposed but also upon the property used in any business or occupation upon which&nbsp; the&nbsp; tax is imposed and&nbsp; upon&nbsp; all&nbsp; property rights therein."</blockquote>The lien created by the&nbsp; Internal Revenue Law is paramount.&nbsp; It attaches to property which is used in the business at the time when the tax becomes due.&nbsp; As against other&nbsp; claims&nbsp; or&nbsp; encumbrances, it is given&nbsp; preference. (Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation vs.&nbsp; Rafferty [1918],&nbsp; 39 Phil.,&nbsp; 145;&nbsp; Macondray&nbsp; &amp; Co. vs.&nbsp; Go Bun Pin [1928], 52 Phil., 451.)<br><br>The two cases above cited are discussed by the parties. They should&nbsp; be&nbsp; understood having regard&nbsp; to their facts. In the first case, it was held that the tax lien does not establish itself upon property which has been transferred to&nbsp; innocent&nbsp; purchasers prior to demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff was there protected because on the date the property was transferred to it no demand had been made&nbsp; and the&nbsp; plaintiff had&nbsp; no notice of the&nbsp; tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second case, the plaintiff&nbsp; had&nbsp; obtained an attachment&nbsp; of property and had sold it, and while the&nbsp; money was thus in the custody of the court the Government intervened but without success. The reason was&nbsp; because the attached property&nbsp; had already been seized and&nbsp; sold at the time the tax in question fell due.<br><br>It is&nbsp; now incumbent upon us to give application of the foregoing principles to the admitted facts.<br><br>The merchant's tax became due and payable prior to January 1, 1933,&nbsp; and was justified&nbsp; shortly&nbsp; thereafter.&nbsp; At that time, Torrejon, Jurika &amp; Co., Inc., had a final judgment, but which had been made effective as to the property of Cano not through its own efforts but through the efforts of a third party.&nbsp; Conceding for present purposes that the preference in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; internal revenue tax only accrues after the lien has&nbsp; attached,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; not clear that the lien had not attached to property actually in use.&nbsp; At least, when the tax&nbsp; in&nbsp; question fell due, the property had&nbsp; not been seized and sold.<br><br>The delay on the part of the Government does not constitute a waiver.&nbsp;&nbsp; The distinction&nbsp; attempted to be drawn between the articles of merchandise and the&nbsp; proceeds of the sale is more refined than tenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think that the facts in this case can&nbsp; be differentiated from&nbsp; those found in the Philippine cases relied upon&nbsp; by the parties, with the result that the claim of the&nbsp; Government predicated on a tax lien must be held superior to the claim of the private litigant predicated on&nbsp; a&nbsp; judgment.<br><br>Agreeable to the foregoing,&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; will be reversed&nbsp; and the trial court&nbsp; directed to turn&nbsp; over to&nbsp; the Collector of Internal Revenue the sum of P172.72 to be applied to the partial payment of its claim&nbsp; against Emilio Cano.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered, without special&nbsp; pronouncement as to the costs in either&nbsp; instance.<br><br><i>Villa-Real, Imperial,&nbsp; Butte,</i> and <i>Goddard, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
