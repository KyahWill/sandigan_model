				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to reverse a judgment of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of the Province&nbsp; of Cavite, finding&nbsp; the appellant, Ariston Luncay, guilty of the offense of robbery with serious physical&nbsp; injuries and&nbsp; sentencing him, with his co-accused, Maximo Nepomuceno, to undergo imprisonment&nbsp; for ten years and one day, <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio mayor,</span> with the accessories prescribed by law, and&nbsp; requiring them to pay jointly and severally to W. P. Hamil the sum of KL7, and to pay each one-third part of the&nbsp; costs.<br><br>The proof shows beyond peradventure of doubt that on the night of May 12, 1925, the appellant, Ariston Luncay, and Maximo Nepomuceno, in conjunction with a third person whose identity has not been established, assaulted one W. P. Hamil while the latter was riding in a <span style="font-style: italic;">calesa&nbsp; </span>near the barrio of San Roque, Cavite.&nbsp; The&nbsp; party assaulted was&nbsp; able to discern the faces of two of his assailants from the lights of the <span style="font-style: italic;">calesa</span>, as said two approached him on either side of the vehicle.&nbsp; These two were the appellant, Ariston Luneay, and&nbsp; his&nbsp; co-accused,&nbsp; Maximo&nbsp; Nepomuceno.&nbsp; Approaching near the vehicle, the said two attacked Hamil and gave him several blows on the face and head, by reason of which Hamil lost&nbsp; consciousness.&nbsp; He was then robbed&nbsp; of&nbsp; P17 which he&nbsp; had upon his person and his unconscious body was thrown out of the <span style="font-style: italic;">calesa </span>in a swampy place about 200 yards&nbsp; from the&nbsp; nearest house.&nbsp; He was there found the next morning covered with blood&nbsp; and lying in an unconscious state.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken to the Army&nbsp; and Navy Hospital at Canacao, Hamil&nbsp; was treated by a physician, and in time he recovered, though the hearing of one ear was destroyed by one of the blows he had received.&nbsp; Among other injuries Hamil suffered were a fracture of the jaw, a fracture of the skull,&nbsp; and several lacerated wounds or&nbsp; bruises.&nbsp; The evidence shows that in this&nbsp; assault Ariston&nbsp; Luncay used iron knucks (<span style="font-style: italic;">Llave inglesa</span>) while Nepomuceno used a stick.<br><br>The testimony of Hamil in respect to the&nbsp; identification of the appellant as one of&nbsp; his assailants is placed beyond doubt by the testimony of Arsenio Concepcion, a boy about 16 years of age&nbsp; who was at first joined in the complaint as a confederate&nbsp; of the other two; but at the request of the fiscal,&nbsp; the prosecution was dismissed as to&nbsp; him at the hearing and he was used as a witness for the prosecution. We suppose&nbsp; that&nbsp; this fellow was&nbsp; the unidentified third person who took part in the commission of the offense, but he renounced the honor of having been a willing participant and claims that the third assailant was another person than himself.&nbsp; We have no hesitation in accepting his testimony as corroborative&nbsp; of Hamil as to the identity of two of the miscreants.<br><br>The offense committed is punishable under paragraph 3 of article 503 in relation with paragraph 2 of article 416 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; In connection with the offense are to be appreciated the&nbsp; aggravating circumstances&nbsp; of nocturnity and the use of iron knucks.&nbsp; With less certainty might be considered the&nbsp; additional&nbsp; aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and that the offense was committed in an uninhabited place.&nbsp; The lower court appreciated in favor of the appellant the mitigating circumstance indicated in article 11 of the Penal Code, as amended.&nbsp; This concession was probably not merited, but in the face of, the aggravating circumstances mentioned,&nbsp; it does not avail to reduce the penalty lower than the minimum of the maximum degree of the penalty prescribed by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; As suggested by the Attorney-General, the&nbsp; penalty appropriate to the&nbsp; offense&nbsp; is&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; for&nbsp; seventeen&nbsp; years,&nbsp; four months, and one day, <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal,</span> with the appropriate accessories.<br><br>It being understood that the&nbsp; penalty shall be imprisonment for seventeen years, four months, and one day, <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal</span>, with the accessories,&nbsp; the&nbsp; conviction is affirmed, including the&nbsp; clause of&nbsp; indemnization,&nbsp; with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
