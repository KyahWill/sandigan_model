				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">From a judgment absolving the defendant&nbsp; from plaintifffs complaint, with costs against the plaintiff, the latter has taken the present appeal.&nbsp; The sole question presented for determination is whether lot No. 2329 is an accretion formed&nbsp; by the action of the Rio Grande, and whether this accretion adjoins plaintiff's property or defendant's property..&nbsp; The trial Judge, the Honorable Eduardo Gutierrez David, made a succinct statement&nbsp; of facts which we believe conforms to the evidence of record.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial Judge placed reliance on the <u>croquis</u> made by the surveyor Silverio Choco who went upon the land personally and on the testimony of this surveyor, and we think this was proper procedure.&nbsp; We are shown no reason for interposing our opinion on the facts for the opinion of&nbsp; the trial Judge on the&nbsp; same facts.&nbsp; A preponderance of the evidence is not in favor of the plaintiff.<br><br>Overruling the six errors assigned, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs of this instance against the&nbsp; appellant.<br><br>Ten days from the&nbsp; publication of&nbsp; this&nbsp; decision, judgment will be entered,&nbsp; and&nbsp; five days thereafter,&nbsp; the record will be remanded to the court below.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Street, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
