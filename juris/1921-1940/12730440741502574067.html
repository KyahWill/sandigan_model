				G.R. No. 35963, March 31, 1932</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ROMAN CAPA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the accused Roman Capa from the sentence of the Court of 
First Instance of Cebu, convicting him of triple murder qualified by evident 
premeditation, with the generic aggravating circumstance of treachery offset by 
the mitigating circumstances of, passion and obfuscation, and lack of 
instruction, and sentencing him for each of said crimes to seventeen years, four 
months, and one day of cadena temporal, P1,000 indemnity to the heirs of each of 
the deceased, with the costs of the prosecution.
<p>In support of his appeal the appellant assigns the following alleged error as 
committed by the trial court in its judgment, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The trial court erred in sentencing the accused to the penalty of fifty-two 
years and three days, and the amount of P3,000 as indemnity to the heirs of the 
deceased victims."</p></blockquote>
<p>In arguing the legal question raised in his brief, counsel for the appellant 
contends that the trial court erred in convicting the accused solely upon his 
plea of guilty, and without having received evidence to determine the 
circumstances under which the defendant committed the three murders to which he 
pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>The accused was accompanied by his counsel <em>de oficio,</em> Pedro G. 
Aragon, when he was arraigned and pleaded guilty. Before the court pronounced 
sentence, counsel prayed that only one aggravating circumstance be taken into 
account, and two mitigating, namely, treachery, and obfuscation and ignorance. 
The prosecuting attorney was agreeable to this petition, and the court below 
imposed the sentence hereinbefore mentioned.</p>
<p>In the present instance the appellant mentions no other extenuating or 
justifying circumstance which would have to be considered if the circumstances 
under which the crime was committed had been investigated. Inasmuch as the 
counsel <em>de oficio</em>, who was present when the accused pleaded guilty, 
prayed the court to consider the mitigating circumstances of passion and 
obfuscation, and ignorance only, it is to be assumed that he was acquainted with 
all the details of the case and could find no other extenuating circumstance 
that might be taken into account in favor of his client. This request of the 
defendant's counsel <em>de oficio</em> in behalf of the man he was defending, 
implying as it does that he had investigated all the circumstances of the crime, 
rendered it unnecessary for the court to make a further investigation, for no 
one could know better than the defendants own counsel <em>de oficio</em> the 
circumstances under which the crime was committed, or could have more interest 
in having those favorable to his client taken into account by the court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is modified so that the defendant is 
further sentenced to the accessaries of law, and the total penalty is reduced to 
forty years, according to article 88, paragraph 2, of the Penal Code, and 
affirmed in all other respects, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Romualdez,</em> and 
<em>Imperial, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
