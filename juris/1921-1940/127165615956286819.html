				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The spouses Juan Lambino and Maria A. Barroso begot three 
children named Alejo, Eugenia and Marciana Lambino. On June 2, 1919 said spouses 
made a donation of propter nuptias of the lands described in the complaint in 
favor of their son Alejo Lambino and Fortunata Solis in a private document 
(Exhibit A) in consideration of the marriage which the latter were about to 
enter into. One of the conditions of this donation is that in case of the 
donees, one-half of these lands thus donated would revert to the donora while 
the surviving donee would retain the other half. On the 8th of the said month of 
June 1919, Alejo Lambino and Fortunata Solis were married and immediately 
thereafter the donors delivered the possession of the donated lands to them. On 
August 3,1919 donee Alejo Lambino died. In the same year donor Juan Lambino also 
died. After the latter's death, his wife, Maxima Barroso recovered possession 
the donated lands.
<p align="justify">The surviving donee Fortunata Solis filed the action, which is 
the subject matter of this appeal, against the surviving donor Maxima Barroso 
and Eugenia And Marcelina Lambino, heirs of the deceased donor Juan Lambino, 
with their respective husbands, demanding of the defendants the execution of the 
proper deed of donation according to law, transferring one-half of the donated 
property, and moreover, to "proceed to the partition of the donated property and 
its fruits.</p>
<p align="justify">The court rendered judgment based upon article 1279 of the 
Civil Code granting1 plaintiff's prayer and ordering the defendants to execute a 
deed of donation in favor of the plaintiff, adequate in form and substance to 
transfer to the latter the legal title to the part of the donated lands assigned 
to her in the original donation. </p>
<p align="justify">We are of the opinion that article 1279 of the Civil Code, 
relating to contracts, is not applicable to the present case. </p>
<p align="justify">We are concerned with a donation <i>propter nuptias</i>, which, 
according to article 1328 of the Civil Code, must be governed by the rules 
established in Title II, Book III of this Code, on donations (articles 618 to 
656). Article 633 provides that in order that a donation of real property may be 
valid, it must be made in a public instrument. This is the article applicable to 
donation <i>propter nuptias</i> in so far as its formal validity is concerned. The only 
exceptions to this rule are onerous and remuneratory donations, in so far as 
they do not exceed the value of the charge imposed, which are then governed by 
the rules on contracts (art. 622), and those which are to take effect upon the 
donor's death, which are governed by the rules established for testamentary 
successions (art. 620). </p>
<p align="justify">We have, therefore, a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias</span> which is not 
valid and did not create any right, since it was not made in a public 
instrument, and hence, article 1279 of the Civil Code which the lower court 
applied is not applicable thereto. The last named article provides that, should 
the law require the execution of an instrument or any other special form in 
order to make the obligations of a contract effective, the contracting parties 
may compel each other to comply with such formality from the moment that consent 
has been given, and the other requirements for the validity of the contract 
exist. Suffice it to state that this article refers to .contracts, and is 
inapplicable to the donation in question, which must be governed by the rules on 
donations. It may further be noted, at first sight, that this article 
presupposes the existence of a valid contract and cannot possibly refer to the 
form required in order to make it valid, which it already has, but rather to 
that required simply to make it effective, and for this reason, it would, at all 
events, be inapplicable to the donation in question, wherein the form is 
required precisely to make it valid.</p>
<p align="justify">But the lower court states in its judgment that the present 
donation is onerous, and pursuant to article 622 of the Civil Code must be 
governed by the rules on contracts. This opinion is not well founded. Donations 
for valuable consideration, as may be inferred from article 619 of the Civil 
Code, are such as compensate services which constitute debts recoverable from 
the donor, or which impose a charge equal to the amount of the donation upon the 
donee, neither of which is true of the present donation, which was made only in 
consideration of marriage. The lower court insists that, by the fact that this, 
is a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias</span>, it is based upon the marriage as a consideration, 
and must be considered onerous. Neither is this opinion well founded. In 
donations <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias</span>, the marriage is really a consideration, but not in 
the sense of being necessary to give birth to the obligation. This may be 
clearly inferred from article 1333, which makes the fact that the marriage did 
not take place a cause for the revocation of such donations, thus taking it for 
granted that there may be a valid donation <i>propter nuptias</i>, even without 
marriage, since that which has not existed cannot be revoked. And such a valid 
donation would be forever valid, even if the marriage never took place, if the 
proper action for revocation were not instituted, or if it were instituted after 
the lapse of the statutory period of prescription. This is so, because the 
marriage in a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">propter nuptias</span> is rather a resolutory condition which, 
as such, presupposes the existence of the obligation which may be resolved or 
revoked, and it is not a condition necessary for the birth of the obligation. 
</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from mentions the decision of this court 
in the case of Torres de Villanueva vs. Standard Oil Co. of New York (34 Phil., 
370), which is inapplicable to this case. That was a case of <span style="font-style: italic;">arras</span> offered in 
1875, and it was held that its effects were to be determined by the laws then in 
force, and not by the Civil Code, which became effective later. </p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendants are 
hereby absolved from the complaint, without special pronouncement of costs. So 
ordered. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, 
JJ.</span>, concur. </p>
<hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="justify">

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Street, J.: </strong></p> I am compelled to record my dissent. A donation made in 
consideration of a marriage contracted by the donee, or donees, on the faith of 
such donation, is, in my opinion, made for a valuable consideration within the 
meaning of article 622 of the Civil Code. The contrary view seems to me to be 
based upon a process of reasoning more congenial to the spirit of the schoolmen 
of the middle ages than to the jurisprudence of the present epoch.</div>
