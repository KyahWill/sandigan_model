				<H3>CONCEPCION CABIGAO AND LUIS YZQUIERDO, COMPLAINANTS, VS. JOSE FERNANDO RODRIGO, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 6, 1931, Conception Cabigao and Luis Yzquierdo filed charges for 
malpractice against Attorney Jose Fernando Rodrigo.
<p>By resolution of March 9, 1931, the court referred the matter to the 
Attorney-General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>
<p>After several hearings in which the parties submitted their evidence the 
Attorney-General, on April 5, 1932, submitted his report.</p>
<p>The respondent was then required to answer the report and after various 
extensions of time which were granted him upon his request he finally filed his 
answer on May 20, 1932.</p>
<p>The matter was called for hearing' on July 12, 1932, and the attorneys filed 
their respective memorandum.</p>
<p>After careful consideration of the whole evidence presented at the hearings 
the Attorney-General found the following facts satisfactorily proven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the complainants were defendants in case No. 3590 of the Court of First 
Instance of Bulacan; that the respondent was one of their counsel; that sometime 
between May and July, 1930, the respondent advised the complainants to settle 
the case for P2,500, and that during the same period, the respondent had been to 
the house of Bugenio Lim Pineda, plaintiff in said case No. 3590, with offers of 
settlement; that after securing the assent of said Eugenio Lim Pineda to a 
settlement of the case for the amount of P2,500, the respondent obtained from 
the complainants a check for the amount of P3,900, P2,500 of which, he 
represented as the sum to be paid to Eugenio Lim Pineda in full settlement of 
the case and the P1,400 to be paid to himself for his professional services; 
that the respondent also represented to the complainants that the payment of 
said amount would terminate the ease and that Pineda would subscribe to a motion 
for dismissal; that after obtaining from the complainants the said check, the 
respondent kept the funds and failed to settle the case; that; the complainants 
relying upon the representations of the respondent believed that the case would 
be settled and were unprepared for tftie trial which took place sometime after 
the respondent had assured them that they had 'nothing to worry about'; that by 
reason of the respondent's representations and conduct, the complainants were 
forced to a settlement in open court, by the terms of which, they were sentenced 
to pay the amount of P3,500 to Eugenia Lim Pineda; that in order to satisfy the 
judgment the complainants demanded of the respondent, the return of the amount 
of P2,500 (Exhs. B and E of the complainants and Exh. 20 of the respondent); 
that to compel the respondent to make such return the complainants had to appeal 
to the fiscal of the City of Manila; that by reason of the respondent's conduct 
the complainants suffered considerable damages."</p></blockquote>
<p>The facts above quoted are undeniable and do not leave rooni for any doubt. 
It has been clearly proven by Exhibit A, the authenticity of which is admitted 
by respondent, that he received the check No. 1568738-D of the Philippine 
National Bank in the amount of P3,900 to be applied as follows: P2,500 to be 
paid to Eugenio Lim Pineda as the agreed price of the amicable settlement 
between him and the complainants in civil case No. 3590 of the Court of First 
Instance of Bulacan, and P1,400 to be paid to the respondent as attorney's fees. 
The whole amount of P3,900 was misappropriated by the respondent notwithstanding 
the fact that he never carried out the alleged amicable settlement of the case 
and the repeated demands made by the complainants for the return of the money. 
</p>
<p>We have here a clear case of misappropriation by an attorney of funds 
entrusted to him by his clients to be applied to the settlement of a civil case 
in which he acted as a lawyer. It also clearly appears that these facts 
constitute malpractice for which the respondent is accountable.</p>
<p>The contention of the respondent that he had the right to retain the money 
intended to be paid to Eugenio Lim Pineda for the protection of certain bondsmen 
secured by him in favor of the complainants and that at any rate he was entitled 
to use all the money because the complainants were indebted to him in a larger 
amount as attorney's fees, is untenable and without merit. He admitted having 
received the total sum of money for the specific purpose recited in the receipt 
signed by him, and we fail to conceive any sound reason by which he should be 
allowed to misapply said money entrusted to him. To permit this would amount to 
sanctioning a flagrant violation of his obligations as an attorney to his 
clients and to the public, aside from the criminal aspect which the case might 
have.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing we are of the opinion that Attorney Jose Fernando 
Rodrigo should be, as he is hereby, suspended from his profession indefinitely 
and until he refunds the sum of P3,900 to the complainants and let this matter 
be again referred to the Attorney-General for appropriate action, result thereof 
to be reported to this court for further proceeding. So ordered.</p>

Santos, Hull, Vickers,</em> and <em>Butte, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
