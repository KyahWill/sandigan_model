				<H3>THE ILOILO ICE AND COLD STORAGE COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. PUBLIC UTILITY BOARD, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action in certiorari is for the purpose of reviewing a decision of the 
Public Utility Commissioner, affirmed by the Public Utility Board, holding that 
the petitioner, the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company, is a public utility 
and, as such, subject to the control and jurisdiction of the Public Utility 
Commissioner.
<p>The case can be best understood by a consideration of of its various phases, 
under the following topics: Statement of the issue, statement of the case, 
statement of the facts, statement of the law, statement of the authorities, 
statement of the petitioner's case, and of the government's case, and 
judgment.</p>
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE ISSUE</p>
<p>The issue is whether the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company is a public 
utility, as that term is defined by section 9 of Act No. 2694.</p>
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>
<p>Francisco Villanueva, jr., secretary of the Public Utility Commission, 
investigated the operation of ice plants in Iloilo early in November, 1921. He 
reported to the Public Utility Commissioner that the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage 
Company should be considered a public utility, and that, accordingly, the proper 
order should issue.</p>
<p>Agreeable to the recommendation of Secretary Villanueva, the Public Utility 
Commissioner promulgated an order on December 19, 1921, reciting the facts 
abovementioned, and directing the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company to show 
cause why it should not be considered a public utility and as such required to 
comply with each and every duty of public utilities provided in Act No. 2307, as 
amended by Act No. 2694. To this order, John Bordman, treasurer of the Iloilo 
Ice and Cold Storage Company, interposed a special answer, in which it was 
alleged that the company is, and always has been, operated as a private 
enterprise.</p>
<p>Hearing was then had, at which the testimonies of Francisco Villanueva, jr., 
and of John Bordman were received. Various exhibits were presented and received 
in evidence. Mr. Bordman, as the managing director and treasurer of the company, 
later submitted an affidavit.</p>
<p>The Public Utility Commissioner rendered a decision, holding in effect that 
the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company was a public utility, and that, 
accordingly, it should file in the office of the Public Utility Commissioner, a 
statement of its charges for ice. This decision was affirmed on appeal to the 
Public Utility Board. From this last decision, petitioner has come before this 
court, asking that the proceedings below be reviewed, and the decisions set 
aside.</p>
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</p>
<p>The petitioner, the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company, is a corporation 
organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands in 1908, with a capital stock 
of P60,000. Continuously since that date, the company has maintained and 
operated a plant for the manufacture and sale of ice in the City of Iloilo. It 
also does business to a certain extent in the Provinces of Negros, Capiz, and 
Antique, and with boats which stop at the port of Iloilo. At the time its 
operations were started, two additional ice plants were operating in Iloilo. 
Subsequently, however, the other plants ceased to operate, so that the 
petitioner now has no competitor in the field.</p>
<p>The normal production of ice of the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company is 
about 3 tons per day. In the month of January, 1922, a total of 83,837 kilos of 
ice were sold, of which 56,400 kilos were on written contracts in the City of 
Iloilo and adjoining territory, 14,214 kilos, also on written contracts, to 
steamers calling at the port of Iloilo, and 13,233 kilos on verbal contracts. 
Although new machinery has been installed in, the plant, this was merely for 
replacement purposes, and did not add to its capacity. The demand for ice has 
usually been much more than the plant could produce and no effort has been made 
to provide sufficient ice to supply all who might apply.</p>
<p>Since 1908, the business of the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company, 
according to its managing director and treasurer, has been carried on with 
selected customers only. Preference, however, is always given to hospitals, the 
requests of practicing physicians, and the needs of sick persons. The larger 
part of the company's business is perfected by written contracts signed by the 
parties served, which, in the present form, includes an agreement that no right 
to future service is involved.</p>
<p>The coupon books of the company contain on the outside the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This agreement witnesseth, that The Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Co. will 
furnish the undersigned with ice as indicated herein at the rate of one coupon 
per day. These coupons are not transferable. It is further agreed that the 
company is not obligated to similar service in future except by special 
agreement.</p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">"No. ___________"</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>Cash sales of ice are accomplished on forms reading: "In receiving the ice 
represented by this ticket I hereby agree that the Iloilo Ice &amp; Cold Storage 
Co. is not bound in future to extend to me further service." A notice posted in 
the Iloilo store reads: "No ice is sold to the public by this plant. Purchases 
can only be made by private contract." In August, 1918, all storage facilities 
were abolished, and resumed in 1920 only with contracts, a copy of the form at 
present in use waiving any right to continued service.</p>
<p>On only one point of fact is there any divergence, and this is relatively 
unimportant. Secretary Villanueva reported, and the Public Utility Commissioner 
found, that the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company sold ice to the public, and 
advertised its sale through the papers; while managing director Bordman claims 
that only once have the instructions of the board of directors prohibiting 
public advertising been violated.</p>
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE LAW</p>
<p>The original public utility law, Act No. 2307, in its section 14, in speaking 
of the jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, and in 
defining the term "public utility," failed to include ice, refrigeration, and 
cold storage plants. This deficiency was, however, remedied by Act No. 2694, 
enacted in 1917, which amended section 14 of Act No. 2307, to read as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The term 'public utility' is hereby defined to include every 
individual, copartnership, association, corporation or joint stock company, 
whether domestic or foreign, their lessees, trustees or receivers appointed by 
any court whatsoever, or any municipality, province or other department of the 
Government of the Philippine Islands, that now or hereafter may own, operate, 
manage or control within the Philippine Islands any common carrier, railroad, 
street railway, traction railway, steamboat or steamship line, small water 
craft, such as <i>bancas</i>, <i>virais</i>, <i>lorchas</i>, and others, engaged 
in the transportation of passengers and cargo, line of freight and passenger 
automobiles, shipyard, marine railway, marine repair shop, ferry, freight or any 
other car service, public warehouse, public wharf or dock not under the 
jurisdiction of the Insular Collector of Customs, ice, refrigeration, cold 
storage, canal, irrigation, express, subway, pipe line, gas, electric light, 
heat, power, water, oil, sewer, telephone, wire or wireless telegraph system, 
plant or equipment, for public use: <i>Provided</i>, That the Commission or 
Commissioner shall have no jurisdiction over ice plants, cold storage plants, or 
any other kind of public utilities operated by the Federal Government 
exclusively for its own and not for public use." * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>It will thus be noted that the term "public utility," in this jurisdiction, 
includes every individual, copartnership, association, corporation, or joint 
stock company that now or hereafter may own, operate, manage, or control, within 
the Philippine Islands, any ice, refrigeration, cold storage system, plant, or 
equipment, for public use. Particular attention is invited to the last phrase, 
"for public use."</p>
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE AUTHORITIES</p>
<p>The authorities are abundant, although some of them are not overly 
instructive. Selection is made of the pertinent decisions coming from our own 
Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court of 
California.</p>
<p>In the case of United States <i>vs</i>. Tan Piaco ([1920], 40 Phil., 853), 
the facts were that the trucks of the defendant furnished service under special 
agreements to carry particular persons and property. Following the case of 
Terminal Taxicab Co. <i>vs</i>. Kutz ([1916], 241 U. S., 252), it was held that 
since the defendant did not hold himself out to carry all passengers and freight 
for all persons who might offer, he was not a public utility and, therefore, was 
not criminally liable for his failure to obtain a license from the Public 
Utility Commissioner. It was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Under the provisions of said section, two things are necessary: (<i>a</i>) 
The individual, copartnership, etc., etc., must be a public utility; and 
(<i>b</i>) the business in which such individual, copartnership, etc., etc., is 
engaged must be for public use. So long as the individual or copartnership, 
etc., etc., is engaged in a purely private enterprise, without attempting to 
render service to all who may apply, he can in no sense be considered a public 
utility, for public use.</p>
<p>" 'Public use' means the same as 'use by the public' The essential feature of 
the public use is that it is not confined to privileged individuals, but is open 
to the indefinite public. It is this indefinite or unrestricted quality that 
gives it its public character. In determining whether a use is public, we must 
look not only to the character of the business to be done, but also to the 
proposed mode of doing it. If the use is merely optional with the owners, or the 
public benefit is merely incidental, it is not a public use, authorizing the 
exercise of the jurisdiction of the public utility commission. There must be, in 
general, a right which the law compels the owner to give to the general public. 
It is not enough that the general prosperity of the public is promoted. Public 
use is not synonymous with public interest. The true criterion by which to judge 
of the character of the use is whether the public may enjoy it <i>by right</i> 
or only by permission."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Terminal Taxicab 
Company <i>vs</i>. Kutz, <i>supra</i>, it was held: "A taxicab company is a 
common carrier within the meaning of the Act of March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. at L., 
938, chap. 150), sec. 8, and hence subject to the jurisdiction of the Public 
Utilities Commission of the District of Columbia as a 'public utility' in 
respect of its exercise of its exclusive right under lease from the Washington 
Terminal Company, the owner of the Washington Union Railway Station, to solicit 
livery and taxicab business from persons passing to or from trains, and of its 
exclusive right under contracts with certain Washington hotels to solicit 
taxicab business from guests, but that part of its business which consists in 
furnishing automobiles from its central garage on individual orders, generally 
by telephone, cannot be regarded as a public utility, and the rates charged for 
such service are therefore not open to inquiry by the Commission." Mr. Justice 
Holmes, delivering the opinion of the court, in part said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rest of the plaintiff's business, amounting to four tenths, consists 
mainly in furnishing automobiles from its central garage on orders, generally by 
telephone. It asserts the right to refuse the service, and no doubt would do so 
if the pay was uncertain, but it advertises extensively, and, we must assume, 
generally accepts any seemingly solvent customer. Still, the bargains are 
individual, and however much they may tend towards uniformity in price, probably 
have not quite the mechanical fixity of charges that attends the use of taxicabs 
from the station and hotels. There is no contract with a third person to serve 
the public generally. The question whether, as to this part of its business, it 
is an agency for public use within the meaning of the statute, is more 
difficult. * * * Although I have not been able to free my mind from doubt, the 
court is of opinion that this part of the business is not to be regarded as a 
public utility. It is true that all business, and, for the matter of that, every 
life in all its details, has a public aspect, some bearing' upon the welfare of 
the community in which it is passed. But, however it may have been in earlier 
days as to the common callings, it is assumed in our time that an invitation to 
the public to buy does not necessarily entail an obligation to sell. It is 
assumed that an ordinary shopkeeper may refuse his wares arbitrarily to a 
customer whom he dislikes, and although that consideration is not conclusive 
(233 U. S., 407), it is assumed that such a calling is not public as the word is 
used. In the absence of clear language to the contrary it would be assumed that 
an ordinary livery stable stood on the same footing as a common shop, and there 
seems to be no difference between the plaintiff's service from its garage and 
that of a livery stable. It follows that the plaintiff is not bound to give 
information as to its garage rates."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court of California in the case of Thayer and Thayer <i>vs</i>. 
California Development Company ([1912], 164 Cal., 117), announced, among other 
things, that the essential feature of a public use is that "it is not confined 
to privileged individuals, but is open to the indefinite public. It is this 
indefiniteness or unrestricted quality that gives it its public character." 
Continuing, reference was made to the decision of the United States Supreme 
Court in Fallbrook Irrigation District <i>vs</i>. Bradley ([1896], 164 U. S., 
161), where the United States Supreme Court considered the question of whether 
or not the water belonging to an irrigation district organized under the 
California statute of 1887, and acquired for and applied to its authorized uses 
and purposes, was water dedicated to a public use. Upon this question, the 
Supreme Court on appeal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that the use of the water is limited to the landowner is not 
therefore a fatal objection to this legislation. It is not essential that the 
entire community, or even any considerable portion thereof, should directly 
enjoy or participate in an improvement in order to constitute a public use. All 
landowners in the district have the right to a proportionate share of the water, 
and no one landowner is favored above his fellow in his right to the use of the 
water. It is not necessary, in order that the use should be public, that 
<i>every resident</i> in the district should have the right to the use of the 
water. The water is not used for general, domestic, or for drinking purposes, 
and it is plain from the scheme of the act that the water is intended for the 
use of those who will have occasion to use it on their lands. * * * We think it 
clearly appears that all who by reason of their ownership of or connection with 
any portion of the lands would have occasion to use the water, would in truth 
have the opportunity to use it upon the same terms as all others similarly 
situated. In this way the use, so far as this point is concerned, is public 
<i>because all persons have the right to use the water under the same 
circumstances</i>. This is sufficient."</p></blockquote>
<p>The latest pronouncement of the United States Supreme Court here available is 
found in the case of Producers Transportation Company <i>vs</i>. Railroad 
Commission of the State of California ([1920], 251 U. S., 228). Mr. Justice Van 
Devanter, delivering the opinion of the court, in part said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is, of course, true that if the pipe line was constructed solely to carry 
oil for particular producers under strictly private contracts and never was 
devoted by its owner to public use, that is, to carrying for the public, the 
State could not by mere legislative fiat or by any regulating order of a 
commission convert it into a public utility or make its owner a common carrier; 
for that would be taking private property for public use without just 
compensation, which no State can do consistently with the due process of law 
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. * * * On the other hand, if in the beginning 
or during its subsequent operation the pipe line was devoted by its owner to 
public use, and if the right thus extended to the public has not been withdrawn, 
there can be no doubt that the pipe line is a public utility and its owner a 
common carrier whose rates and practices are subject to public regulation. Munn 
<i>vs</i>. Illinois, <i>supra</i>.</p>
<p>"The state court, upon examining the evidence, concluded that the company 
voluntarily had devoted the pipe line to the use of the public in transporting 
oil, and it rested this conclusion upon the grounds * * * that, looking through 
the maze of contracts, agency agreements and the like, under which the 
transportation was effected, subordinating form to substance, and having due 
regard to the agency's ready admission of new members and its exclusion of none, 
it was apparent that the company did in truth carry oil for all producers 
seeking its service, in other words, for the public. (<i>See</i> Pipe Line 
Cases, 234 U. S., 548.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, we take note of the case of Allen <i>vs</i>. Railroad Commission of 
the State of California ([1918], 179 Cal., 68; 8 A. L. R., 249). It was here 
held that a water company does not, by undertaking to furnish a water supply to 
a municipality which will require only a small percentage of its product, become 
a public utility as to the remainder, which it sells under private contracts. 
The court observed that its decisions fully recognize that a private water 
company may be organized to sell water for purposes of private gain, and that in 
so doing, it does not become a public utility. "To hold that property has been 
dedicated to a public use," reads the opinion, "is not a trivial thing, and such 
dedication is never presumed without evidence of unequivocal intention." 
Continuing, the court discusses what is a public utility in the following 
language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What is a public utility, over which the state may exercise its regulatory 
control without regard to the private interests which may be affected thereby? 
In its broadest sense everything upon which man bestows labor for purposes other 
than those for the benefit of his immediate family is impressed with a public 
use. No occupation escapes it, no merchant can avoid it, no professional man can 
deny it. As an illustrative type one may instance the butcher. He deals with the 
public; he invites and is urgent that the public should deal with him. The 
character of his business is such that, under the police power of the state, it 
may well be subject to regulation, and in many places and instances is so 
regulated. The preservation of cleanliness, the inspection of meats to see that 
they are wholesome, all such matters are within the due and reasonable 
regulatory powers of the state or nation. But these regulatory powers are not 
called into exercise because the butcher has devoted his property to public 
service so as to make it a public utility. He still has the unquestioned right 
to fix his prices; he still has the unquestioned right to say that he will or 
will not contract with any member of the public. What differentiates all such 
activities from a true public utility is this, and this only: That the devotion 
to public use must be of such character that the public generally, or that part 
of it which has been served and which has accepted the service, has the right to 
demand that that service shall be conducted, so long as it is continued, with 
reasonable efficiency under reasonable charges. Public use, then, means the use 
by the public and by every individual member of it, as a legal 
right."</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">STATEMENT OF THE PETITIONER'S CASE AND OF THE GOVERNMENT'S 
CASE</p>
<p>Petitioner contends on the facts, that the evidence shows that the petitioner 
is operating a small ice plant in Iloilo; that no attempt has been made to 
supply the needs of all who may apply for accommodation or to expand the plant 
to meet all demands; that sales have been made to selected customers only, and 
that the right has been freely exercised to refuse sales not only to whole 
districts, but constantly to individuals as well; that the greater portion of 
the business is conducted through signed contracts with selected individuals, 
and on occasions, when there is a surplus, the same is sold for cash to selected 
applicants; that no sales are made except to persons who have waived all claim 
of right to similar accommodation in the future; and that no offer, agreement, 
or tender of service to the public has ever been made. Petitioner contends, as 
to the law, that the decisions heretofore referred to are controlling.</p>
<p>The Government has no quarrel with the petitioner as to the facts. But the 
Attorney-General attempts to differentiate the authorities from the instant 
situation. The Attorney-General also argues that to sanction special contracts 
would "open a means of escape from the application of the law."</p>
<p>The result is, therefore, that we have substantial agreement between the 
petitioner and the government as to the issue, as to the facts, as to the law, 
and as to the applicable authorities. The question, however, remains as puzzling 
as before.</p>
<p>Planting ourselves on the authorities, which discuss the subject of public 
use, the criterion by which to judge of the character of the use is whether the 
public may enjoy it by right or only by permission. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Tan Piaco, 
<i>supra</i>.) The essential feature of a public use is that it is not confined 
to privileged individuals, but is open to the indefinite public. (Thayer and 
Thayer <i>vs</i>. California Development Company, <i>supra</i>.) The use is 
public if all persons have the right to the use under the same circumstances. 
(Fall brook Irrigation District <i>vs</i>. Bradley, <i>supra</i>.) If the 
company did in truth sell ice to all persons seeking its service, it would be a 
public utility. But if on the other hand, it was organized solely for particular 
persons under strictly private contracts, and never was devoted by its owners to 
public use, it could not be held to be a public utility without violating the 
due process of law clause of the Constitution. (Producers Transportation Co. 
<i>vs</i>. Railroad Commission, <i>supra</i>.) And the apparent and continued 
purpose of the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company has been, and is, to remain a 
private enterprise and to avoid submitting to the Public Utility law.</p>
<p>The argument for the Government, nevertheless, merits serious consideration. 
The attempt of the Public Utility Commissioner to intervene in corporate 
affairs, to protect the public, is commendable. Sympathetic thought should 
always be given to the facts laid before the Commissioner, with reference to the 
law under which he is acting.</p>
<p>Aware of the foregoing situation, the members of the Court are of the opinion 
that the present case is governed by the authorities mentioned in this decision, 
which means, of course, that, upon the facts shown in the record, the Iloilo Ice 
and Cold Storage Company is not a public utility within the meaning of the law. 
Like Mr. Justice Holmes, in his opinion in Terminal Taxicab Company <i>vs</i>. 
Kutz, <i>supra</i>, when, in speaking for himself personally, he admitted that 
he had not been able to free his mind from doubt, so has the writer not been 
able to free his mind from doubt, but is finally led to accept the authorities 
as controlling.</p>
<p align="center">JUDGMENT</p>
<p>It is declared that the business of the Iloilo Ice and Cold Storage Company 
is not a public utility, subject to the control and jurisdiction of the Public 
Utility Commissioner, and that, accordingly, the decisions of the Public Utility 
Commissioner and of the Public Utility Board must be revoked, without special 
finding as to costs. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Avanceña, 
Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em></div>
<p><strong>OSTRAND, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the result on the ground that an ice plant is not a public 
utility by common law, but is only made so by statute; that in the present case 
the plant existed in approximately its present form and as, in a then legal 
sense, a private enterprise, before the statute making such plants public 
utilities was enacted; and that under these circumstances to deprive the owner 
of a part of the control over his property amounts to a taking of property 
without compensation and without due process of law, and cannot be regarded as 
being within the police power of the State.</p>I find it difficult to agree to 
the proposition that an ice plant, the product of which is not intended 
primarily for the use of the owners thereof but for general consumption, is for 
private use, merely, and not for "public use" within the meaning of Act No. 
2307, the Public Utilities Act. The fact that sales of ice are made under 
special contracts and that some individuals have been denied the privilege of 
purchasing cannot alter the fact that the plant is designed to supply the trade 
and to serve the public as far as the Quantity of ice produced permits and the 
purchasers are acceptable. To hold that a utility of a public character can 
escape regulatory control by the simple expedient of arbitrarily excluding a 
limited number of persons from the enjoyment of its benefits and by posting 
notices to the effect that it does not deal with the public, will seriously 
impair the efficacy of the Public Utilities Act. I think a tendency may be 
discerned in later decisions to give the expression "public use" a broader 
significance than that given it by the earlier authorities.</div>
