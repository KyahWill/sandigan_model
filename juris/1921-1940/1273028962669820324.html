				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
ordering defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P1,740 with interest thereon at 
the rate of 10 per cent per annum from January 1, 1928, to date of payment; 
likewise, to pay plaintiff P174 for attorneys' fees and costs of collection; and 
to pay P250.67 with legal interest from date of filing of complaint to date of 
payment for work, labor, and services rendered and for materials used in the 
installation of a refrigerating machine for the defendant, and pay the 
costs.
<p>It appears that on September 14, 1927, the Pacific Commercial Co., the 
plaintiff herein, sold to the Ermita Market &amp; Cold Stores, Inc., the 
defendant herein, an automatic refrigerating machine of the following 
description: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Una maquina refrigeradora automatica <em>York</em> Style Y-26 capacidad Dos 
toneladas de refrigeracion consistente en: Compresor de amoniaco <em>York, 
</em>de Doble Cilindro, Condensador, Recibidor, Separador de aceite, Juego de 
manometros, Valvulas, Valvula reguladora de agua, Control automatico, Aparato de 
seguridad, Motor Electrico G-E de cinco caballos de fuerza 220 
<em>volts</em>—Corriente alterna, de Una Fase, montadas todas en una base de 
hierro, asi como tambien incluye una bomba centrifuga para circulacion de agua y 
correas."</p></blockquote>
<p>The parties signed the usual printed sales-contract form of the plaintiff 
company, the purchase price being P2,550, payable by instalments on dates and in 
amounts stated in the sales contract. The delivery of the machine was made on 
December 7, 1927, and by mutual agreement between the vendor and the vendee, the 
former installed the machine which was completed on December 26, 1927. The 
installation, including materials used, amounted to P250.67, to be paid by the 
Ermita Market &amp; Cold Stores, Inc., to the Pacific Commercial Company. 
Complying with the terms of the sales contract, the defendant paid the plaintiff 
the amount of P810 against the purchase price of the machine, leaving a balance 
of P1,740.</p>
<p>A few days after the installation of the automatic refrigerating machine, the 
Ermita Market &amp; Cold Stores advised the Pacific Commercial Company that, the 
machine was not serving the purpose for which it was sold to defendant and that 
it was lacking ammonia receiver and oil separator. The plaintiff company in turn 
advised the defendant that the machine installed was complete, having all the 
accessories as stated in the contract. However, upon the insistence of the 
defendant, the plaintiff, just to please the president of the defendant company, 
delivered and installed on the machine an additional oil separator without 
charge. The machine did not give the results expected from it, and the defendant 
refused to pay the balance of its purchase price and the cost of the 
installation of the machine. The Pacific Commercial Company thereupon brought 
this action.</p>
<p>In its answer, the defendant generally and specifically denied the 
allegations contained in plaintiff's complaint, and by way of special defense 
alleged substantially that the machine delivered to the defendant by the 
plaintiff was not the machine described in the contract of sale inasmuch as the 
said machine was not automatic and as it was lacking ammonia receiver, oil 
separator, and the implements necessary to make the said machine automatic. </p>
<p>By way of cross-complaint, the defendant further alleges that it bought the 
machine in question from the plaintiff for the purpose of running the business 
of cold storage; that the temperature in the refrigerating rooms did not reach, 
and had never reached, the necessary temperature for the preservation of meat, 
fish, vegetables, and fruits; that owing to the negligence of the plaintiff in 
not repairing or putting in good working condition the said refrigerating 
machine, the defendant had been forced to close its establishment and for which 
reason the defendant claimed damages against the plaintiff as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"P5,000 for expenses in advertising and propaganda; <br><br>"P15,000 as the 
value of fish, pork, meat, vegetables and fruits alleged to have deteriorated in 
the refrigerating rooms; .<br><br>"P30,000 for the loss of its clientele and 
decrease in its sales;<br><br>"P20,000 for the loss of the whole business; and 
<br><br>"P3,600 for rentals of the premises, salaries of the manager, guard and 
warehouseman, from May 10, 1928, up to October of the same year, at the rate of 
P600 a month, because of the refusal of the plaintiff to withdraw the 
refrigerating machine in question from the premises where it was installed. In 
other words, the defendant asks for damages in the total sum of 
P73,600."</p></blockquote>
<p>Replying to the defendant's cross-complaint, the plaintiff denied generally 
and specifically each and every allegation in the said cross-complaint and by 
way of special defense, alleged that whatever defects or deficiency there might 
have been in the temperature in the refrigerating rooms of defendant's 
establishment, or in the functioning of the machine, these were due to the 
defects and imperfections of the coils which were supplied and installed by the 
defendant itself, as well as to the incompetency and inefficiency of the 
defendant's personnel to operate the machine.<br><br>After trial, the court 
below rendered the judgment above mentioned, and, as hereinbefore stated, the 
defendant appealed to this court.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the record, we have not the least doubt that 
the plaintiff delivered the machine as described in the sales contract, and the 
fact that the defendant could not use it satisfactorily in the three cold stores 
divisions cannot be attributed to plaintiff's fault; as far as we can see, the 
machine was strictly in accordance with the written contract between the 
parties, and the defendant can hardly honestly say that there was any deception 
by the plaintiff; (See article 327, Code of Commerce; Palanca <em>vs.</em> Fred 
Wilson &amp; Co., 37 Phil., 506.)</p>
<p>But it is clear, that the defendant company did not fully understand the use 
of the motor. It complains that the machine would not properly refrigerate the 
refrigerating rooms, but it is evident that the machine could not operate 
automatically when the defendant had three refrigerating rooms which it expected 
to maintain at three different temperatures.</p>
<p>The defendant also complained that the machine was not equipped with a 
thermostat and that the lack of it obstructed the work of the refrigerating. In 
the first place, the thermostat was not included in the sales contract and in 
the second place it would not have been of any service to defendant because it 
could not possibly operate automatically at three different temperatures with 
the defendant's insufficient equipment.</p>
<p>The defendant's complaint that the machine did not contain an oil separator 
is not true; the oil separator is combined with the receiver and condenser in a 
single combined piece in the machine.</p>
<p>The evidence in this case is clear to us, and we cannot find any errors 
committed by the court below. It may be that the machine could have given 
satisfaction to the defendant if the coils had been installed properly and the 
machine had been operated by competent persons. Any deficiency in this regard 
could not-be the plaintiffs fault; the coils were supplied and installed by 
someone other than the plaintiff, and the machine was being operated by the 
defendant itself.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed in its entirety, with costs 
against appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez, 
Villa-Real,</em> and <em>Imperial, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p>
