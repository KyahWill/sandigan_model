<p>Thomas Casey et al. commenced an action in the Court of First Instance, in 
which the plaintiff here was the defendant. It was founded upon a contract, and 
prayed for an accounting. In that action the plaintiffs applied for, and 
obtained, an order of arrest of the defendant under the provisions of Chapter 
XVII of the Code of Civil Procedure. The order was granted upon the condition 
that the plaintiffs would furnish and approve a bond in the sum of P2,000. This 
bond was furnished with the plaintiffs in that action, as principals, and the 
defendant, Fidelity &amp; Surety Company, as surety, and among other things it 
provides that the plaintiffs, as principals, and the Surety Company, as surety, 
"in consideration of the above and of the issuance of said order, hereby jointly 
and severally bind ourselves in the sum of two thousand pesos (P2,000), 
Philippine currency, under the condition that the surety and the plaintiff will 
pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which 
he may sustain by reason of aforesaid order of arrest if the same shall finally 
be adjudged to have been wrongful or without sufficient cause." Upon the 
strength of the bond, the warrant for the arrest of the defendant was issued, 
and he was arrested and confined in Bilibid from the 14th of January, 1922, to 
the 4th of February, 1922. During the period of his confinement, he applied to 
this court for a writ of habeas corpus upon which he was released.</p>
<p>April 1, 1922, this action was commenced against the Fidelity &amp; Surety 
Company as defendant, in which after formal allegations it is alleged that on or 
about October 18, 1921, Thomas Casey and William A. Caldwell commenced an action 
against this plaintiff in which they sought to recover from him upon an alleged 
breach of contract; that on January 14, 1922, they applied for the order of 
arrest, which was granted upon the giving of a bond in the sum of P2,000, with 
the Surety Company as surety. The plaintiff alleges his confinement in Bilibid 
and the issuing out and the granting of the writ of habeas corpus, from which he 
"suffered damages and was forced to pay costs in securing his release from the 
said arrest and imprisonment in the amount of P4,600," for which he prays 
judgment, with interest and costs.</p>
<p>For answer, the Surety Company admits all of the allegations of the 
complaint, except as to damages, which it specifically denies, and, as a 
separate defense, alleges that the action in which Caldwell and Casey were 
plaintiffs, and the plaintiff here was defendant, is still pending in the Court 
of First Instance of the City of Manila, and that no finding has been made in 
the court as to whether the order for the arrest was issued wrongfully and 
without sufficient cause, and for another defense, it alleges that it became 
surety in consideration of the signing of the bond by the defendants William A. 
Caldwell and R. G. Woods, who jointly and severally agreed in writing to pay and 
reimburse the defendant for any sums of money which it might pay or become 
liable to pay on account of having signed the bond as surety, and it prays that 
the complaint be dismissed, and that Caldwell and Woods be made parties 
defendant, and that in any judgment which may be rendered, the Surety Company 
shall have the same amount of judgment jointly and severally against Caldwell 
and Woods. The order was granted, and those parties were made defendants, and 
after making like admissions and denial as the Surety Company, they allege, in 
substance, that Chapter XVII of the Code of Civil Procedure mentioned in the 
complaint is unconstitutional, inoperative, null and void, and that every 
obligation arising therefrom is null and void, and that there is no 
consideration for the bond, and that the original action is still pending in the 
Court of First Instance, and that no final action has been rendered there.</p>
<p>Upon such issues, testimony was taken, and the lower court rendered judgment 
for the defendants and dismissed the complaint, from which the plaintiff 
appeals, specifying six different assignments of error, in substance that the 
trial court erred in holding that before the action can be maintained, there 
must be a final adjudication by the trial court that the arrest was wrongful or 
without sufficient cause, and in holding that there has been no adjudication by 
the Supreme Court that the order of arrest was wrongful or without sufficient 
cause, and in holding that an action for damages must wait the result of a suit 
in which the party was arrested, and in not deciding in favor of the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In its opinion the lower court cited and relied upon the decision of this 
court in Raymundo <i>vs</i>. Carpio (33 Phil., 395), which was an action brought 
upon an attachment bond under section 427 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in 
which this court held, in legal effect, that an action cannot be brought upon an 
attachment bond until after a final judgment has been rendered in the court in 
which the action was pending, to the effect "that the attachment had been 
obtained wrongfully or without sufficient cause."</p>
<p>There is this distinction. In the instant case, a warrant of arrest, which is 
in the nature of a quasi-criminal proceeding, was wrongfully issued in the civil 
action, under which the defendant was arrested and thrown in Bilibid. To obtain 
his release, he applied direct to this court for a writ of habeas corpus, and in 
a well-written opinion, the plaintiff was released by this court upon the writ, 
for the plain, simple reason that his arrest was wrongful and without sufficient 
cause, and, .as this court held, that under the Jones Law "debtors cannot be 
committed to prison for liabilities arising from actions <i>ex contractu</i>," 
and that the action was founded upon contract. (Ganaway <i>vs</i>. Quillen, 42 
Phil., 805.) That was a final adjudication of this court that the arrest of the 
plaintiff in the civil action was wrongful and without sufficient cause. It is 
true that in the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the warden of the prison 
was the only defendant. But it is also true that the defendants here were 
privies to that proceeding, and are bound by that decision. The plaintiff was 
confined in prison because the defendants gave the bond. In other words, in the 
habeas corpus proceeding, there was a final adjudication by this court that the 
arrest of the defendant was wrongful and without sufficient cause, and that 
decision binds the defendants as privies to the proceeding.</p>
<p>Upon the facts shown, we are clearly of the opinion that the instant action 
was not prematurely brought.</p>
<p>The rule in this class of cases is well stated in Corpus Juris, vol. 5, page 
526, where it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Upon undertaking</i>.—(<i>a</i>) <i>In general</i>.—Defendant's right to 
maintain an action on the undertaking by plaintiff for defendant's arrest 
accrues when it is judicially determined that plaintiff was not entitled to have 
him arrested, although the original cause is still pending, unless the 
undertaking is conditioned upon recovery of judgment by defendant, and, although 
the cause of action and grounds for the arrest are identical, because liability 
on the bond is fixed by the discharge from arrest."</p></blockquote>
<p>The remaining question is the amount of damages which the plaintiff has 
sustained.</p>
<p>It is conceded that he was confined in Bilibid for twenty-one days. To obtain 
his release, he was forced to employ counsel and file his petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus, which was argued and submitted to this court. There is also 
testimony tending to show that at the time of his arrest, he had a concession at 
the carnival grounds for the painting of signs upon the fence surrounding the 
grounds, for which he had already procured some contracts, and that in the 
ordinary course of business, he would have obtained a large number of other 
contracts, upon which he claims that there would have been profits to him and 
his partner for about P8,000, of which he would have been entitled to 
one-half.</p>
<p>The evidence as to the amount of damages from loss of business by reason of 
plaintiff's arrest is not very clear or satisfactory, but it does tend to show 
that he sustained some damage from such loss.</p>
<p>The rule as to the measure of damage is well stated on page 528 in the Corpus 
Juris above cited, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The items of damage that may be recovered include the taxable costs, counsel 
fees in proceedings to vacate the order of arrest, expenses in securing bail, 
and compensation for loss of earnings during imprisonment."</p></blockquote>
<p>We hold that the plaintiff's arrest was wrongful and without sufficient 
cause, and that within the meaning of the bond, the question of his wrongful 
arrest was finally adjudicated in the habeas corpus proceeding in this court. 
All things considered, we find that the amount of costs and damages which the 
plaintiff sustained, by reason of his arrest, is P1,500.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court will be reversed, and one will be entered 
here jointly and severally against the Surety Company and William A. Caldwell 
and R. G. Woods for the sum of P1,500, with interest at the legal rate from this 
date, and for the costs on appeal and in the lower court, and judgment for a 
like amount will be entered in favor of the Fidelity &amp; Surety Company of the 
Philippine Islands against the defendants William A. Caldwell and R. G. Woods 
upon their bond to guarantee and protect the Surety Company and hold it 
harmless. So ordered.</p><i>Johnson, Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor,</i> and 
<i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>STREET, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The bond which is the basis of this action against the defendant as surety 
was executed pursuant to section 415 of the Code of Civil Procedure, with a view 
to procuring an order for the attachment of the person of the herein plaintiff 
in a civil action which had been instituted against him by other persons. The 
condition of the bond is to the effect "that the surety and the plaintiff will 
pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the defendant and all damages which 
he may sustain by reason of the aforesaid order of arrest if the same shall 
finally be adjudged to have been wrongful or without sufficient cause."</p>
<p>The language which we have quoted is in exact conformity with the requirement 
of the statute and is in fact reproduced in great part from the section above 
cited. When the law provided that the parties to the bond shall obligate 
themselves to pay all damages which the arrested person may sustain by reason of 
the arrest <i>if the same shall finally be adjudged to have been wrongful or 
without sufficient cause</i>, the undoubted intention was that the liability 
thereby created should become effective when the civil case, to which the arrest 
was an incident, should be decided. By the decision now made an independent 
action on the bond is sustained by this court before the civil liability 
incident to the civil action has been declared.</p>
<p>To permit such procedure operates with injustice to the desfendant, for if 
this judgment should be executed before the civil cause is determined and it 
should be there found that the herein plaintiff is indebted to his opponent in 
the civil action, the surety against whom judgment is now rendered will have 
been deprived of the opportunity to set off !the amount for which the plaintiff 
herein may be found liable in the civil action against the present judgment. The 
arrest of this plaintiff in the civil action was a mere incident of the 
principal action and any damages to which he may be entitled by reason of the 
arrest which has been declared unlawful would be a proper subject of 
consideration in that action and the damages should go to the extinction of the 
civil liability if any should be declared in that case.</p>
<p>The law concerning arrest in a civil case, or attachment of the person, rests 
upon the same basis, so far as the principles involved are concerned, as the law 
concerning the attachment of property in a civil action; and it will be noted 
that the obligation of the surety in case of the attachment of property is 
precisely the same, under section 427 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as the 
obligation of the surety in case of arrest under section 415. The words are 
identical in the two sections—"that the plaintiff will pay all costs which may 
be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain by reason of 
the arrest [or attachment], if the same shall finally be adjudged to have been 
wrongful or without sufficient cause." (Secs. 415, 427.) The meaning of this 
language, as expressed in section 427, has been considered by this court in 
Raymundo <i>vs</i>. Carpio (33 Phil., 395), where it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 427 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that damages which the 
defendant may sustain by reason of an attachment may be obtained in the 
principal action when 'it shall finally be adjudged to have been wrongful or 
without sufficient cause.' This means that it is a necessary prerequisite to 
defendant's right to recover damages for the issuance of an attachment by 
plaintiff that the Court of First Instance in which the action was tried shall 
adjudge in its final judgment that the attachment had been obtained wrongfully 
or without sufficient cause. If such a pronouncement is not obtained from the 
Court of First Instance in its final judgment in the action, then there can 
exist no foundation for an action by the defendant to obtain damages which he 
may have sustained by reason of the attachment."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to see how a court can commit itself to the proposition that 
certain language in section 427 means one thing and that the identical language 
in another section means something entirely different. The inconsistency is 
obvious and needs no comment to expose it.</p>
<p>In the passage quoted in the opinion of the court from Corpus Juris it is 
said that the right to maintain an action on a bond of the kind now under 
consideration accrues when it is judicially determined that the plaintiff was 
not entitled to have the defendant arrested, <i>although the original cause is 
still pending</i>. Reference to this passage will reveal the fact that the only 
cases cited to the part which we have put in italics are New York cases, and we 
are informed in a note that the practise indicated is permissible only under the 
present Practise Act in New York and that the law in that State formerly was to 
the effect that the entry of judgment in favor of the defendant in the civil 
action was a condition precedent to liability on the undertaking for the order 
of arrest. Evidently these later New York cases can have no value in a 
jurisdiction where the law is expressed as in sections 415 and 427 of our Code 
of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>Authority decidedly more in point upon the interpretation of our statute is 
to be found in the decisions of the Supreme Court of California, for upon 
comparison it will be found that section 415 of our Code of Civil Procedure, in 
the part here material to be noted, is taken almost verbally from section 482 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure of the State of California, which we here 
reproduce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 482. <i>Security by plaintiff before order of arrest</i>.— Before 
making the order, the judge must require a written undertaking on the part of 
the plaintiff, with sureties in an amount to be fixed by the judge, which must 
be at least five hundred dollars, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay all 
costs which may be adjudged to the defendant, and all damages which he may 
sustain by reason of the arrest, if the same be wrongful, or without sufficient 
cause, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking. The undertaking must 
be filed with the clerk of the court."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Stechhan <i>vs</i>. Roraback (67 Cal., 29), the Supreme Court 
of California had occasion to consider a question under their statute, which was 
almost identical with that involved in the present case, namely, whether an 
independent action would lie against the sureties after the arrested person had 
been discharged but before the civil action had been finally determined in the 
superior court. It was held that the action could not be maintained. The opinion 
delivered by the Supreme Court of California is brief and may be here reproduced 
to advantage in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The defendant Roraback commenced an action against Stechhan in a justice's 
court, and procured an order for his arrest. In procuring such order Stechhan 
gave an undertaking, with the other defendants herein as sureties. On the trial 
of the action, the justice held the arrest to have been wrongful and without 
cause, and discharged Stechhan. This action is on the undertaking. The 
defendants herein in their answer averred that after the judgment in the 
justice's court, Roraback, plaintiff therein, appealed from such judgment to the 
Superior Court, and that such appeal was still untried and undetermined. This 
portion of the answer was demurred to, and the demurrer sustained. We are of 
opinion that this ruling was error. On the appeal the whole case was for hearing 
and determination, including the question whether or not the arrest was wrongful 
or without sufficient cause; and until such determination it could not be known 
whether liability on the undertaking had been incurred."</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that the only difference between the provision in question, 
as it stands in the California Code of Civil Procedure and as it stands in the 
Philippine Code of Civil Procedure, is that where the California law says "if 
the same be wrongful, or without sufficient cause," our statute says "if the 
same shall finally be adjudged to have been wrongful or without sufficient 
cause."</p>
<p>The greater fullness and precision of the words of our own statute—where the 
two thus differ—make the interpretation adopted by the California court even 
more inevitable in this jurisdiction than in California. The words "finally 
adjudged," used in our statute, were evidently chosen with a view to indicating 
more clearly than in the original that the liability must have been finally 
determined in the civil action in which the undertaking of the sureties was 
given.</p>I am therefore of the opinion, as was the trial judge, that the action 
is, to say the least, premature; and the judgment dismissing the case should 
accordingly be affirmed.</div>
