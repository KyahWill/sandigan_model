				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Samar, 
dated November 11, 1922, and appointing Jose Garcia, administrator of the estate 
of the deceased Geronima Uy Coque.
<p>The appellant is the surviving spouse of the deceased and maintains that the 
court erred in not appointing him administrator instead of Jose Garcia. As the 
refusal to appoint the appellant appears in an order of the court below dated 
September 30, 1922, from which no appeal has been taken, we might well consider 
the question raised upon this appeal <i>res adjudicata</i>. For the satisfaction 
of counsel, we shall, however, briefly state another reason why the appeal must 
fail.</p>
<p>It is well settled that a probate court cannot arbitrarily and without 
sufficient reason disregard the preferential rights of the surviving spouse to 
the administration of the estate of the deceased spouse. But, if the person 
enjoying such preferential rights is unsuitable, the court may appoint another 
person. (Paragraph 2 of sec. 642 of the Code of Civil Procedure.) The 
determination of a person's suitability for the office of administrator rests, 
to a great extent, in the sound judgment of the court exercising the power of 
appointment and such judgment will not be interfered with on appeal unless it 
appears affirmatively that the court below was in error.</p>
<p>In the present case the court based its ruling on the fact that it appeared 
from the record in Civil Case No. 1041 of the same court, that the appellant had 
adverse interests in the estate of such a character as to render him unsuitable 
as administrator. Unsuitableness may consist in adverse interest of some kind or 
hostility to those immediately interested in the estate. (18 Cyc., 93, 94.) The 
court below therefore stated facts which may constitute sufficient grounds for 
setting aside the appellant's preferential rights and which, in the absence of 
proof to the contrary, must be presumed sufficient. Whether they are in fact 
sufficient, we are not in position to determine as we have not before us the 
record in the aforesaid case No. 1041; it being a record of the court below, 
that court could properly take judicial notice thereof, but we cannot.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Villamor,</i> and 
<i>Johns, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
