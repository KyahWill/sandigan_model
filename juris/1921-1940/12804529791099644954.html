				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MARIANO FORMENTO ET AL., DEFENDANTS. MARIANO FORMENTO, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">The defendant Mariano Formento appealed from the 
trial court's judgment sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of 
from seven years of <em>prision mayor</em> to fourteen years, eight 
months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal, </em>to indemnify the 
offended party Buena Aviles in the sum of P200, to support the 
offspring, should any be born of her, and to pay one-half of the costs.
</p><p align="justify"> In his brief, the appellant assigns the following 
three alleged errors as committed by the trial court, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "1. The lower court erred in not dismissing the 
complaint for lack of jurisdiction, it appearing that the complaint was 
not instituted and filed by the proper parties enumerated in article 344
 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "2. The lower court erred in holding that there 
was proven the elements of abduction with rape and in not taking into 
account Exhibit 1 of the defense.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "3. The lower court erred in convicting the 
accused, Mariano Formento."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> With respect to the first assignment of error, it 
may be said that the evidence shows that on December 7, 1933, Pia Aviles
 filed in the justice of the peace court of Unisan, Tayabas, a complaint
 which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "The undersigned Pia Aviles accuses Mariano 
Formento, Casimiro Formento and Godofredo Ruiz of the crime of forcible 
abduction of Buena Aviles and under oath states the following:</p>
  <p align="justify"> "That the undersigned is the guardian and aunt of 
the minor Buena Aviles who is an orphan and 14 years of age;</p>
  <p align="justify"> "That on the 20th day of November, 1933, here in 
the municipality of Unisan, Province of Tayabas, and within the 
jurisdiction of this court, the accused Mariano Formento, in connivance 
and with the understanding of the other accused Casimiro Formento and 
Godofredo Ruiz, this latter being brother-in-law of Casimiro, did then 
and there willfully and criminally, by force and intimidation, and with 
lewd designs, carry and take the minor Buena Aviles from our home where 
she is living under the care of the undersigned.</p>

<p align="justify">After the necessary prelfminary investigation had 
been conducted, the case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance of
 the said province and the acting fiscal thereof, on the strength of the
 amended complaint of Pia Aviles (Exhibit A), filed the information 
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "The undersigned provincial fiscal, upon an 
original complaint filed by the guardian of the offended party, accuses 
Mariano Formento and Casimiro B'ormento of the crime of forcible 
abduction defined and penalized in article 342 of the Revised Penal 
Code, committed as follows:</p>
  <p align="justify"> "That on or about November 20,1933, in the 
municipality of Unisan, Province of Tayabas, P. I., and within the 
jurisdiction of this court, the said accused Mariano Formento and 
Casimiro Formento, conspiring and confederating together, willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force, violence and 
intimidation, and with lewd designs, abducted one Buena Aviles of 13 
years of age, single, by taking and carrying her away with them from her
 dwelling against her consent.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p align="justify">As may be noted from the complaint above quoted the 
complainant stated under oath that in addition to being the aunt of the 
offended party Buena Aviles&gt; she was also her guardian. When she 
testified in the lower court, she was not asked by the provincial fiscal
 nor by the attorney for the defendant-appellant, much less by counsel 
for the latter's co-defendant Casimiro Formento, who is his brother, in 
what respect was she the offended party's guardian, whether she was a <em>de
 facto</em> guardian because she was her aunt and took care of her since
 she became an orphan by the death of her parents, or she was a judicial
 guardian appointed by a competent court for that purpose, fully in 
accordance with the provisions of section 551 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure. Such being the case, it would seem arbitrary to hold or even 
assume that the complainant was not, or in fact she is not the guardian 
of the offended party, merely because she failed to present documentary 
evidence to prove that fact. This is all the more true because before as
 well as during the trial, counsel for the appellant did not even 
attempt to prove that she had not been duly appointed as such guardian. 
This court is of the opinion that the complainant's affirmation made in a
 solemn manner, that is, under oath, that she was the offended party's 
guardian, was sufficient to confer upon the justice of the peace, before
 whom she filed her complaint, authority to conduct the necessary 
preliminary investigation and also to confer upon the lower court 
authority to decide the case on its merits after the same was forwarded 
to it</p>
<p align="justify"> Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code prescribes no 
special form of establishing the relation between the complainant and 
the minor who is the victim of any of the offenses therein enumerated, 
nor does it require that such relation, in the case of a guardian and 
ward, be necessarily proved by means of a judicial decree or order. 
Therefore, when a person affirms under oath that he is the guardian of a
 minor, and this is not denied, as in the case of the herein 
complainant, his affirmation under such circumstances constitutes 
sufficient evidence that he is in fact the guardian in the legal sense. 
The complainant in fact complied with the requirements of the law, by 
stating under oath that she was the guardian of the offended party. It 
is therefore clear that the first assignment of error attributed to the 
trial court is unfounded.</p>
<p align="justify"> As to the last two errors, the evidence shows that 
after the appellant, who is a married man, had, early on the morning of 
November 20, 1933, secured the consent of said Buena Aviles who was then
 only 13 years of age, he carried her away from the center of the <em>poblacion</em>
 of Unisan, where they both resided, to the Panaon railroad station, 
whence they later proceeded to Aloneros where they took a banca for the 
barrio of Mangayao of the municipality of Guinayangan, which is more 
than 67 kilometers from Unisan. On the road to the Panaon station, the 
appellant had carnal intercourse with the said girl. While the two were 
in Guinayangan, the said appellant, with the help of his brother 
Casimiro Formento, who had joined them in Aloneros, acting ahead of 
developments, conceived the excuse or rather the defense that the said 
Buena Aviles was not abducted by anybody but she, of her own free will, 
left the house of her aunt and guardian Pia Aviles in order to join her 
supposed sweetheart Godofredo Ruiz, another minor of 17 years of age, 
who is furthermore a brother-in-law of said Casimiro Formento. In 
passing it should also be stated that Godofredo Ruiz was also charged in
 this case but after the trial he was acquitted by the court <em>a quo.</em></p>
<p align="justify"> The prosecution tried to prove that on the date and 
place above stated, Buena Aviles was abducted against her will by the 
appellant, but the same evidence presented by it shows that the 
abduction was committed with the said girl's consent. If it were true 
that she and her sister Antonia had been threatened with death by the 
appellant, the most natural thing to happen, after the threat had 
ceased, would have been for the said sister to immediately disclose said
 fact to her aunt Pia Aviles and reveal furthermore that the offended 
party had been carried away forcibly by the appellant. Nothing of the 
kind, however, took place, for which reason Pia Aviles, instead of 
reporting the matter to the authorities, went asking for information 
regarding the whereabouts of her niece at the houses of their relatives 
in Pitogo and Macalelon.</p>
<p align="justify"> The contention that Godofredo Ruiz and the offended 
party were sweethearts is not supported by the evidence and is not 
convincing. The offended party did not even know the said youth and if 
she endured the farce of feigning love for him, by kissing him in the 
presence of a constabulary soldier, it was because she had been 
instructed to do so under threat of maltreatment if she did not.</p>
<p align="justify"> The testimony of Dr. G. Santos Cuyugan, who examined
 the offended party some weeks after the abduction, confirms the 
latter's testimony that on the occasion referred to by her the appellant
 actually had carnal knowledge of her. According to the said doctor, the
 signs found by him on the body of the said offended party indicate that
 she had carnal knowledge of a man on or about the date of her 
abduction.</p>
<p align="justify"> For all the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is
 hereby modified by sentencing the appellant to an indeterminate penalty
 of from one year to two years, eleven months and ten days of <em>prision
 correccional</em>, to indemnify the minor Buena Aviles in the sum of 
P500, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, to support the offspring, should any be born of the said 
minor, but not to acknowledge the same, being prevented from so doing by
 the nature of its origin, and to pay the costs of this instance plus 
one-half of the costs in the lower court. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Street, Abad Santos, Hull,</em> and <em>Vickers,
 JJ.,</em> concur.
