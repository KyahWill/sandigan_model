				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 30,1920, Catalino Concepcion, acting&nbsp; as customs broker for a Chinese principal, Ong&nbsp; Siong Kang (altos Gui&nbsp; Chiong) procured the delivery&nbsp; of two shipments&nbsp; of goods from&nbsp; Kobe, Japan, against two bonds for the production&nbsp; of the corresponding bills of lading.&nbsp; These bonds supply the basis of this action and, so far as concerns the present appeal, the sole question is whether the appellant, Catalino Concepcion, made himself personally liable by the manner in which he intervened&nbsp; in the execution of these bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bond, Exhibit A to the complaint, begins&nbsp; as follows, and the corresponding paragraph in the other bond (Exhibit B) is the same; with the&nbsp; exception of the amount stated&nbsp; therein, which is P13,500:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"Know All&nbsp; Men&nbsp; By These Presents </span>That we, Catalino Concepcion,&nbsp; customs broker for&nbsp; Ong&nbsp; Siong Kang, of Manila, P. I., as principal, and Union Guarantee Co.,&nbsp; Ltd.,&nbsp; as sureties, are held and firmly bound unto the Government&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands,&nbsp; in the sum of eighteen thousand nine hundred fifty pesos&nbsp; (P18,950) to be paid to the Government of the Philippine Islands, for the payment whereof we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, and administrators, jointly and severally, firmly by these&nbsp; presents."<br></blockquote>As signatories to the bond, we find first the name of the appellant, Catalino Concepcion, affixed&nbsp; by his agent, P. Concepcion.&nbsp; Then follows the signature of Gui Chiong Co., affixed by Ong Siong Kang, which in&nbsp; turn is followed&nbsp; by the signature of the Union Guarantee&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Ltd., affixed&nbsp; by R. E. Humphreys.&nbsp; It is admitted that Gui Chiong is&nbsp; an alias of Ong Siong Kang, and it&nbsp; results that&nbsp; Ong&nbsp; Siong Kang,&nbsp; the principal of Catalino Concepcion, is himself a signatory party&nbsp; to the bond.<br><br>The&nbsp; liability of the principal upon these bonds is undeniable; and&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears that the surety, the Union Guarantee Co., Ltd., has satisfied the liability under both bonds, and in the trial court judgment over was given&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of the Union Guarantee Co.,&nbsp; Ltd.,&nbsp; to recover of&nbsp; both Catalino&nbsp; Concepcion and Ong Siong Kang the amount&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by said&nbsp; Guarantee Co. as surety.&nbsp; It is from the liability thus fixed upon the appellant Conception by the judgment in favor of the&nbsp; Guarantee&nbsp; Co., that the present appeal is prosecuted.<br><br>We see no possible ground for doubting the correctness of the trial&nbsp; court's conclusion with respect to the liability of the appellant upon these bonds.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is insisted that the&nbsp; words following the appellant's name in the&nbsp; bonds show that he&nbsp; was acting only in the capacity of customs broker for Ong Siong Kang, and it is urged that his principal, and not Concepcion himself,&nbsp; should&nbsp; alone be held liable upon the bond.&nbsp; We are of the opinion that this contention&nbsp; is untenable in view of the wording&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bond and the manner in which it is signed.&nbsp; The words "customs broker for Ong Siong Kang, of Manila," must be considered merely&nbsp; as <span style="font-style: italic;">descriptio personæ</span>; &nbsp; Ong Siong&nbsp; Kang is himself a signatory to the bond and it is impossible to maintain that the appellant signed only as broker when his principal also signed for himself.<br><br>In the appellant's brief it is suggested that, if the liability of the appellant is sustained by the court, nevertheless his responsibility should be limited to the amount of the bond given by him as customs broker, which is said to be&nbsp; in the amount of P4,000.&nbsp; In this connection reference is made to the decision in the case of&nbsp; Government of the Philippine Islands&nbsp; and Collector of Customs <i>vs.</i>. Tienzo, G. R.&nbsp; No. 21567.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; But in that case the document upon which liability was based expressly limited the liability on the broker to the amount of his bond. In the present case the extent of the liability is fixed at the amount stated in the respective bonds, and there is no ground for such a limitation as suggested.<br><br>The judgment appealed from must be affirmed, and it is so ordered, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.&nbsp; J., Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Romualdez, JJ,,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [1]</sup> Promulgated September 26, 1924, not reported.<br></div>
