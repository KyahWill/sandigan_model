				<H3>MOISES ACRICHE ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. THE LAW UNION & ROCK INSURANCE CO., LTD., THE LIVER-POOL & LONDON  &  GLOBE  INSURANCE CO., LTD., AND THE GLOBE & RUTGERS FIRE INSURANCE CO., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> These three actions were instituted in the Court of First Instance of the City of&nbsp; Manila by Moises Acriche for the purpose of recovering certain&nbsp; sums of money from the three&nbsp; defendant insurance&nbsp; companies, namely,&nbsp; the Law Union &amp; Rock Insurance Co., Ltd., the Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Insurance&nbsp; Co., Ltd., and the Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Insurance&nbsp; Co., according&nbsp; to their respective&nbsp; proportional liabilities under&nbsp; policies of insurance&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by them on a stock&nbsp; in trade of Moises Acriche, consisting principally of dry goods, and which had been damaged by fire on the night of September 21, 1922.&nbsp; In addition&nbsp; to the alleged direct liability of the defendant insurance companies under the policies of insurance, the plaintiff sought, in the same complaints, to recover certain proceeds resulting from the sale of salvaged stock effected by the defendant companies after the fire, and which&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; have been retained by the&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; In&nbsp; their&nbsp; answer&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants denied liability under the&nbsp; policies, alleging, among&nbsp; other&nbsp; grounds of defense, that the fire&nbsp; causing the loss was of incendiary origin and&nbsp; had been&nbsp; set by or with the procurance and connivance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff with a view&nbsp; to&nbsp; imposing of a fraudulent liability on the defendants; and, further, that the defendants had been relieved of all liability by reason of the fact that the plaintiff had submitted&nbsp; false proofs of loss.&nbsp; After the original pleadings had been submitted, Leon Acriche was&nbsp; joined in the action as coplaintiff with the original plaintiff, Moises&nbsp; Acriche.&nbsp; In*his opinion, the trial judge&nbsp; passed&nbsp; without deciding the&nbsp; question whether the plaintiff, or plaintiffs, had&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; caused or connived at the setting of tfre fire which resulted in the loss but absolved the defendants from liability under their&nbsp; several policies,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground that the plaintiff, or&nbsp; plaintiffs, had submitted false proofs of loss.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless the trial court recognized the right of&nbsp; the plaintiffs to recover the sum of P8,207 which had been retained in the possession of the defendant companies&nbsp; from the proceeds&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sale of the salvaged&nbsp; merchandise.&nbsp; He accordingly&nbsp; gave&nbsp; judgment against the defendants for the last&nbsp; named&nbsp; amount only, dismissing the complaints with&nbsp; respect to the loss caused by&nbsp; the&nbsp; fire.&nbsp; From&nbsp; this judgment the plaintiffs appealed.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears that, prior to the occurrence&nbsp; with which we are here concerned,&nbsp; a&nbsp; mercantile business had been conducted in Manila under the name of Acriche &amp; Co., consisting of David Acriche, Marcos Abolafia, Julio Busto, and one or two others.&nbsp;&nbsp; In November,&nbsp; 1920, Moises Acriche, a Spanish speaking Jew from Gallipoli, arrived in Manila and here joined his brother, David Acriche.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moises claims to have brought with&nbsp; him a sum of money with which he was able to&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; an interest&nbsp; in the business of Acriche &amp; Co.; and later he purchased from one Eskenazi, a share in&nbsp; the same business that had belonged to&nbsp; Julio Busto, now dead.&nbsp; The principal establishment of Acriche &amp; Co. was located at 132-134 Escolta, Manila, where mis- cellaneous merchandise, principally&nbsp; dry goods,&nbsp; was&nbsp; dealt in.&nbsp; David&nbsp; and Moises Acriche have an uncle, named&nbsp; Leon Acriche, who has stores in Iloilo and Cebu, as well as an establishment in Manila;&nbsp; and by reason of the intimate relations of the Acriches among themselves there appears to have been from time to time considerable shifting around of stock from one place to another.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; to be inferred from&nbsp; the proof that the principal function&nbsp; of the concern at 132-134&nbsp; Escolta was the handling of job lots acquired at forced and bankrupt sales and odds and ends collected from&nbsp; various sources.<br><br>By changes in the membership of Acriche &amp; Co. the ownership of the business at 132-134 Escolta had by&nbsp; June 1, 1922, come to J&gt;e vested in Leon&nbsp; Acriche and&nbsp; Moises Acriche; but Moises had the exclusive management of said business, and the policies of insurance with which we are here concerned were issued in 1921 and 1922 in his name.<br><br>One of the defenses relied&nbsp; upon in the answer is&nbsp; that the insurable interest in the stock was not vested in Moises Acriche at the time of the fire,&nbsp; and Leon Acriche was in fact made a party plaintiff in view of his proven interest in the merchandise which was the&nbsp; subject of loss.&nbsp; We note, however, that the policies sued upon&nbsp; are expressly so written as to cover property held in trust or on commission by Moises Acriche, or held by him on joint account with others and for which he was responsible.&nbsp; It is the contention of the defendants that the stock which was&nbsp; damaged by the fire really belonged to the entity, Acriche &amp; Co., and&nbsp; that it cannot be truly said that Moises Acriche held that stock in any of the characters indicated in the policy, and&nbsp; in particular that the stock&nbsp; was not held by Moises Acriche upon joint account with&nbsp; his uncle, Leon&nbsp; Acriche. At the close of his opinion the trial judge appears to have accepted this view of the case, since he observes&nbsp; that the plaintiffs had not satisfactorily shown&nbsp; an ownership&nbsp; consistent with the terms of the policy.&nbsp; Nevertheless we note that in the end he placed his decision on the ground&nbsp; that the defendants were released by&nbsp; the act of the plaintiffs in submitting fraudulent proof.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to pass&nbsp; upon the precise issue as to the ownership of the&nbsp; insured stock.&nbsp; It is enough to suggest that if the&nbsp; claim had been&nbsp; in&nbsp; all&nbsp; other&nbsp; respects fair&nbsp; and honest, the objection&nbsp; referred to would&nbsp; probably not have been a fatal obstacle to a recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; The really determinative questions in the case are the two&nbsp; which have relation to the&nbsp; origin of the fire and the nature of the proof submitted by Moises Acriche&nbsp; in support of the claim.<br><br>The insured&nbsp; merchandise was&nbsp; contained in a&nbsp; store at the corner&nbsp; of the Escolta and David street, in Manila. Immediately above it was&nbsp; a&nbsp; room occupied for&nbsp; business purposes by one Sam Weingarten,&nbsp; for some time a resident of Manila&nbsp; prior to the fire but who has since absconded. At about 8.30&nbsp; on the night&nbsp; of&nbsp; September&nbsp; 21, 1922, pedestrians in the vicinity heard an explosion which appeared to have-&nbsp; come&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; direction&nbsp; of this&nbsp; store.&nbsp; Immediately smoke&nbsp; and&nbsp; flames were seen&nbsp; to issue from the window of the room occupied&nbsp; by Weingarten.&nbsp; The policeman who happened to be on&nbsp; duty at the corner&nbsp; of the two streets&nbsp; mentioned immediately turned&nbsp; on the&nbsp; fire alarm;&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; detachment of&nbsp; firemen,&nbsp; with&nbsp; appropriate apparatus, reached&nbsp; the place&nbsp; within two or three minutes. As the center of the conflagration appeared to be in Weingarten's room, the&nbsp; firemen broke&nbsp; open the&nbsp; door,&nbsp; which was locked from the outside, and turned on the hose.&nbsp; Admittance was, in like manner gained into&nbsp; Acriche's store, and water was turned into that apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this&nbsp; way the flames were subjugated before they had attained much headway.<br><br>An inspection of the premises followed,&nbsp; with the result that the fire was seen to have been indubitably of incendiary origin; and by putting things together, the following facts have been satisfactorily made out:&nbsp; On&nbsp; the afternoon&nbsp; preceding the fire, Weingarten brought a large demijohn from his sleeping&nbsp; apartment in another&nbsp; part of the city to his room above Acriche's store.&nbsp; On the same afternoon a five- gallon can of gasoline was delivered to Weingarten at the same place; and a muchacho carried the tin up by Weingarten's direction, while the driver of the carretela making the delivery&nbsp; waited&nbsp; below.&nbsp; The can was then opened by Weingarten and&nbsp; the contents poured into the&nbsp; demijohn, upon which the&nbsp; muchacho was directed to&nbsp; take the empty can back to&nbsp; the person&nbsp; waiting below.&nbsp; This was done. The same afternoon Moises Acriche had a secret and extended interview with Weingarten&nbsp; in&nbsp; the latter's room. The fire had evidently originated&nbsp; in Weingarten's room and a quantity of rags of mosquito netting, saturated with inflamable liquid was found on the floor of&nbsp; this room after the fire was&nbsp; extinguished.&nbsp; The demijohn&nbsp; also was found to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; shattered.<br><br>The&nbsp; noise&nbsp; of&nbsp; the explosion, which attracted attention at the very beginning of the fire, finds its explanation in the following facts: The floor of Weingarten's room&nbsp; was made of wood and&nbsp; the planks&nbsp; were not close enough together to prevent leakage.&nbsp; Moreover, at a&nbsp; certain place in the floor, there was a hole through which&nbsp; any liquid&nbsp; that might be poured on the floor would&nbsp; readily flow into the space below.&nbsp; The&nbsp; ceiling of Acriche's store was formed of metal sheets, so closely joined together that any liquid admitted from above would be retained as in a receptacle. Now, the gasoline&nbsp; which had been in the demijohn had evidently been emptied in the floor of Weingarten's room, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; result&nbsp; that a considerable quantity had trickled through the floor and had probably farmed a puddle on the metal roofing of the store&nbsp; below.&nbsp; The gasoline, being a substance which evaporates&nbsp; freely, had quickly saturated with its&nbsp; gas the air in the enclosed space, with the result that when the fire,&nbsp; started in some unknown manner, had reached the spot an explosion occurred, as in the chamber of a gas engine.&nbsp; The physical effect of the&nbsp; explosion was to blow a large hole in the metal ceiling, splattering liquid gasoline&nbsp; over the contents of the store.&nbsp; The hole thus formed was&nbsp; about 2 feet in diameter.&nbsp; Upon examination of the goods found on&nbsp; the counter and shelves of the store, a&nbsp; smell similar&nbsp; to&nbsp; that emitted by gasoline or petroleum was perceived.<br><br>That the&nbsp; fire&nbsp; was started by an incendiary, who&nbsp; could be none other than Weingarten, is self-evident,&nbsp; and circumstantial proof points to Moises Acriche&nbsp; as a&nbsp; probable instigator of the act.&nbsp; Among these circumstances it may be noted that Weingarten had nothing insured from which he could expect&nbsp; to profit by such a fire, while Acriche had on his hands an unsalable stock of self-worn goods, and his sales during the month preceding the&nbsp; fire had been small&nbsp; in&nbsp; amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acriche denies&nbsp; having&nbsp; had&nbsp; any&nbsp; intimacy&nbsp; with Weingarten,&nbsp; but&nbsp; this&nbsp; pretense&nbsp; must&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; disproved,&nbsp; as&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; shown&nbsp; to&nbsp; have visited Weingarten's living room&nbsp; in another part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the city upon more than one occasion prior to the fire.<br><br>But most convincing of the circumstances suggestive of Acriche's participation in the starting of the fire is found in what appears to be a preconceived plan on&nbsp; his part for proving a greater loss than such as would probably result from a&nbsp; destructive fire.&nbsp; The insurance policies&nbsp; which were the subject&nbsp; of suit together cover the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P55,000 and were taken out, as already stated, by Moises Acriche at the end of the year 1921 and beginning of 1922. Upon the demand of the adjuster, the insured supplied a document purporting to be an&nbsp; inventory of stock,&nbsp; dated May 31, 1922.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit F.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition to this various invoices&nbsp; were produced, showing additions&nbsp; to the&nbsp; stock between&nbsp; that date and the date of the&nbsp; fire, on September 21.&nbsp; (Exhibits K-l and K-66.)&nbsp; After the fire had occurred the stock was&nbsp; examined, and some of the goods, as&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; the Exhibit L-l,&nbsp; were found to be un-injured.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; were turned over by the adjuster to the insured.&nbsp;&nbsp; The damaged goods&nbsp; were listed in the Exhibit L,&nbsp; which shows the character and quantity of the merchandise,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as&nbsp; its&nbsp; value.&nbsp; The&nbsp; adjuster&nbsp; verified this list as to kind and quantity&nbsp; of&nbsp; articles&nbsp; listed, and the&nbsp; values shown&nbsp; were either&nbsp; added upon the sole responsibility of the insured or taken without question from data supplied by him.&nbsp; The Exhibit L, a list of the damaged goods, was submitted&nbsp; by the insured as the basis of his claims against the defendant&nbsp; insurance companies.&nbsp; According to this list the value of the damaged stock at the time of the fire was ¥=37,359.77.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not satisfied with the valuation fixed by Acriche, the insurance companies caused an&nbsp; independent appraisal to be made by two disinterested persons, with the result that the same goods were appraised by&nbsp; them at&nbsp; ¥28,537.78, showing that the valuations fixed in&nbsp; the Exhibit&nbsp; L&nbsp; were probably excessive, due&nbsp; account being taken of the character of the goods.<br><br>A comparison of the&nbsp; inventory&nbsp; and invoices with the lists L and L-l&nbsp; reveals the fact that goods shown in the inventory and invoices to the value of P52,708.73 had disappeared&nbsp; from the&nbsp; stock during the interval between May 31&nbsp; and September 21; and as the trial court declared,&nbsp; no satisfactory showing has been made by&nbsp; the assured as&nbsp; to the disposition made of said goods.&nbsp; Certainly they cannot be&nbsp; accounted&nbsp; for on the supposition that they had&nbsp; been sold, since the books show&nbsp; that the gross&nbsp; sales between May 31 and September 21 were about P20,918.43.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; J.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Further examination of the same documents reveals the fact that goods to the value of P16,899.22 were found in the stock upon the date of the fire which were not listed at all&nbsp; in the inventory or invoices.&nbsp; The proper inference to be&nbsp; drawn from this showing in our opinion is that the&nbsp; inventory was in a great measure false, and it is impossible&nbsp; to believe that the assured has acted in good faith.<br><br>The incredible proof connected with the stock of mosquito&nbsp; netting strongly&nbsp; tends&nbsp; to the same conclusion.&nbsp; The Exhibit G purports to show that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; month of May, 1922,&nbsp; the Escolta store received from Leon&nbsp; Acriche 116 bales, each&nbsp; containing 100 mosquito nets&nbsp; of the value of P1.20 per net, and amounting in all to the value of 913,920. These mosquito nets are not&nbsp; listed in Exhibit F,&nbsp; and their disappearance has&nbsp; not been accounted&nbsp; for.&nbsp; Other exhibits show that between&nbsp; May 31 and&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of the fire mosquito netting of the value of P9,969.60 was purchased from Leon Acriche and other small purchases of&nbsp; the same sort of&nbsp; goods&nbsp; were bought from&nbsp; one Epstein&nbsp; and one Goldstein, amounting&nbsp; (with that&nbsp; purchased from&nbsp; Leon Acriche) to the&nbsp; value of P10,465.56.&nbsp; If to this&nbsp; be added the mosquito netting received in May from Leon&nbsp; Acriche, we&nbsp; have merchandise&nbsp; of this&nbsp; sort to&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of P24,385.56.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in the&nbsp; lists&nbsp; L and&nbsp; L-l only&nbsp; a&nbsp; trivial amount of these goods, if any,&nbsp; is listed.&nbsp; Exhibit S, dated August 8, 1922,&nbsp; shows that&nbsp; upon that&nbsp; date various effects were consigned from the Escolta store to the house of one Isaac&nbsp; Acriche on Rosario street,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; City of Manila, of a total value of P3,169.10.&nbsp; Among the&nbsp; goods so consigned appear three bales of mosquito netting of&nbsp; a total value of P435.&nbsp; The Exhibit T shows a similar&nbsp; consignment in June&nbsp; to&nbsp; Leon Acriche and&nbsp; Marcos&nbsp; Chucran, in&nbsp; Cebu, of thirty&nbsp; bales of mosquito netting valued&nbsp; at 93,200.<br><br>We believe the Exhibit G&nbsp; to be fictitious, at least as to a great&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the quantity of mosquito netting&nbsp; stated therein;&nbsp; and upon a review&nbsp; of the whole evidence we find no reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion of the trial court that the inventory&nbsp; of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 1&nbsp; is in great part false and that the plaintiffs have submitted false evidence in support of their claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; It must&nbsp; also be considered established by a preponderance of evidence, though only of a circumstantial nature, that the plaintiff,&nbsp; Moises Acriche, is responsible for the fire which gave rise to this action.<br><br>The insurance policies which are&nbsp; the subject of&nbsp; suit in these cases contain a provision expressly declaring that all benefit&nbsp; thereunder shall be forfeited if&nbsp; the loss&nbsp; be occasioned by the willful act&nbsp; or&nbsp; with&nbsp; the connivance of the insured, or if the claim be in any&nbsp; respect fraudulent or if any fraudulent means are used by the insured&nbsp; or any one acting in his&nbsp; behalf to obtain&nbsp; any benefit under the policy.&nbsp; This provision is&nbsp; fatal to&nbsp; any recovery&nbsp; by the plaintiffs; and the cause is&nbsp; not aided by the circumstance that the plaintiff, or plaintiffs, in&nbsp; fact suffered loss by the damage done to the goods listed in Exhibit L,&nbsp;&nbsp; Supposing Moises&nbsp; Acriche to have acted fraudulently, a thing which is in our opinion established, it must be remembered that the object in view was totally to destroy the stock at 132- 134 Escolta by fire; and it&nbsp; was not&nbsp; designed that the fire should be put out before the&nbsp; work of the fire was&nbsp; fully accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; the manifest purpose had been attained, the books and documents submitted by the plaintiffs would have&nbsp; shown a loss&nbsp; far in&nbsp; excess of the amount&nbsp; of the policies, and the companies&nbsp; would have been defrauded of a large sum of money in&nbsp; excess of&nbsp; the&nbsp; real&nbsp; loss.&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation is to be judged not so much in the light of&nbsp; what actually happened as in the light&nbsp; of the purpose intended to be effected.<br><br>In&nbsp; our opinion there was no error in the judgment appealed from, and the same&nbsp; is affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against the appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avancena, C.
