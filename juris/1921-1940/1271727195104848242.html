				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 10, 1920, Salvador B. Chaves drew a check on the Philippine National 
Bank for P11,000 in favor of <i>La Insular</i>, a concern doing business in this 
city. This check was indorsed by the limited partners of <i>La Insular</i>, and 
then deposited by Salvador B. Chaves in his current account with the plaintiff, 
Asia Banking Corporation. The deposit was made on July 14, 1920.
<p>On June 25, 1920, Salvador B. Chaves drew another check for P18,785.30 on the 
Philippine National Bank, in favor of the aforesaid <i>La Insular</i>. This 
check was also indorsed by the limited partners of <i>La Insular</i>, and was 
likewise deposited by Salvador B. Chaves in his current account with the 
plaintiff, Asia Banking Corporation, on July 6, 1920.</p>
<p>The amount represented by both checks was used by Salvador B. Chaves after 
they were deposited in the plaintiff bank, by drawing checks on the plaintiff. 
Subsequently these checks were presented by the plaintiff to the Philippine 
National Bank for payment, but the latter refused to pay on the ground that the 
drawer, Salvador B. Chaves, had no funds therein.</p>
<p>The plaintiff now brings this action against the defendant, as indorser, for 
the payment of the value of both checks.</p>
<p>The lower court sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiff P11,000, upon 
the check of May 10, 1920, with interest thereon at 9 per cent per annum from 
July 10, 1920, and P18,778.34 on the check of June 25, 1920, with interest 
thereon at 9 per cent per annum from August 5, 1920. From this judgment the 
defendant appealed.</p>
<p>One of the contentions of the appellant in support of this appeal is, that at 
all events its liability as indorser of the checks in question was extinguished. 
We may say in connection with this assignment of error that the liability of the 
defendant never arose.</p>
<p>Section 89 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (Act No. 2031) provides that, 
when a negotiable instrument is dishonored for non-acceptance or non-payment, 
notice thereof must be given to the drawer and each of the indorsers, and those 
who are not notified shall be discharged from liability, except where this act 
provides otherwise. According to this, the indorsers are not liable unless they 
are notified that the document was dishonored. Then, under the general principle 
of the law of procedure, it will be incumbent upon the plaintiff, who seeks to 
enforce the defendant's liability upon these checks as indorser, to establish 
said liability by proving that notice was given to the defendant within the 
time, and in the manner, required by the law that the checks in question had 
been dishonored. If these facts are not proven, the plaintiff has not 
sufficiently established the defendant's liability. There is no proof in the 
record tending to show that plaintiff gave any notice whatsoever to the 
defendant that the checks in question had been dishonored, and therefore it has 
not established its cause of action.</p>
<p>For the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendant 
is absolved from the complaint without special pronouncement as to costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm,</i> and <i>Ostrand, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Johns voted for reversal, but he was absent at the time of the 
promulgation of the decision and his signature therefore does not appear signed 
to the opinion of the court.</p>
