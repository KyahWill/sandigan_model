				<H3>PRIMITIVO GONZALEZ Y LAUREL, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. JOVITA LAUREL Y TAPIA, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By an order dated December 16, 1921, the Court of First Instance of Batangas 
allowed the document, Exhibit A, to probate as the last will and testament of 
the deceased Maria Tapia, thus granting the petition of Primitivo L. Gonzalez 
and overruling the opposition presented by Jovita Laurel.
<p>Jovita Laurel now appeals to this court from that ruling of the court below, 
alleging that that court erred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. In holding that Exhibit A, the supposed will of the deceased Maria Tapia 
y Castillo, was executed with the solemnities prescribed by the law, 
notwithstanding that there was no proof of the dialect known by the said 
deceased and of the fact that it was the same in which said Exhibit A was 
written.</p>
<p>"2. In not holding that the signatures of Maria Tapia appearing in said 
Exhibit A had been obtained through deceit, surprise, fraud, and in an illegal 
and improper manner.</p>
<p>"3. In not finding that said Exhibit A was obtained through unlawful 
pressure, influence and machinations of the applicant, Primitivo L. Gonzalez, 
one of the legatees, in connivance with Attorney Modesto Castillo.</p>
<p>"4. In not finding that the deceased Maria Tapia was physically and mentally 
incapacitated at the time she is said to have executed Exhibit A.</p>
<p>"5. In declaring said Exhibit A valid and authentic and allowing it to 
probate as the will and testament of the deceased Maria Tapia y 
Castillo."</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning the first error assigned, it appears that the deceased Maria Tapia 
was a resident of the Province of Batangas, a Tagalog region, where said 
deceased had had real properties for several years. It also appears that she 
requested Modesto Castillo to draw her will in Tagalog. From the record taken as 
a whole, a presumption arises that said Maria Tapia knew the Tagalog dialect, 
which presumption is now conclusive for not having been overthrown nor 
rebutted.</p>
<p>The three following errors have reference to the question whether or not the 
testatrix acted voluntarily and with full knowledge in executing and signing the 
will. The preponderance of evidence in this respect is that said document was 
executed and signed by Maria Tapia voluntarily and with full knowledge, without 
fraud, deceit, surprise, or undue influence or machinations of anybody, she 
being then mentally capacitated and free. Such is the fact established by the 
evidence, which we have carefully examined.</p>
<p>In connection with the evidence, our attention was called to an 
irreconcilable conflict between the transcript of an answer of the witness 
Primitivo L. Gonzalez, presented by the appellant as "Annex 1" to his motion 
filed in this court (fol. 16 of the <i>Rollo</i>), and the official transcript, 
in that while said answer is <i>"Yes, sir,"</i> according to the transcript of 
the appellant, it is <i>"Certainly, that is not true,"</i> according to the 
official transcript of the stenographic notes attached to the record. But it is 
to be noted that at the continuation of the hearing held on a subsequent date, 
in which said witness Primitivo L. Gonzalez was examined on this contradiction, 
he said in the course of the rebuttal evidence of the applicant: <i>"No, sir. I 
did not answer in that way. I did not take her hand to make her sign. I did not 
by any means answer that question to that effect. I very well remember that 
fact, because it affects much the probate of the will."</i> (Fols. 56 and 57 of 
transcript and documentary evidence.)</p>
<p>It appearing from the record that the document Exhibit A is the will of the 
deceased Maria Tapia, executed with all the formalities and solemnities required 
by the law, the trial court did not commit any error in admitting it to 
probate.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this decision, we deem it unnecessary to pass upon the 
question raised by the appellee as to whether or not this appeal was perfected 
within the time fixed by the law.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Villamor, Ostrand,</i> 
and <i>Johns, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
