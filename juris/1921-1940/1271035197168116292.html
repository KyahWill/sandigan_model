				<H3>CATALINA ASINAS, ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND FRANCISCO MEDINA, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ROMBLON AND FELISA ASINAS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an original petition for the writ of prohibition filed 
by Catalina Asinas, assisted by her husband Francisco Medina, against the Court 
of First Instance of Romblon and Felisa Asinas, praying, for the reasons therein 
given, that the respondent court be required to refrain from ordering the 
payment of P200 to the respondent Felisa Asinas and permitting the latter to 
intervene in the proceeding for the probate of Mauricio Asinas' will, and the 
administration of his estate; and the said respondent Felisa Asinas to refrain 
from performing any act with respect thereto.
<p align="justify">The pertinent facts necessary to the solution of the legal 
question raised in the present instance, briefly stated, are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">On August 9, 1926, an application for the probate of what 
purports to be the will of the deceased Mauricio Asinas, a resident of the 
municipality of Looc of the Province of Romblon was filed in the office of the 
clerk of the Court of First Instance of Romblon.</p>
<p align="justify">Opposition was entered to said application by the respondent 
Felisa Asinas, alleging that she is an acknowledged natural daughter of Mauricio 
Asinas, and by Justo Asinas, brother of said deceased.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the fact that the petitioner Catalina Asinas denied 
Felisa Asinas' right to intervene in the proceeding for the probate of said 
alleged will, the court proceeded to determine whether said respondent is really 
an acknowledged natural daughter of the deceased Mauricio Asinas.</p>
<p align="justify">After hearing the parties, and upon consideration of the 
evidence adduced, the respondent court, in spite of petitioner's objection, 
authorized Felisa Asinas to intervene in said probate proceeding as well as in 
the administration of the said deceased's estate, and granted her, moreover, 
P200 travelling expenses for herself and her witnesses, chargeable to the funds 
under administration.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner took exception to said rulings issued by the 
respondent court and moved for a reconsideration, but said motion was denied by 
its order of November 19, 1927.</p>
<p align="justify">The question to be determined in the present instance is 
whether or not the respondent court exceeded its jurisdiction in authorizing the 
respondent Felisa Asinas to intervene in the proceeding for the probate of the 
alleged will of the deceased Mauricio Asinas and the administration of his 
estate, as well as in ordering that the expenses incurred by her appearance in 
court and that of her witnesses, amounting to P200, be charged to the funds 
under administration.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 630 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in requiring the 
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the province, for three 
consecutive weeks, of the date fixed by the competent court for the probate of a 
will, in order to afford all those interested an opportunity to appear and 
oppose said probate, does not specify who are the interested parties who may 
appear, nor what proof they must submit to show such interest.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Paras vs. Narciso (35 Phil., 244), this court 
laid down the following doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"WILLS; PROBATE; PARTIES TO PROCEEDINGS.—Before any person may 
intervene in proceedings had in a Court of First Instance for the probate of a 
will, he should be required to show an interest in the will or the property 
affected thereby either as executor or otherwise, and strangers should not be 
permitted over the objection of the real parties in interest to embarrass the 
proceedings by meddling or intruding themselves in matters with which they have 
no concern.</p>
<p align="justify">"ID.; ID.; ID.; INTERVENTION BY STRANGER.—But the mere fact 
that a stranger has been permitted to oppose or contest the probate of a will is 
not reversible error and does not invalidate the proceedings where no objection 
is interposed by any of the parties in interest. The judgment of the court in 
probate proceedings is not based on the fact that there is or is not opposition 
to the probate of the will, but upon the production of evidence which discloses 
that there are or are not sufficient grounds for the admission of the will to 
probate."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">A person alleging an interest in opposing the probate of a will 
as an acknowledged natural daughter need not conclusively prove the existence of 
such a civil status, or that such status has been judicially declared; it is 
sufficient that there be <em>prima facie</em> evidence to that effect. This is 
not only because the law does not require it, but because section 753 of the 
same Code provides for the determination of the persons entitled to receive the 
rest of the property in the said administration proceeding after the debts, 
funeral and administration expenses have been paid. (Pimentel vs. Palanca, 5 
Phil., 436; Torres vs. Javier, 34 Phil., 382; Severino vs. Severino, 44 PhiL, 
343; Briz vs. Briz and Remigio, 43 Phil., 763.)</p>
<p align="justify">As to the respondent's (Felisa Asinas') right to intervene in 
the appointment of an administrator and in the estate, that is nothing more than 
a logical consequence of her right to oppose the probate of the will.</p>
<p align="justify">For the foregoing, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that the 
respondent court did not exceed its jurisdiction in permitting the respondent 
Felisa Asinas, upon producing <em>prima facie</em> evidence of her condition as 
an acknowledged natural daughter of the deceased Mauricio Asinas, to oppose the 
probate of the said deceased's will, and to intervene in the appointment of an 
administrator of the property left by him.</p>
<p align="justify">With regard to the question as to whether or not the respondent 
court exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering that the expenses incurred by the 
respondent (Felisa Asinas) and her witnesses be paid from the funds under 
administration, this court laid down the following rule in the case of Lizarraga 
Hermanos vs. Abada (40 Phil., 124):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The expenses of administration should be those necessary for 
the management of the property, for protecting it against destruction or 
deterioration, and possibly for the production of fruits; but the sum expended 
by an administrator of an extensive administration of the estates of the 
decedent cannot be considered 'expenses of administration.' "</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">There can be no doubt that the expenses incurred by the 
respondent Felisa Asinas for her appearance and that of her Witnesses, with a 
view to establishing her right to oppose the probate of Mauricio Asinas' will, 
cannot be considered as administration expenses, inasmuch as they are not 
necessary either for the management of the property or its protection from 
destruction or deterioration, or for the production of fruits. Although a Court 
of First Instance has jurisdiction to authorize a judicial administrator of a 
decedent's estate to make certain expenses for the benefit of said estate, or to 
approve those already made, such jurisdiction is confined to expenses strictly 
necessary for the good management thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">In ordering, then, that the P200 expenses incurred for the 
appearance of the respondent and her witnesses be paid out of, and charged to, 
the funds under administration, the respondent court exceeded its 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondent court's resolution ordering the payment of said 
expenses to be charged to the funds under administration, is final in character, 
since by it a claim of the respondent (Felisa Asinas) is granted, without the 
administrator or the petitioner having had a day in court, and notwithstanding 
their subsequent opposition, thus giving an end to the controversy; and as such 
it is appealable, without the necessity of waiting for the termination of the 
administration.</p>
<p align="justify">As there is another plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the 
ordinary course of justice, namely, an appeal, prohibition cannot lie (So Chu 
and Limpangco vs. Nepomuceno and Reis, 29 Phil., 208; Quimpo vs. Salas, 41 
Phil., 353).</p>
<p align="justify">Summarizing the foregoing, we hold:</p>
<ol><li>That a Court of First Instance does not exceed its probate jurisdiction in 
authorizing one claiming to be an acknowledged natural child of a decedent to 
intervene in the probate of the alleged will of said decedent, upon presentation 
of <em>prima facie</em> evidence of such civil status. And,<br><br>
</li><li>That although a Court of First Instance does exceed its jurisdiction in 
ordering the payment from the funds under administration of the expenses 
incurred by a presumptive heir for his appearance and that of his witnesses with 
a view to opposing the probate of an alleged will of his predecessor, because 
such expenses are not necessary to the management of the estate, or for its 
productivity, yet said decree being of a final character and appealable, and 
there existing a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, such as an appeal, the writ 
of prohibition cannot be issued. </li></ol>
<p align="justify">By virtue whereof, the remedy applied for is denied, and the 
application is dismissed, with the costs against the petitioner. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Malcolm, Villamor, Johns,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, 
concur. </p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>OSTRAND, J.: </strong></p> I concur in the result of the decision of the court, but I 
think it well to call attention to the fact that the record indicates that the 
respondent Felisa Asinas has not as yet established a <em>prima facie</em> case 
as to her claim to the status of a <em>recognized</em> natural child of the 
deceased Mauricio Asinas (<em>see</em> articles 131, 135 and 137 of the Civil 
Code in connection with the cases of Concepcion vs. Untaran, 38 Phil., 736 and 
Samson vs. Corrales Tan, 48 Phil., 401).</div>
