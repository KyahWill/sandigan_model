				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">On May 26, 1926, the defendants, with the exception 
of Concepcion Carratala, married to Luis Fernandez Sidebotorn, signed a 
public document (Exhibit D) in favor of Gotiaoco y Hermanos wherein they
 stated as follows: "That we have received to our full satisfaction the 
sum of P6,000 from Messrs. Gotiaoco y Hermanos; that we bind ourselves 
to pay interest thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from the 
date of the deed until the debt is fully paid, and that we mortgage to 
said Gotiaoco y Hermanos a parcel of land covered by original 
certificate of title No. 8696, binding ourselves, furthermore, to the 
mortgagees for the eviction and warranty of this property which has been
 given as security for our debt." This document was not registered.&nbsp; The plaintiff is the successor of Gotiaoco y 
Hermanos and, as such, filed the complaint in this case, seeking to 
recover from the defendants the sum of P6,000 with interest at 12 per 
cent per annum from May 26, 1926.</p>
<p align="justify"> In their answer the defendants allege that the 
indebtedness of P6,000 referred to in the complaint was contracted 
personally by Gabino Veloso; that they did not receive any part of said 
sum, and that, in signing Exhibit D, they merely tried to secure the 
loan granted to Gabino Veloso with the mortgage on their property.</p>
<p align="justify"> The appealed judgment dismissed the complaint as to 
Concepcion Carratala, married to Luis Fernandez Sidebotom, for not 
having signed the document Exhibit D. It absolved the other defendants 
from paying the sum of P6,000, declaring that said sum was a personal 
debt of Gabino Veloso, but ordered them to pay to the plaintiff the 
interest thereon at 12 per cent per annum from May 27, 1926, until fully
 paid.</p>
<p align="justify"> Both the plaintiff and the defendants appealed.</p>
<p align="justify"> The plaintiff appealed from that part of the 
judgment holding the defendants not liable to pay to it the sum of 
P6,000. The defendants appealed from so much of the judgment as ordered 
them to pay to the plaintiff interest on the sum of P6,000 at 12 per 
cent per annum from May 27, 1926, and particularly with respect to the 
defendant Consuelo Carratala, on the ground that she, being married, 
signed the document Exhibit D without the consent of her husband Gabino 
Veloso.</p>
<p align="justify"> As to the plaintiff's appeal we are of the opinion 
that the defendants who signed Exhibit D are liable to pay to said 
plaintiff the sum of P6,000. The terms of said document, the material 
parts of which had been quoted hereinbefore, are explicit in the sense 
that the defendants considered themselves indebted in said sum upon 
affirming that they had received the same to their full satisfaction, 
binding themselves to pay the interest thereon and, calling it, to be 
more explicit<em>, our debt</em>.</p>
<p align="justify"> However, the defendants allege that the said sum of 
P6,000 was Gabino Veloso's personal debt and that they signed the 
document Exhibit D merely for the purpose of securing with the mortgaged
 property the payment thereof by Gabino Veloso, and that it was not 
their intention to assume the obligation to pay the sum in question. The
 only witness presented in connection with said defense was Gabino 
Veloso. However, although Veloso testified that the sum of P6,000 is his
 personal debt, he did not state that the defendants signed the document
 Exhibit D merely for the purpose of securing with the mortgage the 
payment thereof and that they did not assume the obligation to pay the 
same. It results from the foregoing that there is no evidence that the 
defendants' intention, which is clearly deducible from the terms of the 
document, is not that which they had upon signing said document.</p>
<p align="justify"> The fact that the debt in question was originally 
contracted by Gabino Veloso alone, does not alter the defendants' 
liability. The most that can be inferred therefrom is that the original 
contract of loan between Veloso and the plaintiff's predecessor in 
interest was novated under Exhibit D by the substitution of the persons 
who signed it as debtors.</p>
<p align="justify"> This conclusion likewise adversely decides the 
defendants' appeal with respect to the payment of interest. If they must
 pay the debt, they should pay the stipulated interest, especially 
because they expressly bound themselves to do so. Furthermore, this 
conclusion relieves us from discussing the erroneous contention made in 
the defendants' brief, to the effect that in this case the mortgage is 
the principal obligation, and the payment of interest an accessory.</p>
<p align="justify"> As to Consuelo Carratala, we concur in the trial 
court's opinion that she cannot evade the effect of the document signed 
by her by alleging that it is null and void for lack of her husband's 
consent, inasmuch as only the husband or his heirs can raise such 
question of nullity.</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the foregoing considerations, the 
judgment appealed from is modified, and the defendants, with the 
exception of Concepcion Carratala and her husband, are ordered to pay to
 the plaintiff the sum of P6,000. Said judgment is affirmed in all other
 respects, without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Street, Malcolm, Vickers, Butte, Goddard, </em>and
 <em>Diaz, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>IMPERIAL,</strong><em> J., </em>with whom 
concur <strong>VILLA-REAL, ABAD SANTOS, </strong>and <strong>HULL, </strong><em>JJ.,</em>
 dissenting:</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 26, 1926, the defendants signed the document 
which reads as follows:</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>"Know all men by these presents;</em> That we 
Feliciana Enriquez, widow, Carmen Carratala, married to Mariano G. 
Veloso, Concepcion Carratala, married to Luis Fernandez Sidebotom, 
Manuel Carratala, married to Quintillana Samson, all of age, do hereby 
declare that, in consideration of the sum of six thousand pesos 
(P6,000), which we have received to our full satisfaction from Messrs. 
Gotiaoco y Hermanos, do hereby mortgage to said Messrs. Gotiaoco y 
Hermanos, their heirs and successors in interest, a parcel of land known
 as lot number one thousand seven hundred fifty-six (lot No. 1756) of 
the cadastre of Cebu, Cebu, and described in original certificate of 
title number eight thousand six hundred and ninety-six (o. c. of title 
No. 8696) of the registry of deeds of Cebu.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "We likewise declare that the stipulated term of 
this mortgage is two (2) years from the date of this deed, and we bind 
ourselves to pay interest thereon at twelve per cent (12%) per annum 
until the debt is fully paid.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "We further declare that during the term of the 
mortgage the assessments in favor of the municipality, by way of land 
taxes, as well as the assessments in favor of the provincial or insular 
government, will be paid by the mortgagors, binding ourselves, 
furthermore, to the mortgagees for the eviction and warranty of the 
above described property which has been given as security for our 
indebtedness.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "In witness whereof, we hereunto affix our 
signatures at Cebu, Cebu, P. I., this 26th day of May, 1926.</p>

<p align="justify"> Inasmuch as the defendants refused to pay the sum of
 P6,000 and the interest thereon and because, on the other hand, said 
mortgage deed was not duly registered, the plaintiff entity brought a 
personal action for the recovery of both.</p>
<p align="justify"> The plaintiff appealed from that part of the 
judgment absolving the defendants from the payment of the sum of P6,000.
 The defendants, in turn, appealed in so far as the judgment ordered 
them to pay interest thereon at 12 per cent per annum from May 27, 1926,
 with costs.</p>
<p align="justify"> In their answer, the defendants alleged, among other
 defenses, that the above quoted document, transcribed in the complaint,
 does not express the true intention of the parties, and that the sum 
claimed was an indebtedness of one Gabino Veloso, which they, without 
assuming it, secured by the real property described in the document.</p>
<p align="justify"> It has been established by means of preponderant and
 convincing evidence that the sum of P6,000 was an obligation contracted
 by Gabino M. Veloso from the plaintiff's predecessor in interest, which
 the defendants secured with the mortgage on their real property.</p>
<p align="justify"> Such facts are shown by said Veloso'3 testimony to 
the effect that he owed said sum; that he issued a promissory note for 
the accrued interest thereon; and that said promissory note was 
presented in his insolvency proceedings as evidence of the claim filed 
by the plaintiff, and that the defendants merely secured his personal 
obligation with the mortgage in question. Exhibit 1 corroborates 
Veloso's statement that he issued a promissory note for the accrued 
interest on his indebtedness of P6,000 and that, in order to collect the
 same, the plaintiff presented it as a claim in his insolvency 
proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify"> It having been proven that the case involves an 
obligation or indebtedness contracted by a third person and that the 
defendants by means of the above quoted document merely secured it with 
the mortgage executed by them, it is evident that the action brought for
 the recovery of the principal obligation does not lie against the 
defendants, and the same should have been instituted against Veloso.</p>
<p align="justify"> The plaintiff's claim that the defendants, by means 
of said document, assumed Veloso's obligation, is incompatible with the 
weight of the evidence and is not supported by the terms of the document
 which, it has also been proven, does not reflect the true intention of 
the parties or the true facts of the case.</p>
<p align="justify"> As to the defendants' appeal, the same is unfounded.
 It is not error to have ordered them to pay interest. Such obligation 
is clearly disclosed by the terms of the document. The obligation which 
they voluntarily bound themselves to perform is lawful and effective, 
for the reason that a person may bind himself to pay the interest on the
 debt of a third person, and that is precisely what the defendants did 
in this case.</p>
<p align="justify"> The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with 
the costs of this instance against the plaintiff-appellant.
