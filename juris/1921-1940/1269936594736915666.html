				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This
is an appeal by the M. P. Tranco, Inc., from an order of the Public
Service Commission entered on January 24, 1933, which is the basis of
G. R. No. 39181,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in which the Manila Railroad Company was the appellant, and which was decided by this court in a decision promulgated this day.
  <p>  The first assignment of error in the present appeal relates to the power of the Public Service Commission under paragraph (<em>h</em>) of section 15 of Act No. 3108 to grant <em>ex parte</em>,
without notice and without the taking of any evidence, a change in
rates. It is to be noted that the Legislature has fixed a thirty-day
period as the normal period before a proposed change of rates takes
effect. The commission has absolute power to suspend the change for a
period not exceeding three months, but a true reading of the law would
indicate that the commission should have some facts to change the
period of thirty days fixed by the Legislature. But as the period of
thirty days has long since been passed, the first assignment of error
really has become academic.</p>
  <p> The second, third, and fourth
assignments of error assert that the old freight rates between Bauang
and the mines on fuel oil were not too high and that therefore the
commission erred in ordering into effect the rates that it thought were
fair, just, and reasonable.</p>
  <p> The main question in the case
was the cost of hauling fuel oil in tank trucks from Bauang to the
mines, and the commission was not limited to a choice of putting into
effect either the old rates or the proposed new rates. On the evidence
as a whole, the commission was convinced that the old rates were too
high and the proposed new rates were too low, and it was not necessary,
nor would it serve any useful purpose, having arrived at that
conclusion, to start another proceeding to enable it to put into effect
what the evidence had already convinced it was fair and just.</p>
  <p>
There can be no dispute that there is evidence of record from which
reasoning men could arrive at the conclusion that the rates adopted by
the Public Service Commission are fair. The evidence is insufficient to
convince us that the rates are not remunerative.</p>
  <p>    The fifth assignment of error reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The
commission erred in not holding that the practice of the Manila
Railroad Company and the Benguet Automobile Line in reducing rates by
adopting so-called thru or joint rates, without making any
corresponding reduction in the railroad rate between Manila and Bauang,
constitutes unfair, inequitable and illegal competition with the
appellant herein and other operators in the Benguet district."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
This matter was not touched upon in the decision of the Public Service
Commission. It did, however, deny the application for the joint rate in
question. It knew that the question was going to arise in other
matters, and its discretion in declining to reject the proposed rates
on one ground when it had already rejected them on another, can hardly
be made the basis of a valid assignment of error.</p>
  <p>
Notwithstanding that the Public Service Commission held that the
proposed rates of the Manila Railroad Company were not proper, it
directed that they remain in force pending this appeal. Under the
Public Service Act, the Public Service Commission is given full
discretion in such matters, and its action thereon is not subject to
review unless its action is so arbitrary as to constitute abuse of
discretion. Under the circumstances of this case and both parties
objecting to the rates that the commission set as fair, the commission
was not without reason for its action.</p>
  <p>    The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant. So ordered.</p>
    <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Imperial</em>, and <em>Diaz, JJ</em>., concur.
