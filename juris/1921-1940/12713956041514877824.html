				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for the recovery of land, the delivery of 
fruits received and for damages.
<p align="justify">After trial the Honorable Fermin Mariano, judge, in order to 
better investigate the facts and to decide the case rightly, reopened the case 
and received the testimony of Abraham de Peralta, a man of culture and 
disinterested, and, in the opinion of the court—and on this point we find 
nothing to contradict the trial judge—and then rendered judgment declaring and 
ordering the following:&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">"The court declares the plaintiffs and defendants, surnamed 
Nicolas, <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span> coowners of the parcel of land in San Julian Grande or 
Culao of the municipality of Dingras, Ilocos Norte, with boundaries set forth in 
the complaint, and described on the plan Exhibit 1 of the defendants (page 83 of 
the second file in civil case No. 2348 of this court); that the plaintiffs as 
coparticipants are entitled to the portion of the same parcel of land; that each 
and every one of the defendants except those eliminated and Severino Ramos, is 
obliged to make restitution to the plaintiffs to the prejudice of the right of 
those surnamed Nicolas, defendants, (who were sued) as coowners of the same 
parcel, <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span>; and they must likewise indemnify the plaintiffs and 
deliver to them one-half of the 'uyones and baares of palay' herein mentioned, 
produced by their respective lots during nine years from 1918 to 1926, deducting 
those delivered to the ex-receiver Ignacio Flores, from the harvest of the year 
1925-1926; that the defendants surnamed Nicolas who consider themselves coowners 
with the plaintiff shall deliver also to the latter one-third of the aforesaid 
'uyones of palay' reaped from the five parcels of land during the same time, 
that is, 1918 to 1926, without prejudice to the determination of their part 
after a formal partition of this larger parcel of land in 
dispute.<br><br>"Should the defendant be unable to deliver to plaintiffs 
one-half of the 'uyones of palay and baares' produced by the lots which each one 
possesses and has possessed, retains or has retained within the parcel in 
question during the said years, according to the statement herein made, they 
shall pay them in money in accordance with the aforesaid evaluation herein, with 
the costs against the defendants. </p> <p style="text-align: left;">"It is so ordered."</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">The defendants appealed, making the following assignments of 
error as committed by the trial court, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. In declaring the plaintiffs to be owners and possessors <span style="font-style: italic;">pro 
indiviso</span> of the parcel of land described in the plaintiffs' complaint, such 
declaration not being justified by the evidence, and the exhibits of the 
plaintiffs, constituting the best proof that such community of interests does 
not and did not exist. </p>
<p align="justify">"2. In including the lots occupied by the defendants from time 
immemorial and inherited from their forebears, and the lot which the plaintiffs 
received from Abraham de Peralta and Dorotea Bonoan, which only measured 20 
hectares, thus adjudicating to them a larger lot, that is, some 35 hectares, by 
declaring the plaintiffs possessors of said lots in common. </p>
<p align="justify">"3. In failing to dismiss the complaint for the defect of 
joinder of actions, it having been duly proven by the plaintiffs' evidence that 
there is no community. </p>
<p align="justify">"4. In failing to consider the oral and documentary evidence of 
the defendants individually, and in giving the plaintiffs' oral evidence more 
weight, the latter being contradictory, improbable, against common sense and 
fabricated. </p>
<p align="justify">"5. In giving or granting a greater area of land to the 
plaintiffs than they asked for and alleged themselves to be the owners of in 
civil case No. 741, and greater than the Supreme Court adjudicated to them, to 
the prejudice of the defendants. </p>
<p align="justify">"6. In basing its judgment on the testimony of Abraham de 
Peralta, which was favorable to the interests of the defendants rather than 
those of the plaintiffs. </p>
<p align="justify">"7. In holding that the plaintiffs have been in possession of 
said land from time immemorial, as they alleged, without any interruption, 
having at the same time believed Abraham de Peralta's testimony to the effect 
that he had been exclusively in possession thereof for ten years and more. </p>
<p align="justify">"8. In holding that Paulo Formantes and his companions, being 
prominent persons, the first being a well-known merchant and the others land 
owners, went to usurp the plaintiffs' lands accompanied by some municipal 
policemen, and in not declaring that it was the plaintiffs who were to usurp the 
parcels of land occupied and possessed by them as owners, but that they failed 
on account of the intervention of the authorities, and of the justice of the 
peace court of Dingras. </p>
<p align="justify">"9. In not holding that the plaintiffs' complaint is merely a 
scheme to deprive defendants of their property. </p>
<p align="justify">"10. In basing its adverse judgment on that of the Supreme 
Court in favor of the same and against other persons, the herein 
defendants-appellants not having been parties to, nor even being aware of, said 
case. </p>
<p align="justify">"11. In basing its judgment on the testimony of the plaintiffs 
and of Dorotea Bonoan and Abraham de Peralta, who were the former defendants in 
that case, and who are now parties herein against the defendants-appellants, all 
of them now having a common interest. </p>
<p align="justify">"12. In not holding that the plaintiffs' right of action, if it 
ever existed, has prescribed. </p>
<p align="justify">"13. In not holding that the plaintiffs are estopped from 
claiming a greater portion than what they formerly claimed. </p>
<p align="justify">"14. In holding that; the plaintiffs have possessed as owners 
the parcels of land belonging to the defendants, according to their evidence and 
documents. </p>
<p align="justify">"15. In not holding that the documents which the plaintiffs 
have and did not exhibit at the hearing, and which they had exhibited before in 
case No. 741 against Abraham de Peralta et al., would be prejudicial to them, as 
in fact they are, because the defendants, and especially Paulo Formantes, are 
mentioned therein as adjacent owners. </p>
<p align="justify">"16. In not considering as evident proof of the ownership of 
the defendants of their respective lots, the existence for many years of houses 
belonging to their tenants and to themselves thereon, such houses being already 
very old. </p>
<p align="justify">"17. In granting the plaintiffs unreasonable and exorbitant 
damages. </p>
<p align="justify">"18. In not absolving the defendants-appellants from the 
complaint, there being a greater preponderance of the evidence in their favor. 
</p>
<p align="justify">"19. In not finding that the defendants-appellants are the 
exclusive owners of the lots which they alleged and proved to belong to them by 
documentary and oral evidence, respectively." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The evidence sufficiently shows that the possession of the 
plaintiffs has been as coowners <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span> of the land in question. On the 
other hand, the acquisition of the same by inheritance by the defendants, and 
their possession from time immemorial have not been proven. Consequently, the 
first and second assignments of error have not been committed, neither the 
third, which is a consequence of the first. <br><br>The fourth refers to the 
consideration which the trial court gave the evidence. We see no reason to doubt 
the correctness of such consideration. The fourth assignment of error lacks 
merit. </p>
<p align="justify">The difference in area between the land described in the 
complaint herein and that which was the subject matter of the former civil case 
No. 741, does not necessarily mean that there was a real increase of land. In 
view of the evidence in the case, it may be presumed to be due to an error in 
calculation. The adjoining owners of the land in this case and in the former one 
are practically the same. The fifth assignment of error has no ground.</p>
<p align="justify">The sixth, seventh and eleventh assignments of error also deal 
with the appreciation of the evidence. As in the case of the fourth assignment 
of error, we cannot see any worthy reason for doubting the correctness of the 
trial court's action in considering the probatory value and force of the 
testimony of Abraham de Peralta and Dorotea Bonoan. </p>
<p align="justify">The weight of the evidence is not in favor of the eight and 
ninth assignments of error.</p>
<p align="justify">Passing to the tenth, it is to be noted that the conclusions 
reached in the judgment appealed from are not based solely on the judgment 
rendered in the formef case. In addition the lower court considered the 
testimony offered by the parties and its preponderance as evidence. </p>
<p align="justify">The prescription alleged in the twelfth assignment of error has 
not been sufficiently established and cannot therefore be invoked. </p>
<p align="justify">Inasmuch as the fifth assignment of error has no merit in it, 
the thirteenth must likewise fail, being intimately connected therewith. The 
same thing holds good for the fourteenth, which is intimately connected with the 
aforementioned first and third errors already considered.</p>
<p align="justify">There is not sufficient reason to consider the presumption of 
unfavorable evidence against the plaintiffs simply because they did not present 
certain documents as evidence. It does not appear that they were necessary 
evidence. (Sec. 334, par. 5, Code of Civil Procedure; Modesto vs. Leyva, 6 
Phil., 186.) The fifteenth assignment of error has not been proven. </p>
<p align="justify">The next two, the sixteenth and seventeenth, turn on the 
consideration of the evidence. In view of the diligence shown by the trial 
court, in the study and consideration of the present case, as it appears from 
the record, the oftrepeated rule of this court of respecting the findings of 
fact made by the trial court that saw and heard the witnesses testify, is here 
especially applicable. </p>
<p align="justify">The last two assignments of error are a sequel of the preceding 
ones. </p>
<p align="justify">There being no reason to reverse or modify the judgment 
appealed from the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants. So 
ordered. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur.
