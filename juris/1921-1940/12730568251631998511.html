				<H3>GUILLERMO LUALHATI, PETITIONER, VS. MARIANO A. ALBERT, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The issue in these certiorari proceedings is whether it clearly appears from 
the record that Honorable Mariano A. Albert, as Judge of First Instance of 
Manila, acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in punishing Attorney 
Guillermo Lualhati for contempt of court by imposing a fine of P100 on the 
attorney.
<p>In the case of the People of the Philippine Islands vs. Remedios Avelino de 
Linao, the accused was, after trial, convicted of the crime of frustrated 
parricide by Judge Mariano A. Albert. The accused appealed to the Supreme Court, 
which affirmed the decision of the lower court, G. R. No. 33909.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Before the judgment of the Supreme Court had 
become final, the court granted a motion for a new trial, and remanded the 
record to the court below for the accomplishment of this purpose.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Subsequently the appellate court denied a 
motion filed on behalf of the accused in which it was prayed that the court 
grant the petition of counsel to order the holding of the new trial allowed the 
defendant before any judge other than the trial judge. When the record in the 
case was received in the office of the clerk of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, the case was, following the usual practice, assigned to Judge Albert" 
for hearing. Thereupon, counsel for the accused asked the judge to refrain from 
taking cognizance of the case at the new trial, which the judge refused to do. 
Still not satisfied, a few days before the dates fixed for the hearing, counsel 
filed what was called an "urgent motion" which, according to the trial judge, 
was caused to be published in the local papers even before the respondent judge 
had had a chance to pass upon the same. This motion reads as follows: </p>
<p align="center">"URGENT MOTION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Comes now undersigned counsel for the accused and to this Honorable Court 
respectfully states:</p>
<p>"1. Considering that the administration of justice will not, by any means, be 
affected by Honorable Mariano Albert, Judge of the Court of First Instance of 
the City of Manila, not taking cognizance of this case, it seems proper, in our 
judgment, that, in order to avoid any misinterpretation of the action taken by 
said judge during the trial of this case, and in order to grant the accused a 
completely impartial trial to which her constitutional right entitles her, this 
case be taken cognizance of and decided by any other judge of the City of 
Manila.</p>
<p>"2. That herein counsel sincerely believes that, for the proper 
administration of justice and for the purpose of protecting the accused against 
the prejudice which has been necessarily formed by the judge who had presided at 
the original trial of this case and who had already rendered a judgment 
convicting the herein accused, and considering that the conclusions of said 
judge are strongly against the accused in finding her guilty of the crime 
charged, and that said judge has already formed in his mind a firm and 
irrevocable conviction of the guilt of the accused as shown by his findings 
appearing in the judgment condemning the accused, it is now impossible for her 
to obtain a completely impartial trial from said judge, Honorable Mariano 
Albert, wherefore, it becomes absolutely necessary that, to do justice to the 
accused and to avoid any misinterpretation of the action of Honorable Mariano 
Albert in this case, and because justice and equity so demand, this case be 
transferred to another branch presided over by another judge who did not have 
the slightest intervention in this case and, therefore, cannot have any 
prejudice against the herein accused.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that Honorable Mariano Albert transfer 
this case to any judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila in justice to 
the accused.</p>
<p>"Manila, March 23, 1932.</p></blockquote>
<p align="right">"(Sgd.) LAUREL, DEL ROSARIO &amp; LUALHATI<br><em>"Attorneys for 
the Accused,</em><br>"601-607 Cu Unjieng Building<br>"Escolta, Manila."</p>
<p align="justify">Without loss of time, the trial judge summarily promulgated an 
order in which he found counsel in contempt of court and imposed a fine of P100 
to be paid within twenty-four hours from receipt of the order, with an 
admonition that if not paid, five days imprisonment would result. As the trial 
judge construed the motion, "it is, therefore, evident that it is a part of the 
plan of the defense to avoid the new trial being presided over by the herein 
judge, and its principal object is to impress upon the mind of the public in 
general that the undersigned is not capable of administering justice to the 
accused pursuant to the facts and the law," On counsel being informed of the 
order of the court, a motion of reconsideration was presented by Attorney 
Guillermo Lualhati who assumed sole responsibility for the preparation of the 
motion found to be contemptuous, and who stated that he did not have the 
slightest intention of impeaching the honesty and rectitude of Judge Albert, and 
accordingly expressed a willingness to withdraw the motion from the record. The 
trial judge considered the explanation offered by Attorney Lualhati not 
satisfactory, but modified the previous order so as to have it directed 
exclusively against Lualhati. At this point, a petition for certiorari was 
presented in this court.</p>
<p>It would appear needless to repeat that the question before the court when 
the extraordinary remedy of certiorari is invoked relates exclusively to 
determining if the lower court exceeded its jurisdiction. It would likewise 
appear obvious that a discretionary power is lodged in trial courts, and that 
with the exercise of that discretion the appellate court should not, and 
properly can not, interfere unless there is a clear showing of an abuse of 
discretion. It would be fatal to orderly procedure if the Supreme Court should 
attempt to substitute its judgment for the judgment of trial judges. Further, it 
should be emphasized that section 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides the 
grounds for the disqualification of a judge, and that none of the reasons given 
in the motion constituted a ground for disqualification. Consequently, as this 
court has heretofore stated, considering the fact that the trial judge was not 
legally disqualified from trying the case, it was his duty to go forward with 
the trial. (Joaquin <em>vs</em>. Barretto [1913], 25 Phil., 281; Perfecto 
<em>vs.</em> Contreras [1914], 28 Phil., 538.) But even this does not state the 
case completely for the respondent judge, for it should be recalled that a 
motion had previously been presented to the Supreme Court and denied, and 
thereafter had been presented to the trial judge and denied, the "urgent motion" 
constituting the third effort to secure the disqualification of the trial 
judge.</p>
<p>On the other side of the case it is of course evident that the power to 
punish for contempt of court should be exercised on the preservative and not on 
the vindictive principle. Also, the disclaimer in an effort to purge the 
contempt was wise, although simply tending to excuse and not to justify the act. 
We have no doubt that on more mature reflection, the lawyers representing the 
accused realized the impropriety of the action taken by a member of the firm, 
and would have been glad to find a means to undo what had been done.</p>
<p>Up to this point, little or no attention has been paid to the authorities. In 
truth, not one of them is found to be exactly controlling. The case of Perfecto 
<em>vs.</em> Contreras, <em>supra,</em> was one for libel in which the trial 
judge considered it his duty to proceed with the trial in the civil case 
notwithstanding he had been the presiding judge in the criminal case, and in 
which the Supreme Court sustained him for so doing. The case of United States 
<em>vs</em>. Guanzon ([1907], 9 Phil., 371), was a prosecution for contempt 
under the provisions of the Penal Code which the Supreme Court found, on the 
facts, did not constitute the offense of contempt. The recent case of Carag 
<em>vs.</em> Warden of the Jail of Cagayan, and Sevilla ([1929], 53 Phil., 85), 
in which the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> was denied, was based on the 
proposition that if the court in committing a person for contempt acted within 
its jurisdiction, its action is final and the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> 
will not lie. The remark was made that "The court to whom the contempt was 
offered and in whose presence it arose is the best judge of its nature." So much 
for the Philippine cases.</p>
<p>Harrison <em>vs.</em> State ([1880], 35 Ark., 458), concerned a motion for a 
new trial on the ground that the judge before whom the case was tried was "so 
prejudiced against the defendant that he did not give him a fair and impartial 
trial", which the court found to constitute contempt, the Supreme Court of 
Arkansas refusing to interfere by writ of certiorari. Toledo Newspaper Co. 
<em>vs.</em> United States ([1918], 247 U. S., 402), while likewise different on 
the facts, is yet indicative of the antagonistic trends of thought in the United 
States Supreme Court, since the majority headed by Chief Justice White upheld 
the District Judge who had found the defendants guilty of summary contempt and 
who had imposed a fine upon them because the publication tended to. evoke public 
suspicion of the judge's integrity and fairness and bring him into public odium, 
while the contrary viewpoint was presented as only Justice Holmes could present 
it in a1 dissenting opinion in which it was said that "a judge of the United 
States is expected to be a man of ordinary firmness of character, and I find it 
impossible to believe that such a judge could have found in anything that was 
printed even a tendency to prevent his performing his sworn duty." We have to 
follow the majority rule. </p>
<p>The case most nearly on all fours with the one before us is the Tweed 
Contempt Case. In this case, the notorious Boss Tweed came to trial before Judge 
Davis, but the jury was unable to agree and was discharged. When the case came 
on for retrial, Judge Davis was again presiding over the court. So distasteful 
was Judge Davis to Tweed's counsel that they presented to him a paper setting 
forth the reasons why he should not proceed at the trial and, among other 
things, stated "The said Justice has formed, and upon a previous trial 
expressed, a most unqualified and decided opinion, unfavourable to the 
defendant, upon the facts of the case." At the conclusion of the trial, Judge 
Davis took action with reference to the paper signed by some of the most eminent 
lawyers in the State, and in a decision which has become a classic, summarily 
found them in contempt and imposed fines on the senior counsel, while letting 
the younger counsel off with words of advice (Costigan's Cases on Legal Ethics, 
pp. 176-179).</p>
<p>We quite agree with counsel for the petitioner that attorneys should ever be 
fearless in the discharge of their duties even in the face of a hostile court. 
To the client, as stated by the canons of legal ethics, the attorney owes entire 
devotion. This court has heretofore given evidence on more than one occasion, of 
its desire to safeguard the interests of attorneys. At the same time, the duty 
of the attorney to the courts is no less sacred, and can only be maintained by 
rendering no service involving any disrespect to the judicial office which he is 
bound to uphold. In this instance, the submission of a motion once previously 
denied by the appellate court which had granted the motion for a new trial, and 
once previously denied by the trial judge, asking for the disqualification of 
the judge on a ground not provided by law, which motion the judge construed as 
misbehaviour intended to make the public believe that he was incapable of 
administering justice to the accused, left the judge no other recourse, if he 
was to maintain his self respect as a judge, than to take action by way of 
finding the attorney who presented the motion in contempt of court. As a 
consequence, we are driven to the conclusion that the trial judge did not act 
without or in excess of jurisdiction and did not abuse his discretion when he 
found the petitioner in contempt of court.</p>

<p align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING:</em></p>
<p><strong>BUTTE, J., </strong></p>
<p>It is with considerable regret that I feel obliged to dissent from the 
decision of my brethren in this case and all the mo»e so because of the high 
regard which I entertain for the learned judge who is the respondent.</p>
<p>I shall state my conclusions as succinctly as possible. </p>
<p>The law confers upon the courts the power to punish summarily for direct 
(criminal) contempts; but this power has its limitations, otherwise, it would 
become a means of judicial tyranny. It is conditioned upon the exercise of a 
sound discretion. Each case must be judged in the light of its special facts and 
circumstances.</p>
<p>In the present instance, I think there was an abuse of discretion which ought 
not to be ignored on the theory that the court had the general power to punish 
for contempt.</p>
<p>The majority opinion in this case finds nothing disrespectful on the face of 
the petitioner's "urgent motion". The motion asked the judge below to transfer 
the case in question, to another judge of the same court on the sole ground that 
"said judge has already formed in his mind a firm and irrevocable conviction of 
the guilt of the accused as shown by his findings appearing in the judgment 
condemning the accused." The motion is couched in courteous language. Neither 
the judge below nor this court pointed out any expressions in said motion that 
reflect on the personal honesty or rectitude of the judge. If the motion stood 
alone there is no reason to believe that the judge below would have held the 
petitioner in contempt.</p>
<p>What is there in the surrounding circumstances that makes the motion 
contemptuous?</p>
<p>It is intimated in the majority opinion that it is contemptuous because it is 
the third effort to secure the disqualification of the trial judge. Perhaps it 
is sufficient answer to this point to say that the motion was not too late and 
could have been granted by the trial judge.</p>
<p>Another circumstance mentioned is that the reason given in the motion, 
namely, that the same judge had previously convicted the defendant in the same 
case, is not a legal ground for disqualification. An examination of the motion 
discloses that counsel did not invoke section 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
He asked that the case be transferred to some other judge of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, which he might have done in accordance with what is the 
common practice among the judges of that court in cases involving considerations 
of delicacy for the trial judge. (See section 169, Administrative Code.) In 
other words, it is not necessary to assume that counsel asked, as a matter of 
right under the provisions of the Civil Code, that the trial judge should 
disqualify himself, but only that he should transfer the case to another judge 
in accordance with common practice. The trial judge might have arranged the 
transfer of the case to some other judge of the same court, irrespective of the 
decision of this court on the first certiorari proceeding denying the petition 
of counsel for this court to require him to do so. (Cf. Concepcion <em>vs.</em> 
De Joya, G. R. No. 19697.) It is true the "urgent motion" was the second time 
counsel presented the matter to the trial judge, but surely we are not prepared 
to hold that it is evidence of contempt to try to get a judge to change his 
mind.</p>
<p>Another circumstance mentioned by the trial judge in his answer to this 
certiorari is that after the motion was filed the petitioner caused the motion 
to be given to the press before the judge had an opportunity to pass on it. As 
to this, we have no evidence, but assuming it true, I see nothing contemptuous 
in that act. The motion became a public document the moment it was filed. If 
there was nothing objectionable per se in the motion the widest possible 
publicity could not alter its character.</p>
<p>The respondent judge says of the motion that "it is evident that * * * its 
principal object is to impress upon the mind of the public in general that the 
undersigned is not capable of administering justice to the accused pursuant to 
the facts and law." It is not clear whether that is the mere conclusion of the 
judge or intended as a statement of fact. Nothing appears on the face of the 
motion to indicate that its principal object was anything else than to improve 
the chances of the petitioner's client. Certainly, the mere filing of such a 
motion hardly warrants the statement that its principal object is to create 
prejudice against the judge in the mind of the public. Nor is it clear how such 
prejudice, if created, would have influenced the judge in favor of the accused 
in the slightest degree.</p>
<p>The petitioner, in his motion for reconsideration, disclaimed that he had any 
intention to reflect on the honesty and rectitude of the trial judge in his 
motion for the transfer of the case to another judge. While I think this 
disclaimer was unnecessary, it should have been taken as proof of the 
petitioner's sincerity and as evidence that said motion was what it purported to 
be and nothing more.</p>
<p>It is not to be overlooked that in this case we are dealing with a criminal 
contempt and the general rule is applicable that the defendant is presumed to be 
innocent and he must be proved to be guilty beyond reasonable doubt. (Gompers 
<em>vs.</em> Buck's Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U. S., 418, 444.)</p>
<p>Like my brethren, I have not been able to find any decision of authority that 
aids us very much in determining whether the petitioner has committed a 
contempt.</p>
<p>Joaquin <em>vs</em>. Barretto ([1913], 25 Phil., 281), doesn't touch the 
subject of contempts.</p>
<p>In the case of Perfecto <em>vs.</em> Contreras ([1914], 28 Phil., 538), a 
civil action for damages for libel was brought before the same judge who found 
the defendants guilty of criminal libel on the same facts. The defendants filed 
a motion asking the judge to disqualify himself on the ground that by reason of 
the former conviction, he "had already formed an opinion adverse to the 
defendants". So far from holding the mover in contempt, the trial judge took the 
motion in good part and made repeated efforts to secure some other judge to try 
the case. Failing in this, he considered it his duty to try the case because he 
could not disqualify himself under section 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
There is no question of contempt in this case.</p>
<p>Harrison <em>vs.</em> State (35 Ark., 458) in which the defendant was fined 
for contempt for stating in a motion for new trial that the judge was so 
prejudiced against the defendant that he <em>did not give him</em> a fair and 
impartial trial, is clearly not in point for two reasons: First, because it 
deals with a motion for new trial and not a motion for disqualification; and 
second, the contemptuous language is a statement of fact after the trial and not 
one of belief of<br>the pleader before trial, based upon reasonable and not 
captious grounds.</p>
<p>The case of Carag <em>vs.</em> Warden of the Jail of Cagayan, and Sevilla (53 
Phil., 85) was an original action in this court for a writ of habeas corpus. The 
petitioner had been sentenced to be confined in the provincial jail for ten days 
for misconduct in the presence of the court, that is to say, for a direct 
(criminal) contempt. This court dismissed the petition saying "If the court in 
committing a person for contempt acted within its jurisdiction, its action is 
final and the writ of habeas corpus will not lie." It is not to be presumed that 
when this court said the "action is final" it meant that a sentence for contempt 
could not be reviewed by any kind of a proceeding; but only that it could not be 
reviewed on a petition for habeas corpus. It is familiar law that a case cannot 
be retried on its merits in a habeas corpus proceeding, but the case before us 
is not a petition for writ of habeas corpus but a petition for writ of 
certiorari. It cannot be said that in the latter proceeding all that it is 
necessary to show to make the action of the court below final is that it has 
jurisdiction. Therefore, the case of Carag against the Warden of the Provincial 
Jail cannot be construed to disbar the petitioner of the only means of review 
available to him.</p>
<p>Referring to the. so-called Tweed Contempt Case, an examination of Costigan's 
Cases on Legal Ethics, page 176, discloses that the citation is a quotation from 
a book by Theron G. Strong entitled "Landmarks of a Lawyer's Lifetime". 
Obviously, this book is not a legal authority in this court, nor can I find, 
after diligent search, that there is any such case in the reports. The decision 
quoted by Strong, as quoted by Costigan, is one of a State court of first 
instance. Decisions of such courts do not possess a semblance of authority in 
this court and it would be a work of supererogation to point out that the motion 
in the so called Tweed Case was offensive on its face, which is not true of the 
motion in the instant case.</p>
<p>The instant case may fairly be pointed out as one of first impression in 
these Islands, hence its importance. It seems to me that the following 
propositions are sound: First, that the judge of the Court of First Instance had 
the general authority to hear and determine whether or not this petitioner was 
guilty of contempt of court and to assess against him the fine here in question; 
second, that said authority is conditioned by the requirement that the court 
exercise a sound and reasonable discretion both in the appreciation of the facts 
and the assessment of the penalty; third, that this court may, on certiorari, 
review the merits of such cases and determine whether or not the court below 
overstepped the bounds of a sound and reasonable discretion; or, in other words, 
whether the alleged contemptuous conduct constitutes a contempt in law.</p>
<p>Finding no real substantial grounds for believing that the petitioner did, or 
intended to, commit an act of criminal contempt, I am constrained to register my 
dissent in this case.</p>
