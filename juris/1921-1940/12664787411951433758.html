				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In
a civil case against defendant a writ of execution was issued to
satisfy a deficiency judgment. By virtue thereof a parcel of land
belonging to "him was sold at public auction to the plaintiff
Philippine National Bank which was the highest bidder. Said land had
been acquired by defendant under a homestead title issued on October
26, 1923 and recorded in the registry of property of the Province of
Tarlac, where the land lies, on November 11, of the same year. The
attachment was made on February 26, 1936 and the sale at public auction
took place on May 21, following. The period of five years within which
the Public Land Act prohibits the alienation of a homestead not yet
having expired, said defendant alleged that the attachment of the land
was void inasmuch as he had not encumbered the same through any
voluntary act on his part and asked the court to set the attachment
aside and order the register of deeds to cancel the annotation, if any
had been made, of said encumbrance. Notwithstanding the opposition of
the plaintiff Philippine National Bank, the Court of First Instance of
Tarlac, by order of October 15, 1937, declared null and void the
attachment and sale at public auction of the land aforesaid. Upon
denial of its motion for reconsideration of this order, plaintiff duly
excepted.
  <p> Appellant, in its brief, contends that the court
erred in not declaring itself without jurisdiction to resolve
defendant's motion which led to the issuance of the order appealed from
and that it likewise erred in not finding that plaintiff and appellant'
is one of those excepted from the operation of the legal prohibition
against the alienation and encumbrance of lands forming part of a
homestead grant.</p>
  <p> The first assignment of error is based on
the theory that when defendant's motion praying for the annulment of
the attachment and sale at public auction of the land in question was
filed on August 23, 1937, one year, five months and twenty-six days had
already elapsed and that the remedy left to the defendant under the law
was an action to recover the land and not a mere motion as has been
attempted to be done in the instant case, (Sections 113 and 513 of the
Code of Civil Procedure; Banco Español-Filipino <i>vs.</i> Palanca, 37 Phil., 921.)</p>
  <p>
Although we are of the opinion that there is merit in appellant's
contention, nevertheless, in order to avoid multiplicity of suits and
the necessity on the part of the defendant and appellee of commencing
another action having the same object as that sought by him in his
motion of August 23, 1937, we shall pass over the question raised by
appellant relative to the lack of jurisdiction of the court if we can
decide on its merits in this appeal the contention of the appellee in
his said motion as we believe we can.</p>
  <p> As has been stated,
defendant and appellee's motion was based on the fact that the law
prohibits the sale, encumbrance and alienation of a public land granted
a homestead applicant within the period of five years following the
issuance of the title to the homestead. Section 23 of Act No. 3517,
which was approved on January 30, 1929 and took effect on February 4,
1929, has, however, amended section 116 of Act No. 2874, which now
reads as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Sec. 116. Except in
favor of the Government or any of its branches, units, or institutions,
or legally constituted banking corporations, lands acquired under the
free patent or homestead provisions shall not be subject to encumbrance
or alienation from the date of the approval of the application and for
a term of five years from and after the date of issuance of the patent
or grant, nor shall they become liable to the satisfaction of any debt
contracted prior to the expiration of said period; but the improvements
or crops on the land may be mortgaged or pledged to qualified persons,
associations, or corporations."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> From the
section above-quoted, it may be seen that alienations or encumbrances
made in favor of the Government or of any of its branches or legally
constituted banking corporations are excepted from the prohibition that
the land granted under a homestead title cannot be encumbered or
alienated within the period of five years from the date of the issuance
of the title. The Philippine National Bank is a Government-controlled
banking corporation, the due incorporation of which has not been
questioned either by defendant and appellee or by any one else. The
execution of the judgment in favor of the Philippine National Bank
against appellee on the latter's homestead was, therefore, valid and
legal.</p>
  <p> The contention of the appellee that the encumbrance
or attachment of the land granted him under a homestead title had not
been contracted through any voluntary act of his, does not in the least
alter the essence of the question.</p>
  <p> Wherefore, the order
appealed from is reversed and the attachment and sale at public auction
of the land referred to in this decision are hereby declared valid and
legal. Costs shall be assessed against appellee. So ordered.</p>
