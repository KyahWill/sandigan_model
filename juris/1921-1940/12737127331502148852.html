				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question to be here decided is whether or not pictures portraying the 
inhabitants of the country in native dress and as they appear and can be seen in 
the regions in which they live, are obscene or indecent. Surprising as it may 
seem, the question is one of first impression not alone in the Philippine 
Islands, but in the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere. This will 
explain why a case which otherwise would be heard and voted in Division has been 
submitted to the court <i>in banc</i> for decision.
<p>On November 24, 1922, detective Juan Tolentino raided the premises known as 
Camera Supply Co. at 110 Escolta, Manila. He found and confiscated the 
post-cards which subsequently were used as evidence against J. J. Kottinger, the 
manager of the company.</p>
<p>Out of these facts arose the criminal prosecution of J. J. Kottinger in the 
Court of First Instance of Manila. The information filed in court charged him 
with having kept for sale in the store of the Camera Supply Co., obscene and 
indecent pictures, in violation of section 12 of Act No. 277. To this 
information, the defendant interposed a demurrer based upon the ground that the 
facts alleged therein did not constitute an offense and were not contrary to 
law; but the trial court overruled the demurrer and the defendant duly excepted 
thereto. Following the presentation of evidence by the Government and the 
defense, judgment was rendered finding the defendant guilty of the offense 
charged and sentencing him to pay a fine of P50 with subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency, and the costs.</p>
<p>The five errors assigned by defendant-appellant in this court divide 
themselves into two general issues. The first point sustained by counsel for the 
appellant is in nature a technical objection, growing out of the defendant's 
demurrer. The second point, in reality the decisive issue, is as suggested in 
the beginning of the decision. We will take up the assignments of errors as thus 
classified in order.</p>
<p>Act No. 277 is the Philippine Libel Law. But included therein is a section, 
No. 12, making obscene or indecent publications misdemeanors. Said section 12 
which, it is contended by the Government, has here been violated, and which, 
appellant argues, does not apply to the information and the facts, reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any person who writes, composes, stereotypes, prints, publishes, sells, or 
keeps for sale, distributes, or exhibits any obscene or indecent writing, paper, 
book, or other matter, or who designs, copies, draws, engraves, paints, or 
otherwise prepares any obscene picture or print, or who moulds, cuts, casts, or 
otherwise makes any obscene or indecent figure, or who writes, composes, or 
prints any notice or advertisement of any such writing, paper, book, print, or 
figure shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of not exceeding 
one thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or 
both."</p></blockquote>
<p>Counsel has gone to the trouble to make a careful analysis of section 12 of 
the Libel Law which is intended to bear out his thesis, first, that section 12 
does not prohibit the taking, selling, and publishing of alleged obscene and 
indecent pictures and prints, and second, that the information in this case 
charges no offense prohibited by section 12. Recall, however, that the law 
provides punishment, among other things, for any person who keeps for sale or 
exhibits any obscene or indecent writing, paper, book, or other matter, and that 
the information charges the defendant, among other things, with having wilfully 
and feloniously kept for sale, distribution, or exhibition, obscene and indecent 
pictures.</p>
<p>The phrase in the law "or other matter," was apparently added as a sort of 
"catch-all." While limited to that which is of the same kind as its antecedent, 
it is intended to cover kindred subjects. The rule of <i>ejusdem generis</i> 
invoked by counsel is by no means a rule of universal application and should be 
made to carry out, not to defeat, the legislative intent. Even if the phrase "or 
other matter" be construed to mean "or other matter of like kind," pictures and 
post-cards are not so far unrelated to writings, papers, and books, as not to be 
covered by the general words (Commonwealth <i>vs</i>. Dejardin [1878], 126 
Mass., 46; 30 Am. Rep., 652; Brown <i>vs</i>. Corbin [1889], 40 Minn., 508).</p>
<p>The line of argumentation is more refined than practical. Once conceded that 
section 12 of Act No. 277 does not cover the present case, there yet remain for 
application article 571, No. 2, of the Penal Code, and section 730 of the 
Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila. The section of the Revised Ordinances 
cited is most specific when it provides in part that no person shall "exhibit, 
circulate, distribute, sell, offer or expose for sale, or give or deliver to 
another, or cause the same to be done, any lewd, indecent, or obscene book, 
<i>picture</i>, pamphlet, card, print, paper, writing, mould, cast, figure, or 
any other thing."</p>
<p>While admittedly the information is lacking in precision and while the 
content of section 12 of the Libel Law is not as inclusive as it might be, we 
yet conclude that the information is not fatally defective, and that said 
section 12 covers the alleged facts.</p>
<p>We come now to decide the main issue. We repeat that our own researches have 
confirmed the statement of counsel that not one parallel case can be found. We 
must perforce reason from the general to the specific and from universal 
principle to actual fact. </p>
<p>The pictures which it is argued offend against the law on account of being 
obscene and indecent, disclose six different postures of non-Christian 
inhabitants of the Philippines. Exhibit A carries the legend "Philippines, 
Bontoc Woman." Exhibit A-1 is a picture of five young boys and carries the 
legend "Greetings from the Philippines." Exhibit A-2 has the legend "Ifugao 
Belle, Philippines. Greetings from the Philippines." Exhibit A-3 has the legend 
"Igorrot Girl, Rice Field Costume." Exhibit A-4 has the legend "Kalinga Girls, 
Philippines." Exhibit A-5 has the legend "Moros, Philippines."</p>
<p>The prosecution produced no evidence proving the post-cards obscene and 
indecent because it thought the post-cards themselves the best evidence of that 
fact. The fiscal admitted in open court "that those pictures represented the 
natives (non-Christians) in their native dress." The defendant, on the other 
hand, attempted to show that the pictures are true to life. Dr. H. Otley Beyer, 
Professor in the University of the Philippines, corroborated by other witnesses, 
testified from his studies in various parts of the Islands, such as the Mountain 
Province, Abra, Palawan, and Mindanao and Sulu, that none of the pictures 
represented poses which he had not observed on various occasions, and that the 
costumes worn by the people in the pictures are the true costumes regularly worn 
by them. Are such pictures obscene or indecent?</p>
<p>The word "obscene" and the term "obscenity" may be defined as meaning 
something offensive to chastity, decency, or delicacy. "Indecency" is an act 
against good behaviour and a just delicacy. The test ordinarily followed by the 
courts in determining whether a particular publication or other thing is obscene 
within the meaning of the statutes, is whether the tendency of the matter 
charged as obscene, is to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such 
immoral influences and into whose hands a publication or other article charged 
as being obscene may fall. Another test of obscenity is that which shocks the 
ordinary and common sense of men as an indecency. (29 Cyc., 1315; 8 R. C. L., 
312.)</p>
<p>The Philippine statute does not attempt to define obscene or indecent 
pictures, writings, papers, or books. But the words "obscene or indecent" are 
themselves descriptive. They are words in common use and every person of average 
intelligence understands their meaning. Indeed, beyond the evidence furnished by 
the pictures themselves, there is but little scope for proof bearing on the 
issue of obscenity or indecency. Whether a picture is obscene or indecent must 
depend upon the circumstances of the case. (People <i>vs</i>. Muller [1884], 96 
N. Y., 408; 48 Am. Rep., 635.)</p>
<p>Considerable light can be thrown on the subject by turning to the Federal 
Laws prohibiting the use of the mails for obscene matter and prohibiting the 
importation into the Philippine Islands of articles, etc., of obscene or 
indecent character. (U. S. Rev. Stat., art. 3893; 36 Stat. at L., 135; 7 Fed. 
Stat. Ann., 1194, sec. 3[<i>b</i>].)</p>
<p>"Obscene," as used in the Federal Statutes making it a criminal offense to 
place in the mails any obscene, lewd, or lascivious publication, according to 
the United States Supreme Court and lesser Federal courts, signifies that form 
of immorality which has relation to sexual impurity, and has the same meaning as 
is given at common law in prosecutions for obscene libel. (Swearingen <i>vs</i>. 
U. S. [1896], 161 U. S., 446; U. S. <i>vs</i>. Males [1892], 51 Fed., 41; 6 
Words and Phrases, 4888, 4889.)</p>
<p>The case of United States <i>vs</i>. Harmon ([1891], 45 Fed., 414), grew out 
of an indictment for depositing an obscene publication in a United States 
post-office in violation of the Postal Law. Judge Philips said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The statute does not undertake to define the meaning of the terms 'obscene,' 
etc., further than may be implied by the succeeding phrase, 'or other 
publication of an indecent character.' On the well-recognized canon of 
construction these words are presumed to have been employed by the law-maker in 
their ordinary acceptation and use. As they cannot be said to have acquired any 
technical significance as applied to some particular matter, calling, or 
profession, but are terms of popular use, the court might perhaps with propriety 
leave their import to the presumed intelligence of the jury. A standard 
dictionary says that 'obscene' mean 'offensive to chastity and decency; 
expressing or presenting to the mind or view something which delicacy, purity, 
and decency forbid to be exposed.' This mere dictionary definition may be 
extended or amplified by the courts in actual practice, preserving, however, its 
essential thought, and having always due regard to the popular and proper sense 
in which the legislature employed the term. Chief Justice Cockburn, in Rex 
<i>vs</i>. Hicklin (L. R. 3 Q. B., 360), said: 'The test of obscenity is this: 
Where the tendency of the matter charged as obscene is to deprave and corrupt 
those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a 
publication of this sort may fall;' and where 'it would suggest to the minds of 
the young of either sex, or even to persons of more advanced years, thoughts of 
the most impure and libidinous character.' So, also, it has been held that a 
book is obscene which is offensive to decency or chastity, which is immodest, 
which is indelicate, impure, causing lewd thoughts of an immoral tendency.' U. 
S. <i>vs</i>. Bennett, 16 Blatchf., 338. Judge Thayer, in U. S. <i>vs</i>. 
Clarke, 38 Fed. Rep., 732, observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'The word "obscene" ordinarily means something which is offensive to 
chastity; something that is foul or filthy, and for that reason is offensive to 
pure-minded persons. That is the meaning of the word in the concrete; but when 
used, as in the statute, to describe the character of a book, pamphlet, or 
paper, it means containing immodest and indecent matter, the reading whereof 
would have a tendency to deprave and corrupt the minds of those into whose hands 
the publication might fall whose minds are open to such immoral 
influences.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"Laws of this character are made for society in the aggregate, and not in 
particular. So, while there may be individuals and societies of men and women of 
peculiar notions or idiosyncrasies, whose moral sense would neither be depraved 
nor offended by the publication now under consideration, yet the exceptional 
sensibility, or want of sensibility, of such cannot be, allowed as a standard by 
which its obscenity or indecency is to be tested. Rather is the test, what is 
the judgment of the aggregate sense of the community reached by it? What is its 
probable, reasonable effect on the sense of decency, purity, and chastity of 
society, extending to the family, made up of men and women, young boys and 
girls,—the family, which is the common nursery of mankind, the foundation rock 
upon which the state reposes?</p>
<p>"* * * To the pure all things are pure, is too poetical for the actualities 
of practical life. There is in the popular conception and heart such a thing as 
modesty. It was born in the Garden of Eden. After Adam and Eve ate of the fruit 
of the tree of knowledge they passed from that condition of perfectibility which 
some people nowadays aspire to, and, their eyes being opened, they discerned 
that there was both good and evil; 'and they knew that they were naked; and they 
sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.' From that day to this 
civilized man has carried with him the sense of shame,—the feeling that there 
were some things on which the eye—the mind—should not look; and where men and 
women become so depraved by the use, or so insensate from perverted education, 
that they will not veil their eyes, nor hold their tongues, the government 
should perform the office for them in protection of the social compact and the 
body politic."</p></blockquote>
<p>As above intimated, the Federal statute prohibits the importation or shipment 
into the Philippine Islands of the following: "Articles, books, pamphlets, 
printed matter, manuscripts, typewritten matter, paintings, illustrations, 
figures or objects of obscene or indecent character or subversive of public 
order." There are, however, in the record, copies of reputable magazines which 
circulate freely thruout the United States and other countries, and which are 
admitted into the Philippines without question, containing illustrations 
identical in nature to those forming the basis of the prosecution at bar. 
Publications of the Philippine Government have also been offered in evidence 
such as Barton's "Ifugao Law," the "Philippine Journal of Science" for October, 
1906, and the Reports of the Philippine Commission for 1903, 1912, and 1913, in 
which are found illustrations either exactly the same or nearly akin to those 
which are now impugned.</p>
<p>It appears therefore that a national standard has been set up by the Congress 
of the United States. Tested by that standard, it would be extremely doubtful if 
the pictures here challenged would be held obscene or indecent by any state of 
Federal court. It would be particularly unwise to sanction a different type of 
censorship in the Philippines than in the United States, or for that matter in 
the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The pictures in question merely depict persons as they actually live, without 
attempted presentation of persons in unusual postures or dress. The aggregate 
judgment of the Philippine community, the moral sense of all the people in the 
Philippines, would not be shocked by photographs of this type. We are convinced 
that the post-card pictures in this case cannot be characterized as offensive to 
chastity, or foul, or filthy.</p>
<p>We readily understand the laudable motives which moved the Government to 
initiate this prosecution. We fully appreciate the sentiments of colleagues who 
take a different view of the case. We would be the last to offend the 
sensibilities of the Filipino people and to sanction anything which would hold 
them up to ridicule in the eyes of mankind. But we emphasize that we are not 
deciding a question in political theory or in social ethics. We are dealing with 
a legal question predicated on a legal fact, and on this question and fact, we 
reach the conclusion that there has not been proved a violation of section 12 of 
the Libel Law. When other cases predicated on other states of facts are brought 
to our attention, we will decide them as they arise.</p>
<p>We seem to recall the statement of counsel that the proprietor of the 
photographic concern whom he represents would on his own initiative place 
suitable and explicit inscriptions on the pictures so that no one may be misled 
as to them. Indeed, he might even go further and out of consideration for the 
natural sensibilities of his customers, withdraw from sale certain pictures 
which can be pointed out to him.</p>
<p>We hold that pictures portraying the inhabitants of the country in native 
dress and as they appear and can be seen in the regions in which they live, are 
not obscene or indecent within the meaning of the Libel Law. Disagreeing 
therefore with the appellant on his technical argument but agreeing with him on 
his main contention, it becomes our duty to order the dismissal of the 
information.</p>
<p>Judgment is reversed, the information is dismissed, and the 
defendant-appellant is acquitted with all costs <i>de oficio</i>. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><i>Johnson, Street, Avanceña, Villamor,</i> and <i>Johns, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</p>Mr. Chief Justice Manuel Araullo was present at the time this case 
was voted and then voted with Mr. Justice Romualdez. (Sgd.) E. FINLEY 
JOHNSON.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>ROMUALDEZ, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>ARAULLO, C. 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>I do not agree with the view taken by the majority as to the nature of the 
photographic pictures in question. While said pictures cannot, strictly, be 
termed <i>obscene</i>, they must, however, be regarded as <i>indecent</i>, for 
they are so.</p>
<p>Such pictures offend modesty and refinement, and for this reason, they are 
indecent. This is shown by common sense. No woman claiming to be decent would 
dare to stand before the public in Manila, where said pictures were exhibited, 
in the same fashion as these pictures are.</p>
<p>It is alleged that these pictures were taken from nature in non-Christian 
regions. We agree that in said regions they are not, perhaps, regarded as 
offensive to modesty, and, therefore, are accidentally not indecent there. But 
in the City of Manila where they were exhibited, no doubt they are.</p>
<p>And the law prohibits the exhibition not only of obscene pictures, but of 
indecent as well. (Sec. 12, Act No. 277.)</p>I understand that the judgment 
appealed from should have been affirmed.</div>
