				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"> STATEMENT<br></div><br>Upon the&nbsp; death of Henry&nbsp; W.&nbsp; Elser, and on June&nbsp; 21, 1923, C. W. Rosenstock filed a petition in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila for&nbsp; the probate of&nbsp; Elser's will, and that he, Rosenstock, be appointed as executor of the estate.<br><br>August 18,1923, Judge Diaz admitted the will to probate, and&nbsp; appointed Rosenstock&nbsp; as executor, who later qualified and entered&nbsp; upon the discharge of his duties.<br><br>August 30, 1923, the executor filed the following petition:<br><blockquote>"Comes now the executor in the above-entitled case and shows the court:<br><br>"1. That the work&nbsp; of administering the above-entitled estate is such as to require an unusual amount of time of the executor, owing to the&nbsp; size&nbsp; and&nbsp; involved condition of the estate.<br><br>"2. That as manager of the business of the deceased and for administering the said as guardian of&nbsp; the deceased immediately prior to his death and for administering the said estate as special administrator, after the death of the deceased and before the probate of the&nbsp; will of the deceased, the administrator was&nbsp; allowed one thousand pesos (P1,000) per month.<br><br>"3. That all parties in the Philippines of interest in the above-entitled case&nbsp; have agreed&nbsp; that the&nbsp; said&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P1,000 per&nbsp; month,&nbsp; as compensation for the executor, is just and reasonable.<br><br>"Wherefore, the&nbsp; executor&nbsp; prays the&nbsp; court&nbsp; that the executor be allowed&nbsp; P1,000&nbsp; per month as compensation as administrator of&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; in&nbsp; the above-entitled case." October 3, 1923, the court made the following order:<br><br>"It appearing from the inventory of the estate filed by the executor&nbsp; and appraised by the committee appointed for the purpose,&nbsp; that the estate in the above-entitled case is unusually large and involved; it further appearing that notice of the said petition&nbsp; was duly&nbsp; served upon&nbsp; all interested parties in the Philippine Islands, who not only did not oppose&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; but joined in the prayer&nbsp; of the same; and it appearing that the compensation asked, in view of the circumstances of the case, is reasonable, and it appearing further that the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem </span>of the minor interested in this case, Frederick Johnson Elser, has expressed his&nbsp; concurrence in the petition referred to&nbsp; of the executor herein; no reason appearing why the said petition should not be granted, let the&nbsp; same be granted."<br></blockquote>April 15, 1925, the widow of Mr. Elser filed a petition asking that the order of October 3, 1923, be revoked, and that the compensation of the executor should&nbsp; be based upon the provisions&nbsp; of section 680 of the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure.<br><br>June 13, 1925, Judge&nbsp; Imperial&nbsp; revoked&nbsp; the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of October 3, 1923, and fixed the compensation of the executor at P400 per&nbsp; month, commencing&nbsp; with&nbsp; the 1st of June, 1925.&nbsp; From&nbsp; this order, the&nbsp; widow&nbsp; appeals, contending that the trial court erred in failing&nbsp; to&nbsp; reduce the compensation of the executor to the statutory amount allowed under section 680.<br><br>The executor appeals, and assigns the following errors: <br><blockquote> "I. The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in finding that the grounds upon which&nbsp; movent's&nbsp; motion&nbsp; is&nbsp; based were established by the various writings which appear in the record, and particularly by the accounts filed by the executor.<br><br>&nbsp;"II.&nbsp; The trial court erred in finding 'that the work which is being done&nbsp; by the executor at the present&nbsp; time has been reduced to much&nbsp; less than half of that which he did when he was appointed and for several months thereafter.'<br><br>&nbsp;"III.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; reducing&nbsp; the executor's compensation from P1,000 to P400 a month, and in not denying movent's motion."<br></blockquote>JOHNS,&nbsp; J.:<br><br>The record speaks for itself.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; time of his appointment, all parties agreed that the executor should have and&nbsp; receive P1,000 per&nbsp; month for his services.<br><br>&nbsp;The order of October 3,&nbsp; 1923, among&nbsp; other things, recites the agreed&nbsp; facts, and is largely founded upon&nbsp; that stipulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; present order, reducing&nbsp; the executor's fee to P400 per month, from which both&nbsp; parties have appealed,&nbsp; was made on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1925,&nbsp; more than nineteen months after the original order&nbsp; was made.&nbsp; That&nbsp; is to say, that at the time the last order was made, Rosenstock had&nbsp; been acting as executor of the estate&nbsp; for more than nineteen months, and,&nbsp; as such, had been administering the affairs of the estate, with the ultimate view of winding up and&nbsp; closing it.&nbsp; It is very apparent that whatever reasons may have existed for allowing him&nbsp; a&nbsp; compensation of P1,000&nbsp; per&nbsp; month at&nbsp; the time of his appointment have ceased to exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; During that period, all of the assets and liabilities of the estate&nbsp; should have been legally ascertained and&nbsp; determined.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the character and class of the work which now devolves&nbsp; upon the executor is of a very&nbsp; different type&nbsp; and nature now than&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time of his appointment.&nbsp; Although by mutual consent his&nbsp; compensation was fixed at P1,000&nbsp; per month&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of his appointment, that was not a valid or binding contract continuous throughout the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; administration of the estate.&nbsp; It was always subject to change and the approval of the court,&nbsp; and to either an increase or decrease as conditions might warrant.&nbsp; At all times the compensation of the executor&nbsp; was a matter largely in the discretion of the probate court.<br><br>The original order&nbsp; of October 3,&nbsp; 1923, and the&nbsp; last order of June 13,&nbsp; 1925, were both&nbsp; made in the court in which&nbsp; the probate proceedings were pending,&nbsp; and all matters pertaining to the estate&nbsp; were peculiarly within the knowledge&nbsp; and province of that court, by which all orders were&nbsp; made; and in which&nbsp; all accounts were&nbsp; filed.&nbsp; That is to say, from the date&nbsp; of&nbsp; the appointment of the executor until the&nbsp; order of June 13, 1925, the lower court had before it all of the records, orders, and proceedings growing out of the administration&nbsp; of the estate.&nbsp; Based upon such records,&nbsp; it found as a fact that under all of the existing circumstances the fee of the executor from&nbsp; June 1, 1925, should be&nbsp; P400 per month.<br><br>In matters of this nature, the findings and conclusions of the probate court are entitled to much&nbsp; weight, particularly on questions of fact. It appears&nbsp; from&nbsp; the record that the widow-filed a motion for the removal of the executor, and that an exhaustive hearing was had and the motion denied.<br><br>&nbsp;It may be that the feeling now shown to exist by the widow against the executor was the primary cause of her motion to have his&nbsp; allowance reduced. Be that as it&nbsp; may, the court of origin, in which&nbsp; the probate proceedings&nbsp; were pending, made the&nbsp; reduction, and there is ample evidence to sustain its finding.<br><br>For the reasons above stated, there is no merit in the appeal&nbsp; of the widow.&nbsp; The judgment&nbsp; of the lower court is in all respects affirmed.&nbsp; Neither party to recover costs. So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><i>Johnson, J.,</i> did not take part.&nbsp; </div>
