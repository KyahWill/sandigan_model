				<H3>PERFECTO CORTIGUERA, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal taken by the Director of
Prisons, through the Solicitor-General, from an order of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, dated November 14, 1933, ordering the
immediate release of the herein petitioner, who some days prior thereto
had filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that,
notwithstanding the fact that he had already overserved the penalty of <em>reclusion temporal </em>imposed
upon him by the competent court for the crime of homicide, the said
respondent still continued to deprive him of his liberty. <p> The record shows that the petitioner-appellee was convicted of
the crime of homicide in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, the
judgment against him was affirmed by this court on appeal. Inasmuch as
the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction was taken into
consideration in his favor, he was sentenced only to twelve years one
day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, which is the minimum of the
minimum degree of the penalty prescribed by the law for the crime of
homicide, with the corresponding accessory penalties, to pay an
indemnity of P1,000 to the heirs of his victim. He began serving his
sentence on January 4, 1925. On November 14, 1933, the date on which
the order appealed from was issued, it appeared that he had scarcely
served eleven years, three months sixteen days of his aforesaid
sentence of twelve years one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, after
having been credited with all the allowances for good conduct to which
he was entitled under the provisions of Acts Nos. 1533 2557 of article
97 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
  <p> The petitioner, in order to
induce the lower court to order his release, alleged in his petition
for a writ of habeas corpus that inasmuch as the mitigating
circumstance of "voluntary surrender to the authorities" newly
established by the Revised Penal Code, which only took effect after his
prosecution was present in the commission of the crime, for the reason
that he, in fact, surrendered himself to the lieutenant of his barrio
immediately after he had committed his aforesaid crime, under the law
said new mitigating circumstance should also be taken into
consideration in his favor on the ground that articles 22 366 of said
Code prescribe that the provisions thereof shall have a retroactive
effect in so far as they favor the person guilty of a felony, for that
reason the next lower penalty should now be imposed upon him, that is, <em>prision mayor</em>,
in accordance with rule 5 of article 64 of said Revised Penal Code,
which corresponds to rule 5 of article 81 of the old Code. The trial
court, admitting the existence of the alleged new mitigating
circumstance, finding that the petitioner had overserved his sentence,
issued the order now under consideration.</p>
  <p> While the
respondent was perfecting his appeal against the order in question, the
Chief Executive of the Philippine Islands granted the petitioner a
conditional pardon which the latter accepted, in consequence thereof he
was immediately released by the respondent on November 20, 1933.</p>
  <p>
At first glance, inasmuch as the petitioner is already at liberty, it
certainly seems unnecessary to pass upon the respondent's appeal for
the reason that the question raised by him has now become more or less
academic. However, the Solicitor-General contends that it is not so if
the petitioner's release ordered by the trial court proves to be
unfounded.</p>
<p> Upon an examination of the record a careful study of the question
involved, this court is convinced that the same is not purely an
academic question if we bear in mind the consequences which would
result from the appealed order, should the condition of the pardon
granted to the petitioner be ever violated. There is no question that
the petitioner owes his liberty to his conditional pardon. The
condition which he bound himself to comply with was that he shall not
again commit any violation of the penal laws of the Philippine Isls.
This condition would prove illusory there would be no means of exacting
compliance therewith, in spite of the sanction provided by article 159
of the Revised Penal Code, if the appealed order were enforced
sustained, notwithstanding the falsity of the petitioner's contention
that he voluntarily surrendered himself to the lieutenant of his barrio
after the commission of the crime. Therefore it is but proper to
consider whether or not the order in question is supported by the
evidence in accordance with law.</p>
<p> The only evidence presented by the petitioner to show that he
really surrendered himself to the lieutenant of his barrio is his own
sworn statement to that effect in his application, based on an alleged
plain copy of a judgment rendered by this court in case G. R. No. 22384,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> entitled "The People of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em>
Perfecto Cortiguera" promulgated on October 23, 1924, which copy was
attached to his aforesaid application. The pertinent part of said
judgment, according to the alleged plain copy thereof, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * the accused, finding himself in such danger,
drew a knife from his pocket (saco de su bulsillo un cortaplumas)
clinched with the deceased, with the result that the latter was
wounded; whereupon said accused presented himself to the barrio
lieutenant Gavino Austria in order to report the incident."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Attention is invited to the fact that the word "bolsillo" is
misspelled, which shows that the alleged copy is not a true correct
copy. It should be noted furthermore that, judging from the seal
appearing thereon, the said copy did not come from the court of
Batangas but from the Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p> However, Exhibit 1, which is a certified copy of the original
decision rendered in the aforecited case (G. R. No. 22384, promulgated
on October 23, 1924), shows that, of the above cited part of said
decision, only the following portion appears therein, that the rest is
a fraudulent or false addition:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "* * * that the accused, finding himself in such
danger, drew a knife from his pocket (saco de su bolsillo un
cortaplumas) clinched with the deceased, with the result that the
latter was wounded."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> There is no question that the lower court erred in giving credit to
the petitioner's allegation that, according to the decision of this
court, he had surrendered himself to the barrio lieutenant Gavino
Austria, because it lost sight of the fact that the allegation in
question was based on an unauthentic apocryphal copy of said decision
that said copy was completely discredited by Exhibit 1, which is a
certified copy of the original decision. A statement under oath,
relative to a fact the knowledge of which is based merely on a
document, does not have the effect of proving that such fact has ever
taken place, if it subsequently appears that said document is false.
This is particularly true in matters relating to habeas corpus, as the
one now under consideration, inasmuch as in cases of like nature, this
court has constantly held that only those circumstances stated in the
decisions of the courts or which may logically be inferred therefrom
may be taken into consideration. (Igpuara <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons, G. R. No. 38472, decided by resolution of November 12,1932; Avestro <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons, G. R. No. 40376, decided by resolution of September 21, 1933;  Lacson <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons, G. R. No. 37947, decided by resolution of October 19, 1932.)</p>
<p> Wherefore, the appealed order is hereby declared null void set
aside on the ground that it is based on a false fact, it is ordered
that the record of the case be remanded to the court <em>a quo</em>,
through the Solicitor-General, in order that after the corresponding
investigation, he may order the proper official to take the necessary
action against the person responsible for the falsification use during
the trial of the apocryphal copy of the aforesaid decision of this
court, without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
