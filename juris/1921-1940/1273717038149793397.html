				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was instituted in the Court of First Instance of Manila by the 
Culion Ice, Fish &amp; Electric Co., Inc., for the purpose of recovering from 
the Philippine Motors Corporation the sum of P11,350, with interest and costs. 
Upon hearing the cause the trial court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff 
to recover of the defendant the sum of P9,850, with interest at 6 per centum per 
annum from March 24, 1927, the date of the filing of the complaint, until 
satisfaction of the judgment, with costs. From this judgment the defendant 
appealed.</p>
<p>The plaintiff and defendant are domestic corporations; and at the time of the 
incident with which we are here concerned, H, D. Cranston was the representative 
of the plaintiff in the City of Manila. At the same time the plaintiff was the 
registered owner of the motor schooner Gwendoline, which was used in the fishing 
trade in the Philippine Islands. In January, 1925, Cranston decided, if 
practicable, to have the engine on the Gwendoline changed from a gasoline 
consumer to a crude oil burner, expecting thereby to effect economy in the cost 
of running: the boat. He therefore made known his desire to McLeod &amp; Co., a 
firm dealing in tractors, and was told by McKellar, of said company, that he 
might make enquiries of the Philippine Motors Corporation, which had its office 
on Ongpin Street, in the City of Manila. Cranston accordingly repaired to the 
office of the Philippine Motors Corporation and had a conference with C. E. 
Quest, its manager, who agreed to do the job, with the understanding that 
payment should be made upon completion of the work.</p>
<p>The Philippine Motors Corporation was at this time engaged in business as an 
automobile agency, but, under its charter, it had authority to deal in all sorts 
of machinery engines and motors, as well as to build, operate, buy and sell the 
same and the equipment thereof. Quest, as general manager, had full charge of 
the corporation in all its branches.</p>
<p>As a result of the aforesaid interview, Quest, in company with Cranston, 
visited the Gwendoline while it lay at anchor in the Pasig River, and the work 
of effecting the change in the engine was begun and conducted under the 
supervision of Quest, chiefly by a mechanic whom Quest took with him to the 
boat. In this work Quest had the assistance of the members of the crew of the 
Gwendoline, who had been directed by Cranston to place themselves under Quest's 
directions.</p>
<p>Upon preliminary inspection of the engine, Quest came to the conclusion that 
the principal thing necessary to accomplish the end in view was to install a new 
carburetor, and a Zenith carburetor was chosen as the one most adapted to the 
purpose. After this appliance had been installed, the engine was tried with 
gasoline as a fuel, supplied from the tank already in use. The result of this 
experiment was satisfactory. The next problem was to introduce into the 
carburetor the baser fuel, consisting1 of a low grade of oil mixed with 
distillate. For this purpose a temporary tank to contain the mixture was placed 
on deck above and at a short distance from the compartment covering the engine. 
This tank was connected with the carburetor by a piece of tubing, which was 
apparently not well fitted at the point where it was connected with the tank. 
Owing to this fact the fuel mixture leaked from the tank and dripped down into 
the engine compartment. The new fuel line and that already in use between the 
gasoline tank and the carburetor were so fixed that it was possible to change 
from the gasoline fuel to the mixed fuel. The purpose of this arrangement was to 
enable the operator to start the engine on gasoline and then, after the engine 
had been operating for a few moments, to switch to the new fuel supply.</p>
<p>In the course of the preliminary work upon the carburetor and its 
connections, it was observed that the carburetor was flooding, and that the 
gasoline, or other fuel, was trickling freely from the lower part of the 
carburetor to the floor. This fact was called to Quest's attention, but he 
appeared to think lightly of the matter and said that, when the engine had 
gotten to running well, the flooding would disappear.</p>
<p>After preliminary experiments and adjustments had been made, the boat was 
taken out into the bay for a trial run at about 5 p. m., or a little later, on 
the evening of January 30, 1925. The first part of the course was covered 
without any untoward development, other than the fact that the engine stopped a 
few times, owing no doubt to the use of an improper mixture of fuel. In the 
course of the trial Quest remained outside of the engine compartment and 
occupied himself with making experiments in the matter of mixing the crude oil 
with distillate, with a view to ascertaining what proportion of the two elements 
would give best results in the engine.</p>
<p>As the boat was coming in from this run, at about 7.30 p. m., and when 
passing near Cavite, the engine stopped, and connection again had to be made 
with the gasoline line to get a new start. After this had been done the 
mechanic, or engineer, switched to the tube connecting with the new mixture. A 
moment later a back fire occurred in the cylinder chamber. This caused a flame 
to shoot back into the carburetor, and instantly the carburetor and adjacent 
parts were covered with a mass of flames, which the members of the crew were 
unable to subdue. They were therefore compelled, as the lire spread, to take to 
a boat, and their escape was safely effected, but the Gwendoline was reduced to 
a mere hulk. The salvage from the wreck, when sold, brought only the sum of 
P150. The value of the boat, before the accident occurred, as the court found, 
was P10,000.</p>
<p>A study of the testimony leads us to the conclusion that the loss of this 
boat was chargeable to the negligence and lack of skill of Quest. The temporary 
tank in which the mixture was prepared was apparently at too great an elevation 
from the carburetor, with the result that when the fuel line was opened, the 
hydrostatic pressure in the carburetor was greater than the delicate parts of 
the carburetor could sustain. This was no doubt the cause of the flooding of the 
carburetor; and the result was that, when the back fire occurred, the external 
parts of the carburetor, already saturated with gasoline, burst into flames, 
whence the fire was quickly communicated to the highly inflammable material 
near-by. Ordinarily a back fire from an engine would not be followed by any 
disaster, but in this case the leak along the pipe line and the flooding of the 
carburetor had created a dangerous situation, which a prudent mechanic, versed 
in repairs of this nature, would have taken precautions to avoid. The back fire 
may have been due either to the fact that the spark was too advanced or the fuel 
improperly mixed.</p>
<p>In this connection it must be remembered that when a person holds himself out 
as being competent to do things requiring professional skill, he will be held 
liable for negligence if he fails to exhibit the care and skill of one 
ordinarily skilled in the particular work which he-attempts to do. The proof 
shows that Quest had had ample experience in fixing the engines of automobiles 
and tractors, but it does not appear that he was experienced in the doing of 
similar work on boats. For this reason, possibly, the dripping of the mixture 
from the tank on deck and the flooding of the carburetor did not convey to his 
mind an adequate impression of the danger of fire. But a person skilled in that 
particular sort of work would, we think, have been sufficiently warned from 
those circumstances to cause him to take greater and adequate precautions 
against the danger. In other words Quest did not use the skill that would have 
been exhibited by one ordinarily expert in repairing gasoline engines on boats. 
There was here, in our opinion, on the part of Quest, a blameworthy antecedent 
inadvertence to possible harm, and this constitutes negligence. The burning of 
the Gwendoline may be said to have resulted from accident, but this accident was 
in no sense an unavoidable accident. It would not have occurred but for Quest's 
carelessness or lack of skills The test of liability is not whether the injury 
was accidental in a sense, but whether Quest was free from blame. We therefore 
see no escape from the conclusion that this accident is chargeable to lack of 
skill or negligence in effecting the changes which Quest undertook to 
accomplish; and even supposing that our theory as to the exact manner in which 
the accident occurred might appear to be in some respects incorrect, yet the 
origin of the fire is not so inscrutable as to enable us to say that it was 
eastis fortuitus.</p>
<p>The trial judge seems to have proceeded on the idea that, inasmuch as Quest 
had control of the Gwendoline during the experimental run, the defendant 
corporation was in the position of a bailee and that, as a consequence, the 
burden of proof was on the defendant to exculpate itself from responsibility by 
proving that the accident was not due to the fault of Quest. We are unable to 
accede to this point of view. Certainly, Quest was not in charge of the 
navigation of the boat on this trial run. His employment contemplated the 
installation of new parts in the engine only, and it seems rather strained to 
hold that the defendant corporation had thereby become bailee of the boat. As a 
rule workmen who make repairs on a ship in its owner's yard, or a mechanic who 
repairs a coach without taking it to his shop, are not bailees, and their rights 
and liabilities are determined by the general rules of law, under their 
contract. The true bailee acquires possession and what is usually spoken of as 
special property in the chattel bailed. As a consequence of such possession and 
special property, the bailee is given a lien for his compensation. These ideas 
seem to be incompatible with the situation now under consideration. But though 
defendant cannot be held liable on the supposition that the burden of proof has 
not been sustained by it in disproving the negligence of its manager, we are 
nevertheless of the opinion that the proof shows by a clear preponderance that 
the accident to the Gwendoline and the damages resulting therefrom are 
chargeable to the negligence or lack of skill of Quest.</p>
<p>This action was instituted about two years after the accident in question had 
occurred, and after Quest had ceased to be manager of the defendant corporation 
and had gone back to the United States. Upon these facts, the defendant bases 
the contention that the action should be considered stale. It is sufficient 
reply to say that the action was brought within the period limited by the 
statute of limitations and the situation is not one where the defense of laches 
can be properly invoked.</p>
<p>It results that the judgment appealed from, awarding damages to the plaintiff 
in the amount of P9,850, with interest, must be affirmed; and it is so ordered, 
with costs against the appellant.</p>
