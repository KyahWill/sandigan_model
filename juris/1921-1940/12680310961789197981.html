				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Convicted of the crime of double homicide and sentenced to the indeterminate penalty of from ten years of <em>prision mayor </em>to seventeen years, four months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal </em>with
the corresponding accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased Andrea Paril and Bruna Caguyong in the sum of P1,000, and to
pay the costs, the defendant herein Tomas Layos appealed from said
judgment. In his brief he enumerates the alleged errors as committed by
the trial court in its judgment. <p> Said appellant contends that the lower court erred: (1) In
declaring that he killed the two women above-mentioned; (2) in not
holding that the confessions made by were the result of brutal
treatment of him; and (3) in exaggerating, as he claims, the
contradictions of his witnesses Pascual Villares and Bruno Gonzalez.</p>
<p> Without being contradicted by the appellant, the evidence of record
shows that at about 5 o'clock on the afternoon of September 22, 1933,
while Bruna and Bonifacia Caguyong, each of whom was riding a carabao
and followed on foot by Andrea Paril, grandmother of the former and
mother of the latter, and Paula Caguyong, were returning home from a
certain mountain where they had gathered some corn, a man, whom they
met on the way, attacked said Bruna Caguyong with a bolo, causing her
to fall from her carabao, after which he continued to hack her until
she died. When Andrea Paril, the grandmother of the deceased, went to
the said Bruna Caguyong's assistance and asked the aggressor what he
had done, said individual, without a word, turned upon and attacked her
with his bolo, inflicting upon her five wounds which caused her death a
few moments later.</p>
<p> Who was the aggressor and what was the motive of the aggression? This is the question to be decided in this case.</p>
<p> The eyewitnesses of the crime, Paula and Bonifacia Caguyong,
identified the appellant as the aggressor, saying that they saw him
commit the crime from beginning to end. In said appellant's sworn
declarations which are attached to the record as Exhibits B and C, he
stated that the cause of the aggression was due to the fact that the
deceased Bruna Caguyong had called him a lunatic.</p>
<p> The defense questions the credibility of the aforesaid two
witnesses for the prosecution and cites some portions of their
testimony wherein, it is claimed, they have seriously contradicted
themselves and which makes them unworthy of credit. In the case of
Paula Caguyong, for instance, the defense considers it strange how said
witness could remember that the appellant wore a white shirt but was
unable to recall the color of his pants. There is nothing strange in
this because the witness gave a satisfactory explanation when she said:
"I do not remember it any more because I was very much frightened."
Furthermore, as the lower court has very well stated, referring
undoubtedly to the suddenness of the aggression, said witness could not
have noticed everything due to the rapidity of the attack and the
circumstances surrounding it. Furthermore, in crimes of similar nature,
where the blows are struck faster and in less time than it takes to
think, the question relative to the clothing worn by the aggressor
constitutes a very insignificant detail to the eyewitness for the
reason that his attention is focused on the attack. This1 is
particularly true when his degree of mentality is similar to that of
the witness in question who is a country woman and so illiterate that
she had to use her thumb mark in certifying her affidavit Exhibit 1.
Furthermore, she was completely overcome by fright. Human intelligence,
unlike a photographic film, cannot take in everything at a single
glance, much less reproduce it afterwards.</p>
<p> In the case of the witness Bonifacia Caguyong, who is a mere child
12 years of age and likewise illiterate, the attorney for the defense
cannot understand why the lower court should give credit to her when,
according to him, she had grossly contradicted herself in answering the
various questions propounded to her during the cross-examination. In
support of his contention, he cites the following portions of the
testimony of said witness, to wit:</p>

<p> With respect to the reply of the witness wherein she said "dangas,
bald", the word "bald" must be the interpreter's translation of the
word "dangas" used by her. However, whatever it may be, said word or
reply should be construed in connection with the suggestive question
asked by the defense counsel in the lower court, as follows: "And he
seemed to be bald?" to which she answered: "Yes, sir". Therefore, there
is no reason to attribute to said witness the categorical affirmation
that the aggressor, who killed the two deceased, was bald. On the other
hand, the defense has not proven and there is nothing of record from
which to infer that although the appellant has hair, "he does not seem
to be bald".</p>
<p> However, the fact is" that both before and after the defense
counsel had asked the question from the answer to which the present
counsel now infers that the witness could not identify the aggressor of
the deceased, said witness stated several times that the appellant was
the aggressor. Perhaps the defense counsel has not seen the other
portions of the testimony of said witness on that occasion when she
gave the testimony hereinbefore cited, which portions are as follows:</p>

<p>If the appellant's sworn declarations (Exhibits B and C) are taken
into consideration in addition to the aforesaid testimony of the
witnesses Paula and Bonifacia Caguyong, there would be no reason to
doubt but that the appellant killed the deceased Andrea Paril and Bruna
Caguyong. In the aforesaid two documents, said appellant admits that he
killed them because the latter called him a lunatic. He could not have
made this admission in a more formal manner because he made it before
the justice of the peace who conducted the preliminary investigation in
this case.</p>
<p> It is true that the appellant tried to prove during the trial that
the aforesaid confessions were not voluntarily made by him, alleging
that they had been obtained from him by means of force and maltreament.
He then declared that the constabulary soldier Miralles had slapped him
twice and struck him with his fist on the stomach, on the side and on
the breast, and twisted his upper lip. His witness Pascual Villares
likewise testified that he actually saw how the appellant had been
maltreated by a certain constabulary soldiers in the barrio of Mabini
when he was confronted with the witnesses for the prosecution Paula and
Bonifacia Caguyong. However, it is no less certain that the testimony
of said appellant relative to the injuries, which he claimed to have
had on his face and to have been due to such maltreatment, was
contradicted by the justice of the peace before whom said confessions
(Exhibits B and C) were made, saying that although he had looked well
and long at the appellant's face when he was brought to his house and
to his office for the purpose of making said confessions, he could not
find any trace nor sign of maltreatment. On the other hand, on the
occasion that the appellant claimed he had been maltreated by the
constabulary soldiers at their quarters on September 28, 1933, and
several days prior thereto, he had already been removed from their
custody either directly or indirectly, inasmuch as he had been turned
over to the chief of police of the municipality of Ormoc of the
Province of Leyte, on the 25th of said month and year, in order to be
under the custody of said chief of police at the disposal of the courts
of justice. (Exhibit F.)</p>
<p> If it were true that the appellant had been maltreated by the
constabulary soldiers or by any of them, nothing could have prevented
him from informing the justice of the peace thereof or that the
confession he had made under Exhibit B, to the effect that he killed
the two women, was the result of said maltreatment, inasmuch as he was
not under their custody at the time he made the statement Exhibit C.
The fact that he had not done so proves that he had not been maltreated
at all except on September 20,1933, that is, two days before the
commission of the crime, when, according to the testimony of corporal
Miralles of the Constabulary, he was struck several times by reason of
his refusal to cooperate in the extermination of locusts', but
certainly not for the purpose of compelling him to sign any document
nor to make any confession. Furthermore, it is unbelievable that the
constabulary soldiers or corporal Miralles or any other member of the
constabulary would have dared to maltreat him or to do violence to him
in order to compel him to confess a crime in the presence of many
persons, as the appellant claimed they did, because inasmuch as such
act constitutes an offense, it is absurd that said soldiers would
commit it in the presence of many people who might denounce it later.
Furthermore, had such a thing happened, there would at least be
somebody to corroborate the appellant's testimony, but no one did.</p>
<p> Even disregarding Exhibits B and C, which might be done arbitrarily
in view of the fact that this court does not believe that said
confessions were obtained by means of force or threats, the testimony
of Paula and Bonifacia Caguyong and the finding of the homicidal bolo,
still with bloodstains, in the appellant's house, are in themselves
sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that the appellant is, in
fact, the one who killed the said deceased Andrea Paril and Bruna
Caguyong.</p>
<p> It is likewise true that the two witnesses for the defense, Bruno
Gonzalez and Pascual Villares, testified that during the whole day of
September 23, 1933, and part of the following morning, they were
engaged with the appellant cleaning the latter's corn field and that
they began working before breakfast on the first day, the three not
having separated from each other until after sunset. However, it is
also true that a certain detail therein destroys the probatory force of
the testimony of said two witnesses, which is that, aside from the fact
that they were not certain as to the exact day on which they worked
together on the appellant's field inasmuch as they are not familiar
with dates, Bruno Gonzalez said that he and Pascual Villares arrived
together on said appellant's field on the day in question, while the
latter stated that when Bruno Gonzalez arrived there, he and the
appellant were already at work. This shows his lack of credibility. On
the other hand, oral evidence of alibi is so easily manufactured and
usually so unreliable that it can rarely be given credence, at least in
this case, for the reasons stated. (People <em>vs.</em> Badilla, 48 Phil., 718.)</p>
<p> In view of the aforestated contradiction, which the trial court
must have taken into consideration in connection with the other
findings of the case, and inasmuch as the testimony of the two
witnesses for the prosecution Paula and tonifacia Caguyong is
convincing, this court is of the opinion that the trial court did not
commit any of the errors attributed to it by the appellant.</p>
<p> It is noted, however, that the trial court did not consider such
findings strictly in conformity with the law inasmuch as it considered
the act committed by the appellant as merely constituting the complex
crime of double homicide when such is not the case, taking into
consideration the spirit and the text of article 48 of the Revised
Penal Code. According to said article, in order the crime may be
considered double homicide, it is necessary that it be the result of a
single act, as in the case of killing two persons at the same moment
with a single stroke of the bolo or with a single shot. The homicide
perpetrated by the herein defendant on Bruna Caguyong and that on
Andrea Paril do not constitute a single act but two distinct acts
committed at different times. The former's death was the result of
sixteen wounds inflicted upon her by the appellant and that of the
latter was likewise the result of the five wounds which he inflicted
upon her immediately afterward. The only mitigating circumstance which
may be taken into consideration in favor of the appellant is his lack
of instruction because the record shows that he can neither read nor
write.</p>
<p> Wherefore, inasmuch as the record contains no aggravating
circumstance to compensate said mitigating circumstance, and taking
into consideration the provisions of Act No. 4103, the appealed
judgment should be, as it is hereby, modified by sentencing said
appellant to the indeterminate penalty of seven years of <em>prision mayor </em>to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal </em>for the death of Andrea Paril and to another seven years of <em>prision mayor</em> to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>
for the death of Bruna Caguyong, and to indemnify the heirs of each of
the deceased in the sum of P1,000. The appealed judgment is hereby
affirmed in all other respects, with costs against the appellant. So
ordered.</p>
