rendered in this case, sentencing him to four years, two months and one day of 
<em>presidio correctional</em>, to pay the offended party P110, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs, as recidivist of 
<em>estafa.</em>
<p>The defense contends that the facts herein proven do not constitute 
estafa.</p>
<p>Such facts are: In May, 1923, the defendant made negotiations with Julian de 
Leon, who had and operated an automobile for hire, for the use of said vehicle. 
They agreed that the defendant should pay P25 a day for the use of the 
automobile between Manila and Binangonan, Rizal, and that such rent was payable 
daily. The accused then occupied said vehicle and caused himself to be taken to 
Binangonan. On the following day, Julian de Leon required the defendant to pay 
the rent for the first day, but the defendant gave the excuse that he had a 
check which he was to change for coin. Julian de Leon believed him and the 
defendant continued to use the car for four days more, at the end of which, and 
Julian de Leon seeing that the defendant did not pay him anything, 
notwithstanding his demands, he took the defendant to Attorney Lazaro Pormarejo 
to whom, among other things, he said that he had no money. From the evidence as 
a whole we find it sufficiently proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not 
then have, nor did he ever have, the check he mentioned.</p>
<p>We consider the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain on February 
16, 1881, and May 6, 1892, to be applicable to this case, for the reason that, 
as in those cases, it appears in the one at bar established by sufficient 
<em>indicia</em> that the defendant in hiring the automobile had no intention to 
pay for the use thereof, but deceitfully simulated that he had such 
intention.</p>
<p>The deceit became more positive and indubitable when the accused, being 
required to pay the rent for the first day, said that he had a check with the 
value of which he assured that he would pay as soon as the same was changed, 
when as a matter of fact he had no such check nor money. As to whether or not 
the information is sufficient as to the allegation of deceit, it is said therein 
that the defendant defrauded. Furthermore no objection was made to the 
information.</p>
<p>We find no error in the judgment appealed from, which is hereby affirmed with 
the costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Malcolm, Avancena, Villamor, </em>and <em>Ostrand, JJ., 
</em>concur.</p>
