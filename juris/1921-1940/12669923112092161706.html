				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On December&nbsp; 18,1929, a certificate of public convenience was granted&nbsp; to the&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; a&nbsp; Japanese subject, to operate&nbsp; a&nbsp; Ford automobile&nbsp; for&nbsp; the transportation of passengers in&nbsp; the Province of Davao, subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the following conditions which were accepted by him, to wit:<br><blockquote>"And&nbsp; without authorization&nbsp; from this commission&nbsp; previously had, the applicant shall not alter the&nbsp; manner of operating his cars prescribed herein, increase or decrease the number thereof,&nbsp; substitute them with others, change the form of the carriage with a different one, or in&nbsp; any case send&nbsp; them on a trip outside&nbsp; the zone&nbsp; of operation of the service herein&nbsp; authorized.<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br></center>"The&nbsp; certificate of public convenience&nbsp; to be issued to him by virtue of this decision shall take effect on the date the same is issued and shall continue in force until further order to the contrary from this commission."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Case&nbsp; No. 21268, Public&nbsp; Service Commission.)</blockquote>On October 23, 1935, the&nbsp; petitioner filed an application for authority to&nbsp; increase his present equipment by the addition of another <i>Ford</i> automobile, alleging that the number of automobiles registered under "PU" denomination in the&nbsp; Province of Davao was not sufficient to&nbsp; meet the demand for transportation of the inhabitants of the province.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service Commission,&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; order issued on February 14, 1936, denied said application in view&nbsp; of the constitutional&nbsp; inhibition that no&nbsp; franchise, certificate, or any other&nbsp; form&nbsp; of authorization for the operation of a&nbsp; public utility&nbsp; shall be granted except to citizens of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; or&nbsp; to corporations&nbsp; or&nbsp; other entities organized under the laws of the Philippines,&nbsp; sixty <i>per centum</i> of the capital of&nbsp; which is owned by citizens of the Philippines (Article XIII, section 8).<br><br>A petition for a writ of certiorari has been filed against this order.&nbsp; The&nbsp; allegations of&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; fail to&nbsp; state that the respondent exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the order in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; They do&nbsp; not,&nbsp; therefore, justify the issuance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ applied for, in accordance&nbsp; with section 35 of Act No. 3108, as amended.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proper remedy would have&nbsp; been to apply for the review of the disputed order in accordance with said&nbsp; section&nbsp; 35 of said Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before disposing of the&nbsp; case, this&nbsp; court deems&nbsp; it advisable, however, to state its opinion on the constitutional question raised in order to decide the case once for all.<br><br>The question&nbsp; raised&nbsp; is whether or not the petitioner's application for an increase of&nbsp; his equipment&nbsp; comes within the constitutional prohibition contained&nbsp; in Article&nbsp; XIII, section 8, of the Constitution&nbsp; of the Philippines, notwithstanding the fact that a certificate of public convenience to operate&nbsp; a&nbsp; Ford&nbsp; automobile for the transportation of passengers&nbsp; in the Province&nbsp; of Davao had been&nbsp; issued to the petitioner before the Constitution took effect on November 15,&nbsp; 1935.&nbsp; This&nbsp; court&nbsp; must decide the question in the&nbsp; affirmative.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner is neither a citizen of the Philippines nor a corporation sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned&nbsp; by citizens of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; His application for an increase&nbsp; of equipment may not require the granting of a new franchise or certificate but&nbsp; it certainly&nbsp; requires&nbsp; an&nbsp; authorization the granting of which in any form is limited by the Constitution to the citizens and corporations above-stated.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was&nbsp; clearly admitted by the petitioner&nbsp; himself when&nbsp; he alleged in paragraph 3 of his petition for a writ of certiorari that he sought "authorization" to increase his&nbsp; equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner admits&nbsp; that&nbsp; he cannot&nbsp; increase his&nbsp; equipment without&nbsp; being&nbsp; previously "authorized" to do so by the respondent commission,&nbsp; as expressly provided in&nbsp; his certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; public convenience. The&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; "any other form&nbsp; of authorization"&nbsp; used&nbsp; in Article XIII, section 8, of the Constitution&nbsp; is comprehensive&nbsp; enough to include the&nbsp; "authorization" sought by the petitioner.<br><br>The Constitution provides for the&nbsp; nationalization&nbsp; not only of the natural resources and of all forces of potential energy, but also&nbsp; of all public services or utilities, except only those rights&nbsp; that might have been&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; prior to the adoption thereof. This was&nbsp; one of&nbsp; the avowed purposes of the framers of that fundamental law, as&nbsp; declared in its preamble.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; court&nbsp; cannot agree to the suggestion&nbsp; that, as the petitioner is&nbsp; the lawful holder of&nbsp; a certificate of public convenience to operate a Ford automobile in the&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of Davao, he has a&nbsp; vested right&nbsp; to&nbsp; be authorized to increase&nbsp; his&nbsp; equipment&nbsp; by the addition&nbsp; of one&nbsp; or more oars&nbsp; thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; commission's order in&nbsp; question&nbsp; is in accordance with the&nbsp; letter and spirit of the Constitution&nbsp; and&nbsp; must be&nbsp; upheld.<br><br>The petition is&nbsp; denied, with the costs&nbsp; to the petitioner.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Villa-Real, Abad&nbsp; Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
