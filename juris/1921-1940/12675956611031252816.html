				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant seeks admission to&nbsp; the&nbsp; country, alleging he is the minor son of a resident merchant of Cebu, named Loo Ang&nbsp; Chein.&nbsp; The majority of&nbsp; the&nbsp; members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the customs board of special inquiry in said port granted&nbsp; the admission,&nbsp; but&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; being appealed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Insular Collector of Customs, the latter reversed it.&nbsp; The petitioner then instituted the instant proceedings for habeas corpus before the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Cebu, which denied the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner appeals from this&nbsp; decision.<br><br>Counsel for the petitioner maintains that the court below erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; rendering judgment&nbsp; without sufficient evidence and contrary to&nbsp; law.<br><br>At the hearing before the court below, the evidence adduced before the board of special inquiry,&nbsp; as well as the documents with reference to the appeal to the Insular Collector of Customs, and the latter's decision were presented in evidence.&nbsp; There is, then, evidence&nbsp; in the case,&nbsp; which we deem sufficient to support the judgment appealed from, the decision of the Collector of Customs is based upon the weight of the evidence duly presented&nbsp; before him, and&nbsp; it is a doctrine in this jurisdiction that where there is evidence in support of the decision of the Collector of Customs, such decision&nbsp; must be respected, and courts&nbsp; cannot go into the sufficiency or admissibility of the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Guevara vs. Collector of Customs, 34 Phil., 394; Molden vs. Collector of Customs, 34 Phil.,&nbsp; 493.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And it must be borne&nbsp; in&nbsp; mind that, as repeatedly held by this court (Rafferty vs.&nbsp; Judge of First Instance of Cebu, 7 Phil., 164; Ngo-Ti vs. Shuster, 7 Phil., 355; Lo Po vs. McCoy, 8 Phil., 343;&nbsp; Jao Igco vs. Shuster,&nbsp; 10 Phil., 448; Tan Chin Hin vs. Collector of Customs, 27&nbsp; Phil., 521; Chua Yeng vs. Collector of Customs, 28 Phil., 591) in cases of Chinese immigration,&nbsp; the decisions rendered by administrative authorities&nbsp; are&nbsp; final unless in abuse of authority.<br><br>Counsel for the appellant imputes abuse of authority to the Collector of Customs, in that he did not call a hearing on the appeal taken to him.&nbsp; It is not necessary&nbsp; that the Collector of Customs in&nbsp; cases of such&nbsp; appeals should see or hear the&nbsp; witnesses testifying (See Chiat and See Huan vs. Collector of Customs, 34 Phil., 865; Guevara&nbsp; vs. Collector of Customs, supra; Que Quay vs.&nbsp; Collector of Customs, 33 Phil., 128; Co Puy vs. Collector of Customs,&nbsp; 36 Phil., 409).<br><br>The judgment appealed&nbsp; from being nowise in error,&nbsp; it is hereby affirmed&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
