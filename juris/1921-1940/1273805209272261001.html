				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>There is practically no dispute as to the facts in this case. On January 23, 
1917, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., a foreign corporation with a branch in the 
Philippine Islands, brought an action against the Collector of Customs to 
recover the possession of certain merchandise imported into the Islands and then 
in the hands of the Collector. A. N. Jureidini &amp; Bros, intervened in the 
case and claimed title to the merchandise under a sale of the same ordered by 
the British Admiralty Court of Alexandria, Egypt, in prize court 
proceedings.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance on February 28, 1918, rendered judgment in favor 
of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., on the ground that the title to the merchandise 
originally rested in Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., and that no record of the 
prize court proceedings showing that Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., had been 
divested of the title had been presented in evidence. On appeal to the Supreme 
Court the judgment was reversed and the case remanded to the court below with 
instructions to allow Jureidini &amp; Bros, a reasonable time within which to 
obtain a duly certified copy of the decision of the Admiralty Court of 
Alexandria, in which that court declared that the merchandise constituted lawful 
prize.[1] A new trial was held on February 24, 1922, after which a judgment was 
entered in favor of A. N. Jureidini &amp; Bros. and against Behn, Meyer &amp; 
Co., Ltd., for the sum of P1,988 in damages and for the further sum of P1,988 
for the value of the merchandise in default of delivery to Jureidini &amp; 
Bros.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on the 16th day of February, 1918, all the business, 
property, and assets of every nature of the firm of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., 
were taken over by the Alien Property Custodian of the United States under the 
provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act and by direction of the said Alien 
Property Custodian, one W. D. Pemberton was appointed receiver and placed in 
full charge of the business and assets of the firm.</p>
<p>During the month of January, 1919, the business of the Philippine branch of 
Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., was liquidated and the property and assets of the 
corporation in the Philippine Islands, including the goodwill, trade-marks, 
accounts receivable, together with all vouchers, entries, and other proofs of 
the indebtedness, such as the books of account, etc., were sold to one of the 
intervenors herein, John Bordman, by the direction and under the supervision of 
the said Alien Property Custodian, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Alien Enemy Act, for the sum of P660,000, as shown by the letters and bills of 
sale, Exhibits B, C, D, and E.</p>
<p>The intervenor herein, the Bank of the Philippine Islands, advanced to 
Bordman the sum of P660,000, with which to purchase the said business, property, 
and assets of the said Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., which sum was turned over to 
W. D. Pemberton, the receiver appointed by the Alien Property Custodian.</p>
<p>On the 21st of February, 1919, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., was declared by 
the Alien Property Custodian to be an enemy not holding a license granted by the 
President, and on the same date demand was made on the receiver to convey, 
transfer, assign, deliver, and pay over to the Alien Property Custodian the net 
proceeds of the sale and liquidation of the business, property, and assets 
aforesaid, and by virtue of that demand, the said net proceeds in the sum of 
P392,674.96 was on February 28, 1919, delivered to the managing director of the 
office of the Alien Property Custodian in the Philippine Islands, as shown by 
Exhibits F and G, which sum, as far as the record shows, is still in possession 
of the Alien Property Custodian.</p>
<p>Execution of the judgment of February 24, 1922, in favor of A. N. Jureidini 
&amp; Bros, having been issued and returned unsatisfied, Jureidini &amp; Bros, 
on August 8, 1922, filed an <em>ex-parte</em> petition in the same case praying 
that a receiver be appointed by the court to take charge of the estate and 
effects of Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., and on August 10,1922, the Court of 
First Instance issued an order appointing Lazarus G. Joseph receiver of the 
property, assets and estate of the said firm, upon giving a bond in the sum of 
P1,000.</p>
<p>On the 4th of September, 1923, the said Lazarus G. Joseph, as such receiver, 
commenced an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Bank of 
the Philippine Islands and J. M. Menzi, being civil case No. 24892 of said 
court, to annul the aforesaid sale of the business, property, and assets, etc., 
of the said Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., to John Bordman and to recover back the 
property sold as property of the said Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., and for an 
accounting and other relief.</p>
<p>On the 5th of September, 1923, the said Lazarus G. Joseph, in his capacity of 
receiver, appeared in the present case in the Court of First Instance and 
obtained an order directed to the said J. M. Menzi citing him to appear before 
the court on a certain date to show cause why he should not turn over to the 
said receiver the books of account of the said Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>On September 14, 1923, John Bordman, J. M. Menzi, and the Bank of the 
Philippine Islands filed in the same case a motion for permission to intervene 
in the receivership proceedings solely for the purpose of vacating the order of 
August 10, 1922, appointing a receiver for the property, assets, and estate of 
the said Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., and alleging in support thereof that they 
had a legal interest in the subject-matter of said receivership and an interest 
against that of the parties to said proceedings.</p>
<p>At the same time the intervenors filed a verified motion setting forth the 
facts hereinbefore stated and asking that the said order of August 10, 1922, 
appointing the said Lazarus G. Joseph, receiver of the said Behn, Meyer &amp; 
Co. Ltd., be vacated and set aside on the ground that Jureidini &amp; Bros., 
under the facts and circumstances stated, had no legal right to such 
receivership and that the court had no jurisdiction to make such an appointment, 
and that consequently its order to that effect was null and void.</p>
<p>Upon hearing, the Court of First Instance, under date of September 26, 1923, 
entered an order, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the foregoing and the interests of J. M. Menzi, John Bordman and the 
Bank of the Philippine Islands in this proceeding having, in the opinion of the 
court, been shown, that of Bordman consisting in his having acquired through 
purchase for the sum of P660,000 all the interests, rights, choses in action, 
books, vouchers of the herein plaintiff; that of J. M. Menzi in his having been 
designated by said Bordman to take charge of said properties and books in his 
name; and that of the Bank of the Philippine Islands in its having furnished the 
sum of money with which said Bordman made the purchase, it is hereby adjudged to 
permit said parties, as they are hereby permitted and authorized, to intervene 
in this case; and-the court having reached the conclusion that it has not, and 
did not have, any jurisdiction to appoint a receiver in view of the fact that 
all of the properties of the said plaintiff had been sold by the Alien Property 
Custodian in accordance with the Act of Congress hereinbefore mentioned; it is 
hereby adjudged that the order of this court of August 10, 1922, appointing 
Lazarus G. Joseph, receiver, should be, as it hereby is, set aside. Let the bond 
given by said receiver to secure the faithful performance of his duties be 
cancelled, and J. M. Menzi is held to be under no obligation to deliver to the 
aforesaid Lazarus G. Joseph, the books under said Menzi's charge which formerly 
belonged to the plaintiff Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd."</p></blockquote>
<p>No exception was taken to this order neither by the receiver nor by Jureidini 
&amp; Bros., but on October 1, 1923, their counsel filed the following motion 
for reconsideration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Come now the Receiver and A. N. Jureidini &amp; Bros. in the above entitled 
case and move this court that the court reconsider the resolution of this court 
dated September 26, 1923, and, thereafter order the delivery of the books to the 
said receiver."</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 3, 1923, the motion for reconsideration was denied, exception 
duly taken and the case is now before us upon appeal from the two orders last 
mentioned.</p>
<p>The appellants contend that the court below erred in permitting the appellees 
to intervene inasmuch as (<em>a</em>) a final judgment had been entered in the 
case and (<em>b</em>) the appellees had no legal interest in the matter in 
litigation. Neither one of these points is, in our opinion, well taken. The 
appellees intervene only in the receivership proceedings which still were an 
open issue and did not attempt to interfere in the part of the case which was 
covered by the final judgment. They claimed no interest in the con- troversy 
between Jureidini &amp; Bros, and Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., but that Bordman 
and the Bank of the Philippine Islands had a vital interest in the subsequent 
receivership is clearly shown by the fact that one of the first actions of the 
receiver appears to have been the institution of an action against them to annul 
the sale made by the Alien Property Custodian to Bordman, thus disturbing the 
latter in his property rights and threatening the lien held by the bank upon the 
property sold. As to the appellee Menzi, it, is sufficient to say that he was 
brought into the present case by the receiver himself on the order to show cause 
why he did not turn over and deliver to said receiver the books of account of 
Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd. We fail to find any error or abuse of discretion on 
the part of the court below in permitting the intervention.</p>
<p>Appellants further maintain that the court erred in holding that the 
appointment of the receiver was in excess of its jurisdiction. This contention 
is also untenable. As soon as Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Ltd., was declared an 
"enemy not holding a license granted by the President of the United States," it 
became the duty of the Alien Property Custodian to take possession of its 
business and <em>all</em> its assets within United States territory, and we must 
presume that this duty was duly performed and that all such assets are now 
either actually or constructively in the possession of the Alien Property 
Custodian and under his control. If so, they are beyond the jurisdiction and 
control of the Philippine Courts. Section 7 of the Trading with Enemy Act as 
amended provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'The sole relief and remedy of any person having any claim to any money or 
other property heretofore or hereafter conveyed, transferred, assigned, 
delivered, or paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, or required so to be, 
or seized by him shall be that provided by the terms of this Act, and in the 
event of sale or other disposition of such property by the Alien Property 
Custodian, shall be limited to and enforced against the net proceeds received 
therefrom and held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the 
United States"</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 9 of the Act provides that anyone "not an enemy or ally of enemy" 
claiming any interest, right, or title in any money or other property so 
sequestered and held, may give notice of his claim and institute a suit in 
equity against the Custodian or the Treasurer, as the case may be, to establish 
and enforce his claim; and where suit is brought, the money or property is to be 
retained by the Custodian or in the Treasury, to abide the final decree. The 
same section further provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Except as herein provided, the money or other property conveyed, 
transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian shall 
not be liable to lien, attachment, garnishment, trustee, process, or execution, 
or <em>subject to any order or decree of any court."</em></p>
<p>Section 17 of the same Act provides:<br>"That the district courts of the 
United States are hereby given jurisdiction to make and enter all such rules as 
to notice and otherwise, and all such orders and decrees, and to issue such 
process as may be necessary and proper in the premises to enforce the provisions 
of this Act, with a right of appeal from the final order or decree of such court 
as provided in sections one hundred and twenty-eight and two hundred and 
thirty-eight of the Act of March third, nineteen hundred and eleven, entitled 
'An Act to codify, revise, and amend the Jaws relating to the 
judiciary."</p></blockquote>
<p>The only jurisdiction given to the Courts of First Instance of the Philippine 
Islands is in regard to criminal offenses under said Act, as shown by section 18 
thereof. Had it been the intention of Congress to give the Philippine courts 
jurisdiction over civil litigation in regard to property under the control of 
the Alien Property Custodian, the Act would, of course, have so stated. The 
orders appealed from are affirmed, with the costs against the appellants. So 
ordered.</p>
