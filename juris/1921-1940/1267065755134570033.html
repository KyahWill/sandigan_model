				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case was originally instituted on August 21,1933, by Ciriaco Chunaco against&nbsp; Delfina Tria for&nbsp; the recovery&nbsp; of the amount of P2,179.10&nbsp; with&nbsp; legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint; of another&nbsp; sum of P500 for damages, and of P400 for&nbsp; attorney's fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; On said date the plaintiff&nbsp; asked for the attachment of the defendant's property.<br><br>It is inferred from the allegations of&nbsp; the complaint and from the document attached to it as&nbsp; a&nbsp; part thereof that one Angel Pintor was an&nbsp; agent of the&nbsp; plaintiff to purchase palay and sell rice, coconut wine and other products in the municipality of Naga, Province of Camarines Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant Delfina Tria signed a contract of suretyship in favor of the plaintiff, whereby she bound herself jointly and severally&nbsp; with Angel Pintor to secure&nbsp; to the plaintiff the payment of any amount resulting, after liquidation, in favor of said plaintiff and against the principal obligor Angel Pintor.&nbsp; To secure this obligation, the defendant mortgaged certain parcels of land described in the document of suretyship.&nbsp; After a liquidation of&nbsp; accounts made on December 20, 1929, between the plaintiff and Angel Pintor, it appeared that the latter was indebted to the former in the specific sum of P2,179.10.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the demands made by the plaintiff to Angel Pintor for the&nbsp; payment of this amount,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; has failed to make payment, for which reason this&nbsp; case was instituted against the defendant as joint and several&nbsp; surety, for the recovery thereof.&nbsp; Angel Pintor has not been joined as a defendant.<br><br>On September 6,1933, the plaintiff filed another amended complaint which&nbsp; was admitted by the court. The said second complaint is for the foreclosure of a mortgage.&nbsp; In&nbsp; as much as the defendant, as alleged in&nbsp; the amended complaint, has sold the&nbsp; mortgaged parcels&nbsp; of land to Albino Rico, Margarita de los Santos, Francisco Malabanan, Paz Nadres and&nbsp; Andres&nbsp; Ilagan, in different contracts, they were joined as defendants.&nbsp; Francisco Malabanan and Paz Nadres filed&nbsp; a demurrer to the amended complaint but it was&nbsp; overruled.&nbsp; All the defendants answered the amended complaint.<br><br>After the filing of the amended&nbsp; complaint, without the plaintiff's reproducing his petition for an attachment, the court granted the petition filed&nbsp; with the original complaint<br><br>At this stage of the proceedings, the court, without calling the case for trial for the&nbsp; presentation of evidence, rendered a resolution on November 14, 1934, declaring that the facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action against each and every one&nbsp; of the defendants, and ordered the plaintiff to amend his complaint by joining Angel Pintor as defendant,&nbsp; and to refrain from prosecuting the attachment.&nbsp; The plaintiff refused to amend his&nbsp; complaint and asked that judgment be rendered in accordance therewith.&nbsp; The court, in a decision&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; on December 4, 1934, dismissed the complaint, with the costs to the plaintiff.&nbsp; The plaintiff appealed from said resolution.<br><br>The court, in dismissing the complaint and in holding that the facts alleged therein do not constitute a cause of action, based its opinion on the premise that, as the obligor Angel Pintor was not joined as&nbsp; a defendant, it&nbsp; cannot be declared that the account between him and the plaintiff is liquidated and, it&nbsp; not being liquidated, the liability of the defendant as a surety, under the terms of the contract of suretyship, has&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; arisen.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is&nbsp; alleged in the complaint&nbsp; that the account between the plaintiff and the obligor Angel Pintor has already been liquidated and this is sufficient to prevent the court from dismissing the complaint on&nbsp; the&nbsp; grounds alleged in&nbsp; its decision,&nbsp; the&nbsp; question of whether or not there really was such a liquidation being, at all events, a question of evidence.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; as the defendant had bound herself jointly and severally with the obligor&nbsp; Angel Pintor, the action of the plaintiff may be directed only against her, without the necessity of joining Angel Pintor (art. 1144, Civil Code).<br><br>With respect to the other defendants, inasmuch as&nbsp; they had purchased the mortgaged parcels and are in possession thereof, as alleged in the amended complaint, and inasmuch as the action brought is a foreclosure suit,&nbsp; they are&nbsp; duly joined in this case as defendants.<br><br>As to the attachment levied,&nbsp; notwithstanding the&nbsp; fact that, according to the amended complaint, the action brought is a foreclosure suit, it should&nbsp; be&nbsp; remembered&nbsp; that&nbsp; the plaintiff asked for it when the action brought by him was simply for the recovery of a certain sum of money.&nbsp; Furthermore, an attachment is not absolutely incompatible with a foreclosure suit, as it may lie if the mortgage, by reason of deterioration or any other cause, becomes insufficient to secure the debt.&nbsp; At&nbsp; all events, the dissolution of the attachment may, in the course of the proceedings, be decreed by the court if a petition to that effect is presented to it.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the appealed judgment&nbsp; is reversed, and&nbsp; the case is ordered&nbsp; remanded to the court of origin for final determination, with the costs to the appellee.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
