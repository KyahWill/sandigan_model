				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding the accused's protests of innocence, he was 
sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Zambales to seventeen years, four 
months and one day <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessories of the law, 
to endow the offended party in the sum of P500, to support the offspring, if 
any, and to pay the costs, for the crime of rape, with the aggravating 
circumstance of abuse of confidence.</p>
<p align="justify">In this appeal, the defendant reiterates his protests of 
innocence, imputing two errors to the trial court: in finding the evidence to be 
sufficient, and in holding that the facts in the case constitute the crime of 
rape.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for the defense finds signs of improbability in the 
accused having committed the crime in a small house at a time when his own wife 
was in the same house; in the fact that the offended party was not physically 
examined until after thirty-eight days from the occurrence, and in not offering 
resistance. But, as a matter of fact, at the time of the incident the accused's 
wife, a sickly woman, was in one of the kitchens of the house, some 7 varas 
distant, according to the accused himself, from the room where the act took 
place, or some 6 meters, according to the mother of the offended party, the 
latter being at that time a girl of 14 years of age, and physically weak.</p>
<p align="justify">With these circumstances in his favor, the accused thought not 
to attract his wife's attention, who at that time was cooking, and for greater 
safety, put a piece of cloth into the offended party's mouth, that the latter 
might riot be able to scream.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the physical examination, the provincial fiscal stated at 
the trial that it was not promptly submitted because no one requested it—due, no 
doubt, to the lack of knowledge of its necessity on the part of the interested 
parties,—and it was only when the case came up before the Court of First 
Instance and it was discovered that it had not been made, that the physical 
examination was effected. The lack of a prompt examiniation is no argument 
against the prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify">As regards the resistance offered by the offended party, it 
appears from the record that she did resist. After the offended party had 
verbally and actively refused the accused's illicit proposal, was thrown to the 
floor, held there and gagged with a piece of cloth; she was weeping, and as soon 
as her mother arrived she complained of the outrage.</p>
<p align="justify">We find the evidence sufficient and the facts proven constitute 
the crime of rape.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court took into account the abuse of confidence as an 
aggravating circumstance.</p>
<p align="justify">We take it that in this particular case the fact that the 
accused lived in the same house as the offended party is not enough, in itself, 
to hold that there is such aggravating circumstance, for after all, that house 
did not belong to the offended party (pp. 22, 61, 62, t. s. n.). As this court 
said in the case of United States vs. Cabaya Cruz (4 Phil., 252), it might serve 
to describe the accused's conduct as disgraceful, but not as an abuse of 
confidence, for which it is required to show what was the confidence reposed in 
the accused, and that it facilitated the commission of the crime, in order that 
it might be judged whether or not he had abused such confidence.</p>
<p align="justify">We hold that the crime proven in the record is rape without any 
modifying circumstance, of which the herein appellant is guilty.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is modified, and under 
the provisions of article 438 of the Penal Code, the accused is hereby sentenced 
to fourteen years, eight months and one day <em>reclusion temporal</em>, the 
judgment being affirmed in all other respects, with costs against the appellant. 
So ordered.</p> <em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, 
Ostrand,</em> and <em>Villa-Real, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
