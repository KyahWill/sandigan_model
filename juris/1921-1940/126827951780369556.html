				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This petition for certiorari was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by Maria Elviña against Enrique V.&nbsp; Filamor, as&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija, and Potenciana C. Domingo, praying for the reasons stated that this court set aside (1) the order&nbsp; of the respondent judge&nbsp; dated&nbsp; July 29, 1931, which vacated the decision rendered on March 16, 1931, declaring Potenciana C. Domingo in default, and adjudicating lots Nos. 1 and 2 of registration proceeding No. 1970, G. L. R. 0. Record No. 35645 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija to the petitioner, Maria Elvina; (2)&nbsp; the order of June 23,1931, denying the motion for a reconsideration of the aforesaid decision; (3) the order requiring the issuance&nbsp; of the decree&nbsp; of&nbsp; confirmation and registration dated June&nbsp; 23, 1931; and (4)&nbsp; the order of July 15, 1931, denying the motion for reconsideration of said order and ordering the reopening of the case so that the respondent Potenciana&nbsp; C. Domingo might file an answer. The relevant facts&nbsp; necessary to decide the point of law raised on appeal are as follows:<br><blockquote>The land involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; this proceeding was already&nbsp; litigated by the petitioner, Maria Elviña and the respondent, Potenciana&nbsp; C. Domingo in civil case No. 3265, which was decided in favor of the latter and in registration proceeding No.&nbsp; 1644, G. L. R. O. Record&nbsp; No. 28563 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija (Exhibits D,&nbsp; E,&nbsp; and F).<br><br>The same land&nbsp; is&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in registration&nbsp; proceeding No.&nbsp; 1934, G.&nbsp; L. R. 0. Record No. 35086, which&nbsp; is still pending,&nbsp; Potenciana&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Domingo, the respondent&nbsp; herein, being the applicant, and Maria Elviña, the petitioner herein, the opponent.<br><br>On September 13, 1929, the petitioner filed an application for the registration of a parcel of land comprising&nbsp; lots Nos. 1 and 2 of registration proceeding No. 1970, G. L. R. O. Record&nbsp; No. 35645&nbsp; (Exhibit A-petitioner)&nbsp; which was amended on December 8, 1930 (Exhibit C).&nbsp;&nbsp; That application was set for hearing on March 16,&nbsp; 1931,&nbsp; 8.30 a. m., before the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija.&nbsp;&nbsp; After due publication,&nbsp; the case came&nbsp; up for hearing on the date indicated, i. e., March&nbsp; 16, 1931, and there being no opposition to the application, the court entered an order of general default (Exhibit F-petitioner), and corresponding decision, adjudicating said lots and decreeing their registration to the petitioner Maria Elvina (Exhibit G).<br><br>On April 23, 1931, or thirty-eight days after that decision was promulgated, Potenciana C. Domingo filed a motion to set it aside on the ground that she had not been given notice of the pendency of said registration case (Exhibit H).<br><br>On June 23, 1931, Judge Buenaventura Ocampo, then presiding over the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, denied the motion&nbsp; and ordered the issuance of the final decree of confirmation and registration of the petitioner's title to said land&nbsp; (Exhibits I and J)&nbsp; which up to that time had not been issued.<br><br>On July 9, 1931,&nbsp; Potenciana C.&nbsp; Domingo moved for the reconsideration of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; order, dated&nbsp; June 23, 1931, denying her petition to set aside the decision rendered on March 16, 1931, which motion had&nbsp; been denied&nbsp; by the respondent judge on July 15, 1931&nbsp; (Exhibits&nbsp; K and L).<br><br>On July&nbsp; 16, 1931, the respondent Potenciana C. Domingo filed another motion under oath, amended on July 23, 1931, by another, praying the respondent judge to reconsider his orders dated June 23d and July 15, 1931, alleging, among other grounds, besides those set up&nbsp; in the preceding motions, that&nbsp; she was the owner of the land registered in the petitioner's name in registration proceeding No. 1970, G. L. R. O. Record No. 35645 which land had already&nbsp; been litigated&nbsp; by&nbsp; them in&nbsp; civil case No. 3265 and registration proceeding No. 1644, G. L. R. O. Record No. 28563, the case being decided&nbsp; in favor of the respondent, and in registration proceeding No.&nbsp; 1934, G. L. R. O. Record No. 35086, which is still pending;&nbsp; and&nbsp; she there further alleged that she had been in possession&nbsp; of said land for over twenty-five years publicly, peacefully, continuously, and adversely (Exhibits 1 and 2).<br><br>On July&nbsp; 29, 1931,&nbsp; the respondent judge granted&nbsp; the respondent's&nbsp; amended motion&nbsp; filed&nbsp; on July 23, 1931, and entered the order now sought to be set aside, revoking the order of general default entered on&nbsp; March 16, 1931 (Exhibit M).&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner excepted to this order on August 24, 1931.</blockquote>The only question to be decided here is whether the respondent judge acted without jurisdiction&nbsp; in&nbsp; issuing the order of July 29,&nbsp; 1931, setting aside the decision of March 16, 1931, which declared a general default and&nbsp; adjudicated to the petitioner Maria Elvina lots Nos. 1 and 2 of registration&nbsp; proceeding No. 1970,&nbsp; G. L.&nbsp; R. O. Record No.&nbsp; 35645 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, and ordering their registration in her name.<br><br>The decision of&nbsp; March 16, 1931, mentioned heretofore was&nbsp; rendered after the respondent Potenciana C. Domingo had been declared in default, and the various motions which she&nbsp; had filed to set aside that decision&nbsp; and annul the default&nbsp; against her were based upon her not having been personally notified of the pendency of the registration proceeding in the course of which it was rendered, while the petitioner Maria Elviña was aware that she was in possession of the land concerned in that case, and notwithstanding the fact that they had&nbsp; previously litigated the&nbsp; property, when the respondent won the case; the motions had an affidavit of&nbsp; merits attached.&nbsp; Although that decision became final because&nbsp; Potenciana C. Domingo did not appeal from it, she still was entitled to ask to&nbsp; be relieved from it on the ground that fraud had been employed in procuring it, and&nbsp; that it was the result of surprise&nbsp; or excusable negligence, providing&nbsp; she requested&nbsp; such relief within a reasonable time, not exceeding&nbsp; six months from&nbsp; the date of the&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; (Larrobis vs.&nbsp; Wislizenus and&nbsp; Smith, Bell &amp; Co.,&nbsp; 42&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 401;&nbsp; Philippine Manufacturing Co.&nbsp; vs. Imperial, 47&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 810;&nbsp; Philippine Manufacturing^Co. and Government&nbsp; of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Cabangis,&nbsp; 49 Phil., 107.)<br><br>The decision mentioned above was dated&nbsp; March 16, 1931, and the motions to set it aside were filed within the period of six months thereafter.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1931, the order for the issuance of the decree of confirmation and registration had already been issued, and as that order was not put into effect and the chief of the General Land Registration&nbsp; Office has not yet issued&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; decree, which would&nbsp; have made&nbsp; the order&nbsp; aforesaid final, section 38 of Act&nbsp; No. 496&nbsp; is not yet applicable where it&nbsp; provides that the decree of confirmation and registration may be reviewed&nbsp; only within&nbsp; the year&nbsp; following its&nbsp; issuance, and upon the ground of&nbsp; fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; (De los Reyes vs.&nbsp; De&nbsp; Villa, 48 Phil., 227.)<br><br>Inasmuch as&nbsp; the&nbsp; decree of registration had&nbsp; not been issued&nbsp; when the motions were&nbsp; filed&nbsp; and&nbsp; the respondent judge entered the order of July&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1931,&nbsp; and as the six- month period fixed&nbsp; in section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, reckoned from the date&nbsp; of the decision, had not elapsed when Potenciana C.&nbsp; Domingo filed the&nbsp; motions, the respondent judge acted with jurisdiction in entering the order of July 29, 1931.<br><br>In view of the foregoing consideration, we are of opinion and so hold that an order of default and the decision wherein said order is included, entered in a registration proceeding,&nbsp; may be set aside even after thirty days from its promulgation,&nbsp; by reason&nbsp; of fraud, surprise, or&nbsp; excusable negligence,&nbsp; if a motion is filed&nbsp; to that effect within six months&nbsp; from the date of the decision, under section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure,&nbsp; and&nbsp; before the chief of the General Land Registration Office issues the decree of registration in pursuance of&nbsp; the order to that end.<br><br>Wherefore, the petition for the writ of certiorari&nbsp; is hereby denied,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp; the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.</span><b>,</b> concur.</div>
