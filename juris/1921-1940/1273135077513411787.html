				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The decision handed down on August 3, 1918, in regard to lot 1897 in cadastral proceeding No. 4, G. L. R. 0. Record No.  103  of  the  Court of First Instance  of  Nueva  Ecija, reads as  follows:<br><br><blockquote>"It having been shown by the evidence adduced at the trial  that, except  for certain  portions of riparian forest land not exceeding 200 hectares covered with trees of the first,  second and third groups, along the Patalac, Palasan and  Buhay  Creeks,  all of the land in question has been known for more than forty  years to date, as the  private property, and  in continuous possession, of Antonio Sangabol's  father and afterwards of his children and grandchildren  as  owners, who subsequently sold it to the  spouses Bartolome A.  Ramos and Jorja Torres, it is ordered that after the portions specified above as containing timber have been segregated  from lot 1897, the remaining  portion be ad- judged to, and  registered in  the  name of  the conjugal partnership of  Bartolome A.  Ramos  and  Jorja  Torres.  The  cadastral surveyor is hereby  ordered,  with the aid of the forest inspector, to identify the portions  covered by trees of  the first,  second and third groups,  not to exceed 200 hectares, along the aforementioned creeks, and to segregate them from the lot in  question, later filing with the court a sketch with the proper technical description, showing the various portions or new lots into which lot 1897 may be subdivided."<br></blockquote><br>No appeal was taken from this judgment.<br><br>This lot originally  belonged to Antonio Sangabol's heirs from whom Bartolome A. Ramos and his wife Jorja Torres purchased it.  But this sale having been subsequently rescinded,  Antonio Sangabol's heirs conveyed  it  to Arsenio Sangueza, who later also sold it to Fernando  Busuego, who, in turn,  transferred it to the spouses Fernando Lopez and Carmen Gonzales.  In view of these conveyances, the court on January 6,  1922  amended  its decision  rendered  on August 3, 1918,  upon petition of the interested parties, and ordered that  after  the  exclusion  of  the  portions  not  to exceed  200  hectares, pursuant to the judgment of March 3, 1918, this lot  be adjudged to, and registered in the name of, the spouses  Vicente  Lopez and Carmen Gonzales.  By the  order of  the court, Surveyor Silverio Choco accompanied by an inspector appointed by the Bureau of  Forestry went to the land for the purpose of locating the  portions which could be  considered  forest land in the segregation ordered.  As  a  result of this action,  the  provincial fiscal of Nueva Ecija,  at the request of the Director of the Bureau of Forestry, filed a petition in the court on May 22, 1923, to the effect that, after an investigation by  the  said Bureau, it was found  that the land  included in lot  1897  is not forest land  throughout, and  he  therefore prays  that from said lot only a strip of 15 meters on each side of the creeks in the lot be segregated from said lot.   The spouses Lopez and  Gonzales objected to this  petition and  made application that all of said lot be registered in their name. On June 11, 1923 this cause was heard at the request  of the fiscal, there being present the said fiscal and the attorneys for  Vicente Lopez and Carmen Gonzales, the latter introducing  their evidence and the provincial fiscal waiving his right to do  the same.  On July 9th of the same year, the court's finding that all the said lot 1897 did not contain any  portion which  might  be  considered  as  forest  land, denied the provincial fiscaPs petition, and ordered  the registration of all  of the lot in the name of the spouses Vicente Lopez and Carmen Gonzales.<br><br>Subsequently,  the provincial fiscal of  Nueva Ecija,  in behalf of the  Director of Lands and  the  Director of Forestry, moved for the reconsideration of this  order of the court rendered on July 9, 1923, on the  ground that it had exceeded its jurisdiction, but the court denied this reconsideration by an  order of October 16, 1923.<br><br>During the course of these proceedings in  1919 and the following years,  several portions  within the 200 hectares of said lot 1897, to which the order of  segregation in the decision of August 3, 1918 refers, were  occupied  as homesteads with the approval  of the Bureau  of Lands.<br><br>The Director of Lands and several of these occupants now file  this  original  petition for  a writ  of certiorari against Judge Eduardo  Gutierrez  David  of  the  Court of First Instance of  Nueva Ecija, and the spouses Vicente Lopez  and  Carmen  Gonzales.  It  is  alleged  that  the Court of  First Instance  of  Nueva Ecija acted without jurisdiction in  ordering in its decree of  July 9, 1923, the registration of all  of lot  1897 in the name of the spouses Vicente Lopez and Carmen  Gonzalez and in ordering  on March 21, 1927 that the  latter be placed in  possession of the whole of  this lot and that the petitioners,  except the Director of Lands, be  ejected  therefrom,  without said petitioners having  been notified that  such an order was to be issued, before it was actually issued.   It is alleged, furthermore,  that,  as the  judgment  of  August  3,  1918, declaring this area of 200 hectares public land  and ordering its segregation from lot  1897  had become final,  the court had no jurisdiction  to issue its order of July 9, 1923 directing  the  registration of  this portion in  the  name of the spouses Lopez and Gonzales.  They pray that this order of July 9, 1923 be  declared null.<br><br>It should be noted that the judgment  of August 3, 1918 did not order  the  definite segregation of the whole  area of 200 hectares from this lot 1897, but an area not to exceed 200 hectares,  covered with trees  of  the first, second and third groups.   This segregation, then, had been  ordered on the condition that said area <i>was not to exceed 200 hectares and  was  to be covered by  trees of  the first, second and third groups.</i>   As to this area of 200 hectares, that judgment was not  final, since nothing in particular was decided, but on the contrary it ordered further proceedings for the determination of the area to be definitely segregated.  The only thing final about that judgment was that the area to be segregated was  not to exceed  200 hectares.  Hence it was ordered that the portions falling within  these  conditions were to be located by a surveyor designated by the court and  accompanied by  an inspector from the  Bureau of Forestry.  Therefore, in accordance with that decision, any area not exceeding 200 hectares and covered by trees of the first, second and third groups, could be  segregated or there could be no segregation if it were found that none of it was covered by trees  of these kinds.  Consequently, the court's order of July 9, 1923 is in conformity with the judgment of August  3, 1918, and is nothing but  a compliance of its command.   Hence, it cannot be said that the court quashed a final judgment  and therefore acted  in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the order of July  9, 1923.  Furthermore, the only parties interested in said lot 1897 when the judgment of August 3, 1918 was rendered, were the spouses Lope2 and Gonzales and the Fiscal of Nueva Ecija in  behalf of the Director of Forestry and Director of Lands, who took part in  all the proceedings that led up to the order  of July  9,  1923.  The  other  petitioners in this proceeding occupied portions  of this lot only  in 1919 and the years following,  and do not allege that they  appeared in the registration case in which  that  order  was issued; hence they are not entitled to personal notification of the proceedings.<br><br>This petition  for the writ of certiorari,  originally  presented to this court on July 30, 1927, was decided on October 3 of  the  same year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  A motion for  reconsideration of this decision was filed and granted.  Now, setting aside the decision of this court of October 3, 1927, the  petition is hereby denied, without special  finding as to costs.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Street,  Malcolm,  Villamor, Ostrand, Johns</span>,  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa- Real,  JJ.</span>, concur.
