				<H3>BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. WENCESLAO TRINIDAD, AS COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p align="center">STATEMENT</p>
<p>The plaintiff is a domestic banking corporation, with its principal office 
and place of business in the City of Manila, operating under a special charter 
granted by the Philippine Legislature, known as Act No. 1790.</p>
<p>The defendant is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting Collector of 
Internal Revenue of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>For cause of action, plaintiff alleges that article 26 of its Charter 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The bank shall be held to renounce all claim to the exclusive privilege of 
issuing notes in the Philippine Islands, or to any other exclusive privilege not 
set forth in this Act; but no laws or regulations shall be made or enforced 
affecting the bank, or imposing charges or taxation upon it, which shall not 
apply equally to other banks of a similar type operating under similar 
conditions, and no bank shall be authorized to issue circulating notes in the 
Philippine Islands with a paid-up capital less than two million pesos; but this 
provision shall not preclude the Government from granting special privileges to 
agricultural banks, savings banks, mortgage banks, or other institutions of 
special types whose principal business is not commercial 
banking."</p></blockquote>
<p>That after it was granted by Act No. 2612 on February 4, 1916, the 
Legislature of the Philippine Islands granted a charter to the Philippine 
National Bank, by section 18 of which authority is given the bank to issue 
circulating notes, and that in such section it was provided that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Said circulating notes shall be exempt from any and all taxes levied 
or assessed by the Philippine Government, or any department, division or 
subdivision thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>That, through the Collector of Internal Revenue, the Government has always 
claimed and exercised the right to collect from the plaintiff internal revenue 
taxes upon its circulating notes issued by the plaintiff under the authority of 
its charter for one-twelfth of one per cent upon the average amount of its 
circulation, and compelled the plaintiff to pay such taxes, and that it has paid 
such taxes; that the enactment of the provisions of article 26 above quoted was 
in violation of the contract entered into between the plaintiff and the 
Philippine Government; that the defendant has not collected taxes upon the 
circulation of the Philippine National Bank, and that, by reason of the fact 
above stated, the plaintiff was and is entitled to the same exemptions and 
privileges as the Philippine National Bank, it being a bank of similar type and 
operating under similar conditions; that the defendant wrongfully and unlawfully 
demanded and collected from the plaintiff upon its circulation the following 
sums upon the following dates, to wit:</p>

<p>That the interest upon such taxes from the time of the filing of the 
complaint amounts to P5,728.32; that each year the plaintiff paid the taxes 
under protest, and that demand therefor has been made and payment refused.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the plaintiff prays judgment against the defendant for the sum of 
P109,117.93, with interest from November 1, 1921, with costs.</p>
<p>December 21, 1921, the defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint upon the 
ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action.</p>
<p>After arguments, the lower court sustained the demurrer, from which the 
plaintiff appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>In an opinion written by Mr. Justice Johnson, to which three members 
dissented, the judgment of the lower court was reversed,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> and remanded with leave to the defendant to 
answer.</p>
<p>The defendant, without waiving the legal point raised in his demurrer, then 
filed an answer, admitting the formal part of the complaint, and alleging the 
collection of the taxes as alleged, and specifically denies all of the other 
material allegations of the complaint, and, as a special defense, alleges: 
(<i>a</i>) That the plaintiff is a private corporation organized for private 
purposes, and is exclusively owned and managed by private interest; and that the 
Philippine National Bank is a Government institution established to promote the 
public interests and welfare of the Government, which owned more than one-half 
of the capital stock, and which has supervision and control over the bank; 
(<i>b</i>) that the plaintiff is not a bank of similar type operating under 
similar conditions to the National Bank, nor is it entitled to the same 
exemptions and privileges as the National Bank; (<i>c</i>) that at the time the 
taxes mentioned in the first paragraph were paid by the plaintiff, Act No. 2612 
of the Philippine Legislature was no longer in force, and that it was amended 
and superseded by Acts Nos. 2747 and 2938; that under the provisions of section 
14 of Act No. 2747 and section 15 of Act No. 2938, the circulating notes of the 
Philippine National Bank, with the exception of those issued against gold coin 
of the United States, are not exempt from taxes, and the defendant has 
heretofore levied and collected the taxes due on the circulating notes of the 
National Bank; that the plaintiff has no note circulation issued against gold 
coin of the United States, and the circulating notes upon which the taxes were 
paid were of the same kind and type on which the National Bank was paying taxes; 
that Acts Nos. 2747 and 2938 are not laws or regulations affecting the plaintiff 
bank or imposing charges or taxation upon it; (<i>d</i>) that the plaintiff paid 
the taxes voluntarily without any compulsion or demand by the defendant; 
(<i>e</i>) that the charter of the plaintiff bank has not in any way been 
violated, and that the taxes paid by the plaintiff were legally due the 
Government.</p>
<p>It is then alleged that the action to recover the taxes paid on October 27, 
1919, is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Upon such issues, the parties entered into the following stipulation of 
facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto that 
the following facts are true and that the same may be used upon trial with the 
same force and effect as though given as evidence before the court:</p>
<p>"That the plaintiff is a domestic corporation, as alleged in the complaint, 
organized for a private end and benefit and operating under Act No. 1790 of the 
Philippine Commission with its outstanding capital stock owned by private 
individuals and corporations;</p>
<p>"That the activities of the plaintiff and the business done by it is such as 
permitted and set forth in said Act No. 1790;</p>
<p>"That the Philippine National Bank is a banking corporation organized under 
Acts Nos. 2612, 2747, and 2938 of said Legislature;</p>
<p>"That 92 per cent of its outstanding capital stock is owned by the Government 
of the Philippine Islands and 8 per cent by individuals and corporations;</p>
<p>"That the activities and business of said Philippine National Bank are such 
as are permitted and set forth in said last above-mentioned acts;</p>
<p>"That the payment of taxes upon its circulation made by the plaintiff, 
alleged by the complaint and admitted by the defendant in his answer, were made 
under due and timely protest, but without any compulsion or previous demand from 
the defendant, and such payments were made to avoid payment of penalties in case 
of non-payment;</p>
<p>"That heretofore and on the 9th day of March, 1922, and after the beginning 
of this action, the defendant made demand upon the Philippine National Bank for 
the payment of taxes under its circulation;</p>
<p>"That the amount of said circulation issued under Act No. 2924 from October 
7, 1919, to October 31, 1921, was P10,926,300, as is more fully shown by Exhibit 
A attached hereto and made a part hereof;</p>
<p>"That the amount of circulation issued against its capital stock by said 
Philippine National Bank from October 7, 1919, to October 31, 1921, was 
P19,299,500, as is more fully shown by Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part 
hereof;</p>
<p>"That heretofore and on the 15th day of July, 1922, the said Philippine 
National Bank paid the defendant as taxes upon its circulations shown in Exhibit 
B, the sum of P519,043.03; and on the 2d day of August, 1922, said bank paid the 
defendant further the sum of P129,760.77, being 25 per cent surcharge upon the 
taxes paid as last above-mentioned ; that the Philippine National Bank has not 
since its organization issued any circulating notes against gold coin of the 
United States held in the bank's own vault or to its order in the Treasury of 
the Philippine Islands or of the United States or in solvent National Banks of 
the United States or in any Federal Reserve Bank thereof;</p>
<p>"That both of said payments were made under due and timely protest and that 
the Board of Directors of the said Philippine National Bank has resolved to 
bring an action against the defendant for the recovery of said sums if the 
Secretary of Justice, to whom the matter has been referred for advice, should, 
in his capacity as ex-officio attorney for the Bank, approve of such action;</p>
<p>"That the payments made by the Philippine National Bank of taxes on its 
circulation are more fully shown in Exhibit C which is attached hereto and made 
a part hereof;</p>
<p>"That plaintiff's action was filed in Court on November 1, 1921;</p>
<p>"That on January 28, 1922, the Attorney-General of the Philippine Islands 
rendered an opinion on the taxability of the circulating notes of the Philippine 
National Bank, a copy of which will be submitted to the Court by 
defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p>The plaintiff also offered the oral testimony of two witnesses as experts in 
the knowledge of banking, for the purpose of showing that the two banks were of 
similar type and operating under similar conditions, to which offer the 
defendant objected, and the objection was sustained.</p>Upon such issues and the 
stipulated facts, the lower court rendered judgment for the defendant, from 
which the plaintiff appeals, contending that the court erred in rejecting the 
testimony of the two witnesses as to the similarity of the banks; "in finding 
that the statement of agreed facts submitted by the parties admitted that 'on 
the other hand, the Philippine National Bank was created to promote the general 
interests of the country, etc.;' in finding that said agreed statement of facts 
admitted 'That, in accordance with the law, the Philippine National Bank pays 
the corresponding tax upon notes put in circulation, etc.' and omitting the 
facts as set forth in said statement in that regard; in finding that section 18 
of Act No. 2612 contains a provision that does not affect plaintiff but refers 
exclusively to the Philippine National Bank;" in finding the law to be as stated 
in the dissenting opinion upon the demurrer in the former appeal; in finding 
that because the Philippine National Bank paid taxes upon its circulating notes, 
plaintiff's cause of action was not proven; and in rendering judgment for the 
defendant.<br><br><br>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Bank of the Philippine Islands 
<i>vs</i>. Trinidad, G. R. No. 18747, promulgated September 23, 1922, not 
reported. 
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The Banco Español Filipino was incorporated under a charter granted by the 
Kingdom of Spain by which certain rights and privileges were conferred upon it, 
and specially that of the exclusive right of issuing and circulating notes of 
the bank to an amount equal to three times of its capital stock. After the 
Treaty of Paris, a dispute arose between the bank and the Government authorities 
as to the powers, rights and privileges of the bank under its then charter, 
resulting in the enactment of Act No. 1790 by the Philippine Commission October 
12, 1907, in and by which certain rights and privileges under the Spanish 
charter were surrendered and the powers of the bank were specifically defined, 
and article 26 above quoted, upon which the plaintiff now relies, was then 
enacted.</p>
<p>By the terms of the Act, the corporate name of the bank was changed to that 
of Bank of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>This was followed by Act No. 2612 of the Philippine Legislature creating what 
is known as the Philippine National Bank, in and by which, under section 18 
thereof, it is provided that the circulating notes of that bank "shall be exempt 
from any and all taxes levied or assessed by the Philippine Government, or any 
department, division or subdivision thereof."</p>
<p>Plaintiff contends that the Philippine National Bank is a bank of a similar 
type to it, and that it is operated under similar conditions, and that the 
exemption in favor of the Philippine National Bank under section 18 of its 
charter, was in violation of, and is in direct conflict with, the provisions of 
article 26 of plaintiff's charter. It will be noted that section 18 above quoted 
further provides for the issuance of circulating notes, specifying the amount, 
the redemption of securities, and that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The said securities described in section eleven and the proceeds thereof 
shall be held inviolable for the payment and redemption of said circulating 
notes. Said circulating notes shall be engraved and shall be payable on demand 
to the bearer in lawful money of the Philippine Islands. There shall at all 
times be held by said bank a sum not less than thirty-three and one-third per 
cent of the total amount of said circulating notes outstanding in lawful money 
of the Philippine Islands. Said sum shall be available only for the purpose of 
redeeming the circulating notes herein provided for."</p></blockquote>
<p>February 20, 1918, the Legislature of the Philippine Islands passed Act No. 
2747, entitled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An Act to amend in certain particulars Act Numbered Twenty-six hundred and 
twelve, entitled 'An Act creating the Philippine National Bank.' 
"</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 48 of which provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent or incompatible with the provisions 
of this Act are hereby repealed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 15 of Act No. 2747 provides for the issuance of circulating notes, 
and further—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There shall at all times be held by said National Bank a sum not less than 
thirty-three and one-third per cent of the total amount of said circulating 
notes issued and outstanding and not covered by gold coin of the United States 
as herein provided for in lawful money of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"It is hereby further provided that in addition to the circulating notes 
above provided for, said National Bank shall have authority to issue its 
circulating notes against gold coin of the United States to the full value 
thereof: <i>Provided, however,</i> That such gold coin against which circulating 
notes have been issued shall be held by said bank and used for no other purpose 
except the redemption of said circulating notes. The said bank, however, shall 
have the privilege of redeeming said circulating notes in any lawful money of 
the Philippine Islands. Such circulating notes shall be exempt from any and all 
taxes levied or assessed by the Philippine Government, or any department, 
division or subdivision thereof.</p>
<p>"The said circulating notes shall be receivable by the Philippine Government 
in payment of all taxes, dues or other claims due or owing to said Government, 
and shall be redeemed by the bank on demand, in lawful money * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>January 30, 1921, the Philippine Legislature enacted Act No. 2938, 
entitled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An Act to amend Act Numbered Twenty-six hundred and twelve, entitled 'An Act 
creating the Philippine National Bank,' as amended by Act Numbered Twenty-seven 
hundred and forty-seven."</p></blockquote>
<p>The provisions of section 14 of Act No. 2938, as to circulating notes and 
exemption from taxation, are identical with the provisions of section 15 above 
quoted of Act No. 2747.</p>
<p>Both Acts Nos. 2747 and 2938 expressly provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That in addition to the circulating notes above provided for, said National 
Bank shall have authority to issue its circulating notes against gold coin of 
the United States to the full value thereof: <i>Provided, however,</i> That such 
gold coin against which circulating notes have been issued shall be held by said 
Bank and used for no other purpose except the redemption of said circulating 
notes. The said bank, however, shall have the privilege of redeeming said 
circulating notes in any lawful money of the Philippine Islands. Such 
circulating notes shall be exempt from any and all taxes levied or assessed by 
the Philippine Government, or any department, division or subdivision thereof." 
And there is no provision in Act No. 2612 for the issuance of circulating notes 
of the bank "against gold coin of the United States to the full value thereof," 
or that "such gold coin against which circulating notes have been issued shall 
be held by said bank and used for no other purpose except the redemption of said 
circulating notes."</p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming, without deciding, that, in so far as it exempts the Philippine 
National Bank from certain taxes, Act No. 2612 is in conflict with plaintiff's 
charter, such exemption provisions are left out of both Acts Nos. 2747 and 2938. 
That is to say, that, as to the question of exemption from taxation, there is no 
provision in either Act No. 2747 or Act No. 2938, which is in conflict with the 
provisions of plaintiff's charter. The conflict, if any, which did exist ceased 
to exist on February 20, 1918, when Act No. 2747 became a law.</p>
<p>Under the stipulated facts, among others, it is agreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the Philippine National Bank has not since its organization issued any 
circulating notes against gold coin of the United States held in the Bank's own 
vault or to its order in the Treasury of the Philippine Islands or of the United 
States or in solvent National Banks of the United States or in any Federal 
Reserve Bank thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>As the Attorney-General points out, all of the taxes here involved, and which 
the plaintiff now seeks to recover, accrued and were paid after Act No. 2747 
became a law, and upon the question here presented Acts Nos. 2747 and 2938 are 
identical.</p>
<p>It appears in the Act itself that Act No. 1790, granting the plaintiff its 
charter, was in the nature of a compromise of conflicting claims and rights, and 
plaintiff's cause of action is founded upon the theory that it is a contract 
between it and the Government, and that Act No. 2612, incorporating the 
Philippine National Bank, was a violation of that contract.</p>
<p>Assuming that to be true, and that at the time Act No. 2612 became a law it 
had a just cause of grievance, the treatment of which it now complains arose and 
the taxes, which it now seeks to recover, accrued after Act No. 2612 was amended 
and repealed by Act No. 2747. For such reason, its alleged grievance comes 
under, and must be construed by, the terms and provisions of Act No. 2747. In 
other words, plaintiff's cause of action is founded upon an alleged breach of 
contract arising from, and growing out of, the granting of a charter to the 
Philippine National Bank by Act No. 2612, which contains the provisions above 
quoted, and the legislative records show that Act No. 2612 was amended and 
repealed by Act No. 2747, and that the last Act became the law of the land on 
February 20, 1918, and that the payment of the taxes, of which plaintiff now 
complains, accrued on and after October 27, 1919.</p>
<p>It is further contended that prior to the time this action was commenced, the 
Philippine National Bank had not paid or been requested to pay any tax upon its 
circulating notes, and, for such reasons, the plaintiff is entitled to the 
refund of the taxes which it has paid upon its circulating notes. The taxes in 
question were levied and assessed under section 1499 of the Administrative Code 
of 1917, which, among other things, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 1499. <i>Tax on capital, deposits, and circulation of 
banks</i>.—Subject to the exemptions herein made there shall be collected from 
banks the following taxes on capital, deposits, and circulation:</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) Upon the average amount of circulation issued by the bank, 
including as circulation all notes and other obligations calculated or intended 
to circulate or be used as money, but not including such as may be retained in 
the vault of the bank or redeemed and on deposit for said bank, for each month, 
one-twelfth of one per centum."</p></blockquote>
<p>The section itself defines the meaning of the word "bank," as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Includes every incorporated or other bank, and every person, association, or 
company having a place of business where credits are opened by the deposit or 
collection of money or currency subject to be paid or remitted upon draft, 
check, or order, or where money is advanced or loaned on stocks, bonds, bullion, 
bills of exchange, or promissory notes are received for discount or for 
sale."</p></blockquote>
<p>It must be conceded that, unless otherwise exempt, the plaintiff comes under 
the terms and provisions of that section.</p>
<p>The fact that one person may not have paid or been required to pay his taxes 
does not exempt another from the payment of his legal taxes, or legally entitle 
him to a refund of any taxes which he has paid.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, plaintiff's cause of action is founded upon an alleged 
breach of contract, and the breach, if any, which plaintiff alleges, did not 
exist at the time the plaintiff paid the taxes, which it now seeks to 
recover.</p>
<p>Again, it appears from the stipulation of facts that after this action was 
commenced, and on the 15th day of July, 1922, the Philippine National Bank, 
under protest, paid the defendant the sum of P519,043.03 as taxes upon its 
circulation, and that on the 2d of August, 1922, it paid the further sum of 
P129,760.77, the amount of the 25 per cent surcharge upon such taxes. Although 
such taxes were paid under protest in and by which the legal rights, if any, of 
the Philippine National Bank were fully protected, the fact remains that the 
defendant demanded the payment of such taxes from that bank, and that it paid 
such taxes, and that in the absence of proof or allegation, this court has no 
right to assume that the demand for payment was not made in good faith, or that 
it was not founded upon a legal right.</p>
<p>Under this view, it is not necessary to decide the question as to whether the 
plaintiff and the Philippine National Bank are of a "similar type" or operated 
"under similar conditions."</p>
<p>From what has been said, it follows that the judgment of the lower court must 
be affirmed. Neither party to recover costs. So ordered.</p><i>Malcolm, 
Avanceña, Villamor,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Johnson,

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em></div>
<p><strong>STREET, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the clause in the charter of the Bank of the 
Philipine Islands to the effect that no law shall be made or enforced imposing a 
charge or taxation upon said bank which shall not apply equally to other banks 
of a similar type operating under similar conditions has all the sanctity of a 
contract or solemn treaty; and, so far as this clause is concerned, I am of the 
opinion that the Philippine National Bank is a bank of similar type to that of 
the Bank of the Philippine Islands and operating under similar conditions. From 
this it must follow that any subsequent law passed by the Philippine 
Legislature, conferring upon the Philippine National Bank the privilege of 
issuing tax-exempt notes for circulation as money, must have the effect of 
exonerating the Bank of the Philippine Islands from the burden of paying taxes 
upon its circulating notes to the same extent.</p>If therefore the Bank of the 
Philippine Islands were to issue circulating notes against gold coin of the 
United States held by the bank for no other purpose than their redemption, such 
notes would undoubtedly be tax-exempt. But it does not appear that the Bank of 
the Philippine Islands has issued any such notes. On the contrary it is to be 
assumed that the circulating notes upon which the appellant bank has been taxed 
were issued against its capital or against securities deposited with the 
Treasurer of the Philippine Islands as contemplated in Article XXIV of its 
Charter (Act No. 1790). The circumstance that the Philippine National Bank has 
been granted the privilege of issuing tax-exempt notes against gold coin held in 
deposit upon trust for their redemption does not exonerate the appellant bank 
wholly from tax liability upon all of its issue but only from tax liability upon 
such notes as might be issued against gold coin similarly held. The charter 
provision upon which the appellant bank relies secures to it equal privileges 
only, not better privileges than those conferred upon other banks.</div>
