				<H3>FRANCISCO SORIANO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JUAN RAMIREZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For the proper understanding of this case, it should be borne in mind that 
the Court of First Instance of Surigao, on June 30, 1922, rendered a decision in 
an action for the recovery of a certain sum of money, absolving the defendant 
from the complaint. The appellant was duly notified of said judgment on July 
12th, and thereupon filed a motion for new trial dated in Manila on the 12th, 
and received in Surigao on the 22d, of the said month of July. Said motion for 
new trial reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned plaintiff being dissatisfied with the decision of the court 
rendered in this case, of which he was notified in Manila on June 12, 1922, 
hereby moves for a new trial on the following ground:</p>
<p>"That the evidence does not justify the decision of the court, and the said 
decision is contrary to the facts and the law.</p>
<p>"Manila, for Surigao, July 14, 1922.</p>

<p>This motion having been denied by the court on July 26th, the appellant took 
due and timely exception to such ruling, and announced his intention to perfect 
a bill of exceptions, which he did on July 31st, the bill of exceptions 
presented by him having been approved by the court on the 19th of following 
August.</p>
<p>On September 2, 1922, the docket fee was paid, and the necessary amount of 
money for the printing of the bill of exceptions deposited with the clerk's 
office. The bill of exceptions was printed on September 9th, and appellant and 
appellee received the required number of copies thereof on October 2d and 11th, 
respectively.</p>
<p>The defendant-appellee received the required number of copies of appellant's 
brief on October 25th, and, on November 14th, filed a motion for an extension of 
15 days within which to file his brief. Said extension was to expire on December 
9th of the same year. On December 11th a motion dated December 3d was filed in 
this court asking for the dismissal of the appeal. The court, by a resolution 
dated December 22, granted the motion <i>ex parte</i>, dismissing the appeal 
interposed by the plaintiff. On January 2, 1923, the plaintiff filed a motion 
for the reconsideration of the preceding resolution, and this is the motion now 
before us.</p>
<p>It should be noted that no question was raised by the appellee in the Court 
of First Instance as to the alleged irregularity in the filing of the motion for 
new trial; nor was any objection made by him to the approval of the bill of 
exceptions; nor was the motion for the dismissal of the appeal filed in this 
court until after he had received the copies of the bill of exceptions and of 
appellant's brief, and after the expiration of the extension applied for by him 
for the filing of his brief.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, after hearing the arguments made by both parties, 
the doctrine laid down by this court, among other cases, in that of Vergara 
<i>vs</i>. Laciapag (28 Phil., 439, 442), may be applied, wherein, the court 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have frequently decided that no objection to the procedure in the lower 
court will be considered here unless an objection or exception was made or taken 
in the lower court. The only exception to this rule is one where the 
jurisdiction of the lower court is involved. The defendant-appellant not having 
laid a foundation for his first assignment of error it cannot be considered 
here. (Andrews <i>vs</i>. Morente, 9 Phil., 634; Guerrero <i>vs</i>. Singson, 19 
Phil., 122.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>It cannot be argued that as, in the motion for new trial now in question, the 
date and place of its hearing were not stated, the trial court had no 
jurisdiction to entertain said motion, for the case was under its control and it 
could pass upon it, as is expressly provided in section 146 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure.</p>
<p>Under article 9 of the Rules of the Courts of First Instance, when no other 
provision is made by law, no action shall be taken on any motions or 
applications unless it appears that the adverse party had notice thereof three 
days before the time set for the hearing thereof.</p>
<p>Article 10 provides the manner in which notices of motions should be given, 
and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All notices of motions shall be in writing, and shall state generally the 
nature and grounds of the motion and when and where it will be heard. They shall 
be accompanied with copies of the affidavits and other papers on which the 
motion is based. No demurrer or motion shall be accepted for filing without 
proof of notice thereof having been given the adverse party, at least three days 
in advance, that same will be submitted on the next motion day or on a date 
specifically designated by the court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Could the lower court validly pass upon said motion, as it did, 
notwithstanding that the notice given the appellee by the appellant did not 
state the date and place of hearing? An answer in the negative would be 
inevitable if the general provisions alone of these two articles of the Rules 
are considered, but article 9 contains an exception which is a recognition of 
the principle that the provisions of the statute must prevail over those of the 
Rules. Under said article 9, no action shall be taken upon any motion if the 
formalities required by the Rules have not been complied with, unless the law 
provides otherwise.</p>
<p>And section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure expressly provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The application shall be made by motion in writing, stating the ground 
therefor, of which the adverse party shall have such reasonable notice as the 
judge may direct. When the application is made for a cause mentioned in the 
first or second subdivisions of the last section (referring to accident, 
surprise which could not have been guarded against, or newly discovered 
evidence) it must be made upon affidavits, and counter affidavits from the 
adverse party may likewise be received.</p>
<p>"The overruling or granting of a motion for a new trial shall not be a ground 
of exception, but shall be deemed to have been an act of discretion on the part 
of the judge, within the meaning of the second sentence of section one hundred 
and forty-one. If, however, the motion for a new trial was made on the ground 
that the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision, an exception may be 
taken to the order overruling such motion, and such exception may be reviewed by 
the Supreme Court as in other cases."</p></blockquote>
<p>A comparison of the language of section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
with the phraseology of articles 9 and 10 of the Rules in regard to serving 
notice of motion on the adverse party, will show that while the Rules make it 
the duty of the party filing the motion to give the adverse party a three days' 
previous notice, stating the date and place of the hearing of the motion, the 
Code of Civil Procedure leaves it to the discretion of the judge to order the 
notification to the adverse party of a motion like that under discussion.</p>
<p>What the Code requires of the movant is that the motion for new trial be made 
in writing, stating the grounds therefor. And if the motion is on the ground of 
accident, or surprise which could not have been guarded against, or newly 
discovered evidence, it must be proved by affidavits.</p>
<p>The appellant made his motion in writing and on the ground that the evidence 
did not justify the judgment, and gave notice thereof to the adverse party, 
although without stating the date and place of hearing. The appellant has 
complied with the requirement of the law. It became a matter of discretion on 
the part of the judge to order the giving of notice of the hearing of the motion 
to the adverse party, if he deemed it fit. But the judge denied the motion, and 
considered it unnecessary to give any notice. Such an action of the trial court 
is, in our opinion, in accordance with the provision of article 146 above 
quoted. Indeed, if the motion was to be denied, we do not see the necessity of 
giving any notice of the hearing of the same, there being no right of the 
appellee to be prejudiced by the denial of said motion. If the trial court were 
disposed to grant the motion for new trial, then it would have been necessary to 
notify the adverse party and to hear whatever objection he might have to the 
granting of new trial.</p>
<p>In reaching this conclusion, we are not unmindful of the decision rendered by 
this court in the case of Manakil and Tison <i>vs</i>. Revilla and Tuaño (42 
Phil., 81), dismissing the complaint in an application for <i>mandamus</i> to 
compel the Court of First Instance of Pampanga to pass upon a motion for new 
trial similar to the one now in question.</p>
<p>In that case a motion for new trial was filed five days after the notice of 
the judgment; that is, on the 12th of April, 1921. The movants gave notice to 
the adverse party, but without designating the date and place of the hearing of 
said motion, which was submitted to the trial court without argument. No action 
was taken by the trial court on this motion, nor did the movants urge that court 
to act within the legal period. Forty days after the notice of the judgment, 
that is, on the 23d of May, 1921, the movants asked that that motion be taken up 
for decision, and that to that end a date and place of hearing be designated; 
whereupon the court below denied the motion on the ground that it had been filed 
outside of the legal period of thirty days and after the judgment had become 
final.</p>
<p>This is what gave rise to the petition for <i>mandamus</i>, in which the 
respondent demurred to the complaint on the ground that the application was 
improper and that the facts therein alleged did not constitute a cause of 
action. The question at issue in that case was whether or not <i>mandamus</i> 
lay to compel the judge to admit a motion for new trial based on the 
insufficiency of evidence, filed thirty days after notice of judgment; and this 
was the question decided by this court in the negative when it sustained the 
demurrer to the complaint.</p>
<p>The fact of the motion lacking the formalities required by the Rules, as it 
was filed on the 12th of April, 1921, was not necessarily involved in the case 
of <i>mandamus</i>, since the petitioners had consented to the court passing 
upon the motion as of the 23d of May, whereby his contention was reduced to the 
proposition that <i>mandamus</i> should issue to compel the lower court to admit 
the motion for new trial on the ground of insufficiency of evidence even though 
it was filed after the lapse of the legal period.</p>
<p>In the case of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Lipa <i>vs</i>. Municipality of 
Unisan, p. 866, <i>post</i>, the appellant assigned as one of the errors 
committed by the trial court, its failure to consider and pass upon the motion, 
for new trial filed by the said appellant. In that case the trial court rendered 
judgment on April 19, 1917, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint. On the 21st of 
the same month the plaintiff filed a motion in writing, taking exception to the 
judgment and asking, at the same time, for the reopening of the case and the 
holding of a new trial on the ground that the evidence did not justify the 
decision and that the judgment was contrary to law. On the same day, April 21, 
1917, he sent a copy of his motion to the defendant, but without having seated 
therein the date and place of its hearing. The trial court took no action on 
said motion. And on March 2, 1918, that is, more than ten months thereafter, the 
attorneys for the plaintiff notified the defendant in writing that on the 9th 
instant they would move the court to hear and determine the motion for new trial 
of April 21, 1917. Hearing having been held on the date fixed for the purpose, 
the trial court, by an order dated the 14th day of the said month of March, 
denied the petition to consider and decide the motion for new trial filed April 
21, 1917.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances it is evident that the plaintiff having failed to 
urge the hearing of his motion within the legal period, he could not lawfully 
ask that same be taken up for decision ten months after the notice of judgment. 
And this is the reason why the assignment of error made by the appellant was 
held by this court not to be well founded.</p>
<p>We believe that the doctrines laid down in the aforesaid two cases on the 
specific questions submitted to the court for decision do not apply to the 
instant case, in which a motion for new trial was filed within the legal period, 
notice of the same having been given to the adverse party, though without 
designating the date and place of hearing, the court having passed upon the 
motion by denying it.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we find that in the instant case the trial court 
had jurisdiction to pass upon the motion of the appellant under section 146 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure; wherefore the resolution of December 29, 1922, 
should be set aside, the cause reinstated and the appellee granted the first 
extension of fifteen days applied for within which to file his brief, the said 
period to be computed from the date of notice of this decision. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns,</i> and 
<i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Avanceña, J.,</i> concurs in the 
result.</div>
