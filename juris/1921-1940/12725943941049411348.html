				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Amzi B. Kelly, a member of the Philippine Bar, has made application in this 
court for the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus to set at liberty sixteen 
young Russians, members of the crew of a fleet of boats now at anchor within the 
jurisdiction of the Philippine Islands. The return of the Attorney-General 
states that these Russian subjects are confined in Bilibid Prison, at the 
request of the Admiral of the Russian ships, and pursuant to the orders of the 
Governor-General. The Attorney-General further states that the said persons do 
not desire that any writ of habeas corpus be issued in their behalf, and accept 
and abide by the order of the Governor-General pending such disposition as it is 
the wish of the Chief Executive to make in their respective cases. This last 
statement is supported by an affidavit subscribed and sworn to by the sixteen 
Russians before the Director of Prisons.
<p>The writ of habeas corpus may be prosecuted by a person unlawfully imprisoned 
or restrained of his liberty, or by some person in his behalf. Where the 
application is made in the prisoner's behalf by a third person, and where the 
prisoner repudiates the action taken, the writ will be denied. The writ of 
habeas corpus ought not to issue if the restraint is voluntary because 
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Petition denied without costs. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, 
Avance√±a, Ostrand, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
