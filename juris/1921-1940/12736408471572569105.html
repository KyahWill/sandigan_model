<p>Plaintiff alleges that it is a domestic corporation, with its principal place 
of business in the City of Manila; that the defendant is a municipal 
corporation, chartered under the laws of the Philippine Islands; that plaintiff 
is a lessee from the Government of the Philippine Islands of a certain parcel of 
land in the City of Manila, known as block 73 of the Port Area, under a lease, 
which is attached to, and made a part of, the complaint; that for taxation 
purposes for the year 1921, the land was assessed by the city assessor in the 
sum of P57,973, upon which a tax of 1½ per cent was levied, amounting to 
P869.60. Plaintiff paid the tax under duress and protest, and to avoid fines, 
penalties and forfeitures; that the land in question is the property of the 
Government of the Philippine Islands, and is not subject to land tax. Like 
allegations are made for the year 1922, and plaintiff prays for judgment against 
the city for P1,739.20, with legal interest and costs.</p>
<p>The land is described as situate in the City of Manila, and—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Known as lot No. 73, of reclamation No. 1, Manila Harbor, containing an area 
of five thousand seven hundred ninety-seven and thirty-one hundredth (5,797.31) 
square meters, as shown on the new plan of said reclamation prepared under the 
direction of the Director of Lands, which plan is now on file in the Bureau of 
Lands, Manila."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lease is for a full term of ninety-nine years at a yearly rental of 3 per 
cent of the appraised value of the land, to be paid semiannually in advance. It 
also provides for a new appraisal within five years after the execution of the 
lease, or any time in the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources.</p>
<p>The defendant filed a demurrer to the complaint upon the ground that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The facts alleged in the complaint do not constitute any cause of action 
against the defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court sustained the demurrer, and dismissed the complaint, without 
costs, from which the plaintiff appeals, contending that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court erred in finding that the plaintiff is liable for taxes imposed 
upon the land leased to it by the Government, the owner of the land.</p>
<p>"The court erred in not finding that the complaint states a cause of action 
for the recovery of taxes illegally collected, and in sustaining the defendant's 
demurrer without leave to amend."</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The appellant cites and relies upon section 344 of the Administrative Code, 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Property exempt from tax</i>.—The exemptions shall be as follows:</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) Property owned by the United States of America, the Government of 
the Philippine Islands, or by any province or municipality in the Philippine 
Islands."</p></blockquote>
<p>It also cites section 343 of the Administrative Code, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Incidence of real-property tax</i>.—In those parts of the Philippine 
Islands comprised in regularly organized municipalities situated elsewhere than 
in the Department of Mindanao and Sulu there shall be levied, assessed, and 
collected, an annual ad valorem tax on real property, including land, buildings 
and other improvements not hereinafter specifically exempted."</p></blockquote>
<p>In its brief a number of authorities are cited in substance and to the effect 
that "while the title remains in the government, public lands are not subject to 
state taxation, and tax sales and deeds thereof are void," and that "the 
property of a municipal corporation is not liable for taxation for municipal 
purposes. It cannot tax its own property." And quotes at length from a decision 
of the Supreme Court of California. (167 Cal., 425.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>)</p>
<p>It is conceded that the title to the land is in the Government of the 
Philippine Islands, and that the plaintiff applied for, took and accepted, the 
lease in question under Act No. 1654 of the Philippine Commission.</p>
<p>Subdivision (<i>b</i>) of section 2, among other things, recites that upon 
the completion of the plats and plans the Governor-General shall give notice to 
the public that any portion thereof, which had been made or reclaimed and which 
is not needed for public purposes, will be leased for commercial and business 
purposes, and that upon the receipt of an application for a lease, the 
Governor-General shall specify the land and give notice by public advertisement 
that an application has been made, and that the Government will lease the 
described lot or block for commercial and business purposes, such leases to run 
for a period of ninety-nine years at a rental of 3 per cent per annum of the 
appraised value, etc., and subdivision (<i>c</i>) provides for an appeal to the 
Court of First Instance from any reappraisal which may not be satisfactory to 
the tenant, and a further appeal by either party to the Supreme Court. 
Subdivision (<i>d</i>) provides that the improvements shall be made subject to 
the approval of the consulting architect, and that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * In case of failure to make such improvements within the time 
prescribed by the lease or to comply with any or all of the terms and conditions 
of said lease the same shall thereupon be forfeited, and that all improvements 
made on the leased property shall vest in and become the property of the 
Government of the Philippine Islands. * * *</p>
<p>"Every such lease shall also contain a provision for the payment of the tax 
or taxes levied on said land or improvements and providing that upon the failure 
of the lessee to pay any such tax or taxes or any part thereof the lease shall 
forthwith cease and determine."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 4 of the Act provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All lands leased under the provisions of the foregoing sections of this Act, 
and all improvements thereon, shall be subject to local taxation against the 
lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, or assigns, to the 
same extent as if such lessees, their heirs, executors, administrators, 
successors, or assigns, were the owners of both land and 
improvements."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon the facts in them stated, the authorities cited by the appellant are 
good law, but no authority is cited founded upon the facts shown in this 
record.</p>
<p>Act No. 1654 specifically provides for the payment of the stipulated rental, 
and that, in addition thereto and as a part thereof, the lease itself shall also 
contain a provision for the payment of the tax or taxes levied on the land or 
improvements, and that upon the failure of the lessee to pay any of such tax or 
taxes, "the lease shall forthwith cease and determine." In other words, the 
payment of the taxes upon the land is one of the primary considerations which 
enters into, and becomes a part of, the lease. In the absence of the provision 
for the payment of the taxes in question, the Government would not have any 
legal right or authority to make the lease in question. When the plaintiff 
applied for, and obtained, its lease, the payment of the taxes was one of the 
considerations which entered into the execution of the lease, and one of the 
conditions precedent to the obtaining of the lease. Legally speaking, the amount 
of the taxes, which plaintiff agreed to pay, is a part of the stipulated rental. 
That is to say, as one of the primary considerations for the execution of the 
lease, the plaintiff not only covenants and agrees to pay as rental "3 per cent 
per annum of the appraised value of the parcel of land leased," but, in addition 
thereto, and as a part of the lease, it further covenants and agrees to pay "the 
tax or taxes on said land or improvements."</p>
<p>Section 4 of the Act above quoted expressly provides that all lands leased 
under the provisions of the Act, and all improvements thereon, shall be subject 
to local taxation "to the same extent as if such lessees, their heirs, 
executors, administrators, successors, or assigns, were the owners of both land 
and improvements." In other words, by the terms of the Act, and the lease 
itself, the plaintiff has stipulated that, for the purpose of taxation, it is 
the owner of both the land and improvements. Having signed and entered under the 
lease, the plaintiff is estopped to claim or assert that it is not liable for 
the taxes in question. This is further evidenced by the fact that the lease also 
recites that for any failure or neglect to pay the taxes as they mature, "the 
lease shall forthwith cease and determine."</p>
<p>In other words, the covenant to pay the taxes is one of the primary 
considerations for which the Government executed and the plaintiff obtained the 
lease, and the covenant to pay the taxes is one of the express conditions by 
which the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the land, and is a condition 
precedent to the right of possession. In other words, the failure to pay any of 
the taxes as stipulated in the lease would operate to terminate the lease and 
oust the plaintiff from its possession of the land.</p>
<p>In legal effect, the Government said to the plaintiff that it would lease it 
the land at a stipulated rental, but in addition thereto, and as a part thereof, 
and as one of the considerations for such leasing, the plaintiff should further 
covenant and agree that, for the purpose of taxation, it is the owner of the 
land, and that it will pay all taxes on the land as they mature, and that for 
any failure or neglect to pay them, the Government could terminate the lease and 
oust the plaintiff from its possession. The plaintiff, having accepted the 
proposition, is bound by the terms and provisions of the lease and the covenants 
which it made in the lease.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed, without costs to either party.
