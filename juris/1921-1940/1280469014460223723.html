				<BR><BR><p align="justify">These are two original actions, one for mandamus and
 the other for certiorari, instituted by Nemesio Monteverde and others 
against the Honorables Delfin Jaranilla and Sabino Padilla, Judges of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila, and others, wherein it is prayed,
 in the first, that an order be issued directing the respondent Judge 
Delfln Jaranilla to immediately act upon the bill of exceptions filed by
 the petitioners on May 24, 1934, and submitted for approval in the same
 case on June 9, 1934, and to approve and certify the same to this 
court; and, in the second, it is prayed that, after proper proceedings, 
an order be issued declaring the judgment by default of January 6, 1934,
 entered by Judge Delfin Jaranilla in civil case No. 45629 of the Court 
of First Instance of Manila, as well as the writs of execution on said 
judgment dated May 17 and June 6, 1934, null and of no effect, in the 
meantime issuing the corresponding writ of preliminary injunction.
</p><p align="justify"> The facts pertinent to and necessary for the 
solution of the questions raised in these actions are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify"> On December 5, 1933, the respondent Lourdes Catala 
brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the 
herein petitioners Nemesio Monteverde and others, for the recovery of 
the sum of ?20,000, plus damages, said action being civil case No. 
45629.</p>
<p align="justify"> On December 8, 1933, upon motion ex parte and the 
filing of a bond in the amount of P2,000 by the plaintiff and 
respondent, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued a writ of 
attachment against the property of the defendants in said case and the 
herein petitioners Nemesio Monteverde and others.</p>
<p align="justify"> On December 23, 1933, said defendants and 
petitioners filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a pleading 
entitled "Special Appearance and Motion to Dissolve Writ of Attachment",
 in which, without waiving their right to enter a general appearance and
 answer the complaint, they made of record their special appearance for 
the purpose of praying, as they in fact prayed, for the dissolution of 
the attachment issued by said court, without expressly impugning its 
jurisdiction over their persons, and, to this end, they offered to file a
 bond with sufficient sureties.</p>
<p align="justify"> On December 29, 1933, the Honorable Judge Delfin 
Jaranilla entered an order granting the motion of the defendants and 
petitioners, and fixing the amount of the bond for the dissolution of 
the attachment at P20,000.</p>
<p align="justify"> Under date of January 3, 1934, the plaintiff therein
 and the herein respondent Lourdes Catala, through her attorney, filed a
 motion ex parte wherein it was prayed that the defendant petitioners be
 declared in default for failure to interpose either a demurrer or an 
answer to the complaint within the reglementary period of ten days from 
the date of their appearance.</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 5, 1934, the respondent Judge, Hon. 
Delfin Jaranilla, granting said motion ex parte, issued an order 
declaring the defendants and petitioners in default and authorizing said
 plaintiff and respondent to 'present her proof in support of her 
complaint.</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 6, 1934, the defendants-petitioners filed
 a verified motion in which it was prayed that they be relieved from the
 effects of the order of default of January 5, 1934, and that they be 
allowed to file their answer and counterclaim within a just and 
reasonable period which the court might fix, the grounds being the 
following: (1) Their appearance being special, it did not have the 
effect of a general appearance and, consequently, they had forty days 
within which to enter a general appearance; (2) that they were not able 
to file either a demurrer or an answer to the complaint, because their 
attorneys, who were in Manila, received from them from Davao the copy of
 said complaint and other papers pertinent to the case only on January 
3, 1934; (3) that they had a good defense, in that their delay in 
complying with what was agreed in the contract, which is the basis of 
the complaint, was due to the delay of the Bureau of Lands and the 
General Land Registration Office and to other circumstances not subject 
to their will; (4) that their liability has been wiped out by the letter
 of Jose Martinez, one of the contracting parties; (5) that the deed of 
transfer has already been executed by the defendantspetitioners; and (6)
 that the plaintiff-respondent has been and is in possession of the land
 from the time the contract was executed and has enjoyed the fruits 
thereof.</p>
<p align="justify"> On the same date, January 6,1934, the respondent 
Judge, Hon. Delfin Jaranilla, without previous notice to the 
defendants-petitioners, proceeded to the trial of the case and entered 
judgment by default, the dispositive part of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Therefore, judgment is entered sentencing the 
defendants Nemesio Monteverde, Santiago Matute, in his capacity as 
guardian of Candelaria Monteverde, Milagros Monteverde, Leon A. Garcia, 
Vicenta Monteverde and Vicente A. Tiongko to pay jointly and severally 
to the plaintiff the sum of P20,000, with legal interest from the date 
of the filing of the complaint, or from December 8, 1933, until fully 
paid, and the costs of the action. So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> On January 10, 1934, the defendants-petitioners, 
through their attorneys, were notified of said judgment by default, and,
 on January 11, 1934, they filed an urgent verified motion praying that 
they be relieved from the effects of said judgment by default of January
 6, 1934, and that the case be reopened,, allowing them to file a 
demurrer or an answer and counterclaim within a just and reasonable 
period to be fixed by the court.</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 25, 1934, before the expiration of the 
forty days from December 6, 1933, the date the defendants were summoned 
in Davao, Davao, the defendants-petitioners Leon A. Garcia and Nemesio 
Monteverde, through their attorneys, filed an answer and counterclaim, 
and the other defendants-petitioners Milagros Monteverde, Vicenta 
Monteverde, Vicente A. Tiongko and Santiago Matute, the latter as 
guardian of the minor Candelaria Monteverde, interposed a demurrer to 
the complaint.</p>
<p align="justify"> The respondent Judge, Hon. Delfin Jaranilla, on 
April 21, 1934, entered an order denying the motion of the 
defendants-petitioners in which it wa3 prayed that the judgment by 
default of January 6, 1934, be vacated.</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 8, 1934, the defendants-petitioners filed a 
motion for reconsideration of the order of the respondent Judge, Hon. 
Delfin Jaranilla, of April 21, 1934, copy of which was received by them 
on April 25, 1934, denying their motion in which they asked to be 
relieved from the judgment by default and ordering that their demurrer, 
answer and counterclaim be stricken out.</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 12,1934, the plaintiff-respondent Lourdes 
Catala, through her attorneys, objected to the motion for 
reconsideration filed by the defendants-petitioners and prayed for its 
dismissal and the issuance of a writ of execution.</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 12, 1934, the respondent Judge, Hon. Sabino 
Padilla, denied the motion for reconsideration filed by the 
defendants-petitioners, as well as the motion filed by the 
plaintiff-respondent for the issuance of a writ of execution of the 
judgment by default.</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 16,1934, the defendants and petitioners 
excepted to said order of April 21, 1934, denying the two verified 
motions wherein it was prayed that they be relieved from the effects of 
the order of default and judgment by default dated January 5 and 6, 
1934, respectively, and at the same time they announced their intention 
to appeal to this court from said orders of April 21, and May 12,1934.</p>
<p align="justify"> Without previous notice, the respondent Judge, Hon. 
Sabino Padilla, on May 17, 1934, granted the motion for the issuance of a
 writ of execution which had already been denied by order of May 12, 
1934.</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 24, 1934, the defendants and petitioners 
submitted to the trial court, then presided over by the respondent 
Judge, Hon. Sabino Padilla, the corresponding bill of exceptions for his
 approval.</p>
<p align="justify"> On May 29, 1934, the respondent Judge, Hon. Sabino 
Padilla, denied the motion of the defendants-petitioners in which they 
asked for the stay of execution of the order of May 17, 1934, 
notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal from the orders of April 21 
and May 12, 1934, and the failure to allege or prove the existence of 
any special ground for the execution of the judgment.</p>
<p align="justify"> On June 6, 1934, without previous notice to the 
parties, another writ of execution addressed to special sheriff S. H. 
Soriano was issued in substitution for the writ of execution issued on 
May 17, 1934.</p>
<p align="justify"> On June 19, 1934, pending the approval of the bill 
of exceptions presented by the defendants and petitioners, the latter 
instituted in this court the present petition for certiorari with 
preliminary injunction, which was allowed, and on June 20, 1934, the 
following order was entered:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of 
certiorari with preliminary injunction filed in the above entitled case,
 praying that the order of May 17, 1934, of the respondent judge as well
 as the writs of execution issued in accordance therewith be declared 
null and void for lack of jurisdiction, and that pending these 
proceedings, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued restraining the 
respondents from executing the judgment rendered in civil case No. 45629
 of the Court of First Instance of Manila (Lourdes Catala <em><em>vs.</em></em>
 Monteverde et al.), the respondents are hereby required to answer (not 
to demur to) said petition within ten days from receipt of a copy 
thereof; and upon the filing of a bond in the sum of P200, let a writ of
 preliminary injunction be issued restraining the respondents from 
executing said judgment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In compliance with the foregoing order, the 
respondent Judge, Hon. Delfin Jaranilla, on June 21, 1934, issued the 
following order:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "In view of the order entered by the Supreme Court
 in the case G. R. No. 41984, entitled Nemesio Monteverde et al. <em>vs.</em>
 The Hon. Delfin Jaranilla et al., which order affects the approval or 
disapproval of the bill of exceptions submitted in this case on June 9, 
1934, the clerk of this court is instructed to resubmit said bill to the
 undersigned after the above entitled case has been finally disposed of 
by the Supreme Court."</p>
  <p align="justify"> In view of the proceedings above set forth, we 
shall first consider the petition for mandamus filed by the petitioners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> We have seen that the defendants in the civil case 
referred to, and the petitioners herein, filed on May 8, 1934, a motion 
for reconsideration of the order of April 21, 1934. denying their 
petition to set aside the judgment by default dated January 6, 1934, of 
which order of denial they were notified on April 25, 1934, that is, 
thirteen days after notification. Inasmuch as said order of denial is 
final and appealable (Philippine Manufacturing Co. <em>vs.</em> 
Imperial, 47 Phil., 810; Riera <em>vs.</em> Palmaroli, 40 Phil., 105; 
Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs.</em> Arzadon, 20 Phil., 452; Mejia <em>vs.</em>
 Alimorong, 4 Phil., 572), the defendants and petitioners had thirty 
days within which to file a motion for new trial. Although said motion 
for reconsideration cannot legally be considered as a motion for new 
trial, not being based upon any of the grounds enumerated in section 145
 of Act No. 190, and, therefore, did not suspend the running of the 
thirty days (Pascua <em>vs.</em> Ocampo, 59 Phil., 48), the exception 
and notice of appeal filed by them on May 16, J.934, or twentyone days 
after having received, on April 25, 1934, notice of said order denying 
the motion in which it was prayed that they be relieved from the effects
 of the judgment by default of January 6,1934, was within the period of 
thirty days and supplied the motion for new trial based on the ground 
that the judgment was against the law, and the bill of exceptions having
 been filed on May 24, 1934, or after eight days, its filing was within 
the ten days fixed by the decisions of this court, beginning from the 
date of notice of intention to appeal. (Layda <em>vs.</em> Legazpi, 39 
Phil., 83; Santiago <em>vs.</em> Manuel and Tumale, 39 Phil., 869; Behn,
 Meyer &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Antholtz, 51 Phil., 796; Lim <em>vs.</em> 
Singian and Soler, 37 Phil., 817.)</p>
<p align="justify"> Passing now to the petition for certiorari, the 
first step in which the respondent Judge, Hon. Delfin Jaranilla, is 
alleged by the petitioners to have acted without jurisdiction, is the 
holding of the trial upon the merits of civil case No. 45629, in which 
the herein respondent Lourdes Catala was plaintiff and the herein 
petitioners Nemesio Monteverde and others were defendants, for failure 
of said defendants to be notified of the trial referred to or to have an
 opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses for the plaintiff, reliance 
being placed upon the rule enunciated by this court in the case of De 
Castro <em>vs.</em> Director of Lands (31 Phil., 461), which holds as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "1. APPEARANCE; RIGHT TO NOTICE OP SUBSEQUENT 
PROCEEDINGS.—It is a well established rule in ordinary actions that, 
when the defendant has once appeared and answered, he has a right to be 
notified of every subsequent motion or step taken by the parties and 
every order or decree made by the court. The defendant having once 
appeared has an absolute right to be present, if he so desires, whenever
 any action is taken affecting his rights."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> It is to be noted that the doctrine above cited 
holds that the defendant has a right to be notified of all subsequent 
motions or all steps taken by the parties, and of all orders entered by 
the court, and to be present, if he so desires, in any action taken 
which may affect his rights, so long as said defendant has appeared and 
answered.</p>
<p align="justify"> In the case before us, while the defendants entered a
 special appearance, which amounted to a general appearance (Marquez Lim
 Cay <em>vs.</em> Del Rosario, 55 Phil., 962), nevertheless they did not
 file an answer within the reglementary period, and having been declared
 in default for failure to comply with the last mentioned legal 
requirement, in accordance with the provisions of section 128 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, they had no right to be notified of the motion 
asking that they be declared in default or, consequently, of the trial 
on default. (34 Corpus Juris, sec. 390; 189, sec. 409; Duran <em>vs.</em>
 Arboleda, 20 Phil., 253; Inchausti &amp; Co, <em>vs.</em> De Leon, 24 
Phil., 224; Dougherty <em>vs.</em> Evangelista, 7 Phil., 37.)</p>
<p align="justify"> It may therefore be seen that, by provision of law 
and jurisprudence, the defendants in that case, and the petitioners in 
the present action, were not entitled to be notified of the plaintiff's 
motion in said case praying that they be declared in default or of the 
trial upon the merits after default.</p>
<p align="justify"> The second action in which the respondent Judge, 
Hon. Sabino Padilla, is claimed by the petitioners to have exceeded his 
jurisdiction, is in ordering the execution of the judgment by default 
pending the perfecting of the appeal against the order denying the 
motion for annulling the judgment by default referred to, and without 
any showing that there were special grounds therefor. Said order being 
on appeal, and the propriety or impropriety of the judgment by default 
being in question, the respondent Judge, Hon. Sabino Padilla, committed 
an abuse of discretion in ordering the issuance of the writ of execution
 without previous notice to the parties and without any showing that 
there existed a special reason therefor, in conformity with the 
provisions of section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Gamay <em>vs.</em>
 Gutierrez David, 48 Phil., 768), and, inasmuch as there is no other 
remedy, more speedy and effective, nor even an appeal, to prevent the 
immediate execution of the judgment which is sought to be annulled, 
certiorari is the proper remedy (sec. 217, Code of Civ. Proc.).</p>
<p align="justify"> In short, therefore, it is proper to vacate the 
order of the respondent Judge, Hon. Sabino Padilla, in which the 
execution is ordered of the judgment by default, which the 
defendants-petitioners sought to annul.</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of 
the Opinion and so hold: (1) That a special appearance in which the 
jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant fft not 
expressly impugned, and in which the dissolution of an order of 
attachment is asked upon the filing of a bond, Is equivalent to a 
general appearance (4 Corpus Juris, 1331; Vergel de Dios <em>vs.</em> 
Abucay Plantation Co., G. R. No. 39830, 59 Phil., 924; Marquez Lim Cay <em>vs.</em>
 Del Rosario, 55 Phil., 962); (2) that the defendant who, after entering
 his appearance in the action, does not interpose either a demurrer or 
an answer within the reglementary period, is declared in default and is 
not entitled to notification of a motion praying that he be declared in 
default, in conformity with the provisions of section 128 of the Code of
 Civil Procedure, or of the trial of the case upon the merits after 
default (34 Corpus Juris, 176; Duran <em>vs.</em> Arboleda, 20 Phil., 
253; Inchausti &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> De Leon, 24 Phil., 224; Dougherty <em>vs.</em>
 Evangelista, 7 Phil., 37); (3) that the court which orders the 
execution of a judgment by default during the pendency of the perfecting
 of the appeal taken against the order denying the motion in which it is
 prayed that said judgment by default be annulled, acts in excess of 
jurisdiction; (4) that the court abuses its discretion in ordering the 
execution of a judgment from which an appeal is pending, without 
previous notice to the adverse party and there being no special ground 
therefor; and, (5) that an order denying a motion for the annulment of a
 judgment by default in accordance with the provision of section 113 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, is final and appealable. (Philippine 
Manufacturing Co. <em>vs.</em> Imperial, 47 Phil., 810; Riera <em>vs.</em>
 Palmaroli, 40 Phil., 105; Manila Railroad Co. <em>vs.</em> Arzadon, 20 
Phil., 452; Mejia <em>vs.</em> Alimorong, 4 Phil., 572.)</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, both petitions are granted, and any of 
the respondent judges who may act in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila is ordered to act upon the bill of exceptions filed in civil case
 No. 45629, and the orders of Judge Sabino Padilla of May 17, 1934, and 
June 6, 1934, ordering the execution of the judgment by default of 
January 6, 1934, entered by the respondent Judge, Hon. Delfin Jaranilla,
 are declared null and void, with costs in both actions against the 
respondent Lourdes Catala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
