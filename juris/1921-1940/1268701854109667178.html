				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; appeal has been&nbsp; brought to reverse&nbsp; a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the City&nbsp; of Manila, finding the appellant, Chan Wat, guilty of the offense&nbsp; of theft, and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for one year, eight months, and twenty-one days,<span style="font-style: italic;"> presidio&nbsp; correctional</span>, with&nbsp; the accessories&nbsp; prescribed by law, to&nbsp; indemnify Ang Hong (alias Yu Lay), in the sum of P300,&nbsp; with subsidiary imprisonment in&nbsp; case of insolvency, and requiring him to pay the costs.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears that during the month of January, 1925, the accused for a time maintained Yu Lay, a&nbsp; Chinese woman 20&nbsp; years of&nbsp; age, as&nbsp; his mistress in a house&nbsp; situated&nbsp; on Calle Blumentritt, in the City of Manila.&nbsp; Yu Lay was the owner,of a pair of gold bracelets of the value of P200 and one gold necklace, with a Chinese gold coin attached, of the value of P100.&nbsp;&nbsp; This jewelry she was accustomed to wear on her person.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant, Chan Wat, being desirous of possessing himself of said jewelry, demanded that she should surrender the jewelry to him.&nbsp; This Yu Lay refused to do, and in order to&nbsp; scare the girl into giving&nbsp; it up, he pretended, upon the occasion with which we are here concerned, that a detective was coming to the house and that Yu Lay should place the jewelry in his hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruse proved unavailing, and the&nbsp; appellant thereupon&nbsp; seized Yu Lay's hands and&nbsp; forcibly&nbsp; removed the&nbsp; bracelets, afterwards drawing&nbsp; the gold necklace from over her head.&nbsp; The jewelry thus taken was never afterwards returned to Yu Lay by the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all the facts really material to the case; and that the&nbsp; incident occurred in the manner stated&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; doubted, being clearly proved by the testimony of Yu Lay herself, corroborated by that of a Chinese woman&nbsp; named Uy&nbsp; Si Ga, who was&nbsp; at the time staying in the house where Yu Lay was kept.&nbsp; The accused admits&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; keeping Yu Lay as a mistress about the time stated, and&nbsp; he claims that he bought her in China&nbsp; and was instrumental in procuring her admission into the Philippine Islands upon a&nbsp; false certificate of residence.&nbsp; He&nbsp; denies, however, that he&nbsp; took from Yu Lay any&nbsp; jewelry whatever upon the&nbsp; occasion mentioned.<br><br>The information charges robbery and it is alleged therein that the accused used threats and&nbsp; intimidation against Yu Lay; but&nbsp; the trial court states in the appealed decision that intimidation has&nbsp; not been proved, with which conclusion we agree.&nbsp; It is a plain&nbsp; case of the forcible seizure of jewelry from the person&nbsp; of the owner.<br><br>Upon the foregoing&nbsp; facts the trial court found the appellant guilty of the crime of theft.&nbsp; We&nbsp; are of the opinion, however, that the offense exhibits every element of the crime of robbery, and for this offense the accused-appellant should have been sentenced.&nbsp;&nbsp; In United&nbsp; States <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Blanco (10 Phil., 298), it&nbsp; was held that the seizure and appropriation of a&nbsp; pawn ticket&nbsp; by the accused from the&nbsp; hands of the bearer thereof, who was the lawful owner of the document, with intent to gain, constituted the crime of robbery.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; course&nbsp; of the opinion in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, Mr. Justice&nbsp; Torres,&nbsp; speaking for&nbsp; the&nbsp; court, said:&nbsp; "The substantial difference between&nbsp; robbery and theft&nbsp; consists of the characteristic circumstance&nbsp; that, in the former, violence or intimidation is employed&nbsp; toward the&nbsp; person,&nbsp; or force upon the&nbsp; thing itself; in the latter&nbsp; no such means are employed.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"<br><br>The case before us is fundamentally the same as a criminal case reported from the&nbsp; Supreme Court of Spain under date of February 21, 1873, where it appeared that the appellant&nbsp; had&nbsp; been convicted of theft for the seizure and taking away of a horse against the will of the owner.&nbsp; It appeared&nbsp; that the appellant&nbsp; in that case had demanded the delivery of a&nbsp; horse which was then in the possession of the offended party.&nbsp; The latter having refused to surrender the horse&nbsp; the appellant entered the stable where the horse was kept and&nbsp; carried the animal&nbsp; off against the will of the owner.&nbsp; Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Spain it was held that&nbsp; the appellant&nbsp; had been improperly convicted of theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point upon which the court there discriminated the offense from theft was that the seizure had been effected against the will of the owner.&nbsp; Upon this feature of the case, the court, after comparing the definitions of theft and&nbsp; robbery in&nbsp; the Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; observed that for robbery it is necessary that there should be a taking against the will of the owner and for theft it suffices that consent on the part of the owner is&nbsp; lacking.&nbsp; (8 Crim.&nbsp; Jur., 235.) In the case before us the offense was committed against the manifest will of Yu Lay&nbsp; and&nbsp; not merely without her consent.<br><br>The offense properly falls under paragraph 5 of article 503&nbsp; of the Penal Code, without aggravating or mitigating circumstance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment will therefore be reversed and the accused is&nbsp; hereby sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three years,&nbsp; eight months, and&nbsp; one day, <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio correccional,</span>&nbsp; with&nbsp; the accessory&nbsp; penalties&nbsp; prescribed by law, to&nbsp; indemnify&nbsp; Yu Lay in the amount of P300, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romnaldez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
