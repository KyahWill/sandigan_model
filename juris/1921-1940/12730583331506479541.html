				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to reverse a judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of the City of Manila, finding the appellants, Fausto Cha y Misal and 
Policarpio Milagrosa y Pascual, guilty of the offence of double homicide, and 
sentencing each of them to undergo imprisonment for eighteen years, <i>reclusion 
temporal</i>, with the accessories prescribed by law; to indemnify jointly and 
severally the heirs of the persons slain, in the amount of P500; and to pay each 
one-half the costs.
<p>It appears in evidence that on and prior to December 16, 1922, an aged Chino, 
named Lim Siam, with his wife, Ki Chio, maintained a <i>tienda</i> at No. 525 
Calle Sagat, in the district of Paco, Manila. The couple were accustomed to 
sleep in the <i>tienda</i>; and in the loft they accommodated their employee, a 
boy named Ing Si. At between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning of the date stated, 
two malefactors effected an entrance into this place by removing one or more 
boards from the back of the house, after which the door was opened by one or the 
other from the inside, in order of course to make possible a prompt escape in 
case of emergency. Lim Siam was the first person to awake who lived to tell the 
tale, and he was aroused by a shriek from his wife. The <i>tienda</i> at the 
time was lighted by an electric light, and what was then occurring was clearly 
visible to Lim Siam's eyes. Looking in the direction of the cot where his wife 
was sleeping, Lim Siam saw a little man, whom he afterwards identified as Fausto 
Cha, stabbing his wife, and blood spurting from her body. Lim Siam attempted to 
catch the assailant, who at once turned and cut Lim Siam on the foot, after 
which he resumed the assault on the wife, striking her in the neck while on the 
floor. He then turned again upon Lim Siam and, stabbing him in the side, fled 
from the room.</p>
<p>While this scene was being enacted Policarpio Milagrosa stood at the bed-room 
door on the lower floor of the store, observing what was being done inside; and 
after Lim Siam had been wounded, as above stated, he emitted a cry for help. 
Policarpio Milagrosa then fled from the house by the front door, followed by 
Fausto Cha.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ing Si, the lodger above, had heard the noise and started down the 
ladder leading to the lower floor. He got down just in time to see Fausto Cha 
running away from the house. He found Ki Chfo stretched upon the floor, dead 
from the many and fatal wounds which she had received, and Lim Siam badly 
slashed in half a dozen places. From the effect of these wounds he died five 
days later in the Philippine General Hospital in Manila.</p>
<p>The police force of the city arrested the two appellants as suspects and 
carried them in company with a number of other persons into the presence of Lim 
Siam, who immediately and without hesitation identified the two appellants as 
the persons who had perpetrated the outrage. Upon this occasion Lim Siam made a 
written <i>ante mortem</i> statement in which, after stating that he realized 
that death was certain, described the scene of the tragedy substantially as 
above given, and explained his reasons for recognizing Fausto Cha as the person 
who had killed Ki Chio and inflicted mortal wounds upon the declarant.</p>
<p>In this connection he pointed out that Fausto Cha is a little man and owing 
to the light that was burning in the <i>tienda</i> the declarant was able to see 
his features plainly. He also stated that he recognized Policarpio Milagrosa as 
being without doubt the individual who stood at the door, looking into the room 
while Fausto Cha committed the homicides.</p>
<p>The identification of the two appellants as the persons concerned in this 
deadly assault is in our opinion complete; and no one reading the <i>ante 
mortem</i> statement of Lim Siam can entertain for a moment any doubt that the 
two appellants are the guilty persons.</p>
<p>Fausto Cha is further identified by Ing Si, who saw the back of this 
appellant as he ran away. Still another circumstance which, though not weighty, 
is of some value as corroborating the case against Fausto Cha, is that when he 
was arrested one of his slippers (<i>chinelas</i>) had blood stains such as 
might have received at the time of the homicides, and which exhibited signs of 
attempt at effacement.</p>
<p>As against Policarpio Milagrosa the identification rests exclusively upon the 
<i>ante mortem</i> statement of Lim Siam, but when it is considered that a light 
was burning and that this accused was looking directly into the little room 
where the deadly assault was made, it will be seen that Lim Siam had perfect 
opportunity to observe this appellant's features. We are entirely satisfied that 
he also was rightly apprehended.</p>
<p>Fausto Cha gave his age as twenty-three years, and Policarpio Milagrosa said 
he was twenty-seven at the time of the trial. Notwithstanding their comparative 
youthfulness, both are seasoned criminals; and it was admitted by them at the 
trial that Fausto Cha had been previously convicted for theft and again for 
<i>estafa</i>, while Policarpio Milagrosa admitted having been convicted once 
for theft and twice for robbery. One Que Siong, a son of Lim Siam, said at the 
trial that these two individuals had already once robbed his father's 
establishment in the year 1918, though he did not give any precise date upon 
this point.</p>
<p>The external indications would seem to show that the two accused intended to 
commit robbery; but in his dying declaration Lim Siam said that he did not know 
whether they took anything or not. It appears in evidence that a number of 
articles, such as milk, sardines, and cigarettes, were, after the incident, 
found in the <i>tienda</i> in a sack, where they had possibly been put with a 
view to being taken away; and a drawer which may have contained some money was 
found open, and the place was otherwise in disorder. Notwithstanding these 
indications of a design to rob, the trial judge was in our opinion right in 
ignoring the charge of robbery, for the reason that the proof does not afford 
any convincing demonstration of the fact that the crime of robbery, frustrated 
robbery, or attempt to rob, was committed. It follows that in estimating the 
character of the offense and fixing the penalty, or penalties, incident thereto, 
account can be taken only of the two homicides.</p>
<p>The information in this case alleges that the crime was committed with 
treachery (<i>alevosia</i>), in that the victims were attacked while asleep; but 
this circumstance is alleged as a generic aggravating circumstance only and not 
as a qualifying circumstance such as would raise the homicides to murder. It is 
evident that the charge of treachery was put in this form in view of the fact 
that the information proceeds on the idea that the complex offence of robbery 
with homicide was committed. We are of the opinion, however, that the presence 
of <i>alevosia</i> as a factor in any form is not demonstrated in this case 
beyond a reasonable doubt. It is certain that Lim Siam was not asleep when 
assaulted, he having intervened in order to save his wife. Furthermore, it is a 
probable conjecture that Ki Chio herself was killed because she awoke from her 
sleep, thereby interrupting the robbery which had been planned.</p>
<p>In the commission of each of the offenses of homicide two aggravating 
circumstances were undoubtedly present, namely, nocturnity and that the 
offenders had been previously punished for two or more crimes to which the law 
attaches a lighter penalty than to homicide.</p>
<p>The trial judge, as we have seen, imposed the penalty appropriate to homicide 
in its maximum degree, but failed to take account of the fact that two persons 
were killed by separate acts. In this we think his Honor was in error. The case 
is one that should be governed by the rule stated in United States <i>vs</i>. 
Balaba (37 Phil., 260), and the penalty appropriate to each of the two homicides 
should have been imposed, as was done in that case. It is undoubtedly true that 
where the complex crime of robbery with homicide is committed, the circumstance 
that more than one homicide may have been committed does not destroy the 
essential nature of the crime, where otherwise there would be only one. In the 
complex offence the number of victims is immaterial (People <i>vs</i>. Manuel, 
44 Phil., 333). But when it occurs, as here, that the robbery, upon a charge of 
the complex offence, is not proved, the offence is resolved into its constituent 
elements; and if more than one homicide appears to have been committed, the 
penalties appropriate to each should be accumulated, in conformity with the 
provisions of article 87 of the Penal Code, in relation with No. 2 of article 88 
of the same Code. This was done in United States <i>vs</i>. Lahoylahoy and 
Madanlog (38 Phil., 330), where four homicides were committed in connection with 
a robbery, but the conviction for the robbery could not be sustained.</p>
<p>In view of the aggravating circumstances present in this case the period of 
imprisonment for each homicide must be fixed in the maximum degree of 
<i>reclusion temporal</i>, and we think it will suffice to fix this period at 
seventeen years four months and one day for each offence.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from will therefore be modified by imposing upon each 
of the appellants imprisonment for seventeen years four months and one day, 
<i>reclusion temporal</i>, for the homicide committed upon the person of Ki 
Chio, and the further period of seventeen years four months and one day, for the 
homicide committed upon the person of Lim Siam, making in all thirty-four years 
eight months and two days, <i>reclusion temporal</i>. In other respects the 
judgment is affirmed, with proportionate costs against the appellants. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Johnson, Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor, Johns,</i> 
and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
