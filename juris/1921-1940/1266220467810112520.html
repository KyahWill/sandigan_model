				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">This is an appeal from&nbsp; a judgment of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pampanga denying the&nbsp; petition of Vivencio Cuyugan for the probate of the will of Silvestra Baron.<br><br>The petition which was filed on February 1, 1933, recites among other&nbsp; things&nbsp; that&nbsp; Silvestra Baron died on January 30,1933. The death certificate recites that she was eighty-six years of age and died of heart failure.&nbsp; The petition further recites that she left an estate exceeding in value the sum of P80,000 which she disposed&nbsp; of&nbsp; by will dated December 17, 1932; that she died single without forced heirs.<br><br>The will appointed Vivencio Cuyugan, her nephew,&nbsp; as executor and contains the following paragraphs which dispose of her estate:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"Que despues de pagados&nbsp; todos&nbsp; los gastos que se han de ocasionar desde que me caiga enferma hasta el entierro de mi cadaver, los bienes y&nbsp; propiedades que he de dejar se repartiran&nbsp; buenamente y en partes iguales mis hermanos llamados Guillermo Baron, Faustina Baron y los hijos de mi difunta hermana Antonia&nbsp; Baron, con excepcion&nbsp; de todo el dinero en metalico y mi&nbsp; casa de materiales fuertes construida en el barrio del Pilar, San Fernando, Pampanga, que actualmente&nbsp; habita mi hermano&nbsp; Guillermo Baron,&nbsp; porque estos&nbsp; los doy de una manera absoluta como herencia de mi sobrino Vivencio Cuyugan.<br><br>"Que a la muerte de mis hermanos Guillermo y Faustina&nbsp; Baron, todos&nbsp; los terrenos que en virtud de este testamento les dejo en herencia, los doy en&nbsp; herencia a mi sobrino VIVENCIO CUYUGAN, por lo&nbsp; que, encargo y&nbsp; prohibo a mis citados&nbsp; hermanos Guillermo y Faustina Baron, que graven&nbsp; o pongan cualquiera clase de obligation sobre los bienes que&nbsp; les dejo en herencia."</font></blockquote><font size="4">The original of this will is signed "Silestra On" and the copy is signed "Silestra Baron"&nbsp; (t. s. n. pp.&nbsp; 170,&nbsp; 171). Both copies are written in the Pampanga dialect and consist of one sheet and are witnessed in due form by Vicente David, Valeriano Silva&nbsp; and Zacarias Nuguid&nbsp; (known&nbsp; to the testator).<br><br>The petition for probate recites:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"9. That on the date of the execution&nbsp; of said will, that is to&nbsp; say, on&nbsp; December 17, 1932, the said&nbsp; testatrix was about 80 years old, more or&nbsp; less, and was&nbsp; of&nbsp; sound and disposing mind, and not acting under duress, menace, fraud or undue influence, and&nbsp; was&nbsp; in every&nbsp; respect competent to dispose of her estate by will."</font></blockquote><font size="4">The amended&nbsp; oppositions of Guillermo Baron, brother of&nbsp; the deceased, and Faustina Baron,&nbsp; sister of the deceased,&nbsp; allege in substance&nbsp; first, that at the time of the execution of the alleged will, Silvestra Baron&nbsp; was mentally and physically incapacitated for the execution of a&nbsp; will; and, second, that her signature and&nbsp; alleged consent to the said will was obtained by imposition and undue&nbsp; influence of the said Vivencio Cuyugan and&nbsp; fraudulent confabulation between him and the attorney who prepared the document and the witnesses&nbsp; who&nbsp; affixed their signatures thereto.<br><br>Upon the issue thus drawn by the pleadings the judge of the Court of First Instance, after an extended&nbsp; trial and a full consideration of the evidence,&nbsp; came to&nbsp; the following conclusion:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"Opinamos&nbsp; que&nbsp; influyeron&nbsp; indebidamente&nbsp; e impropiamente en la voluntad* ya debilitada de dona Silvestra Baro6n por su avanzada edad la presencia de sus sobrinos Vivencio Cuyugan y Regino&nbsp; Cuyugan&nbsp; durante el&nbsp; otorgamiento del Exhibit A;&nbsp; la ausencia de Faustina&nbsp; Baron impedida de presenciarlo&nbsp; por&nbsp; algunos soldados de la Constabularia y el Jefe de Policia Municipal, Zacarias Nuguid;&nbsp; la oposicion de Regino&nbsp; Cuyugan a&nbsp; que ella&nbsp; flrmase&nbsp; el documento preparado por el abogado Narciso declarando que no habia otorgado testamento el dia&nbsp; anterior&nbsp; a su traslado forzoso a San Fernando para que no se hiciese firmar documento analogo y la presencia del cabo Morales y de&nbsp; algunos otros soldados, no&nbsp; solamente cuando&nbsp; se otorgd el testamento, sino cuando ella fue trasladada de casa contra su&nbsp; voluntad y cuando se le hizo firmar el&nbsp; Exhibit 10, y,&nbsp; por&nbsp; lo tanto, que ella no gozo de una completa libertad para&nbsp; disponer de sus bienes en testamento, o con pleno conocimiento del alcance&nbsp; de su contenido.&nbsp; Solo asi se explica el que ella haya dejado toda la propiedad de sus bienes a sus&nbsp; sobrinos, con quienes habia estado en pleito, con preterici6n de sus hermanos,&nbsp; especialmente&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; opositora Faustina&nbsp; Baron,&nbsp; con&nbsp; quien habia estado&nbsp; conviviendo&nbsp;&nbsp; durante 40 aiios&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.<br><br>"Sentadas&nbsp; las premisas&nbsp; de hecho y de derecho que an- teceden, el Juzgado no puede&nbsp; menos de llegar a la conclusion de que&nbsp; el testamento de autos no puede, ni debe, ser legalizado como el testamento y ultima voluntad de la finada Silvestra Baron.&nbsp; Cuando existen pruebas suficien- tes&nbsp; para convencer al Juzgado de que se ha ejercido influencia indebida en el&nbsp; animo de la testadora y que como resultado&nbsp; de&nbsp; dicha influencia indebida esta ha otorgado el testamento que se presenta para su legalizacidn, la unica conclusidn que cabe es que el pretendido testamento no es expresitin de la voluntad de la supuesta testadora sino de los que sobre ella ejercieron la&nbsp; influencia indebida."</font></blockquote><font size="4">An instrument purporting to be a will executed and witnessed in&nbsp; accordance with the&nbsp; formalities required by the statute is entitled to the&nbsp; presumption of regularity.&nbsp; But the burden of the evidence passes to the proponent when the oppositors submit credible evidence tending to show that the supposed testator&nbsp; did not possess&nbsp; testamentary capacity at&nbsp; the time or that the&nbsp; document was not the free and voluntary expression&nbsp; of the alleged testator or that the will, for&nbsp; any other reason, is void in law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; finding that the will was executed under undue influence or by the fraud of another presupposes&nbsp; testamentary&nbsp; capacity. In the present case the learned&nbsp; trial judge refused the probate of the alleged will&nbsp; on the ground that it was executed under the undue influence of other persons and we think the record warrants his&nbsp; findings in this&nbsp; respect.&nbsp; The trial court also made findings of fact tending to show actual lack of testamentary capacity of Silvestra Baron and we have preferred to base our conclusion on that finding. The testamentary capacity of Silvestra Baron having been put in issue and the&nbsp; burden of evidence resting upon the proponent, we think he has signally failed in affirmatively establishing the&nbsp; testamentary capacity of Silvestra Baron at the time she executed the said purported will.<br><br>The evidence shows that the same&nbsp; morning when&nbsp; Silvestra Baron&nbsp; signed the alleged will she suffered a physical collapse of such a serious nature that a physician and&nbsp; a nurse were immediately called in.&nbsp; By reason of her advanced age and the gravity of&nbsp; her illness, she was unable to do anything for herself.&nbsp; Her grandniece, Epifania Sampang, who reached the house&nbsp; about an&nbsp; hour or so after the old lady's collapse,&nbsp; telephoned a message to Vivencio Cuyugan at San Fernando, some fourteen kilometers dis- tant, that Silvestra had had an&nbsp; attack and was in a serious condition and requested that a&nbsp; doctor be&nbsp; sent immediately. Doctor Teopaco and a nurse arrived at&nbsp; about ten o'clock and treated the patient with a&nbsp; plaster on her back and ice packs over her heart and the doctor gave&nbsp; her a hypodermic injection in the arm.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; doctor and the nurse were leaving, Vivencio Cuyugan, with an attorney and three witnesses, entered the house prepared to obtain the will of Silvestra Baron.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the doctor nor the nurse were presented as witnesses by the&nbsp; proponent.&nbsp; Epifania Sampang, admittedly an intelligent young woman, who was the first to reach Silvestra Baron and&nbsp; remained throughout the morning and attended to her, testified that when&nbsp; she reached the house she found her grandaunt lying in bed, very pale and unconscious; that she called to her but&nbsp; she did not answer and&nbsp; only&nbsp; groaned;&nbsp; that her mouth was twisted and her lower lip, swollen. She went out to call&nbsp; a doctor but all the doctors in Magalang were out whereupon she telephoned as stated to San Fernando for a doctor.<br><br>The subscribing witnesses&nbsp; stated that it was their&nbsp; belief that Silvestra understood the alleged will which she signed, but all of them&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that although they were in her house about two hours not one of them exchanged&nbsp; a single word of conversation with Silvestra.&nbsp; The subscribing witness Zacarias Nuguid testified in part as follows:</font><br><blockquote><font size="4"><br>&nbsp; <br></font><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="13%"><div align="center"><font size="4">"P. </font></div></td><td width="87%"><font size="4">Desde que los tres abogados Abad Santos, Silva y David y usted y Vivencio Cuyugan se acercaron a la cama de la finada, hasta que tanto ella como ustedes firmaron el testamento, £ha pronunciado ella alguna palabra? £ha dicho ella algo o no?—R.

It has no application, moreover, where from the day of&nbsp; execution until the death of the testator his mental condition is such that&nbsp; he cannot judge the propriety of revoking the will.&nbsp; Nor obviously does it apply to a case where the alleged testator harbors the belief that he had not executed the will in question.<br><br>In view of the premises, the judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Hull</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br></font><hr style="height: 4px;" align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><font size="4"></font><center><font size="4"><b>CONCURRING </b></font></center><font size="4"><br><i>Malcolm, J.:</i><br><br>The main issue in this case, as I see it, is whether or not Silvestra Baron, a woman of advanced years and in a critical state of health, possessed testamentary capacity to make a will.&nbsp; This was an issue of fact, and resolving it the trial&nbsp; judge reached the conclusion that&nbsp; the testatrix was not of disposing mind.&nbsp; My review of&nbsp; the evidence does not permit me to say that in thus deciding the trial judge was wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; As was&nbsp; to he expected, in a case of this character, the oral testimony was conflicting, but in resolving&nbsp; the&nbsp; credibility of the&nbsp; witnesses, a judge as experienced as Judge Hermogenes Reyes was in a much better position to do so than we are.&nbsp; However, I may state that I have been considerably&nbsp; influenced&nbsp; by the testimony of the parish priest,&nbsp; certainly a&nbsp; disinterested&nbsp; party,&nbsp; who stated on the witness stand&nbsp; that in response&nbsp; to his question if she had made a will, Silvestra&nbsp; Baron answered:&nbsp; "There is no will, Father."&nbsp; But from the premise of lack of testamentary capacity, it does not necessarily follow that anything of an&nbsp; unprofessional nature&nbsp; should be&nbsp; imputed to the&nbsp; lawyer who prepared the will and the other lawyers who acted as attesting witnesses.&nbsp; The first named is the justice of the peace of San Fernando, Pampanga, and has an excellent reputation, which is not lessened in the least by his acts&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case,&nbsp; and the last named are reputable&nbsp; members of the bar.<br><br>For these reasons and to this extent, I concur.<br><br><i>VICKERS, J.:</i><br><br>I agree with the concurring opinion of Justice Malcolm. <br><br><i>Recto, J.:</i><br><br>I concur in the result.<br><br><br></font><hr style="height: 4px;" align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><font size="4"></font><center><font size="4"><b>DISSENTING OPINION</b></font></center><font size="4"><br><i>Villa-Real, J.:</i><br><br>The lower court refused to probate the will of Silvestra Baron&nbsp; on the ground that when she executed it she was under the undue influence of other persons; but&nbsp; the majority of this court, while admitting the existence of such undue influence,&nbsp; prefers to base its refusal on the&nbsp; ground that she lacked testamentary capacity at the time of the execu- tion of said win.<br><br>The facts constituting the undue influence in the opinion of the lower court are summarized&nbsp; in its&nbsp; decision as follows :<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"Opinamos&nbsp; que&nbsp; influyeron indebidamente&nbsp; e impropiamente en la voluntad ya debilitada de dona&nbsp; Silvestra Baron por su avanzada edad la presencia de sus sobrinos Vivencio Cuyugan y Regino Cuyugan durante el otorgamiento del Exhibit A; la ausencia&nbsp; de Faustina Baron impedida de presenciarlo por algunos&nbsp; soldados de&nbsp; la Constabularia&nbsp; y el Jefe de Policfa Municipal, Zacarias Nuguid; la oposicion de Regino Cuyugan a que ella firmase el&nbsp; documento preoparado por el&nbsp; abogado Narciso declarando que no habia otorgado testamento el dia anterior&nbsp; a su traslado forzoso a San Fernando para que no se hiciese&nbsp; firmar documento analogo y la presencia del cabo Morales y de algunos otros soldados, no solamente cuando se otorgo el testamento, sino cuando ella fue trasladada de&nbsp; casa&nbsp; contra su voluntad&nbsp; y cuando se le hizo firmar el Exhibit 10, y, por lo tanto, que ella no gozo" de una complete libertad&nbsp; para&nbsp; disponer de sus bienes&nbsp; en testamento, o con pleno conocimiento del alcance de su contenido. Solo asi se explica&nbsp; el que ella haya dejado toda la propiedad de sus bienes a sus sobrinos, con quienes habia estado en pleito,&nbsp; con pretericion de sus hermanos, especialmente de&nbsp; la opositora Faustina Bardn, con quien habia estado conviviendo durante 40 anos&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."</font></blockquote><font size="4">And the facts constituting lack of&nbsp; testamentary capacity are condensed in the opinion&nbsp; of the majority as follows:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"The evidence shows that&nbsp; the same morning when&nbsp; Silvestra Baron signed the alleged will she suffered a physical collapse of such a serious nature that a physician and a nurse were&nbsp; immediately called&nbsp; in.&nbsp; By reason of her advanced age and the gravity of her illness,&nbsp; she was unable to do anything for herself.&nbsp; Her grandniece, Epifania Sampang, who reached the house about an&nbsp; hour or so after the old lady's collapse, telephoned a message to Vivencio Cuyugan at San Fernando, some fourteen kilometers distant,&nbsp; that Silvestra had had an attack and was&nbsp; in a serious condition and requested that&nbsp; a doctor be sent immediately.&nbsp; Doctor Teopaco and a nurse arrived at about ten o'clock and treated the patient with a plaster on her back and ice packs over her heart and the doctor gave her a hypodermic injection in the arm.&nbsp; As the doctor and the nurse were leaving, Vivencio Cuyugan,&nbsp; with an attorney and three witnesses, entered the house prepared to obtain the will of Silvestra Baron.&nbsp; Neither the doctor nor the nurse were presented as witnesses by the&nbsp; proponent.&nbsp; Epifania Sampang, admittedly&nbsp; an intelligent young woman, who was the first to reach Silvestra Baron and remained throughout the morning and attended to&nbsp; her, testified that when she reached the house she found her grandaunt lying in bed, very pale and unconscious;&nbsp; that she called to her but she did not answer and only&nbsp; groaned;&nbsp; that her mouth was twisted and her lower lip&nbsp; swollen.&nbsp; She went&nbsp; out to call a doctor but all the doctors in Magalang were out whereupon she telephoned as stated to San Fernando for a doctor."</font></blockquote><font size="4">Examining now the facts which according to the findings of the lower&nbsp; court constituted undue influence, we have in the first place the presence of the testatrix's nephews Regino Cuyugan and Vivencio Cuyugan.&nbsp; There was nothing either in the presence of Vivencio Cuyugan or of that of Regino&nbsp; Cuyugan which&nbsp; could have&nbsp; compelled Silvestra Baron to make Vivencio Cuyugan her most favored beneficiary in her will.&nbsp; There is certainly nothing ill in nephews being present at the making of a will.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence shows that these two Cuyugans just&nbsp; stood by while the will was being read to the testatrix and when it&nbsp; was presented to her for her signature.<br><br>The absence of Faustina Baron,—the sister of Silvestra Baron, in&nbsp; whose company the&nbsp; latter was&nbsp; living,—who, according to tiie witnesses for the opponents, but denied by the witnesses for the proponent, while the will was being made, was prevented to come into the house by some Constabulary soldiers and the chief of police of San Fernando, Pampanga, Zacarias Nuguid, is another fact mentioned by the&nbsp; lower court as constituting&nbsp; undue influence.&nbsp; Even granting&nbsp; that Faustina Baron was&nbsp; prevented to come to the&nbsp; house while Silvestra Baron was making her will, I fail to see how such act&nbsp; on the part of the&nbsp; Constabulary soldiers could have unduly influenced the testatrix in the making of her will.<br><br>The presence of some Constabulary soldiers outside the house and in the kitchen&nbsp; is also one of the reasons which led the lower court&nbsp; to conclude that undue influence was used in making Silvestra Baron sign her&nbsp; will.&nbsp; Silvestra Baron was not an ignorant old lady.&nbsp; She was a landed proprietress, who&nbsp; according&nbsp; to the&nbsp; custom&nbsp; prevailing in the&nbsp; Philippine Islands; managed&nbsp; her own property, and in so doing she had to deal with many farm laborers in such a way as to&nbsp; make them respect her.&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of Constabulary soldiers in towns and barrios is not a rare occurrence, and country people are&nbsp; accustomed to seeing them around whether on patrol or quarantine duty.&nbsp; There is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; mere&nbsp; presence of the Constabulary soldiers in the&nbsp; house of Silvestra&nbsp; Baron at the time of making her&nbsp; will which could have influenced her. Besides,&nbsp; the&nbsp; testatrix&nbsp; must have&nbsp; known the presence&nbsp; of such soldiers before&nbsp; she collapsed, because they had been there investigating&nbsp; the&nbsp; assault&nbsp; and&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; committed against her a few days before.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; evidence that said soldiers were brought to the house for the purpose of guarding the making of the will.<br><br>The fact that the&nbsp; chief of police of San Fernando,&nbsp; Zacarias Nuguid, was brought by Attorney Quirino Abad Santos,&nbsp; whom the old lady had requested to prepare her will, had no moire significance than the bringing of the other attorneys to&nbsp; be witnesses to&nbsp; the will.&nbsp; There is certainly no evil in making a chief of police a witness&nbsp; to a will, nor is there any law disqualifying him to be such witness.<br><br>The alleged attitude of Regino Cuyugan in trying to prevent her aunt Silvestra Baron on December&nbsp; 18, 1932,&nbsp; the day following the making of her will, to sign a document prepared by Attorney Jose A. Narciso revoking her said will, even if it were true, could in no way have influenced her in the making of said will which took place the day previous.<br><br>The lower court also&nbsp; found that the will&nbsp; of Silvestra Baron was weakened by old&nbsp; age.&nbsp; In this connection I prefer to reproduce here what is said in 68 Corpus Juris, 440-442:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"<i>Old age</i>—A&nbsp; person&nbsp; possessing the requisites of testamentary capacity is not incapacitated&nbsp; from making a will by old age, although his advanced years be accompanied by infirmity of mind and body. Nor is he incapacitated by failing memory,&nbsp; vacillating judgment,&nbsp; childishness, slovenliness&nbsp; in dress,&nbsp; eccentricities or&nbsp; peculiarities in habit&nbsp; or speech, and even delusions or hallucinations if they do not affect the execution of the&nbsp; will, and he is not limited to conventional methods of disposition.&nbsp; The will is not valid where an aged person is so enfeebled mentally as not to understand what he is doing."</font></blockquote><font size="4">If undue influence had been used&nbsp; to compel Silvestra Baron to make&nbsp; her will on&nbsp; the 17th&nbsp; of&nbsp; December, 1932, she could have changed her said will after all the circumstances which according to the court below constituted said undue influence&nbsp; had disappeared.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the&nbsp; making&nbsp; of her will Silvestra Baron was left alone&nbsp; in her house&nbsp; in the company of&nbsp; her nephew Begino Cuyugan, her grandniece Epifania Sampang&nbsp; and her sister Faustina Baron. Upon gaining access to&nbsp; the house and learning that her sister&nbsp; Silvestra&nbsp; Baron had&nbsp; signed some papers, Faustina Baron started immediately&nbsp; to look for Attorney Jose&nbsp; A. Narciso, and with him went to the house of Attorney Valeriano Silva who upon&nbsp; being questioned informed the latter&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; old lady&nbsp; had&nbsp; signed&nbsp; a will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon efforts were made to have the will revoked,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to this effect Attorney Jose A. Narciso prepared a document which the old lady refused to&nbsp; sign as&nbsp; we have already stated. On the 20th of December, 1932, the old lady was taken&nbsp; by her brother Guillermo Baron, one of the opponents, to her own house in San Fernando, Pampanga, occupied by said Guillermo, and&nbsp; there she stayed for forty days before her death.&nbsp; During that time she signed on two different occasions two documents, one ratifying the making of her will&nbsp; and the other appointing her nephew Vivencio Cuyugan&nbsp; her attorney in fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; An old lady who after making her will remains in the house of her sister, free from any outside influence, refuses to&nbsp; sign a document purporting to be a revocation of her will,&nbsp; lives for forty days in her own house in San&nbsp; Fernando,&nbsp; Pampanga, in&nbsp; the company of her brother, and there signs two important documents, cannot certainly be said&nbsp; to have been unduly&nbsp; influenced when she made her will.<br><br>In Brownlie&nbsp; vs. Brownlie (93 A.&nbsp; Ii.&nbsp; R., 1048), the Supreme Court of Illinois said the following:<br><br>"* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The undue influence which will&nbsp; invalidate a will&nbsp; must be directly connected with the&nbsp; execution of the instrument, be operating when the&nbsp; will was made, and thereby prevent the testator from exercising his own wish and&nbsp; will&nbsp; in the disposition of his estate.&nbsp; (Flanigon vs. Smith, 337 III, 572; 169 N. E., 767;&nbsp; Chaney vs. Baker, 304&nbsp; 111., 362; 136 N. E., 804; Goff vs. Gerhart,&nbsp; 316 111., 513; 147 N. E., 419; McGrady vs. McGrady,&nbsp; 298 111., 129; 131&nbsp; N. E., 251.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the beneficiaries of a will are&nbsp; those by whom the testator was surrounded and with whom he stood in&nbsp; confidential&nbsp; relationship at the time&nbsp; of executing his will&nbsp; is no&nbsp; ground for inferring undue in- fluence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Michael vs. Marshall, 201 111., 70; 66 N. E.f 273; Rutherford vs. Morris, 77 111., 397.)&nbsp; The influence&nbsp; must be directed towards procuring the will&nbsp; in favor of certain parties and must be such as to destroy the testator's freedom of will and purpose.&nbsp; (Pond vs. Hollett, 310 111., 31; 141&nbsp; N. E., 403; Gregory&nbsp; vs. Richey, 307&nbsp; 111.,&nbsp; 219; 138&nbsp; N. E.,&nbsp; 669;&nbsp; Blackhurst vs. James, 304&nbsp; 111.,&nbsp; 536; 136 N. E., 754; Snell vs. Weldon, 239 111., 279; 87 N. E., 1022.)&nbsp; Proof of undue influence&nbsp; must be consistent with the exercise of undue influence and also be inconsistent with its absence. (Cunningham vs. Dorwart, supra; Gompher vs. Browning, 219 HI., 429; 76 N. E., 678; 109 Am. St. Rep., 346.)" In the case of Torres and Lopez de Bueno vs. Lopez (48 Phil.,&nbsp; 772),&nbsp; this court in an&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; written&nbsp; by Justice Malcolm,&nbsp; defines undue influence as follows:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"Undue influence as used in connection with the law of wills,&nbsp; may be defined as that&nbsp; which compels the testator to do that which is against the&nbsp; will from fear, the desire of peace, or&nbsp; from other&nbsp; feeling which he is unable to resist."</font></blockquote><font size="4">In Applehans vs. Jurgenson&nbsp; (67 A. L. R., 857), the Supreme Court of&nbsp; Illinois said:<br><blockquote>"The undue influence&nbsp; which&nbsp; will&nbsp; avoid a will must&nbsp; be directly connected&nbsp; with the execution&nbsp; of the instrument and operate at the time it is made.&nbsp;&nbsp; The influence must be specially directed toward procuring&nbsp; the will in&nbsp; favor of a particular party or parties, and it must be such as to destroy the freedom of the testator's will and&nbsp; render the instrument&nbsp; obviously more the&nbsp; offspring of the will of another or others&nbsp; that of his own.&nbsp; (Ughetti vs. Ughetti, 334 III., 398; 166 N. E., 90; Ray vs.&nbsp; Koenigsmarck, 329 111., 588;&nbsp; 161 N. E., 124; Farmer vs. Davis, 289 111., 392; 124 N. E., 640; Hurd vs. Reed, 260 111., 154; 102 N. E., 1048;&nbsp; Larabee vs. Larabee, 240 111., 676; 88 N. E., 1037; Snell vs. Weldon, 239 111., 279;&nbsp; 87 N. E., 1022; Wickes vs. Walden, 228 111., 56;&nbsp; 81&nbsp; N. E., 798; Woodman vs. Illinois Trust&nbsp; &amp; Sav. Bank, 211&nbsp; 111., 578; 71 N. E., 1099; Roe vs. Taylor, 45 HI., 485.)&nbsp; The evidence failed to establish these requirements. The law&nbsp; does not require that a testator, in making disposition of his property, shall be humane or even just. If he possesses the requisite&nbsp; mental capacity, he&nbsp; has the right to make an unequal&nbsp; distribution of his property among&nbsp; his heirs or to give it entirely to strangers. (McGrady vs. McGrady, 298 111., 129; 131 N. E., 251.)" We&nbsp; have seen that none of&nbsp; the facts which&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; found&nbsp; to&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; undue influence&nbsp; is such&nbsp; as to cause&nbsp;&nbsp; fear,&nbsp; desire of peace, or any other&nbsp; feeling which Silvestra Baron was unable to resist. <br></blockquote>As to the effect of an opportunity of revocation upon an alleged undue influence,&nbsp; we read in 28 R. C. L., 151, the following rule:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"106. <i>Opportunity of revocation</i>.—Where the testator has had an opportunity to revoke his&nbsp; will subsequent to the operation of an alleged undue influence upon him, but makes no&nbsp; change in it, the court as&nbsp; a general rule considers the effect of the testimony of the undue&nbsp; influence as destroyed."</font></blockquote><font size="4">From the foregoing definition of undue influence,&nbsp; and the existence of an opportunity to revoke without taking advantage of it,&nbsp; I&nbsp; come to the conclusion that&nbsp; when Silvestra Baron signed her&nbsp; will she was not under any undue influence, and that if she had ever been in such a situation she could have revoked&nbsp; her will at any&nbsp; time during the forty days which she survived the making of said&nbsp; will. The fact&nbsp; that not only she had not done so but that she made a power of attorney in favor of her nephew Vivencio Cuyugan, the chief beneficiary under her will, and ratified the making of said will,&nbsp; is conclusive proof that no undue influence had been&nbsp; exerted to&nbsp; compel her&nbsp; to sign her will.<br><br>Another fact which led the trial court&nbsp; to conclude that undue influence was exercised&nbsp; upon&nbsp; Silvestra Baron is that in her will she left most of her property to her nephews leaving nothing to&nbsp; her brother and sister Faustina Baron except a life usufruct.<br><br>In the case of Pecson vs. Coronel (45&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 216), this court said the following:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"Although family ties&nbsp; in this country are very strongly knit, the exclusion&nbsp; of&nbsp; relatives, who are not forced heirs, from the&nbsp; inheritance is not an exceptional case.&nbsp; The inhabitants&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Archipelago&nbsp; do&nbsp; not appear to&nbsp; be averse to the freedom to make a will enshrined by article 783 of the Civil Code, which has been in force in the Philippines since the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1889.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even if the appointment of a beneficiary do not seem to be the most usual and ordinary because the beneficiary is&nbsp; not a&nbsp; relative&nbsp; of the testatrix who has relatives by blood, this alone will not render the appointment void per&nbsp; se"</font></blockquote><font size="4">In 68 Corpus Juris,&nbsp; 452, we read the following:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"The fact that a will may be unnatural, unfair, or unjust creates of itself no presumption that the testator was incompetent at the time of its execution.&nbsp; No&nbsp; presumption of mental incapacity arises from the fact that the will makes an unequal distribution of property among the next of kin, or that it gives property to persons other than the natural objects of the testator's bounty.&nbsp; Any departure from the usual course in which a person prompted by&nbsp; ordinary instincts&nbsp; and natural impulses would&nbsp; have his&nbsp; properly go is presumed to have been made&nbsp; by the testator because of reasons rationally conceived which&nbsp; were satisfactory to him, and on the probate of a will&nbsp; the fact that the will is unnatural does not shift the burden to the proponent.&nbsp; According to some decisions, however, where a will is an unnatural one it is the duty of the proponent on the probate of the will to give some reasonable explanation of its unnatural character."</font></blockquote><font size="4">In the present case&nbsp; there is evidence to the effect that Silvestra&nbsp; Baron trusted her nephews,&nbsp; specially&nbsp; Vivencio Cuyugan,&nbsp; more than her brother Guillermo Baron and her sister Faustina Baron.&nbsp; Faustina Baron herself testified that after the&nbsp; assault&nbsp; and robbery on December 9,&nbsp; 1932, Silvestra Baron entrusted to her nephews Ventura Cuyu- gan and Vivencio Cuyugan the combination&nbsp; of the&nbsp; safe where she kept her valuables and documents and gave them the duplicates&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; keys&nbsp; to the interior compartments and drawers (pp. 254, 255, t. s. n.).&nbsp; That Silvestra Baron did not trust her sister Faustina Baron may be inferred from the latter's own testimony on page 291 (t. s. n.) to the effect that before the 17th of December,&nbsp; 1932, she did not dare to suggest to her sister Silvestra Baron to make a will because the latter&nbsp; did not like to hear anything about the matter, but she told Faustina that she had already made her will Ions: time ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; If to this we add the fact that a complaint was signed by Silvestra Baron against her sister Faustina and the latter's son Emilio Lacson for the assault and&nbsp; robbery committed against her,&nbsp; then&nbsp; we have&nbsp; a&nbsp; full explanation why in her will Silvestra Baron bequeathed to her nephews almost all her property leaving to her brother and sister nothing but a life usufruct.<br><br>Passing now to the question of lack of testamentary capacity or disposing&nbsp; mind, which is the ground preferred by the majority opinion on&nbsp; which to&nbsp; base&nbsp; its rejection of the probate of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; will, we find&nbsp; in the first place the alleged failure&nbsp; of the proponent to&nbsp; call as witnesses&nbsp; the doctor and. the nurse who&nbsp; attended&nbsp; Silvestra Baron&nbsp; im- mediately after she collapsed, apparently inferring that had they testified their testimony would have been unfavorable to the claim of&nbsp; sanity.&nbsp; The burden of&nbsp; proving sanity, which falls on the shoulders of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proponent of a will, was&nbsp; discharged by Vivencio&nbsp; Cuyugan when he put to the witness stand Attorney Quirino Abad Santos,&nbsp; the drawer of the will, and attorneys Vicente T.&nbsp; David and Valeriano Silva, and the chief of police of San Fernando, Pampanga, Zacarias Nuguid, the three witnesses&nbsp; who&nbsp; signed the will. They testified unanimously that when the testatrix signed her will she was of sound mind, judging from her appearance and the manner she signed it.&nbsp; "An attesting witness to a will may base an opinion of the testator's mental capacity upon his appearance at the time of executing the will. (Brownlie vs. Brownlie,&nbsp; 93 A. L. R., 1041.)&nbsp; This testimony was&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; make&nbsp; and&nbsp; did make a prima facie case, (68 Corpus Juris, 450), and the burden of going forward to show testamentary incapacity having shifted to the contestants&nbsp; (68 Corpus Juris,&nbsp; 451).&nbsp; It was not therefore the duty of the proponent to call&nbsp; the doctor and the&nbsp; nurse who attended Silvestra&nbsp; Baron when she collapsed to show that she was of sound mind but of the contestants to show incapacity.<br><br>That Silvestra Baron did&nbsp; not become unconscious as the result&nbsp; of her fall is shown&nbsp; by the very testimony of Epifania Sampang who said, referring to her grandaunt: "Estaba inconsciente, lanzaba quejidos, decfa: 'Faustina, Faustina' ; mandaba buscar a la vieja Faustina."&nbsp; If the testatrix was really unconscious as the result of said fall she would not have been able to call&nbsp; her sister Faustina by her name, nor could she have given orders to&nbsp; locate her.&nbsp; Because her grandaunt did not answer her when she called her, Epifania&nbsp; Sampang imagined that she&nbsp; was&nbsp; unconscious. Thus, all the evidence concerning the unconscious state of Silvestra Baron in the morning she made her will consisted of the&nbsp; testimony of Epifania Sampang alone.&nbsp; The doctor who attended Silvestra JJaron after her&nbsp; fall was the one qualified to testify as to her mental condition and not her grandniece.&nbsp; The contestants whose duty it was to call said doctor&nbsp; to prove unconsciousness failed to do so.<br><br>In the case of Torres&nbsp; and Lopez de&nbsp; Bueno&nbsp; vs. Lopez, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; this court said:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"On January&nbsp; 3, 1924, when the testator, Tomas Rodriguez, made his will, he was 76 years old, physically decrepit, weak of intellect, suffering&nbsp; from a loss of memory, had a guardian of his person and his property, and was eccentric, but he still possessed that spark of reason and of life, that strength of mind to form&nbsp; a&nbsp; fixed intention and to summon his enfeebled thoughts to enforce that intention, which the law terms 'testamentary capacity.'&nbsp; Two of the subscribing witnesses testified clearly to the regular manner in which the will was executed, and one did not&nbsp; The attending physician and three other doctors who were present at the execution of the will expressed opinions entirely favorable to the capacity of the testator.&nbsp; Three other members of the&nbsp; medical profession expressed opinions entirely unfavorable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; of the testator and certified that he&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; of unsound&nbsp; mind.&nbsp; Held: That&nbsp; Tomas Rodriguez&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 3, 1924,&nbsp; possessed sufficient mentality to make a will which would meet the legal test regarding testamentary capacity; that the proponents of the will have carried successfully the burden of proof and have shown him of sound mind on that date; and that it was reversible error on the part of the trial court not to admit his will to probate."</font></blockquote><font size="4">While it&nbsp; is true that&nbsp; in the present case no physician testified as to the condition of Silvestra Baron's mind when she signed her will, we have however the testimony of three reputable attorneys to the effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; judging from her appearance and the ways she acted when she signed her will she was of sound mind.&nbsp; This was corroborated by the fact that when the next day Attorney Jose A. Narciso, upon learning that she had made a will,&nbsp; he&nbsp; tried to make her revoke said will which she refused.&nbsp; This in itself is an admission that she was of sound disposing mind.&nbsp; The very finding of the lower court that Silvestra Baron was unduly influenced in the making of her will is an implied admission that she possessed testamentary capacity.<br><br>The preponderance of evidence and the implied admission of the lower court show, therefore, that when Silvestra Baron made her will she&nbsp; was of sound disposing mind.<br><br>From all the foregoing considerations, I come to the conclusion that Silvestra Baron made her will free from any undue influence and in a&nbsp; sound disposing mind, and, therefore, said will should be probated.<br><br><i>AVANCEÑA, C.
