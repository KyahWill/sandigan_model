				<H3>EULOGIO MACALAYAC, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VICKERS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Eulogio Macalayac appeals from a decision
of the Court of First Instance of Manila denying his petition for a
writ of habeas corpus in behalf of his alleged minor son, Yee Sing.
<p> The appellant makes the following assignments of error:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "I. The lower court erred in not declaring that the
board of special inquiry and the respondent-appellee, Insular Collector
of Customs, have arbitrarily abused their authority and discretion in
refusing the applicant Yee Sing the right of entry, notwithstanding the
existence on record of an overwhelmingly strong, decisive and
undisputed evidence that he is the real son of the petitioner-appellant.</p>
  <p> "II. The lower court erred in not granting the present petition for habeas corpus."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the first place it should be pointed out that contrary to the
allegation in the petition and the statement in appellant's brief, Yee
Sing did not claim the right to enter the Philippine Islands as the
minor son of his alleged father, but as the son of a native born
citizen of the Philippine Islands. He arrived in Manila on July 7,
1934, and testified that he was born in China on November 30, 1911. He
was therefore twenty-two years, seven months, and seven days old at the
time of his arrival. He also gave his age as twenty-four. The board of
special inquiry found him to be not less than twenty-five, but no
question was raised as to whether the applicant, who was born in China
and had never previously been in the Philippine Islands, had forfeited
his right to enter the Philippine Islands as a son of a native born
citizen thereof.</p>
<p> The board of special inquiry, which investigated the case of Yee
Sing on July 9, 1934, denied him admission in the following decision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "This is the case of Yee Sing, male, 22 years old
who is seeking admission as the son of a native born Filipino citizen.
His alleged father, one Eulogio Macalayac, holder of L. C. R. No.
17614/21208 and another witness testified in his behalf. After
considering all the facts and circumstances of this case the board
found that the applicant failed to establish his right to admission in
view of the following grounds:</p>
  <p> "l. IDENTITY OF FATHER.—While
the alleged father in this case claims that his real and only name is
Eulogio Macalayac, the applicant insists that the name of his father is
Eulogio Yee and that he has no Chinese name.</p>
  <p> "2. WHEREABOUTS
OF ALLEGED FATHER UPON THE DEATH OF APPLICANT'S MOTHER.—It is claimed
by the herein applicant that his father was in China when his mother
died. The alleged father, however, declares that he was in this country
at the time the mother of the applicant died.</p>
  <p> "3. NAME OF
THE ALLEGED BROTHER IN THIS COUNTRY.— It is claimed by the herein
applicant that his brother who is in this country is Yee Kim while the
alleged father declared that the other child in this country is Yee Suy.</p>
  <p>
"4. OCCUPATION OF ALLEGED BROTHERS IN CHINA.— While the herein
applicant claims that all his brothers in China are studying, the
alleged father declared that two of them are not studying.</p>
  <p>
"5. SIZE OF SCHOOLHOUSE.—While the applicant says that the schoolhouse
and their house in China are about the same size the alleged father
contends that the schoolhouse is much bigger, it having more rooms than
their own house.</p>
  <p> "6. LENGTH OF TIME THE APPLICANT STUDIED IN
CHINA.— While the applicant claims that he studied in China for six
years, the alleged father declares that the applicant studied for nine
years.</p>
  <p> "7. EXISTENCE OF STREAM.—While the alleged father
declares that there is small stream in front of their house in China
the applicant insists that there is no river or body of water near
their house in China.</p>
  <p> "8. While the applicant testified that
the second wife of his father was in China when he left for this
country, the alleged father declared that his second wife is now in
this country having arrived here in the year 1932.</p>
  <p> "9. AGE
AND NATIONALITY OF APPLICANT.—While the applicant claims that he is a
Chinese mestizo, 22 years old, it is the opinion of the board that he
is a pure blooded'Chinese person as evidenced by his mongolian type and
characteristics. He is at least 25 years old as shown by his general
appearance and physical development.</p>
  <p> "In view of the
foregoing, it is the opinion of this board that the herein applicant is
not a real son of Eulogio Macalayac, a native born Filipino citizen.<br>
      <br>
"The applicant is, therefore, refused admission. He and his broker are
informed of this decision and are further informed that they have two
days within which to appeal to the Insular Collector of Customs should
they feel dissatisfied therewith."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> On appeal to the respondent the decision of the board of special
inquiry was approved, although it was erroneously stated in
respondent's order that the applicant failed to prove satisfactorily
that he is a native born Filipino citizen. Such was not his contention.</p>
<p> Although we do not attach much weight to some of the grounds of the
decision of the board of special inquiry, there are certain material
discrepancies between the testimony of the applicant and that of his
alleged father which leave no doubt in our minds that the applicant is
not the son of the petitioner, but an impostor seeking to enter the
Philippine Islands unlawfully. The applicant testified that his mother,
Yang Shi, died in China in 1929, and that his father was in China when
she died. Eulogio Macalayac, the alleged father of the applicant,
testified that he was not in China when his first wife, Yang Shi, died.
When the applicant was asked if his father attended the funeral of Yang
Shi. he replied that he did not remember. According to the testimony of
the applicant he was twenty-two or twenty-four years old when he
testified before the board of special inquiry. He was, therefore, at
least seventeen years old when his mother died. If he were in fact the
son of the petitioner, he would know positively whether the petitioner
was in China when the applicant's mother died, and whether or not his
father attended the funeral.</p>
<p> The applicant claims to have seven brothers, six of whom are in
China and the other one in the Philippine Islands. When asked the name
of his brother, who is in the Philippine Islands, he said that it
wasYee Kim, and that he came to the Philippine Islands last year. The
petitioner testified, however, that the name of his son that has been
admitted into the Philippine Islands is Yee Suy, and that he arrived in
April of this year. After the petitioner had testified as stated, the
applicant was recalled. He then changed his statement to agree with
that of his alleged father.</p>
<p> The applicant testified that his father's second wife, Kang Shi,
was in China when he left home to come to the Philippines, but the
alleged father stated that his second wife has been in the Philippine
Islands since 1932.</p>
<p> We do not deem it necessary to discuss the other grounds for
rejecting the applicant, and finding no merit in the appeal, we affirm
the decision of the lower court, with the costs against the appellant.</p>
