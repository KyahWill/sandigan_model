				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ALFREDO ROSIL (ALIAS LIBAT), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Alfredo Rosil (<em>alias</em> Libat) appeals to this court from the sentence, 
of the Court of First Instance of Palawan convicting him of the crime of 
parricide without any modifying circumstance, and sentencing him to life 
imprisonment, the accessaries of law, an indemnity of P500 to the heirs of the 
deceased, and to pay the costs.
<p>In support of his appeal, the appellant assigns the following alleged errors 
as committed by the trial court in its judgment, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1 The lower court erred in holding the accused and appellant guilty of the 
crime of parricide.</p>
<p>"2. The trial court erred in sentencing the herein appellant to <em>cadena 
perpetua.</em></p>
<p>"3. The court of origin erred in not estimating the following attenuating 
circumstances: (1)<em> vindicacion proxima, de una ofensa grave al acusado;</em> 
(2) <em>arrebato y obcecacion;</em> and (3) lack of instruction on the part of 
the accused herein appellant.</p>
<p>"4. The court below erred in not acquitting the accused from the crime 
charged in the information.</p>
<p>"5. The court below erred in denying the petition for continuance of the 
hearing of this case by the defense."</p></blockquote>
<p>The following facts were proved at the trial beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>
<p>The accused Alfredo Rosil (<em>alias</em> Libat) married the deceased Tomasa 
Magalito according to the rites of the Tagbanua tribe to which both of them 
belonged. Prior to October 13, 1930 the accused became suspicious that his wife 
was unfaithful to him, because she would leave their home alone and go with a 
man named Urbano. Later she deserted the conjugal home for another house, 
refusing to return when her husband begged her to do so. On the afternoon of the 
day of record, October 13, 1930, the accused spoke to his wife about her 
conduct, and she answered that she had a right to act as she did. At this the 
defendant slapped her and beat her with a strip of rattan. As she resisted, he 
stabbed her in the left side of the breast with the knife Exhibit B, and then 
gave himself up at once to the barrio lieutenant, Santiago Garcia, his 
half-brother, to whom he said he had killed his wife, and delivered up the 
knife, Exhibit B. An hour later his victim died. The following morning Santiago 
Garcia went to the defendant's home, where the crime had been committed, in the 
sitio of Cumapcap, barrio of Bucungan, municipality of Puerto Princesa, Province 
of Palawan, and there he found the body of the deceased Tomasa Magalito on a 
bed, with a wound in the right side of her breast. On October 20, 1930 while the 
defendant was under arrest, he was investigated by the provincial fiscal, 
Antonio Lacson, who questioned him in English, the clerk of court Pedro Valdes 
interpreting into the Cuyuno dialect which is the defendant's native dialect. 
The statement he made at that investigation appears in Exhibit D, which he 
signed after its contents had been interpreted for him into Cuyuno, and wherein 
he relates the same facts he had recounted to his half-brother.</p>
<p>At the preliminary investigation held on October 22, 1930 before Gaudencio 
Abordo, the justice of the peace of Puerto Princesa, the accused, with counsel 
de ofieio, upon arraignment pleaded guilty, ratifying what he had stated before 
the provincial fiscal (Exhibit D) and signing Exhibit C of his own free will, 
after its contents had been interpreted into the Tagbanua dialect, which he 
understands.</p>
<p>The above statement of facts, proven beyond a reasonable doubt at the trial, 
leaves no room for doubt that the accused was the one who caused the death of 
the deceased Tomasa Magalito, to whom he was married according to the rites of 
the tribe of Tagbanuas to which both of them belonged, which rites sanctioned 
said marriage according to the admission of the accused, and constitutes the 
crime of parricide, denned and penalized in, article 402 of the Penal Code, the 
penalty fixed by law being life imprisonment to death. To graduate said penalty 
the mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation must be considered, 
without any aggravating circumstance to offset it, for which reason the penalty 
must be imposed in the minimum degree, that is, life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding the judgment appealed from to be in conformity with the 
law and the evidence, it is hereby affirmed in its entirety with costs against 
the appellant, it being understood that in accordance with the Revised Penal 
Code the penalty is reclusion perpetua and not cadena perpetua. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Romualdez,</em> and <em>Imperial, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>

<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong></p>
<p>The decision prepared by Justice Villa-Real contains the following very 
significant language: "The above statement of facts, proven beyond reasonable 
doubt at the trial, leaves no room for doubt that the accused was the one who 
caused the death of the deceased Tomasa Magalito, to whom he was married 
according to the rites of the tribe of Tagbanuas to which both of them belonged, 
which rites sanctioned said marriage according to the admission of the accused, 
and constitutes the crime of parricide." This means, I take it, the definite 
abandonment of the doctrine announced in the cases of United States <em>vs.</em> 
Tubban ([1915], 29 Phil, 434), and United States <em>vs.</em> Verzola ([1916], 
3.3 Phil., 285), refusing to recognize a tribal marriage ceremony—a doctrine 
which this court has heretofore declined to follow in the civil case of Adong 
<em>vs.</em> Cheong Seng Gee ([1922], 43 Phil., 43). Such action also conforms 
to the portion of section 25 of the existing Marriage Law providing: "Marriages 
between persons who do not profess the Mohammedan or Christian religions nor any 
particular religion and who inhabit any of the regions of the Philippine Islands 
which are under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of non-Christian Tribes may also 
be performed in accordance with the rites and practices of their religion, if 
they have any, or with tribal customs if not." Marriage relations among 
individuals living in regions ordinarily referred to as non-Christian are just 
as sacred and should be just as much respected as are the marriage relations of 
individuals settled in more advanced communities and adhering to recognized 
religions. With the understanding, therefore, that the decision means a complete 
reversal of the attitude adopted in the two cases previously referred to, I 
concur in the result.</p>
