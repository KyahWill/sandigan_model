				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellants rely on the sole assignment of error that the 
lower court erred in denying the petition to set aside the order admitting to 
probate the pretended will of Gregorio Natividad.<p></p>
<p align="justify">On May 30, 1926, Gregorio Natividad died at the advanced age of 
38 years. Following his demise one of his heirs, Alfredo Natividad, offered for 
probate in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur the will of the deceased 
alleged to have been executed on August 27, 1928. The will was a document of 
sixteen pages and disclosed that Gregorio Natividad was possessed of a 
considerable fortune, probably amounting to hundreds of thousands of pesos. A 
strong predilection for a natural grandchild, Alfredo Natividad, was apparent. 
Opposition to the probate of the will was filed on July 81, 1926, by the 
attorney for Casimiro Natividad, a son of the deceased.</p>
<p align="justify">Turning directly to the record, it will be found that the case 
was called for trial at Naga, Camarines Sur, before the Honorable Pedro Tuason, 
Judge of First Instance, on July 31, 1926. The following appearances were made 
of record: "El Sr. Vicente Ribaya, por el solidtante; el Sr. Pablo C. Sibulo, 
por Gregorio Natividad y Casimiro Natividad; el Sr. Fernando Alvarez, por 
Casimiro Natividad, y el Sr. Jos6 Peñas, por Casimiro Natividad." The 
subscribing witnesses to the will and Alfredo Natividad were presented as 
witnesses by the proponent of the will. When the proponent closed his case, the 
record discloses that the following happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"COURT (To the attorneys for the oppositors, Messrs. Alvarez, 
Sibulo, and Peñas). Do you have any evidence?</p>
<p align="justify">"ALVAREZ. We waive the right to present evidence, and we only 
pray your Honor that instead of appointing the herein petitioner, Mr. Alfredo 
Natividad, as administrator, one of the children of the deceased be appointed; 
and for this purpose we propose Mr. Casimiro Natividad, or at least, so far as 
we are concerned, we may announce for the sake of harmony, that we petition that 
Mr. Casimiro Natividad be appointed as coadministrator.</p>
<p align="justify">"COURT (To Mr. Alvarez). And then you withdraw your opposition 
to the probate of the will, is that it?</p>
<p align="justify">"ALVAREZ and SIBULO. We withdraw.</p>
<p align="justify">"ALVAREZ. We withdraw, but we pray the Honorable Court that Mr. 
Casimiro Natividad be appointed as coadministrator.</p>
<p align="justify">"COURT. Is there any thing else, Mr. Alvarez?</p>
<p align="justify">"ALVAREZ. Nothing else.</p>
<p align="justify">"COURT. It is ordered that the will be admitted to probate, and 
Mr. Alfredo Natividad is appointed as executor. The amount of the bond to be 
given by him for the performance of his obligations is fixed at P20,000.</p>
<p align="justify">"RIBAYA. That's all.</p>
<p align="justify">"ALVAREZ. We submit the case.</p>
<p align="justify">"COURT. The court adjourns."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Casimiro Natividad was not present at the hearing. However, the 
trial judge observed that he was in the courthouse. There is nothing to indicate 
that Casimiro Natividad authorized his lawyers to compromise the litigation.</p>
<p align="justify">On the same date, that is, on July 81, 1926, that Casimiro 
Natividad filed an objection to the allowance of the will and that the trial was 
had, the presiding judge signed an order in which, after making mention of the 
oppositors, Messrs. Casimiro Natividad and Gregorio Natividad, by means of their 
lawyers, having withdrawn their opposition, it was directed that the document 
Exhibit A be admitted to probate as the last will and testament of the deceased 
Gregorio Natividad, and in conformity with its dispositions appointed as 
administrator the petitioner, Mr. Alfredo Natividad, under a bond of P20,000. 
Casimiro Natividad alleges that he first became aware of the status of the case 
on September 7, 1926. Accordingly, on December 14, 1926, a petition pursuant to 
the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure to set aside the 
order, was presented in the Court of First Instance on behalf of Casimiro 
Natividad, Gregorio Estela, Maria Estela, and Miguel Estela, the latter two 
minors and represented by their guardian. The petition was supported by an 
affidavit executed by Casimiro Natividad. The petition and a subsequent motion 
for reconsideration were denied by the court. Hence this appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">It will have to be frankly conceded right at the start that the 
appellee has in his favor a very strong case. In open court, the regularly 
appointed attorneys for the oppositors withdrew the opposition to the 
legalization of the will and acceded to what in effect constituted a confession 
of judgment. With such the state of the record the trial judge could not do 
anything else than approve of the probating of the will. When later an attempt 
was made to open and vacate the judgment, the court, acting in good faith and in 
the exercise of its best discretion, denied the petition.</p>
<p align="justify">There are, however, equitable aspects to the case. It must not 
be forgotten that it was the relief guaranteed by section 113 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure which was invoked. The application therefor was made within the 
six months' period after the order was taken but came dangerously near to being 
outside of what may be considered a reasonable time. The determining factor 
causes us to consider another section of the Code of Civil Procedure in relation 
with the question of the respective rights and powers of an attorney and his 
client.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 27 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<em>Authority to bind their clients</em>.—Lawyers have 
authority to bind their clients in any action or proceeding, by any agreement in 
relation to the cause, made in writing and in entering appeals, and in all 
matters of ordinary judicial procedure. But they cannot, without special 
authority, compromise their client's litigation, or receive anything in 
discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The section just quoted was derived from the Code of the State 
of Georgia (secs. 4417, 4418). Ordinarily, therefore, we would look to the 
decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia for guidance.</p>
<p align="justify">The Supreme Court of Georgia has taken an advanced position 
with reference to the power of an attorney to consent in open court to the entry 
of judgment against his client in a pending cause. It has there been held that 
the counsel representing a party litigant is competent to represent his client 
in agreeing to a consent verdict, and that the judgment so rendered is binding 
upon the client in the absence of fraud or collusion upon the part of the 
counsel with whose consent such verdict and judgment is rendered (Webster vs. 
Dundee Mortgage &amp; Trust Co. [1893],.93 Ga., 278; Adkins vs. Bryant [1909], 
133 Ga., 465). It is to be noted, however, that in one of its more recent 
decisions the Supreme Court of Georgia has receded considerably from its 
previous stand in favor of the power of the lawyer (Davis vs. First Nat. Bank of 
Blakely [1913], 139 Ga., 702; 46 L. R. A. [N. S.], 750). It was there said that 
the Civil Code "does not mean that when a client employs an attorney to bring or 
defend a suit, it ceases to be the client's litigation, that he has no power to 
say whether he will litigate or compromise his suit, and that the attorney 
becomes the owner or absolute master of the litigation, so as to be able to sell 
or give away his client's property rights by contract, in spite of his client. 
This is a very different thing from the management of the litigation and 
agreements connected therewith * * *."</p>
<p align="justify">A comparison of the Georgia statute with the Philippine statute 
discloses certain differences. For example, the Georgia statute is silent as to 
the limitation on lawyers,without special authority, having no right to 
compromise their clients' litigation. As has been pointed out by a number of 
authorities, the compromise of causes and the confession of judgments appear to 
stand upon the same footing. Inasmuch as the compromise may not be effected by 
counsel without special authority, so may not an agreement to permit judgment to 
be entered against his client be authorized except with the knowledge and at the 
instance of the client. The proceedings in Court to enforce the remedy, to bring 
the claim, demand, cause of action, or subject matter of the suit to hearing, 
trial, determination, judgment, and execution, are, within the exclusive control 
of the attorney. The cause of action, the claim or demand sued upon, and the 
subject matter of the litigation are all within the exclusive control of the 
client; and the attorney may not impair, compromise, settle, surrender, or 
destroy them without his client's consent. So when a judgment has been entered 
by consent of an attorney without special authority, it will sometimes be set 
aside or reopened. (6 C. J. pp. 643, 646-648; 76 Am. Dec., p. 259, note Holker 
vs. Parker [1813], 7 Cranch, 436, where it was held by the United States Supreme 
Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, that even though an 
unauthorized compromise by an attorney has assumed the form of a judgment at 
law, the injured party, if his own conduct has been blameless, ought to be 
relieved against it; and Jordan vs. Russell [8 Ohio Dec. Reprint, 467], where a 
verdict and judgment entered upon compromise of a will contest, by an attorney 
for a contestant of the will, without authority, was set aside).</p>
<p align="justify">In connection with a correct disposition of the case the point 
should not be neglected that the rights of minors are involved. In the affidavit 
subscribed by Casimiro Natividad he solemnly avers that his nephews and niece 
have relied upon him to object to the probate of the pretended will and that he 
had agreed to attend to the matter for them. If this be true, it is too plain 
for argument that no lawyer would have the right to bind minors not otherwise 
represented at the hearing.</p>
<p align="justify">We reach the conclusion that while Casimiro Natividad was 
negligent, his negligence under the circumstances of the case was excusable, and 
that the other petitioners have not been negligent. A new trial to bring forth 
all the pertinent evidence would thus be in order. It may be that such a 
proceeding will merely result in prolonging the litigation and that it will 
serve no good purpose. As to that we cannot say. At least a judgment on the 
merits of the case is preferable. In the interests of justice the judgment 
appealed from should be set aside.</p>
<p align="justify">As responsive to the foregoing, the orders of the trial court 
are vacated and the record remanded for trial to determine if the will of 
Gregorio Natividad should be admitted to probate, and without special finding as 
to costs in this instance, it is so ordered.</p><em>Johnson, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</em> and
