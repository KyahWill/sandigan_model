				[ G. R. No. 38171, October 06, 1932</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO MIRANDA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a motion filed by the accused-appellant, Francisco Miranda, praying 
that the present cause be dismissed on the ground that the offended party has 
completely pardoned the offence against her, in accordance with article 344, 
paragraph 3, of the Revised Penal Code. 
<p>The movant was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Rizal for the 
crime of qualified seduction according to article 443 of the old Penal Code, as 
amended by Act No. 1773. </p>
<p>Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code, amending article 443 of the old Penal 
Code as amended by Act No. 1773 provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 344. <i>Prosecution of the crimes of adultery, concubinage, seduction, 
abduction, rape, and acts of lasciviousness.</i>-The crimes of adultery and 
concubinage shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the 
offended spouse. </p>
<p>"The offended party cannot institute criminal prosecution without including 
both the guilty parties, if they are both alive, nor, in any case, if he shall 
have consented or pardoned the offenders. </p>
<p>"The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness, shall 
not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her 
parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been 
expressly pardoned by the above named persons, as the case may be. </p>
<p>"In cases of seduction, abduction, acts of lasciviousness and rape, the 
marriage of the offender with the offended party shall extinguish the criminal 
action or remit the penalty already imposed upon him. The provisions of this 
paragraph shall also be applicable to the coprincipals, accomplices and 
accessories after the fact of the above-mentioned crimes." </p></blockquote>
<p>Paragraph 3 of the legal provision above quoted prohibits a prosecution for 
seduction, abduction, rape, or acts of lasciviousness, except upon a complaint 
made by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in 
any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above-named 
persons, as the case may be. It does not prohibit the continuance of a 
prosecution if the offended party pardons the offender after the cause has been 
instituted, nor does it order the dismissal of said cause. The only act that 
according to article 344 extinguishes the penal action and the penalty that may 
have been imposed, is the marriage between the offender and the offended 
party.</p>
<p>In People vs. Infante, G. R. No. 36270,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> an adultery case, the first division of this 
court, interpreting article 344 with reference to that crime, declared in a 
decision rendered by Justice Malcolm, promulgated on August 31, 1932, that in 
order that the pardon of the aggrieved party may prevent the prosecution of the 
adulterers, it must be granted before and not after the penal action has been 
instituted. </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of the opinion and so hold, 
that the offended party's pardon of the offender in a seduction case after the 
criminal action has been instituted does not extinguish said action according to 
paragraph 3, article 344, of the Revised Penal Code. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the motion for dismissal filed by the accused- appellant in this 
case is hereby denied; So ordered. </p>
<p><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand; Abad Santos, Hull, 
Vickers,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.</i>, concur. </p></div>
