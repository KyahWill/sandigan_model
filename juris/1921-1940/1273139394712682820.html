				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In G. R. No. 262931 between these same parties, a decision was rendered, the amended dispositive part of which, pertinent to  the case in hand, is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"For the  foregoing, it is adjudged:<br><br>(a)  That the right of preference of the appellants  Urquijo, Zuloaga and Escubi is  only on the value (art. 1922, par. No. 1,  of the Civil Code), which must first be proven, of the machinery sold by them to the Capiz Central which has not been paid for and which was included  among other property  of the Capiz Central in the sale of the same;  and that  in no  case must the preference  exceed the sum of thirty thousand pesos  (P30,000), the only amount on which they  claim  a preference.<br><br><center>* * * * * * *<br></center><br>"In virtue whereof, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in so far as it is in harmony herewith and reversed in so far as it is not, and it is ordered that the record be remanded to the court of origin for  further proceedings in accordance herewith."<br></blockquote><br>The case was remanded to the court of origin and after the proper supplementary evidence had been introduced, the said court  rendered its amended decision, the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br><br>"Therefore, reconsidering  the  pertinent part of the decision of the third instant, the court finds that the sum of P19,285.71 &amp;frac57;  is  the unpaid portion of the price of the machinery sold to the Capiz  Central by Urquijo, Zuloaga and Escubi, and that these  creditors  have a preferential right to claim the said sum of P19,285.71&amp;frac57; from the proceeds of the sale of the property of the insolvent Capiz Central. <br><br><blockquote>"Therefore, it is ordered  that when this judgment becomes final, the assignee  in insolvency pay out of the deposited funds of the same, the following sums as  follows:<br><br><blockquote>"1st.  To Urquijo, Zuloaga and Escubi...................P19,285.71 5/7<br>"2d.  To Timoteo Unson and Clara Lacson..........................   30,000.00 <br>"3d. To Jose Altavas............................................................    8,000.00<br>"4th.  To Antonio Belo..................................................   11,000.00 and <br>"5th.  The remainder, if any, is to be  proportionately   divided  among  the other  creditors of this  insolvent company whose claims have been admitted and approved."<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>Claimants  Urquijo, Zuloaga and Escubi  appealed from said judgment,  assigning the  following alleged error as committed by the trial court in  its  decision, to wit:  The trial court erred in not finding that the appellants' preferential right for the purpose of collecting the unpaid price of their machinery sold to the Capiz Central is upon the sum ofP30,000, obtained by the latter from the sale of said machinery; and in not ordering said sum  to be  paid to them,  but on  the contrary, limiting said preference  and payment to the sum of P19,285.71 5/7<br><br>The  only  question, then, to  determine in the  present appeal  is whether, as the lower court held, the appellants' preferential  right on account of the unpaid balance of the price of the  machinery is limited only to the proportional part  of the  machinery still unpaid, or,  as the appellants contend, their preferential right for the  unpaid balance of the purchase price of the said machinery extends to all of the machinery.<br><br>Paragraph No. 1 of article 1922 of the Civil Code, in regard  to this question, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Art. 1922.  With respect to determinate personal property of the debtor, the following are preferred:<br><br>"1. Credits for the  *   *   *  purchase price of personal property in  the possession of the debtor, to the  extent of the value of the same."<br></blockquote><br>The basic  principle  of  the preference established by the above legal provision is one of equity and justice.<br><br><blockquote>"While the price was unpaid, the purchaser's patrimony increased at  the expense  of the vendor; the latter becomes in the end a gratuitous surety for the purchaser's  creditors, for the personal  property sold is a  pledge from which the creditors might  collect  their credit without any  reason whatever unless  the preference is  established; that  is  to say, that the vendor has a preference because he has placed the thing among the purchaser's patrimony."  (25 <i>Enciclopedia Juridica Española</i>,, p. 362.)  "Without the sale,— the tribune Grenier used to  say, in the tribuneship,—the thing sold could not have become a pledge to the other creditors.   The latter should, therefore, first of  all, fulfill the obligation devolving on the debtor."   (5  Colin y  Capitant, <i>Curso Elemental  de Derecho Civil</i>, p. 182.)<br></blockquote><br>If this is so,  the other debtors (creditors)  cannot collect from  the proceeds of  the resale of the personal  property until the original vendor of the same has  been paid the full price  of the original sale, to the extent of the price  of  said personal property in the resale.  This preference  stands whether the  purchase price has been partially paid or not at all; because the law makes no distinction, and we cannot make it without impairing said preference, which would be the case if, when partial payment has been made, the preference were limited only to a part of the personal property sold proportionate to the unpaid portion of the purchase price; or, what amounts  to the same thing, if said preference were limited to what remains of the personal property sold after  deducting a part proportionate to the price already  paid.<br><br>Equity  and justice demand then that Urquijo, Zuloaga and Escubi be allowed to collect their credit out of the total proceeds of the machinery sold on account of the insolvency, in preference to the other creditors.  Such  is the spirit of the judgment of this court in case G. R. No. 26293, between these same parties.<br><br><br>This  same rule was followed in the case of the claim of H. E. Heacock Company  against Luis Perez Samanillo in the voluntary insolvency of Rafael Rebullida,  R,  G. No. 27706, decided by this court on December 12, 1927.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  In that case, H. E. Heacock Company claimed a preferential right to the goods sold by it to Rebullida, which were in the latter's  possession, for the  unpaid balance  of the purchase price.<br><br>In conclusion, then, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the vendor's preferential right to the purchase price of the personal property sold extends to  all of said property, whether such purchase price has been partially paid or not, while said personal property remains in his possession, and to the extent of its value.<br><br>By virtue whereof, the judgment  appealed  from is reversed,  and it is held that the appellants Urquijo, Zuloaga and Escubi  have the right to collect their credit of P30,000 from the  total  proceeds of the sale of the machinery made by the  assignee who is hereby ordered to make said payment, without special pronouncement as to costs.  So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avancena,  C.J., Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Johns, JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> H.E.
