				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This
is an original petition for the writ of certiorari whereby the
petitioners, Federico Eleazar and the seven others, seek to be relieved
from the effects of an order entered by Judge Francisco Zandueta under
date of August 4, 1925, in an election contest pending in the Court of
First Instance of the Province of Pangasinan, whereby his Honor
admitted the respondents Agustin Bo√±golan and nine others as
interveners in the contest mentioned, conditioned upon the execution by
them of a bond in the amount of P500 to answer for costs in the cause.
The respondents, having been cited by this court, interposed an answer,
and the cause is here submitted for the determination of the issues
thus presented.
  <p> It appears that on June 8, 1925, the
municipal board of canvassers of the municipality of Urdaneta, Province
of Pangasinan, proclaimed the election of the herein petitioners and
six others as councillors for the municipality of Urdaneta for the
current term, 1925-1928. On June 12, 1925, Joaquin Agsalud, one of the
defeated candidates for the office of councillor, started a contest
over the election for the office mentioned, being civil case No. 4391,
of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan. In this motion of contest
only the candidates proclaimed as elected by the municipal board of
canvassers were named as protestees and impleaded, in conformity with
the first paragraph of section 481 of the Election Law, as amended by
Act No. 3210 of the Philippine Legislature. On June 18, 1925, a number
of defeated candidates for the same office, who had not been made
parties to the contest, namely, Agustin Bongolan and nine associates,
appeared in the contest proceeding and filed therein a writing entitled
"Motion of Protest, (<em>Mocion Protesta</em>)" in which they declared
that they had been candidates for the office mentioned, "with
certificates of candidacy duly registered" and alleged that they
adhered to the motion of protest and asked the court to treat them as
interested parties in the cause.</p>
  <p>    It appears that the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan consists of two <em>salas</em>,
the first of which is presided over by Judge C. M. Villareal, and the
second by Judge Francisco Zandueta. When the matter of the contest
first came before the court for consideration it was submitted in the
first sala, before Judge Villareal. Upon this occasion Bongolan and his
nine associates, whom we shall hereafter call interveners, filed
another writing, called their "answer," dated July 8, 1925, in which
they made certain allegations in the character of amendments to their
previous motion. In this pleading the interveners joined issue with the
allegations contained in the special defense which had been put in by
the contestees, and it was alleged that in various named precincts of
the municipality on election day votes were illegally taken away from
the interveners and others and counted in favor of the protestees. The
attorney for the protestees moved the court to strike both the motion
and answer of the interveners, on the ground that the admission of the
interveners as parties to the cause was unprecedented and improper and
that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain said pleadings or to
admit the interveners to the status of litigants in any concept. Upon
consideration of this motion, his Honor, Judge Villareal, came to the
conclusion that the motion to strike interposed by the protestees was
well founded; and he accordingly, on July 9, 1925, ordered the answer
to be stricken from the file.</p>
  <p> It further appears that there
is a conventional rule adopted by the two judges and in force in the
Court of First Instance of Pangasinan by which all election contests
affecting any particular municipality of Pangasinan are assigned to the
same <em>sala</em>, and if it occurs that there are more than one case from the same municipality they are all placed in the <em>sala</em>
determined by the lowest number borne by any of the series. It appears
further that at the time of the pendency of this protest there was
another protest from the municipality of Urdaneta over the office of
president, bearing a lower number than case No. 4391, and this lower
number pertained to the second <em>sala</em>. As a consequence case No. 4391 was transferred, pursuant to the rule mentioned, to the second <em>sala</em>, thereby passing to the court of Judge Zandueta.</p>
  <p>
Upon the making of the order of July 9, 1925, by Judge Villareal, the
interveners promptly filed a motion for reconsideration of the order,
and this motion was not acted upon by Judge Villareal but came before
Judge Zandueta, who, on August 4, 1925, reconsidered the order of Judge
Villareal and permitted the two writings, namely, the motion protest
and answer of the interveners, which had been impugned by the
protestees, to stand; and he allowed the intervention, upon the making
of a bond in the amount of P500 by the interveners to answer for costs.
The protestees in turn asked for the reconsideration of this order but
this motion was denied by Judge Francisco Zandueta on August 15, 1925;
and on September 12, thereafter, the protestees presented this petition
for the writ of certiorari to be relieved from Judge Zandueta's order.</p>
  <p>
The first point relied upon by the petitioners relates to the authority
of Judge Zandueta to reconsider the order previously entered by Judge
Villareal; and in this connection reliance is placed upon Gabigao and
Izquierdo <i>vs.</i> Del Rosario and Lim (44 Phil., 182), and Jerez <i>vs.</i> Wislizenus, G. R. No. 22915,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
wherein this court has declared that the judges presiding in the
different branches of the Court of First Instance in districts having
more than one branch have no authority upon their own motion to
abrogate orders lawfully made in another branch in an action or
proceeding properly assigned to the latter.</p>
  <p> A moment's
reflection will show that the doctrine above announced by this court
has reference to the power of a court to act upon orders which are at
the time pending before the judge of another <em>sala</em>. The
situation involved in the present case involves no anomaly of this
sort. In the case before us a cause that had been pending before the
first branch of the court of Pangasinan was regularly transferred to
the second branch. Judge Villareal was competent to exercise judicial
authority in the matter so long as the case remained before him; and
after It passed to the second branch Judge Zandueta had full power to
act judicially upon any aspect of the case brought before him. If the
contest had remained in the first branch Judge Villareal would have had
power to reconsider and reverse his first order; and after the case
passed to the second branch, Judge Zandueta had the same power. It
cannot be pretended that by the transfer of the case the judicial power
to act upon the, motion of reconsideration had vanished. That power was
vested in Judge Zandueta; and if Judge Villareal had attempted to pass
upon this motion of reconsideration after the cause had passed to the
branch of his associate there would have been just ground for the
contention that action had been taken without power. It is quite
obvious that there is no friction here between the judges of the two
branches in Pangasinan, and we are of the opinion that Judge Zandueta
acted in the matter with proper authority.</p>
  <p> The second
contention of the petitioners has relation to the right of the
interveners to come into the case, and to the legal sufficiency of the
writings called motion protest and answer of the interveners. As to the
right of a defeated candidate for the office of councillor, who had not
been impleaded in a contest over the office, to intervene therein, we
are of the opinion that the point is determined by the express
provision of law. In paragraph 5 of section 481 of the Election Law, as
amended by section 27 of Act No. 3210, it is declared "The candidate
whose election is contested and <em>all other registered candidates voted for</em> may reply thereto, * * *." It is true that in the <em>proviso</em>
to the first paragraph of the same section it is provided that in
contests over the office of councillor, "it shall be sufficient to
summon the candidates proclaimed elected by the municipal board." But
this does not mean that defeated candidates are thereby excluded from
the right to intervene; and the fact that the defeated candidates are
not required to be impleaded supplies the obvious explanation for the
use of the expression "all other registered candidates voted for,"
which we have quoted from the fifth paragraph of the same section.</p>
  <p>
There can be no doubt, then, that the motion protest of June 18 gave
the Court of First Instance jurisdiction to admit the interveners in
the cause, and Judge Zandueta committed no error in recognizing their
status as such upon the showing made in that writing. Nor did the
circumstance that the "answer," so called, of the interveners was not
filed within fifteen days after the filing of the motion of protest
deprive the court of jurisdiction. In this connection it will be noted
that the last mentioned writing was more than a mere appearance; it was
truly an intervention, and though lacking in detail, it was capable of
amendment. This was attempted in the answer; and it is noteworthy that
there is a consistency between the two writings, in that they align the
interveners with the contestees.</p>
  <p> What has been said suffices
to demonstrate that Judge Zandueta had jurisdiction to make the order
which gave rise to this petition. It follows that this court should not
interfere with what has been done by the writ of certiorari. Other
considerations arise which appear to us to relate rather to the merit
of the order complained of than to the jurisdiction of the court, but
with this aspect of the case we have no concern, since we have no
authority in this proceeding to entertain such considerations, and
indeed we have no authority in a protest of this kind even to review
the judgment or orders of the lower court upon appeal.</p>
  <p>    The petition will therefore be dismissed, and it is so ordered, with costs against the petitioners.</p>
   <i>Avance√±a, C. J., Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez</i>, and <i>Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.
