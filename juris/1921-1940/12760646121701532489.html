				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the original complaint&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Alfonso&nbsp; de Castelvi against the Compañia General de&nbsp; Tabacos&nbsp; de Filipinas on April 17, 1922, he prayed&nbsp; that the Court of First Instance of Tarlac render judgment ordering&nbsp; the defendant company to pay&nbsp; him the sum of P12,897.50 as damages&nbsp; for breach&nbsp; of contract,&nbsp; plus legal interest from the date&nbsp; of the filing of the complaint, and the costs of the action.<br><br>The defendant company filed a demurrer upon the ground that the complaint was uncertain,&nbsp; and after the court sustained&nbsp; said&nbsp; demurrer,&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 23, 1922, amended&nbsp; his&nbsp; complaint.<br><br>The defendant company, in answering the amended&nbsp; complaint, denied each and every fact alleged therein.<br><br>The case having been called for trial and the evidence introduced by both&nbsp; parties, the plaintiff prayed for permission of the&nbsp; court to present a second amendment to the&nbsp; complaint for the purpose of making the allegations conform to the&nbsp; facts proven,&nbsp; which amendment was filed on January&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1925.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; grant&nbsp; said permission and&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 30, 1925 rendered judgment absolving the Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas from the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; without any special&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>The plaintiff&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; said&nbsp; judgment, assigning the&nbsp; following supposed errors as&nbsp; committed by the&nbsp; trial court, to wit:&nbsp; (1) In not admitting the second amended complaint&nbsp; presented by the plaintiff on January 26, 1925, in order to make the&nbsp; allegations conform to the facts proven at the trial of this case; (2) in not holding that the plaintiff&nbsp; suffered&nbsp; the damages&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; second amended complaint&nbsp; amounting to P25,808.61;&nbsp; (3) in holding&nbsp; that Adrian Got, the manager of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Hacienda </span>Luisita, and not the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; company,&nbsp; was personally&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; the damages caused the plaintiff by the illegal prohibition made by him to the plaintiff on April 19, 1920, and (4)&nbsp; in denying&nbsp; the motion for a new trial dated May 23, 1925,&nbsp; presented by the plaintiff.<br><br>In regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; first assignment&nbsp; of error,&nbsp; it appears from the record that after having presented evidence tending to show greater damages than those alleged in the original,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; in&nbsp; the amended complaint, the&nbsp; plaintiff attempted to&nbsp; file&nbsp; a second amended complaint in which he claimed damages amounting&nbsp; to&nbsp; P25,808.61,&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; greater amount than that alleged in the original complaint, in order to make the allegations conform to the facts proven at the trial of the action.<br><br>The plaintiff-appellant contends that, in accordance with the letter&nbsp; and spirit of section 110&nbsp; of the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure,&nbsp; he had the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; file said amendment&nbsp; and the court the obligation to admit it.&nbsp; In regard to amending the complaint after the introduction of evidence, the provision of section 109 of the same Code&nbsp; must&nbsp; be taken into consideration, which authorizes such amendment when important variance exists between the allegations and the facts&nbsp; proven for the purpose of making the former conform to the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be noted, however, that&nbsp; the obligation imposed upon the court in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 110 in connection with section 109 refers to the case in which&nbsp; the court finds&nbsp; important facts&nbsp; to have been proven to which the allegations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the amended&nbsp; complaint must be&nbsp; made to conform and&nbsp; not&nbsp; simply to probatory&nbsp; facts. The facts to which the plaintiff tried to conform&nbsp; the allegations of the complaint&nbsp; by means of&nbsp; a second amendment thereto were&nbsp; not found by the court to have been&nbsp; proven, and in refusing to admit&nbsp; said&nbsp; second amendment it committed no&nbsp; error of law.<br><br>In&nbsp; regard to the second assignment of error,&nbsp; the facts show&nbsp; that&nbsp; Antonio Inchausti, acting manager of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Hacienda </span>Luisita&nbsp; of the defendant company in the&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Tarlac,&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; letter dated&nbsp; July&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1919,&nbsp; granted&nbsp; the herein plaintiff-appellant the right&nbsp; to cut firewood in the forests of said&nbsp; hacienda until June 30, 1920, with the condition that&nbsp; he would&nbsp; not&nbsp; use the tenants, the&nbsp; carabaos or the wagons&nbsp; on said <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda </span>for the transportation of the wood, nor&nbsp; interfere in&nbsp; any manner with their&nbsp; work. Adrian Got, having again assumed the management of the hacienda,&nbsp; was&nbsp; surprised&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 9, 1920 to&nbsp; receive&nbsp; a bill from the&nbsp; plaintiff and appellant for the wood that the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda </span>had&nbsp; used.&nbsp; After investigating the reasons for said bill and discovering the existence&nbsp; of the concession,&nbsp; he notified the main office in Manila of the&nbsp; facts, which gave instructions to suspend whatever permit the plaintiff might have to cut wood on the hacienda, effective May&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1921.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instructions of the main office were&nbsp; communicated by letter&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant under date of April 19, 1920, which resulted in&nbsp; a correspondence between the manager and the concessionaire and between the latter and the officers of the company with a view to reaching a settlement,&nbsp; and upon&nbsp; request of Mr. Antonio&nbsp; Correa,&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the&nbsp; officers of&nbsp; said&nbsp; company, Alfonso de Castelvi, under date of May&nbsp; 5, 1920,&nbsp; submitted a statement of the amount of&nbsp; the&nbsp; wood that he needed to cut and what had already been cut and the place where it was piled.&nbsp; Mr. Antonio Correa, in a letter dated May 13, 1920,&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; to&nbsp; almost all of the requests&nbsp; contained in the plaintiff-appellant's letter, but placed the limit of the wood to be cut at 1,300 cords, prohibiting&nbsp; him from using anything&nbsp; belonging to&nbsp; the&nbsp; hacienda.&nbsp; After this letter, or from May&nbsp; 13, 1920, nothing more was heard of the matter&nbsp; until&nbsp; two&nbsp; years&nbsp; later or on April&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1922, when Alfonso de Castelvi filed the&nbsp; herein complaint.&nbsp; It does not appear that the plaintiff made any&nbsp; objection to the limit placed by Mr. Antonio Correa upon the amount of the firewood that he would be permitted&nbsp; to cut until the end of the month of June, 1920;&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; it can be presumed that he agreed to said counter-proposition made by Mr.&nbsp; Antonio Correa.<br><br>The contention made by Alfonso&nbsp; de&nbsp; Castelvi&nbsp; as to the damages said to have been caused by the suspension of the concession&nbsp; made&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor is&nbsp; clearly untenable after the defendant company had conceded him all the facilities in order that he might comply with his obligations, entered into during the time&nbsp; said concession was in force, to furnish various firms and persons with firewood.<br><br>His contention is also groundless to the&nbsp; effect that the manager of the hacienda,.Adrian Got, prevented him from taking the wood already cut and piled at different places on the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda</span>, not only because such prohibition was denied, but because the plaintiff-appellant had not presented any complaint to that effect to the officers of the company who had authorized him to continue cutting the firewood on the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda </span>until June 30, 1920, and to carry it away.&nbsp; Even if it&nbsp; were true,&nbsp; therefore, that the manager of the hacienda, Adrian Got, had prevented the plaintiff from carrying away the firewood&nbsp; cut and piled&nbsp; on the hacienda and he had thereby suffered damages, no&nbsp; liability can&nbsp; be&nbsp; enforced against&nbsp; the company for the&nbsp; reason that he&nbsp; did nothing&nbsp; tending to prevent&nbsp; said damages&nbsp; or at least to minimize them, when he&nbsp; could&nbsp; have done so by&nbsp; appealing to the officers of the company for relief.<br><br>The rest of the&nbsp; assignments&nbsp; of error are mere consequences&nbsp; of the previous&nbsp; ones&nbsp; for which reason it is&nbsp; unnecessary to discuss them.<br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing and not finding&nbsp; any error in the judgment&nbsp; appealed from, the same is affirmed in all its parts, with the costs against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña,&nbsp; C. J., Street,&nbsp; Malcolm, Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
