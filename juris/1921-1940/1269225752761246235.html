<p> plus the further sum of P100 alleged to be a fine of 10 per cent of
the license fees due as above-mentioned, in view of the alleged failure
of defendant to pay the total amount of said license fees before
commencing business in the aforesaid establishments for the period from
July 1, 1932 to June 30, 1933;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "6. That defendant, before commencing business for
the period of July 1, 1932 to June 30, 1933, paid to plaintiff the sum
of P500 alleging that this sum is the maximum amount which said
defendant is legally bound to pay to plaintiff for license fees for the
said period, on the establishments mentioned in paragraph 3 hereof, in
view of the provisions of section 2444 of the Revised Administrative
Code, as amended by Act No. 3669 of the Philippine Legislature ;</p>
  <p>
"7. That the parties hereby submit this stipulation for decision of
this Honorable Court without taking further evidence, after the parties
have filed their respective memoranda within the time which may be
allowed by this Honorable Court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant
license fees in the sum of Pl,000, which the latter's three
establishments should pay during the year beginning with July 1, 1932,
and ending with June 30, 1933.</p>
<p> The defendant appealed from the judgment which declared it liable
for the license fees claimed in the complaint and ordered it to pay the
sum of P500, having already paid P500, plus the penalty in the sum of
P60, with costs.</p>
<p> In brief, the question raised and submitted for resolution is
whether the defendant is bound to pay license fees for each of its
establishments situated and conducted at different places within the
City of Manila, or merely an amount not exceeding P500 a year, in the
same concept.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Section 1453 of the Revised Administrative Code of 1917 created privilege taxes on business and occupation, as follows:<br>
      <br>
"SEC. 1453. <em>Privilege taxes on business and occupation.</em>â€”
A privilege tax must be paid before any business or occupation
hereinafter specified can be lawfully begun or pursued. The tax on
business is payable for every separate or distinct establishment or
place where business subject to the tax is conducted; and one
occupation or line of business does not become exempt by being
conducted with some other occupation or business for which such tax has
been paid.</p>
  <p> "The occupation tax must be paid by each
individual engaged in a calling subject thereto; the tax on a business,
by the persons, firm, or company conducting the same."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Based upon said legal provision, the City of Manila, in 1927, approved section 585 of the Revised Ordinances which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "No person shall conduct more than one kind of
business requiring a license, or conduct business at more than one
place during the term of license, without obtaining a separate license
for each business and place of business so licensed. All licenses shall
be strictly limited to the time, place, and person or thing named
therein."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Section 2 of Act No. 3669 of the Philippine Legislature amended
section 2444 of the Revised Administrative Code, which empowered the
City of Manila to collect license fees from <em>dealers</em> in specific articles or merchandise, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 2. Two new subsections are hereby inserted
between subsections (m and n) of section twenty-four hundred forty-four
of the Revised Administrative Code, which shall be known as subsections
(<em>m</em>-1) and (<em>m</em>-2) and shall read as follows:</p>
  <p> "(<em>m</em>-1)
To tax and fix the license fee of tailor shops, milliners,
manufacturers of embroideries, sails or awnings or both, rope, paper,
slippers or sandals or both, harness or valises or bags or any of them,
textiles, shell lamps or lamp shades or both, statuettes or tomb stones
or both, sacks, rattan goods, wire or brass beds or both, men's shirts,
hats, printers or bookbinders or both, eye-glasses or optical goods or
both, dyes, bottles or glasswares or both, salted or dried fish or
both, fertilizer, nails, and buttons."</p>
  <p> "Manufacturers above mentioned shall not be subject to the payment of any municipal tax or license fee as retail <em>dealers</em>
of their own wares otherwise therein specified: Provided, That no tax
shall be imposed upon any occupation or manufacturer enumerated under
this subsection in excess of two hundred pesos per annum: And provided,
further, That any manufacturing conducted solely by the immediate
members of a family at their own home shall not be subject to any tax
or license fee.</p>
  <p> "(<em>m</em>-2) To tax and fix the license fee on (<em>a</em>) <em>dealers</em> in new automobiles or accessories or both, and (<em>b</em>) retail <em>dealers</em> in new (not yet used) merchandise, which <em>dealers</em> are not yet subject to the payment of any municipal tax.</p>
  <p> "For the purpose of taxation, these retail <em>dealers</em> shall be classified as (1) retail <em>dealers</em> in general merchandise and (2) retail <em>dealers</em> exclusively engaged in the sale of (<em>a</em>) textiles including knitted wares, (<em>b</em>) hardwares including glasswares, cooking utensils, electrical goods and construction materials, (<em>c</em>) groceries including toilet articles except perfumery, (<em>d</em>) drugs including medicines and perfumeries, (<em>e</em>) books, including stationery, paper and office supplies, (<em>f</em>) jewelry, (<em>g</em>) slippers, (<em>k</em>) arms, ammunitions, and sporting goods: <em>Provided, however, </em>That the combined total tax of any dealer, or manufacturer, or both, enumerated under these subsections (<em>m</em>-1) and (<em>m</em>-2) whether dealing in one or all of the articles mentioned herein, <em>shall not be in excess of five hundred pesos per annum."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In pursuance of said Act, the City of Manila promulgated Ordinance
No. 1925, as amended, under which the defendant, by reason of the
amount of its sales, was bound to pay P250 on its business conducted in
the National City Bank Building, P250 on that on Echague Street and
P500 on that on Isla de Romero Street.</p>
<p> The defendant contends that under the saving clause contained in
the last paragraph of section 2 of Act No. 3669, it is bound to pay
only the sum of P500 as combined license fees for its three
establishments. It contends that according to the language of the law,
the fees are imposed upon <em>dealers</em> irrespective of the number
of articles or merchandise in which they deal, or the number of their
establishments or business. This court is of the opinion that that is
not the meaning of the law. The law clearly grants the benefit or
privilege of combined fees to the articles or merchandise enumerated
therein, but not to the business or establishments created and
conducted in different places, although they belong to the same dealer.
In other words, the privilege is based not on the plurality of business
or establishments but on the variety of articles or merchandise. For
this reason, this court is of the opinion and so declares that section
585 of the Revised Ordinances and Ordinance No. 1925, as amended, are
not in conflict with, and should not be understood as contrary to, Act
No. 3669.</p>
<p> The judgment orders the defendant to pay a penalty of P60, having
failed to pay the fees on time. The law authorizes the imposition of a
penalty of only ten per cent (10%). The sum to which the plaintiff is
entitled in this concept cannot exceed P50.</p>
<p> Wherefore, it being understood that the defendant shall pay a
penalty of only P50 instead of P60, the appealed judgment is affirmed
in all other respects, with the costs of this instance against the
defendant. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villa-Real, Abad Santos,</em> and <em>Vickers, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<p> <strong>GODDARD,</strong> <em>J.,</em> with whom concurs <strong>BUTTE,</strong> <em>J., </em>dissenting:</p>
<p> I dissent.<br>
    <br>
  Section 585 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila was enacted in the year 1927.</p>
<p> Act No. 3669 of the Philippine Legislature was enacted December 8,
1929, and amends section 2444 of Chapter X of the Revised
Administrative Code. Chapter X is the Charter of the City of Manila.</p>
<p> The authorities agree that a municipal corporation is a creature of
granted powers and that as such it can exercise only such powers as
fall within the scope of, and not in conflict with its charter.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The charter of the city of St. Louis is the
fundamental law thereof, and all ordinances of the city, which are in
conflict therewith, or violative of its mandates, are null and void,
upon the same principle that a statute which contravenes the
Constitution must fall." (Asphalt &amp; Granitoid Const. Co. <em>vs.</em> Hauessler, 201 Mo., 400; 100 S1. W., 14, 16.)</p>
  <p>
"Hence a city ordinance which does not comply with the city charter is
as invalid as a statute which does not conform to the requirements of
the state constitution. The charter of every municipal corporation, or
the statute by which it is created, is its organic act; and the
corporation cannot do any act not authorized by such charter, or by
some legislative act applicable thereto. 'All acts beyond the scope of
the powers granted are void. 1 Dill. Mun. Corp. (4th ed.), p. 146, sec.
89." (People <em>vs.</em> Mount, 58 N. E., 360, 363.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <em>See also</em> Kemp <em>vs.</em> Monett, 95 Mo. A., 452; 69 S. W., 31, 32; Miller <em>vs.</em> Burch, 32 Tex., 208; 5 Am. R., 242; Angell and Ames on Corporations, 97; Sedgwick on Stat. and Cons. Law, p. 466.<br>
    <br>
In view of the above it follows that if there is a conflict between
section 585 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila and Act No.
3669 of the Philippine Legislature the provisions of the latter must
control.</p>
<p> Section 585, Revised Ordinances, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "No person shall conduct more than one kind of
business requiring a license, or conduct business at more than one
place during the term of license, without obtaining a separate license
for each business and place of business so licensed. All licenses shall
be strictly limited to the time, place, and person or thing named
therein."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Subsection (<em>m</em>-2) of section 2 of Act No. 3669 reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "To tax and fix the license fee on (<em>a</em>) <em>dealers</em> in new automobiles or accessories or both, and (<em>b</em>) retail <em>dealers</em> in new (not yet used) merchandise, which <em>dealers</em> are not yet subject to the payment of any municipal tax.</p>
  <p> "For the purpose of taxation, these retail <em>dealers</em> shall be classified as (1) retail <em>dealers</em> in general merchandise and (2) retail <em>dealers</em> exclusively engaged in the sale of (a) textiles including knitted wares, (<em>b</em>) hardwares including glasswares, cooking utensils, electrical goods and construction materials, (<em>c</em>) groceries including toilet articles except perfumery, (<em>d</em>) drugs including medicines and perfumeries, (<em>e</em>) books, including stationery, paper and office supplies, (<em>f</em>) jewelry, (<em>g</em>) slippers, (<em>h</em>)
arms, ammunitions, and sporting goods: Provided, however, That the
combined total tax of any dealer, or manufacturer, or both, enumerated
under these subsections (<em>m</em>-1) and (<em>m</em>-2) whether dealing in one or all of the articles mentioned herein, shall not be in excess of five hundred pesos per annum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under Ordinance 1925 of the City of Manila, which purports to have
been enacted in pursuance of Act No. 3669, that city insists that it is
entitled, in view of section 585 of its Revised Ordinances, to require
the defendant to procure a license for each of its three establishments
and, if the sales at each one of its places of business reach a certain
amount, that it is also entitled to collect as much as P500 from each
establishment.</p>
<p> Act No. 3669 was adopted for the purpose of authorizing the municipal board of the City of Manila to impose a tax on <em>dealers</em>,
classified therein according to the articles of merchandise sold by
them to the public. The Legislature deemed it necessary to limit that
authority. This limitation appears in the last clause of subsection
(m-2), quoted above, which provides that "the combined total tax of any
dealer, * * * enumerated under these subsections (<em>m</em>-1) and (<em>m</em>-2), whether dealing in one or all of the articles mentioned herein, shall not be in excess of five hundred pesos per annum."</p>
<p> If the Philippine Legislature had added to the clause quoted above
the following "for each place of business or establishment of such
dealer" the majority opinion would be correct. As the Legislature did
not see fit to modify the clear meaning of the last clause of
subsection (mr-2) of section 2 of Act No. 3669 I cannot agree to what I
consider a judicial amendment to that subsection.</p>
<p> It will be noted that section 585 of the Revised Ordinances of the
City of Manila provides for "a separate license for each business and
place of business so licensed" but is silent as to the amount of the
tax to be imposed, while subsection (<em>m</em>-2) of Act No. 3669
fixes P500 as maximum tax to be paid by each dealer whether he deals in
one or all of the articles mentioned in subsections (<em>m</em>-1) and (<em>m</em>-2) and regardless of the number of his places of business.</p>
<p> Granting that the City of Manila may require a dealer to secure a
separate license under section 585 for each and every one of his places
of business, it is evident, under the last clause of subsection (<em>m</em>-2)
of Act No. 3669, that said city has no right to require such dealer to
pay more than a maximum license fee of more than P500.</p>
<p> The trial court erred in holding that the defendant may be required
to pay license fees in excess of P500 and in not dismissing the
complaint in this case. The judgment should be reversed.
