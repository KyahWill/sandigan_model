				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Prior to the month of January, 1931, the plaintiff 
Asturias Sugar Central, Inc., and the defendant Pure Cane Molasses Co., 
entered into a contract, Exhibit A, whereby the former bound itself to 
sell and the latter to buy all the molasses which the said plaintiff 
would produce at the prices and under the conditions specified therein, 
one of which was that the defendant deposit the sum of P6,000 in the 
Bank of the Philippine Islands as security for compliance with the terms
 of the contract, which the said defendant did. In an action which the 
plaintiff later brought against the defendant for the amendment of the 
contract Exhibit A, the latter, in its answer, filed on January 14, 
1931, raised the Question relative to its right to cancel the contract 
upon payment of the sum of P6,000 in accordance with the terms thereof, 
alleging that it had made a demand on the plaintiff to accept the 
cancellation and to receive the sum of P6,000, which said plaintiff 
refused. Consequently, it prayed that the plaintiff be ordered to accept
 the said sum of P6,000 and that the contract Exhibit A be declared 
cancelled. The lower court rendered judgment therein holding, among 
other things, that the terms of the contract Exhibit A did not authorize
 the defendant to cancel it and, therefore, the cancellation was not in 
order. On appeal, this court reversed the judgment of the trial court 
and held that, under the terms of the contract, the defendant had the 
right to cancel it at any time upon payment of the sum of P6,000, which 
had been deposited in the Bank of the Philippine Islands for this and 
other purposes. Upon the filing of a motion for reconsideration the 
judgment of this court was ratified by resolution of this court of 
December 31, 1932, which further declared that the contract was deemed 
cancelled only on November 18, 1932, the date when the defendant 
deposited the sum of P6,000 with the clerk of the court and when the 
cancellation was consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><p align="justify"> After the former case was remanded to the lower 
court, the plaintiff brought another action against the defendant on 
February 3, 1933, for the recovery of the sum of P72,569.28. This sum 
represented the alleged damages suffered by the plaintiff by reason of 
the refusal of the defendant to purchase the molasses which it had 
produced from the month of January, 1931, to November 18, 1932. The 
trial court dismissed the complaint and absolved the defendant 
therefrom. From this judgment the plaintiff took the appeal now under 
consideration.</p>
<p align="justify"> Although the judgment rendered by this court in the 
former case was not unanimous, it is now <em>res judicata</em> that the 
defendant had the option to cancel the contract at any time upon payment
 of the sum of P6,000, in accordance with the terms of the document 
Exhibit A. However, the judgment of this court in the sense that the 
contract was deemed cancelled on November 18, 1932, implies that the 
contract in question was in force prior to that date. Therefore, the 
whole question raised in this appeal hinges on whether or not the 
plaintiff has the right to demand from the defendant the payment of the 
amount claimed by it as damages resulting from the defendant's refusal 
to purchase the molasses it had produced from the month of January, 
1931, to November, 1932, and which said defendant was bound to purchase 
under the contract which was in force during that period.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is an established fact that the defendant 
demanded the cancellation of the contract and tendered payment of the 
sum of P6,000 in consideration thereof. The very answer of the 
defendant, which was filed in the former case on January 14, 1931, is an
 express demand for cancellation and a formal tender of the sum of 
P6,000. This demand and tender were all that the defendant needed to 
make in order that the plaintiff would be obliged to give its consent to
 the cancellation. It was not necessary for the defendant to deposit the
 sum of P6,000 with the clerk of the court merely because the plaintiff 
refused to accept it. The tender made by the defendant in good faith was
 sufficient. Article 1176 <em>et seq.</em> of the Civil Code requiring 
the deposit of the thing due with the clerk of the court, are not 
applicable to this case on the ground that they refer to the payment of a
 debt. In this case the defendant owed the plaintiff nothing. The said 
sum of P6,000 was not a debt of the defendant but merely a consideration
 for the cancellation of the contract previously agreed upon. The 
payment thereof constituted the obligation to be performed by the 
defendant, and the cancellation of the contract, the corresponding 
obligation to be performed by the plaintiff. The defendant was not 
obliged to pay the sum of P6,000 before the plaintiff cancelled the 
contract, just as the plaintiff was not obliged to cancel the contract 
before the defendant paid the sum of P6,000. Both are reciprocal 
obligations which should have been performed simultaneously. In 
principle, the defendant's obligation to pay the sum of P6,000 to the 
plaintiff for the cancellation of the contract is the same as that of 
the vendor in a contract of sale with the right of repurchase to refund 
the purchase price to the purchaser, for the purposes of the resale, in 
which case this court has held that deposit of the repurchase price is 
not necessary to compel the purchaser to make the resale, if he refuses 
to accept it. (Villegas <em><em>vs.</em> </em> Capistrano, 9 Phil., 
416.)</p>
<p align="justify"> Furthermore, this court is of the opinion that the 
offer of the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P6,000 was 
made in good faith, taking into consideration, particularly, the fact 
that said sum had been deposited in a bank at the disposal of the 
plaintiff, for the purpose, among other things, of the cancellation of 
the contract.</p>
<p align="justify"> If, according to the judgment of this court in the 
former case, Exhibit A grants the defendant the option to cancel the 
contract at any time, upon payment of the sum of P€,000, and if the 
defendant demanded such cancellation offering to pay said sum in good 
faith, the plaintiff in refusing to consent to such cancellation, 
violated the contract. Such being the case, the plaintiff has no cause 
of action against the defendant because it is based on the alleged 
obligation of the said defendant to purchase its molasses during the 
period in which such obligation would not have existed, had not the 
plaintiff, in violation of the contract, refused the cancellation 
thereof. In such case, the plaintiff derives its cause of action from 
its own violation thereof. To recognize the validity of such cause of 
action would be to sanction and legalize such breach. On the other hand,
 such breach of contract cannot be the source of rights. Had the 
contract been cancelled in January, 1931, when the defendant demanded 
its cancellation, as it had a right to do, there would have been no 
contract to be complied with by the defendant from that date and the 
plaintiff's cause of action could not have been based on the cancelled 
contract. Plaintiff's violation of that contract by refusing to cancel 
the same cannot now be the basis of its cause of action.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby 
affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>

  <strong> IMPERIAL, </strong><em>J., </em>with whom concur <strong>MALCOLM,
 VILLA-REAL, </strong>and <strong>ABAD SANTOS, </strong><em>JJ., </em>dissenting:</p>
<p align="justify"> On March 21, 1929, the plaintiff entered into a 
written contract with the defendant whereby the latter bound itself to 
purchase from 200,000 to 400,000 gallons of molasses from the former at 
the rate of four (4) centavos a gallon, for five consecutive 
agricultural years, beginning with the year 1929-1930. It was also 
stipulated, among other things, that the plaintiff bound itself to sell 
all the molasses produced annually in its sugar central, with the 
exception of 15 per cent thereof, and that the defendant had the option 
to cancel the contract upon notice and payment of the sum of P6,000, 
which was likewise fixed as a security or bond to be given by the 
defendant for the faithful compliance with its obligations under the 
contract.</p>
<p align="justify"> The plaintiff instituted civil case No. 8436 in the 
Court of First Instance of Iloilo wherein it is prayed that the terms of
 the contract be clarified in the sense that the sum of P6,000 which had
 been offered by the defendant be considered as a bond or security for 
the faithful compliance with its obligations and not as a consideration 
for its option to cancel the contract, and that the quantity of molasses
 which it was obliged to deliver to said defendant should be only 
one-half of the central's production, in addition to other quantities 
belonging to the planters the ownership of which had passed to it for 
failure of the said owners to have the molasses removed within 48 hours 
in accordance with the existing milling contracts. At first the 
defendant was in accord with the allegations of the complaint, but in 
its supplementary answer, and by way of a cross-complaint, it prayed 
that the contract of sale of molasses be cancelled, on the ground that 
under its terms it was given the option to cancel it upon payment of the
 sum of P6,000 which it tendered and placed at plaintiffs disposal.</p>
<p align="justify"> The trial court sustained the plaintiff's 
allegations and rendered judgment in accordance with Ihe prayer of the 
complaint. On appeal (G. R. No. 36026),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  this court reversed the appealed judgment and declared 
the contract cancelled, and in its resolution on the motion for 
reconsideration held further that the contract was deemed cancelled on 
November 18, 1932, when the defendant deposited the sum of P6,000 with 
the clerk of the court.</p>
<p align="justify"> Subsequently, the plaintiff instituted this action 
(civil case No. 9384 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo) to 
recover the sum of P72,569.28 from the defendant. According to the 
complaint, this sum represents the stipulated cost of the molasses 
produced during the agricultural years 1930-1931, 1931-1932, 1932-1933, 
which the defendant unjustifiably refused to purchase and accept with 
the exception of a small quantity thereof sold to La Jarolena of La Paz,
 Iloilo, to minimize the damages which the plaintiff suffered.</p>
<p align="justify"> In its second amended answer, the defendant set up 
the following special defenses: that the judgment rendered by this court
 in civil case No. 8436 (G. R. No. 36026), definitely decided all the 
questions which the plaintiff raises again in its second complaint and 
that its claim is now <em>res judicata</em>; that in the aforesaid civil
 case plaintiff did not claim the damages which it now seeks to recover 
from the defendant for which reason plaintiff lost whatever right it 
might have had therein; that in its motion for reconsideration of the 
judgment rendered by. this court, the plaintiff asked, among other 
things, that the contract be not cancelled, but in the event that 
cancellation lies, the same should not be decreed until the defendant 
has paid for all the molasses which it refused to accept, and that 
according to the judgment of this court the sum of P6,000, which the 
defendant was bound to pay to the plaintiff, also represented whatever 
damages may be due the latter resulting from the cancellation of the 
contract.</p>
<p align="justify"> When the case was submitted, the trial court upheld 
the defendant's contention that the sum of P6,000, now deposited with 
the clerk of the court and at the plaintiff's disposal, likewise 
represented the damages now claimed by the plaintiff due to defendant's 
refusal to receive the molasses in question, and rendered judgment 
absolving the defendant from the complaint, without costs. Appealing 
from this judgment plaintiff here vigorously contends that it is 
entitled to the damages, which it has undisputably proven.</p>
<p align="justify"> In affirming the appealed judgment the majority of 
the members of this court rely on the general principle that when a 
contract is decreed cancelled, its legal effects should retroact to the 
date the right thereto commenced, which, in this case, was January 14, 
1931, when the defendant notified the plaintiff of its option to cancel 
the contract and offered to pay the sum of P6,000.</p>
<p align="justify"> There is an apparent confusion of terms herein. 
There is an attempt to apply the same principle both to a case wherein a
 contract is rescinded or annulled and that wherein a contract is 
cancelled by the parties. When a contract is rescinded or annulled on 
any of the grounds specified by the law, the parties are undoubtedly 
entitled only to the remedies expressly reserved for them in articles 
1295, 1303, 1304, 1305, 1306, 1307 and 1308 of the Civil Code and they 
may not demand performance of any obligation arising from the rescinded 
or annulled contract. Neither can they maintain an action for damages 
based on a breach of contract save the cases excepted by articles 1295 
and 1307. The reason for this is obvious: when a contract is rescinded 
or annulled, it ceases to exist and the contracting parties are entitled
 to have the subject matter thereof restored to its original <em>status 
quo</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Where a contract has been rescinded by mutual 
consent, the parties are as a general rule restored to their original 
rights with relation to the subject matter, and no action for breach can
 be maintained thereafter, nor are the parties bound by the contract 
with reference to their subsequent actions." (13 C. J., pp. 602, 603.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> However, when the contract is merely cancelled or 
terminated by express agreement of the parties, as in this case, such 
cancellation does not affect nor annul already existing obligations.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Ordinarily any claim in respect of performance 
and of what has been paid or received on the contract will be referred 
to the agreement of rescission, where the contract is rescinded while in
 the course of performance, and as a general rule no such claim may be 
made unless it has been expressly or impliedly reserved; but there are 
cases which hold that the fact that the parties agree to terminate the 
contract does not in itself show that they agree to release all rights 
of action for breach which may have arisen up to that time, it being 
held that the mere fact that parties make use of the terms 'rescind' or 
'cancel' does not show that they intend their acts to have such legal 
effect." (13 C. J., p. 603.)</p>
  <p align="justify"> "Where under the contract a party may terminate it
 at his option, he is not liable after termination for further 
transactions thereunder, but obligations which have already accrued are 
not affected. * * *" (13 C. J., p. 608.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The right to cancel the contract was reserved to the
 defendant upon payment of the sum of P6,000. Under this option, it 
could terminate the contract but the obligations arising therefrom were 
enforceable while it was in existence and until its cancellation has 
been agreed upon by the parties or decreed by the court. To wipe out 
already existing and enforceable obligations before the termination of 
the contract would be to annul completely the agreement and obligations 
voluntarily stipulated by the parties.</p>
<p align="justify"> Anticipating the commencement of this action by the 
plaintiff, it was stated in the resolution upon the motion for 
reconsideration that the contract should not be deemed cancelled except 
from November 18, 1932, when the defendant deposited the sum of P6,000 
with the clerk of the court. To hold now that such cancellation 
commenced on January 14, 1931, would be to ignore a settled question.</p>
<p align="justify"> As to the amount of damages, the sum claimed by the 
plaintiff should be reduced to P35,000 because the defendant was only 
bound to purchase molasses up to November 18, 1932. It is difficult to 
establish a correct and clear basis for this sum in round numbers, but 
at least it represents the approximate value of the molasses which the 
defendant was bound to receive and pay for under the terms of the 
contract.</p>
<p align="justify"> Some of the members of the court have taken the view
 that the aforesaid sum should be deemed to include the P6,000 deposited
 with the clerk of court. This latter sum was awarded to the plaintiff, 
and the defendant bound itself to pay it, by way of consideration or 
price of the option to cancel. The amount having been given for a 
different purpose, it should not be confused with, or deducted from the 
damages.</p>
<p align="justify">The appealed judgment should be reversed and damages 
in the sum of P35,000 awarded to the plaintiff, with costs in both 
instances.</p>

<div align="center"><em>DISSENTING
</em></div>
<p align="justify"><strong>DIAZ,</strong> <em>J.,</em></p>
<p align="justify"> It is wifh regret that I have to dissent from the 
majority opinion. Inasmuch as it has already been held in the decision 
rendered in case G. R. No. 36026 that the cancellation of the contract 
Exhibit A, entered into by the parties, should be understood as having 
taken effect on November 18, 1932, when the defendant had ceased 
purchasing the molasses which the plaintiff had been placing at its 
disposal since the agricultural year 1930-1931, in violation of the 
terms of said contract, it is my opinion that said defendant is obliged 
to indemnify the plaintiff for the damages it suffered by reason of such
 breach, but certainly not in the amount of P72,569.28, which it claims 
in the complaint. It may be true that the plaintiff suffered the damages
 in question but, from the communications exchanged between the 
parties,, which form part of the documentary evidence presented during 
the hearing, it may be inferred that, having foreseen the possibility of
 a disagreement similar to the one which gave rise to this suit between 
them, they had fixed the indemnity which said defendant should pay the 
plaintiff at P6,000. Therefore, the question raised by the parties 
should be decided by awarding the plaintiff an indemnity in the sum of 
P6,000, notwithstanding the fact that it had already been allowed a like
 sum in the aforesaid case G. R. No. 36026, on the ground that the 
former was for a different cause or purpose.
