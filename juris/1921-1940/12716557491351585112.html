				G.R. No. 30270, October 19, 1928</h4>
				<H3>ANACLETA CORTES, VDA. DE CASTRO, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAPIZ AND "LEDESMA HERMANOS & PEDRO DE LA VIÃ‘A," RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Mandamus under section 499 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
directed to the Judge of First Instance of Capiz. Irrespective of all other 
features, there is one aspect to the case which discloses the reason why the 
petition cannot be allowed. This is the application to the facts of the 
principle of laches in mandamus proceedings. 
<p align="justify">The record begins with the decision in civil case No. 1875 on 
November 22, 1926. We may then turn to the disapproval of the bill of exceptions 
on September 29, 1927. The motion of reconsideration addressed to this order was 
denied on January 21, 1928. The attorney for the petitioner claims to have been 
notified of this lask order on March 2, 1927 (1928) and immediately to have 
excepted thereto. That then concluded the record in the trial court. The 
petitioner, however, did nothing until he prepared his petition for mandamus 
dated July 16, 1923, but which was received for filing in this court on 
September 3, 1928. To consolidate these admitted facts, nearly two years have 
passed since the decision in the trial court was handed down; approximately one 
year has passed since the disapproval of the bill of exceptions; and almost 
exactly a half year has passed since the last action in the lower court. </p>
<p align="justify">Section 499 of the Code of Civil Procedure permits the 
dissatisfied party to "apply at the next term of the Supreme Court" for a 
mandamus. While terms of court are pretty. much disregarded in actual practice, 
the rules do provide for the calling of a calendar on the second Monday of July. 
The July term of court may, therefore, be here taken to be the next term of the 
Supreme Court mentioned in the law. But even under the most favorable aspect, 
from the second Monday of July to the first days of September, more than a month 
elapsed. Without deciding what would constitute an application within a 
reasonable time after the refusal of a trial judge to sign the bill of 
exceptions, it is apparent that the delay in ordinary cases should not be more 
than the longest period allowed in the lower court for the party to take action, 
which is thirty days. It is well settled that laches in making an application 
for the writ of mandamus affords sufficient cause for its denial. Also it should 
not be forgotten that during the pendency of the proceedings execution has 
issued and the property of the petitioner has been sold at public auction.</p>
<p align="justify">The court is, therefore, fully justified in the exercise of a 
sound discretion in denying the relief prayed for. Petition dismissed, with 
costs. </p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Johnson, Street, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real,
