				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Colegio de San Jose, a corporation sole, instituted these prohibition&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; to prevent the justice of the peace and the auxiliary justice&nbsp; of the peace of the municipality of Liang,&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Batangas, or any other&nbsp; person&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; and acting in their stead, from continuing the hearing&nbsp; of civil&nbsp; cases Nos.&nbsp; 81 to 101,&nbsp; inclusive, instituted by said college in the aforementioned justice of the peace court.<br><br>At the instance of the petitioner,&nbsp; who gave a two-hundred-peso bond, Justice Street of this court issued a preliminary injunction restraining the aforesaid&nbsp; justices of the peace from continuing the hearing&nbsp; of said cases, until further notice.&nbsp; The writ thus issued was affirmed by this Supreme Court in a resolution dated October 9, 1931.<br><br>The facts upon which the petition is based are as follows:<br><blockquote>It was about March 20,&nbsp; 1931, when the petitioner filed a number of complaints in the justice of the peace court of Liang, Batangas,&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents private individuals, for the recovery of the rents due on&nbsp; the&nbsp; portions of land occupied by them as tenants for&nbsp; the year 1930, the cases thus commenced being numbered 81 to 101, inclusive. Subsequently, the&nbsp; petitioner filed 80&nbsp; other&nbsp; complaints against other tenants for the same purpose of recovering due and unpaid rents for the year 1930.</blockquote>On April 23,&nbsp; 1931, the date fixed for the hearing of the 21 cases,&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties appeared in the justice of the peace court of&nbsp; Liang through&nbsp; counsel.&nbsp; The attorneys for the defendants&nbsp; applied for assessors&nbsp; under section 58 of the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure, and&nbsp; prayed that said assessors, once selected&nbsp; and qualified, sit&nbsp; in the trial&nbsp; of said cases. The justice of the peace&nbsp; denied the motion on the ground that the municipal&nbsp; council of Liang had&nbsp; not supplied&nbsp; him with a list of&nbsp; assessors, and that they had not been chosen in accordance&nbsp; with section 57 of that Code.<br><br>That&nbsp; same&nbsp; day,&nbsp; April&nbsp; 23, 1931,&nbsp; the defendant applied to the Court of First Instance of Batangas&nbsp; for a writ of mandamus&nbsp; (civil case No. 2650)&nbsp; against the petitioner and the justice&nbsp; of the peace of Liang, alleging that they had been&nbsp; unlawfully&nbsp; deprived of their&nbsp; right to be judged by assessors and praying that said justice of the&nbsp; peace be compelled to select&nbsp; the assessors and to admit them to sit in the hearings.<br><br>While the proceedings&nbsp; for mandamus&nbsp; were pending in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Batangas, no preliminary injunction having been sued out,&nbsp; the justice of the peace of Liang proceeded&nbsp; with the hearings.of&nbsp; the 21 cases pending before him, at&nbsp; the instance of counsel&nbsp; for the plaintiff and in the absence of the defendants and their counsel.<br><br>While said 21 cases were pending in the&nbsp; justice of the peace court of Liang, the Court of First Instance of Batangas rendered a judgment in the mandamus proceedings instituted by the defendants in those cases&nbsp; requiring the justice of&nbsp; the peace of Liang to try the 21 cases anew,&nbsp; and to appoint assessors for each of them&nbsp; to sit with him in accordance with the law.<br><br>The petitioner herein took exception and appealed from the judgment&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Batangas in said mandamus proceedings, but the auxiliary judge of the&nbsp; court, Braulio Bejasa,&nbsp; pursuant to section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, held, that, notwithstanding the appeal, said judgment should be executed, and consequently the&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; should&nbsp; proceed with the new trial of the aforesaid cases.<br><br>The petitioner filed a motion for a new trial in the mandamus case, which was denied by Judge Pedro Ma. Sison, who further ordered the justice of the peace of Liang to proceed immediately with the new trial theretofore ordered.<br><br>The petitioner, having excepted to the order denying its motion for a&nbsp; new trial, filed the bill of&nbsp; exceptions, which is now pending approval.<br><br>The auxiliary justice of the peace of Liang, acting under instructions from the justice of the peace, set the 21 cases for&nbsp; new trial&nbsp; on the 8th and 9th of October, 1931, which was suspended by the preliminary injunction issued in the present case.<br><br>Counsel for both&nbsp; parties orally&nbsp; argued the&nbsp; merits&nbsp; of the case at the hearing had; and later filed their&nbsp; respective memoranda.<br><br>In our opinion this case&nbsp; raises but two important questions :&nbsp; The first relates to the right claimed by the private respondents to have their cases pending before the justice of the peace tried with the intervention&nbsp; of assessors; and the second is whether under the circumstances of the case, the Court of First Instance of Batangas&nbsp; had&nbsp; the power to order the execution of the judgment in the mandamus proceedings notwithstanding the appeal taken by the petitioner.<br><br>With regard to the first question, we have&nbsp; section 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure granting the parties in a&nbsp; civil case pending before a justice court the right to be heard with the intervention of assessors, and giving the procedure for their selection by&nbsp; the parties or their attorneys. This section reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 58. <i>Rights&nbsp; of parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; have assessors.</i>—Either party to an action may apply in writing to the justice of peace, who is to try the action, for assessors to sit in the trial.&nbsp; Upon the filing of such application the justice shall direct that assessors be provided.&nbsp; Thereupon&nbsp; the parties shall be notified forthwith to appear before the justice for the&nbsp; purpose of selecting assessors, who shall&nbsp; be selected from the list provided for&nbsp; in the preceding section,&nbsp; and shall be&nbsp; selected in the following manner&nbsp; in the presence of the justice: The plaintiff shall strike out from the list one&nbsp; name;&nbsp; then&nbsp; the defendant shall strike out one name, and&nbsp; so,&nbsp; alternately, the parties shall&nbsp; strike&nbsp; out names until but&nbsp; two remain on&nbsp; the list.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; remaining&nbsp; two shall be&nbsp; the assessors to sit in the action; but if one or more of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two remaining are&nbsp; disqualified by law&nbsp; to sit as assessors, then the justice shall draw one or two names, as the case may be, by lot from those stricken&nbsp; out,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; person&nbsp; or&nbsp; persons thus drawn&nbsp; shall act as assessors, as the case may be."</blockquote>Section 57 of the&nbsp; same Code prescribes the&nbsp; manner in which assessors shall be chosen&nbsp; by the municipal council, and&nbsp; the preparation of the&nbsp; list of assessors' name,&nbsp; to be supplied&nbsp; to each justice of the peace during the first week of the month of January every year.<br><br>An examination of the provisions of section 58 will show that the right thus granted to&nbsp; the parties to be judged by assessors is absolute, and that the duty imposed upon the justice of the peace is likewise mandatory. Once the petition in&nbsp; writing has been filed by any of the parties, it is the&nbsp; duty of the justice of&nbsp; the peace to grant it, and to proceed to&nbsp; the selection of the&nbsp; assessors&nbsp; in the manner prescribed.&nbsp; The petitioner&nbsp; argues that in denying the private respondents' petition for assessors, the justice of the peace did not err,&nbsp; inasmuch as he had&nbsp; not been supplied by the municipal council of Liang with&nbsp; the list mentioned in section&nbsp; 57.&nbsp; We&nbsp; are of&nbsp; opinion that the reason given by the justice of the peace was neither good nor tenable, and&nbsp; did not exempt him from his imperative duty to grant the petition and to provide for&nbsp; the selection of the two assessors to which the aforesaid respondents were entitled. Under the circumstances it was his duty to require the municipal council of Liang to supply him&nbsp; with the list required by the law,&nbsp; which, according to the complaint filed in the present proceeding, was at once prepared by said municipal council and furnished to the justice of the peace. The respondents could not be deprived of a substantial right granted them by&nbsp; law.&nbsp; According to section 62 of the Code of Civil Procedure,&nbsp; the assessors thus appointed shall after qualifying sit at&nbsp; the hearings and advise the justice of the peace in the&nbsp; determination of all questions of facts as well as of law, and in case of their dissent&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the merits of the action, they are required by law to certify in writing their dissent, giving the reasons therefor, and such dissent shall be taken into&nbsp; account by the Court of First Instance in case of appeal.&nbsp; All these provisions necessarily lead to the conclusion that&nbsp; the intervention of the assessors is not an&nbsp; empty formality&nbsp; which&nbsp; may&nbsp; be disregarded without violating either the letter or the&nbsp; spirit of the law.&nbsp; It is another security&nbsp; given by the law to the litigants, and as such, it is a&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; right of which they cannot be deprived "without vitiating all the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were we to agree that for one reason or another the trial by assessors may be done away&nbsp; with, the same line of reasoning would force us to admit that the parties&nbsp; litigant may be deprived of their right to&nbsp; be represented by counsel, to appear and be present at&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearings, and&nbsp; so&nbsp; on, to the&nbsp; extent of omitting the&nbsp; trial in a civil case, and thus set at naught the essential rights granted by the law to the parties, with the consequent nullity of all the proceedings.<br><br>It would be indeed improper to consider in these proceedings the merits of the judgment&nbsp; rendered in the mandamus case pending in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, inasmuch as an appeal has been taken from that judgment; nevertheless,&nbsp; in deciding this petition, we are compelled to pass upon the action of said court with regard to the appointment of assessors.&nbsp; We are convinced that the court did right in requiring the justice of the peace of Liang to proceed with the appointment of the assessors and the holding of new trials for the reason that those already had were null and void, the defendants and respondents having been&nbsp; deprived of a substantial right.<br><br>With reference to the&nbsp; last&nbsp; question, we hold that&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; judges&nbsp; of first instance did&nbsp; not exceed their powers but acted within&nbsp; the discretion granted them by section 144 of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure in providing for the execution of the judgment rendered in the mandamus case notwithstanding the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; taken by the herein petitioner. For these reasons,&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby denied, and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued, quashed, with costs&nbsp; against the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor,&nbsp; Romualdez,</i>&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real,</span> <i>JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br>OSTRAND, <i>J.</i>: <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I dissent.<br></div><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br>STREET, <i>J.</i>:<br><br>What has happened here, stated in simple terms, is this: One of the judges of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Batangas has issued an order, in&nbsp; response to an application for the writ of mandamus, directing a new trial in certain cases submitted in the court of a justice of the peace.&nbsp; There is obviously&nbsp; no express statutory authority&nbsp; for&nbsp; such an intervention on the part of the superior court in the ordinary procedure of the inferior court, and the proper method of correcting errors in such court is by review in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance upon&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Code of Procedure does&nbsp; not in express&nbsp; terms even&nbsp; confer on the justice of the&nbsp; peace the right to grant a rehearing or new trial in his own court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much less does it, under any circumstance, confer&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance the authority to order a new&nbsp; trial in the inferior court.&nbsp; If the provisions&nbsp; relative to proceedings in the courts of the justice of the peace be carefully examined, it will be found that those provisions are clearly designed&nbsp; for the accomplishment&nbsp; of a speedy trial&nbsp; in&nbsp; the inferior court and&nbsp; a quick removal&nbsp; to the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance when the losing party deems himself&nbsp; aggrieved.&nbsp; Even under the provisions contained&nbsp; in sections&nbsp; 148 and 149&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure providing for relief from judgments obtained by&nbsp; fraud, accident or mistake, the law does not provide for a new trial, or for any trial, in the court of the justice of&nbsp; the peace, but—and&nbsp; this is remarkable— directs that the case be removed at once to the&nbsp; Court of First Instance for trial there.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; obvious that for&nbsp; a Court of First Instance to&nbsp; order a new trial in the court of a justice of the peace is directly opposed to the tenor of the procedural law.<br><br>Furthermore, the law&nbsp; governing the removal&nbsp; of cases from the court of the justice of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; upon appeal to the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; provides&nbsp; about as speedy&nbsp; &amp; remedy as&nbsp; could be obtained by any other method&nbsp; of relief, and&nbsp; a much speedier&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; than can be&nbsp; obtained by&nbsp; a retrial in the lower court,&nbsp; to be followed&nbsp; in&nbsp; turn by an appeal and third&nbsp; trial in the&nbsp; higher court.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; connection it should be remembered that the trial in the Court of First Instance is a trial&nbsp; <i>de&nbsp; novo</i>, which&nbsp; means that the Court of First Instance tries&nbsp; the case without regard to the conclusions reached by the justice of&nbsp; the peace, and upon the proof adduced in the Court of First Instance only.<br><br>With reference to the irregularity which occurred in this case, namely, that at the hearing&nbsp; in the&nbsp; court of the justice of the peace assessors were not appointed as requested by the defendant in&nbsp; that court, it should be observed that the provisions&nbsp; of law relating&nbsp; to assessors in&nbsp; courts of the justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; are&nbsp; duplicated in the&nbsp; provisions relating to trials in Courts&nbsp; of First Instance; and whatever right the defendants may have&nbsp; had to have&nbsp; these&nbsp; cases tried in the presence of assessors would be preserved in the higher court.<br><br>In the case before us it cannot be said that the defendants were&nbsp; prejudiced by&nbsp; the error committed in the court of the justice of the peace, because when the writ of mandamus was granted by the judge of the Court of First Instance, no judgment at all had been entered in the court of the justice of the peace in favor of anybody, nor has any judgment been there entered&nbsp; even as yet;&nbsp; and for aught that this court can know, or properly assume, the judgment might have been favorable to the defendants.<br><br>The action of the respondent judge who granted the writ of mandamus was therefore irregular, unwarranted, and in excess of his jurisdiction for the&nbsp; reasons: First, that the order made involved the granting of a new trial in&nbsp; a court of the justice&nbsp; of the peace, when&nbsp; the law provides for no such remedy; secondly, that the remedy was granted without any showing that the applicant for the writ had&nbsp; been prejudiced by the procedural&nbsp; irregularity complained of; and, thirdly, that the remedy by trial <i>de&nbsp; novo</i> upon appeal was available&nbsp; to the complaining party,&nbsp; in case he should have lost, which remedy is a&nbsp; plainer, speedier,&nbsp; and more adequate&nbsp; remedy than that available by a&nbsp; new trial in the court&nbsp; of the justice of the peace.<br><br>It is evident that the defendants (other than the judges and justices of the peace), having no confidence in their ability to defend the actions brought against them&nbsp; on the merits,&nbsp; are merely wasting the time of the court,&nbsp; and no patience should be indulged in dealing with their&nbsp; frivolities.&nbsp; The petition for <i>certiorari</i> should therefore have&nbsp; been granted by&nbsp; this court and the order for the&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial quashed, with the consequence that the&nbsp; proper judgment would be&nbsp; promptly&nbsp; entered in the court&nbsp; of the&nbsp; justice of the peace upon the proof submitted at the hearing on&nbsp; May 21,&nbsp; 1931,&nbsp; the losing&nbsp; party, or parties, being at&nbsp; liberty to appeal from the judgment if they should so desire.<br><br>With those&nbsp; who&nbsp; are unversed in the mysteries of legal science it&nbsp; is a standing&nbsp; criticism against courts and their methods that we are too much inclined to indulge in legal refinements to the prejudice of the prompt and speedy administration of&nbsp; justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is to be&nbsp; feared that the decision of the court in this&nbsp; case will not tend to dissipate that error.</div>
