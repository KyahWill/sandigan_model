				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the 
action for want of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.
<p>The action is brought for the recovery of the possession of five parcels of 
land situated in the barrio of Calatrava, municipality of Badajoz, subprovince 
of Romblon, Province of Capiz, of which the deceased Pedro Sanz is alleged to 
have taken possession unlawfully in the year 1908. It was originally brought 
against Enriqueta Perez as administratrix of the estate of the said Pedro Sanz; 
but on August 8, 1917, the plaintiff, upon discovering that Enriqueta Perez was 
not legally appointed administratrix, filed a motion asking that an 
administrator be appointed and that, thereupon, he be granted permission to 
amend the complaint making such administrator the defendant. The motion was 
granted and one Sebastian Felices was appointed special administrator and the 
case partly tried on August 9, 1917; it was thereupon continued for the purpose 
of enabling the plaintiff to have a survey made of the land in question as well 
as of the "Hacienda de Sanz" in which the defendant claimed that the lands in 
question were included.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the estate of Pedro Sanz was distributed among the heirs, a 
scheme of partition having been approved by the Court of First Instance of 
Romblon. Upon discovering that the distribution had been made, the plaintiff 
filed a motion on January 12, 1918, setting forth that the five parcels in 
question had been awarded to Francisco Sanz, one of the heirs of Pedro Sanz, and 
asking that said Francisco Sanz be made a party defendant. Two days later the 
administrator, Felices, presented a motion for the dismissal of the case as to 
the estate of Pedro Sanz on the ground that as the property had been awarded to 
Francisco Sanz, the administrator of the estate had no further interest 
therein.</p>
<p>On January 9, 1918, in ruling on the two motions last mentioned, the court 
ordered that Francisco Sanz be substituted for Sebastian Felices as defendant 
and that Sebastian Felices be excluded (<i>descartado</i>) from the complaint. 
The plaintiff did not except to this order, but on August 8, 1919, his attorney 
filed an affidavit in which he states that he, on July 2, 1918, forwarded a 
communication by registered mail to Francisco Sanz, which communication was 
accompanied by an order of the court of January 19, 1918, together with 
certified copies of all proceedings filed in the case; that said certified 
copies were received by Francisco Sanz on the 23d of August, 1918, according to 
certain telegrams received from the postmaster of the City of Manila.</p>
<p>On January 6, 1920, the plaintiff filed a motion asking that the case be set 
down for hearing for the presentation of a plan of the "Hacienda de Sanz" and 
for the taking of testimony of the surveyor by whom it was made.</p>
<p>On the same date Sebastian Felices, represented by his attorney, Jose 
Altavas, filed a motion asking that the case be dismissed with costs against the 
plaintiff, and on the same day Manuel Terrencio, as attorney for Francisco Sanz, 
presented the following motion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Comes now Francisco Sanz, through his undersigned attorney, for the sole 
purpose of objecting to the jurisdiction of this court over his person and to 
this end makes the following motion;</p>
<p>" 'The court of First Instance of Romblon has no jurisdiction over the person 
of Mr. Francisco Sanz in the above entitled case.'</p>
<p align="center">"GROUNDS</p>
<p>"Mr. Francisco Sanz was not duly summoned to appear before this court. The 
court acquires jurisdiction by the service of summons.</p>
<p>"Mr. Francisco Sanz was not heard in this case. The court cannot adjudicate a 
case without granting the party to be affected a previous hearing of his 
defense."</p></blockquote>
<p>Both motions were opposed by the plaintiff and on February 5, 1920, the 
court, upon hearing, denied the motion of Sebastian Felices, but granted the 
motion of Francisco Sanz in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It being an elementary principle of law that a court of justice cannot 
acquire jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, without the latter being 
served with summons, and it not appearing in the record that the movant, 
Francisco Sanz, was ever served with summons, or that he has ever appeared at 
any stage of this case; it being a principle of constitutional law that 'no 
person shall be deprived of his life or property rights without being previously 
heard,' the motion of Francisco Sanz is hereby granted, and it is ordered that 
the whole proceeding be set aside without special finding as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>The plaintiff duly excepted to this order and also to a subsequent order 
denying the motion for a reconsideration and brought this appeal.</p>
<p>The appellant presents two assignments of error:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) The court below erred in dismissing the case, and</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>(2) That the court erred in not fixing a day for the presentation of the plan 
of the "Hacienda Sanz," the only evidence lacking for the final determination of 
the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first assignment of error is well taken and must be sustained. The 
appellee Francisco Sanz is a transferee <i>pendente lite</i> of the property 
involved in the case. As such he stands exactly in the shoes of his predecessor 
in interest, the original defendant, and is bound by the proceedings had in the 
case before the property was transferred to him. He is a proper, but not an 
indispensable, party as he would, in any event, have been bound by the judgment 
against his predecessor. (<i>See</i> 31 Cyc., 473.)</p>
<p>The court below erred in excluding the administrator Sebastian Felices from 
the complaint; the proper procedure would have been to continue the action 
against the administrator and simply join Francisco Sanz as a party defendant. 
But no exception was taken to the order excluding the administrator and the 
error can therefore not be considered here.</p>
<p>We agree with the court below that Francisco Sanz was not properly summoned. 
The service upon a person of a copy of the order of the court making him a party 
defendant, together with a copy of the complaint and other pleadings, is not the 
process required for bringing him into court. There may be exceptions where it 
is sought to bring in the administrator of a deceased party defendant in 
substitution of the deceased, and it has also been held in at least one case 
(Emeric <i>vs</i>. Alvarado, 64 Cal., 529) that where upon the decease of an 
original defendant his infant heirs are made parties the service of the order 
making them parties is sufficient without service of summons, but the present 
case does not fall within any of these exceptions.</p>
<p>But in view of the fact that Francisco Sanz had been impleaded as a party 
defendant, opportunity should have been given to have him summoned so as to 
enable the court to decide the case on its merits. To avoid the retaking of 
testimony and to prevent unnecessary discussions of the effect of the Statute of 
Limitations upon the action, it is especially important that the action should 
be continued as originally commenced. (<i>See</i> 25 Cyc, 1304.) It was the duty 
of the clerk of the Court of First Instance to issue the summons and the 
responsibility for his failure to do so should not be laid at the door of the 
plaintiff. As hereinbefore intimated, the court below erred in dismissing the 
complaint.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is therefore reversed and the record is remanded to 
the court below with the direction that the defendant Francisco Sanz be summoned 
as provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure. The trial of the case will then 
proceed without the necessity for reintroducing the evidence already presented 
and as if the defendant Francisco Sanz had been a party to the action from its 
inception. No costs in this instance. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, 
Malcolm, Avance√±a, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
