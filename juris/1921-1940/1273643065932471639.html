				G.R. No. 22611, July 19, 1924</h4>
				<H3>GERONIMO SANTIAGO, PETITIONER, VS. SEGUNDO AGUSTIN, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Geronimo Santiago, the petitioner, seeks in this original action in quo 
warranto to have the respondent, Segundo Agustin, ousted and excluded from the 
office of member of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila, and to secure a 
judgment averring that the petitioner is entitled to the office.
<p>Geronimo Santiago was elected member of the Municipal Board of the City of 
Manila at the general elections held on June 6, 1922. He duly qualified for and 
took possession of the office on October 16, 1922. Sometime later, Mr. Santiago 
was chosen President of the Municipal Board.</p>
<p>In an official communication of date November 17, 1923, Mr. Santiago was 
designated Acting Mayor of the City of Manila by His Excellency, the 
Governor-General. This letter was phrased as follows:</p>
<p align="center">"OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF -THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"MANILA, <em>November 17,1923.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>"SIR: Pursuant to the provisions of section 2434 of the Administrative Code, 
as amended by section 4 of Act No. 2774, you are hereby designated Acting Mayor 
of the City of Manila until further notice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Very respectfully,</p>

<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td width="6%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="44%">"Governor-General"</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>On the same day, Mr. Santiago took the oath of office as Acting Mayor of the 
City of Manila and entered upon the performance of the duties of the office. Mr. 
Jose Ciria Cruz was by resolution of the Municipal Board chosen Acting President 
of the Muncipial Board "hasta que el actual presidents, Honorable Geronimo 
Santiago, resuma su cargo."</p>
<p>On November 19, 1923, the Philippine Senate, upon learning that Mr. Santiago 
had been appointed Acting Mayor of the City of Manila, sent a communication to 
the Governor-General inquiring if this fact was true, and if so what authority 
the Chief Executive had for making the appointment. On the same day and previous 
to reply to the Senate, the Governor-General submitted to the Senate the 
nomination of Geronimo Santiago as Mayor of the City of Manila. This nomination 
was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"MANILA, <em>November 19, 1923.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>"GENTLEMEN : Pursuant to the provisions of section 2434 of the Administrative 
Code, as amended by section 4 of Act No. 2774,1 hereby submit, for confirmation, 
the nomination of Mr. Geronimo Santiago as Mayor of the City of Manila, 
effective as of November 17, 1923.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Very respectfully,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>The nomination of Mr. Santiago for the position of Mayor of the City of 
Manila was disapproved by the Philippine Senate on December 14, 1923. On the day 
following, Mr. Santiago ceased to perform the duties of Acting Mayor of the City 
of Manila, and on the day following this, that is, on December 16, 1923, 
reassumed the office of member of the Municipal Board.</p>
<p>Inferentially, we are given to understand that subsequently the Insular 
Auditor ruled that Mr. Santiago was not entitled to continue to hold the office 
of member of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila. At any rate, on June 1, 
1924, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued a preliminary injunction 
restraining Mr. Santiago from exercising his powers and discharging his duties 
as member of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila. In compliance with this 
order, Mr. Santiago refrained from performing the duties of member of the 
Municipal Board. On June 7, 1924, while the preliminary injunction issued as 
aforesaid was in force, the Governor-General named one Segundo Agustin, the 
respondent herein, in place and stead of the petitioner to hold the office of 
member of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila. Said appointment was 
couched in the following language:</p>
<p align="center">"OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE<br>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"MANILA, <em>June 7, 1924.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>"SIR : Pursuant to the provisions of sections 65 and 2440 of the 
Administrative Code, you are hereby appointed, <em>ad interim</em>, member of 
the Municipal Board, City of Manila, vice Mr. Geronimo Santiago pending final 
action of the courts as to the legality of Mr. Santiago's incumbency.</p>
<p>"This supersedes my letter of June 6, 1924.</p>
<p>"Very respectfully,</p>
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<tr>
<td width="50%">&nbsp;</td>

<td width="44%">"Governor-General"</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>In accordance with said appointment, Mr. Agustin entered upon the performance 
of the duties of the office. The preliminary injunction was lifted on June 7, 
1924, but nevertheless, Mr. Agustin remains in and Mr. Santiago remains out of 
the office of member of the Municipal Board. Mr. Santiago has made demand upon 
Mr. Agustin for the office but Mr. Agustin has refused to give it up.</p>
<p>Section 2448 of the Administrative Code provides that "* * * No city officer 
(of the City of Manila) shall hold more than one office unless expressly so 
provided by law. * * *" Relying on this legal provision, the respondent 
reinforces it by the well-settled rule of the common law that he who, while 
occupying one office, accepts another incompatible with the first, <em>ipso 
facto</em> vacates the first office and his title is thereby terminated without 
any other act or proceeding. (Mechem on Public Officers, sees. 420 et seq.)</p>
<p>A public office may also become vacant by abandonment. But in order to 
constitute an abandonment of office, it must be total, and under such 
circumstances as clearly to indicate an absolute relinquishment. Temporary 
absence is not sufficient. Instead, there must be an intention, actual or 
imputed, to abandon the office. (Atty.-General vs. Maybury [1905], 141 Mich., 
31; State vs. Huff [1909], 172 Ind., 1.)</p>
<p>With the facts and the law as above briefly stated, the petitioner and the 
respondent would undoubtedly not quarrel. It is in the application of the facta 
and the law that divergence results. But the issue presents no difficulty if one 
primal fact be kept clearly in view, and this is, that Mr. Santiago was never 
actually "Mayor of the City of Manila" and he never held that office of Mayor 
but only that of "Acting Mayor." With reference to Mr. Santiago, the 
Qovernor-General performed two distinct acts: (1) He designated Mr. Santiago 
Acting Mayor of the City of Manila; and (2) he tried to appoint Mr. Santiago 
Mayor of the City of Manila, but that appointment was not complete due to the 
failure of confirmation by the Philippine Senate.</p>
<p>To emphasize this crucial point somewhat. Mr. Santiago took the oath of 
office and qualified for the position of Acting Mayor of the City of Manila. He 
indicated to the Municipal Board his intention to fill the new office tem- 
porarily and then return to his position as member of the Municipal Board. Mr. 
Santiago never took the oath of office as Mayor of the City of Manila. He never 
qualified for the office of Mayor. He never accepted the office of Mayor. He did 
not at any time disclose an intention to abandon the office of member of the 
Municipal Board. There was no resignation, express or implied, from the latter 
office.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Insular Auditor is <em>ex-parte</em> and not binding of 
the courts. The appointment of Mr. Agustin by the Governor-General is 
conditional and only continues until a pronouncement by the courts as to the 
legality of Mr. Santiago's imcumbency can be had, and presumably, this must be 
considered such pronouncement.</p>
<p>It is the judgment of the court that the petitioner is entitled to the office 
of member of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila, and that the respondent 
shall be ousted and altogether excluded therefrom. Without costs. So 
ordered.</p>
