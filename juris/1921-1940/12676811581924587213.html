				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was&nbsp; instituted in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Zamboanga by two Chinese firms, namely, Heo Cheo Tong y Co., composed of the partners&nbsp; Yeo Loby and Yeo Seng, and the firm of Yeo Boon Cheong &amp; Company, for the purpose of recovering from the defendant municipality of Zamboanga, of&nbsp; which the&nbsp; codefendant Carlos Dominguez&nbsp; is acting municipal treasurer, the&nbsp; sum of P1,440, with interest and costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing the&nbsp; cause the trial&nbsp; court gave judgment in favor of the plaintiffs to recover the amount sued for with interest from the date of the filing of the complaint, but without costs.&nbsp; From this judgment the defendants appealed.<br><br>The two concerns which are plaintiffs&nbsp; in&nbsp; this action have been conducting for years in the municipality of Zamboanga two pawnshops, during which&nbsp; time they&nbsp; have paid the annual license tax&nbsp; imposed by the city ordinances upon the&nbsp; businesses conducted by them as pawnbrokers. On December 12, 1927, the municipal council of Zamboanga passed an ordinance (No. 210) effective January 1, 1928, among other things imposing upon pawnbrokers&nbsp; who devote themselves exclusively to loans an annual license tax in the amount of P1,800, and upon pawnbrokers&nbsp; who engage in the making of loans and the selling of jewelry or other effects the higher annual tax of P2,400.&nbsp; The license tax of P1,800 thus imposed upon pawnbrokers is in effect a mere republication of the&nbsp; former provision taxing pawn-brokers; while the&nbsp; provision imposing the larger tax&nbsp; of P2,400 upon pawnbrokers who sell jewelry or other effects is new.<br><br>It appears that both the partnerships with which we are here concerned are engaged in selling jewelry from their shops in addition to making loans as&nbsp; pawnbrokers.&nbsp; Accordingly, the defendant municipal treasurer made demand for&nbsp; the payment of the increased tax imposed by the new ordinance.&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to this demand the plaintiffs paid without question the sum of P1,800 imposed upon them respectively for conducting the business of pawnbrokers, but as to the further sum of ^600 demanded of them in respect to the&nbsp; additional activity of selling jewelry,&nbsp; payment was made under protest.&nbsp; The amount thus paid under protest, including the surcharge resulting from their failure to pay the&nbsp; tax within the time required, was P1,440.<br><br>The&nbsp; basic tax of P1,800&nbsp; per annum imposed on pawn-brokers in general by the ordinance&nbsp; (No. 210) is clearly valid, as pawnbrokers are expressly mentioned in subsection (d)&nbsp; of section 2625 of the Administrative&nbsp; Code as one of the classes of persons that may be lawfully taxed.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the excess above the sum, of P1,800, we concur with the trial court in the opinion that the tax is invalid.&nbsp; Those who engage in selling jewelry are subject to the internal-revenue tax upon their sales, but jewelers are not mentioned among the classes of persons upon whom license taxes may be imposed by a municipal council.&nbsp; Moreover, where the Legislature has clearly withheld the power to impose license taxes upon persons engaged in a particular activity, such as the selling of jewelry, the act of engaging in this activity cannot be used as a criterion for establishing a class which shall be&nbsp; subject to a higher tax than that imposed generally upon persons engaging in a taxable activity.&nbsp; To permit&nbsp; this would&nbsp; be merely to sanction&nbsp; an&nbsp; evasion of the immunity from the&nbsp; license tax conferred by law.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that under the power to tax&nbsp; pawnbrokers&nbsp; it is competent for a municipal council to discriminate between pawnbrokers of different sorts, but the&nbsp; criterion taken for such discrimination, or&nbsp; division of pawnbrokers into classes,&nbsp; must be reasonable.&nbsp; This cannot be said of the classification here adopted, for it&nbsp; violates&nbsp; the rule requiring uniformity in taxation, in this, that some persons engaged in selling jewelry are taxed while others are not&nbsp;&nbsp; It is suggested, however, that the additional tax imposed upon the pawnbroker in respect to the selling of jewelry or other effects can be sustained as a tax imposed upon&nbsp; dealers in second-hand merchandise.&nbsp; It is true that, under&nbsp; subsection (d)&nbsp; of section 2625 of the Administrative Code, municipal councils&nbsp; are authorized to impose a tax upon&nbsp; dealers in second-hand merchandise.&nbsp; But it&nbsp; does not appear that the selling of merchandise by the plaintiffs&nbsp; in this case is limited to&nbsp; second-hand jewelry; and even if&nbsp; such fact had appeared, it&nbsp; is doubtful&nbsp; whether a person selling jewelry at second-hand should be classed as a dealer in second-hand merchandise.&nbsp; By universal usage the&nbsp; expression "dealer in second-hand merchandise" has&nbsp; reference more particularly to persons who buy and sell clothing and household effects at second-hand.<br><br>Our conclusion is that the tax in question is invalid, and the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.&nbsp; So ordered, with costs&nbsp; against the municipality&nbsp; of Zamboanga.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Malcolm,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez</i>, and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
