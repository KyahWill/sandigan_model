				<H3>PEDRO DIZON AND SEVERINA DIZON, PLAINTIFFS AND  APPELLANTS, <I>VS.</I> VICENTE GALANG, JUAN MEDINA AND TEODORO JURADO,  DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Rufina Dizon, who&nbsp; was married to Vicente Galang and by whom she had a son&nbsp; named Francisco, inherited from "her parents&nbsp; the&nbsp; three parcels of land&nbsp; described in the complaint.<br><br>On October 4, 1904, Rufina Dizon died and her son Francisco inherited from her the said three parcels&nbsp; of&nbsp; land. Francisco Galang died on December 8, 1904, and his father Vicente Galang, by operation of law, inherited from him the said land.&nbsp; In accordance with article 811 of the Civil Code these three parcels&nbsp; of land are considered as reservable property although they do not appear as such in the registry of deeds.<br><br>In 1913, Vicente Galang sold the first two parcels to Juan Medina and in 1909 the third to Teodoro Jurado, without informing them that they were reservable property.<br><br>The plaintiffs Pedro and Severina Dizon,&nbsp; brother and sister of the deceased Rufina Dizon, being related to her within the third degree, brought this action&nbsp; against Vicente Galang, Juan Medina and Teodoro Jurado.&nbsp; The complaint prays&nbsp; that the sales of this land by Vicente Galang to Juan Medina&nbsp; and&nbsp; Teodoro&nbsp; Jurado be set&nbsp; aside;&nbsp; that Juan Medina and Teodoro Jurado be ordered to return the said parcels of land; that Vicente Galang be compelled to record in the registry&nbsp; of deeds the reservable character of this&nbsp; land&nbsp; and to execute a mortgage to&nbsp; secure its value. The&nbsp; appealed judgment dismissed the complaint with costs against the plaintiffs.<br><br>It is settled by jurisprudence that the provisions regarding a reservation by&nbsp; the widowed spouse&nbsp; referred to in article 968 of the Civil Code, for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; assuring its efficacy,&nbsp; are also applicable to the reservation known as <span style="font-style: italic;">troncal </span>referred to&nbsp; in&nbsp; article 811 so far as&nbsp; they insure the efficacy of the reservation.&nbsp; Article 975 permits the sale of reservable property by the widower, after contracting a second marriage, subject, however, to the reservation as a resolutory condition, in case, at the time of the death of the vendor bound to make the reservation, there should be legitimate children or descendants of the first marriage, without prejudice to the provisions of the Mortgage Law.<br><br>According to the&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp; the sales made by Vicente Galang (who was bound to make the reservation) of the three parcels of land, which are reservable&nbsp; property, in favor of Juan Medina and Teodoro Jurado, cannot be set aside unless the resolutory condition imposed by the reservation shall have occurred, which is not the case here.<br><br>Since these parcels of land have been legally transferred to third persons, Vicente Galang has lost ownership thereof and cannot&nbsp; now register nor record in&nbsp; the&nbsp; registry of deeds their reservable character; neither can he affect the fee simple, which does not belong to him, to the damage of Juan Medina and Teodoro Jurado, who acquired&nbsp; the&nbsp; said land in good faith, free of all incumbrances.&nbsp;&nbsp; An attempt was made to prove that&nbsp; when&nbsp; Juan Medina was&nbsp; advised not to buy the land he remarked,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">"why, did he&nbsp; (Vicente Galang)&nbsp; not inherit it from his son?"</span>&nbsp; Aside from the fact that it is not clear whether this conversation took place in 1913 or&nbsp; 1914, that&nbsp; is, before or after the sale, it&nbsp; does not signify that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had any knowledge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; reservation. This did not&nbsp; arise from the fact alone that Vicente Galang had inherited the land from his son, but also from the fact that, by operation of law,&nbsp; the son had inherited it from his mother Rufina Dizon, which&nbsp; circumstance, so far as the record shows, Juan Medina had not been aware of.&nbsp; We do not decide, however, whether or not Juan Medina and&nbsp; Teodoro Jurado&nbsp; are obliged to acknowlege the&nbsp; reservation and to note the same in their deeds, for the reason that there was no prayer to this effect in the&nbsp; complaint and&nbsp; no question raised in regard thereto.&nbsp; Neither can Vicente Galang be compelled to execute a mortgage to secure the&nbsp; value of the three parcels of land.<br><br>As already intimated, the provisions of the law tending to give efficacy&nbsp; to a reservation by the widowed spouse&nbsp; mentioned in article&nbsp; 968 are&nbsp; applicable to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> reserva troncal</span> provided for&nbsp; in article 811.&nbsp; But as these two reservations vary in&nbsp; some respects, these&nbsp; rules may be applied to the <span style="font-style: italic;">reserva&nbsp; troncal</span> only in so far as&nbsp; the latter is similar to reservation by the widowed spouse.&nbsp; In the <span style="font-style: italic;">reserva troncal</span> the property&nbsp; goes to the reservor&nbsp; as&nbsp; reservable property and it remains so until the reservation takes place or is extinguished.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a reservation by&nbsp; the&nbsp; widowed spouse- there are two distinct stages, one when the property goes to the widower without being&nbsp; reservable, and the other when the widower contracts a second&nbsp; marriage, whereupon the property, which theretofore had been in his possession free of any incumbrance, becomes reservable.&nbsp; These two stages also affect differently the transfer that may be made of the property.&nbsp; If the property is&nbsp; sold&nbsp; during&nbsp; the first stage, before&nbsp; becoming reservable,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; absolutely free and is transferred to the purchaser unencumbered.&nbsp; But if the sale is made during the second stage, that is, when the duty&nbsp; to reserve has arisen, the&nbsp; property goes to&nbsp; the purchaser subject to the reservation,&nbsp; without prejudice to the provisions of the Mortgage Law.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; the reason why the law&nbsp; provides that should the&nbsp; property be sold before it becomes reservable, or before the&nbsp; widower&nbsp; contracts another marriage, he will be compelled to secure the value of the property by a mortgage upon&nbsp; contracting a new marriage, so that the reservation&nbsp; may not lose its efficacy and that the rights of those for whom the reservation is made may be assured.&nbsp; This mortgage is&nbsp; not required by law when the sale is made after the reservation has arisen, for the reason that the reservation will follow the property, without prejudice to the contrary provisions of the Mortgage Law and the rights of innocent purchasers, there being no&nbsp; need to secure the value of the&nbsp; property since it&nbsp; is liable for the efficacy of the reservation.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason the rules established for reservation by a&nbsp; widowed spouse to secure the value of the property sold by the widower, before becoming&nbsp; reservable, are not&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">reserva troncal</span> where the&nbsp; property goes to the ascendant already&nbsp; reservable&nbsp; in&nbsp; character.&nbsp; A&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">reserva troncal</span> might&nbsp; be analogous to a sale made by the widower after contracting a second marriage in the case of reservation by the widowed spouse.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Street, Malcolm, Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
