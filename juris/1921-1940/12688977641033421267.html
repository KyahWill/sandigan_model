				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Mindoro to twenty&nbsp; years r<span style="font-style: italic;">eclusion temporal</span>, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to indemnify the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased in the&nbsp; sum of P1,000 and&nbsp; to pay the costs.<br><br>The crime charged in the complaint is that&nbsp; of murder committed with evident premeditation and treachery, but in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the evidence, the trial court found the accused guilty&nbsp; of the crime of homicide with the aggravating circumstance provided in paragraph 9&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 10 of the Penal Code.<br><br>On&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon of September 3, 1923, the deceased Gabino Mascariñas, accompanied by Alejandro de Boda, went&nbsp; to&nbsp; Felipe Venturanza's house situated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the barrio of Bagumbayan in the municipality of Pinamalayan, to take part in a game of chance then being played&nbsp; there, where they met several other players,&nbsp; among whom was the accused Pedro Concha.&nbsp;&nbsp; Concha&nbsp; made&nbsp; a bet&nbsp; in one of the games which he lost and then discovered that the two-peso bill which&nbsp; he possessed&nbsp; had disappeared.&nbsp; He asked Gabino Mascariñas,&nbsp; who was next to him,&nbsp; about it and the latter replied that he knew nothing about it.&nbsp; The accused insisted that Gabino must know who had taken his two-peso bill, because he was next to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabino felt offended at being suspected&nbsp; by Pedro and an altercation followed in which Gabino punched the accused in&nbsp; the right&nbsp; eye. The&nbsp; players pacified the combatants and continued their game.&nbsp; Some time later,&nbsp; which cannot be determined from the record, the accused got up stating that he had no money&nbsp; with which to play and&nbsp; left the&nbsp; house&nbsp; just as Alejandro Mascariñas, a brother&nbsp; of the deceased, came from the market and was going upstairs to call his companions (Gabino&nbsp; Mascariñas and Alejandro de Boda)&nbsp; in order to return to their homes.<br><br>Alejandro Mascariñas&nbsp; found his companions in Venturanza's house&nbsp; and invited them to leave, but Gabino&nbsp; sail? that he wished to make&nbsp; one more bet, and having lost in that game, the three of them then left the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had hardly left the stairway when Gabino Mascariñas was met&nbsp; by the accused who was waiting there;&nbsp; he inquired where they were going and hardly had Gabino answered that they were returning to their home&nbsp; when he was attacked by the accused with a penknife and wounded in the abdomen which resulted in the death of Gabino Mascariñas on the fifth day after the incident.<br><br>The accused admits having inflicted the&nbsp; wound&nbsp; which caused Gabino's death,&nbsp; but alleges&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was due to a quarrel he had with him on account of his having lost the two&nbsp; pesos and Gabino&nbsp; having struck him on the forehead and attempted to&nbsp; stab him with a penknife,&nbsp; which he dodged.<br><br>We have considered the evidence before us and&nbsp; are convinced that after the altercation between the deceased and the accused in Venturanza's house, they had a quarrel near said&nbsp; house with&nbsp; the&nbsp; result&nbsp; that&nbsp; Gabino&nbsp; was mortally wounded by the accused.&nbsp; We are of the opinion that both combatants, upon encountering each other outside&nbsp; of&nbsp; the house, must have been prepared for a fight on account of what had occurred&nbsp; between them a few minutes&nbsp; before and&nbsp; we do not believe that any aggravating circumstance was&nbsp; proven.<br><br>We find no grounds in the record to support the errors alleged by the&nbsp; defense.<br><br>With the&nbsp; modification that the&nbsp; penalty provided by&nbsp; article 404 of the Penal Code be imposed upon&nbsp; the accused in its medium degree, or, fourteen years, eight&nbsp; months and one&nbsp; day&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> the judgment&nbsp; appealed from must be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with the costs against&nbsp; the appellant.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Street, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.&nbsp; </div>
