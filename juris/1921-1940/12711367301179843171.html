  <p>
This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Court of
First Instance of Laguna convicting him of the crime of homicide based
upon the following information:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"That on or
about April 13, 1923, in the municipality of Cavinti, Province of
Laguna, Philippine Islands, the accused, Pedro Pereja, did willfully,
unlawfully and criminally and with premeditation, cruelty and
treachery, assault Ignacio Pasion with a bolo which he was carrying,
inflicting upon the latter with said bolo the following wounds: One
wound on the anterior left lateral part of the thorax, two wounds on
the left forearm, one of which is on the right anterior lateral part of
the left forearm and the other on the anterior part thereof, and other
wounds on the anterior parts of the right forearm, which were mortal by
necessity, and were the direct and only cause of the death of the
aforesaid Ignacio Pasion.</p>
    <p>"Contrary to law."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The defendant was sentenced to seventeen years, four months and one day of<em> reclusion temporal</em>,
with the corresponding accessories, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay the costs, and assigns the
following errors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"1. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in pronouncing judgment against the accused for a felony in the absence of the accused. </p>
    <p>"2. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in admitting as evidence the document Exhibit B of the prosecution as the dying declaration of the deceased. </p>
    <p>"3. The court <em>a quo</em>
erred in holding that the dying declaration of the deceased has been
duly proven by oral testimony of Capt. J. C. Quimbo and Felix Flores. </p>
    <p>"4. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in failing to appreciate the testimony of the witnesses for the defense."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>    JOHNS, J.: </strong></p>
  <p>The
evidence for the prosecution tends to show that the children of Ignacio
Pasion fell asleep in another house, and that he told his wife to
remain with them and to sleep in that house, and that he would go home
and sleep alone which was done. Early the next morning, the deceased
was found on the <em>azotea</em> of his own house with several wounds
on his body. When he was asked by the chief of police as to the cause
of the wounds, the deceased told him that while he was sleeping, he
felt some one piercing his back through the openings between the bamboo
floor, and that upon coming out of the house to see what it was, he was
assaulted and attacked by the defendant whom he well recognized,
because at the time the moon was shining bright. That the defendant
harbored a bad feeling towards him on account of some land question
between them. This statement was reduced to writing by the justice of
the peace of Cavinti, who went to the place where the deceased was at
that time. That morning at his own request, the deceased was taken to
the hospital of Pagsanjan where the document purporting to be a dying
declaration and known in the record as Exhibit B was prepared by the
auxiliary justice of the peace. It appears that during the preparation
of Exhibit B, the deceased was in a very serious condition, and after
it was read to him and he signed it, that he had a fainting spell, and
that the doctor, fearing that he was going to die, gave him an
injection.</p>
  <p>    Exhibit B is as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I, Ignacio Pasion, of age, married, resident of Cavinti, Laguna, Philippine Islands, do hereby state under oath the following:</p>
    <p>"On
the dawn of this 13th day of April, 1923, being alone in my house
sleeping I felt that some one was piercing me on the back, and what I
did is to stand up and go down, and once downstairs Pedro Pereja met me
whom I recognized because the moon was then clear.</p>
    <p>"The said Pedro Pereja above mentioned I know is angry against me on account of a question regarding a lot in Cavinti.</p>
    <p>"When he met me he immediately attacked me with the bolo he was carrying and hit me under the left nipple.</p>
    <p>"Inasmuch
as at this time when I am making this declaration I feel near to death,
I swear to the truth, besides the doctor having told me of the gravity
of my situation and that I may die."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> After
the prosecution rested, the defense moved for a dismissal on the ground
that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the conviction, and the
court denied the motion.</p>
  <p> Eulogio Benitez, now the attorney
for the defendant, was called as a witness for the defense and
testified that he was in the hospital when the justice of the peace
prepared Exhibit B. That when it was about finished, he, Benitez,
suggested to him that it was not a complete dying declaration, and that
in view of his suggestion, the last paragraph of the writing was added
by the justice of the peace, and that the last paragraph was not
inserted at the suggestion of the deceased, but was made without him
being consulted. But Benitez did testify that all of Exhibit B,
including the last paragraph, was read to the deceased before he signed
it.</p>
  <p>    Based upon this testimony, the defense again moved for a dismissal which was again denied.</p>
  <p>
To rebut the evidence of Benitez, the prosecution called Juan C.
Quimbo, who testified that before Benitez arrived at the hospital, he
and the justice of the peace had finished the questioning of the
deceased, and that for such reason, Benitez could not have heard his
statements.</p>
  <p> Felix Flores testified that he would have
written the last paragraph of the exhibit without regard to the
suggestion of Benitez, because he had been told by Captain Quimbo that
it was necessary.</p>
  <p> The case was then submitted, and the trial
judge prepared his decision, but at the request of the defendant, it
was reopened, and he then offered testimony tending to show that the
crime was committed in self-defense. Suffice it to say that there is no
merit in that plea. It is both incredible and unreasonable, and, if
anything, it tends to support the prosecution.</p>
  <p> The defendant
claims that he saw a man sitting on the staircase of his house, who,
upon seeing him, stood up and said: "Your time has come and I have been
waylaying you for a long time." Saying which, the man "began to assault
and attack him," and that to avoid the attack, he stepped back, but
because of some obstacle, he could not step back any further, and that
he then drew his bolo, which he usually carried, and offered resistance
to defend himself.</p>
  <p> The evidence is conclusive that the
defendant was not wounded or injured in the least. Neither is there any
evidence worthy of belief that the deceased had a bolo or any kind of a
weapon.</p>
  <p> The defendant vigorously contends that the dying
declaration is not admissible, for the reason that at the time it was
made, there is no evidence that the deceased had any fear of his
impending death, and that the last paragraph of it was not inserted at
the instance or request of the deceased, but because the justice of the
peace thought it was a legal requisite to make it admissible, and for
such reason he inserted it on his own motion. That contention is not
tenable. It clearly appears from the testimony of Felix Flores and Juan
C. Quimbo that at the time the dying declaration was made, the deceased
was conscious of his impending death. Regardless of the language of the
dying statement, it is competent to show by evidence <em>aliunde</em>
the condition, actions and conduct of the deceased, and anything which
his medical adviser may have said to him, which met with his approval.
(U. S. <i>vs.</i> Virrey, 37 Phil., 618, 625.)</p>
  <p> Again, the
evidence is conclusive that the dying statement was prepared at the
suggestion of the deceased, and that it was read to him before he
signed it, and that he was conscious of what he signed, and it recites:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Inasmuch
as at this time when I am making this declaration I feel near to death,
I swear to the truth, besides the doctor having told me of the gravity
of my situation and that I may die."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Upon the facts shown, it was clearly admissible.</p>
  <p>
The defendant's counsel has submitted a very able and adroit brief. Be
that as it may, we are clearly of the opinion that the defendant is
guilty of the crime charged.</p>
  <p>    The judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand</i>, and <i>Romualdez, JJ</i>., concur. </p>
