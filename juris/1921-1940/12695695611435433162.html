				<H3>THE  GOVERNMENT  OF  THE  PHILIPPINE  ISLANDS,  PETITIONER, <I>VS.</I> THE COURT OF  FIRST INSTANCE OF NUEVA ECIJA, THE CHIEF OF THE GENERAL LAND REGISTRATION  OFFICE,  THE  REGISTRAR  OF  DEEDS OF NUEVA ECIJA, ESTEBAN DEL  ROSARIO AND NATIVIDAD TIANGCO, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for&nbsp; a writ of certiorari, the petitioner praying that the orders, decrees and certificates&nbsp; of title issued by the respondent court in regard to lot No.&nbsp; 1442 in cadastral case No. 3&nbsp; of the Province of Nueva&nbsp; Ecija be declared null and void.<br><br>The lot in question is situated in the town of Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, and embraces an area of 4,453 square meters. It appears from the record that prior to&nbsp; December 4, 1914, Gregorio Crisostomo, the parish priest of Cabanatuan, was the owner of the entire lot.&nbsp; On&nbsp; that date he&nbsp; executed a deed of sale in favor of the spouses Esteban&nbsp; del Rosario and Natividad Tiangco for a&nbsp; portion of the lot, measuring 1,435 square meters.&nbsp; Subsequently, proceedings in the aforesaid cadastral case No. 3 were instituted and it seems that, by agreement between the&nbsp;&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; Father Crisostomo&nbsp; presented a claim to all of&nbsp; lot No. 1442&nbsp; apparently with the understanding that a conveyance to Esteban del Rosario of the portion purchased by him would be subsequently made. On December 29, 1916,&nbsp; decision was&nbsp; rendered in&nbsp; the cadastral&nbsp; case&nbsp; adjudicating the lot in&nbsp; question, to&nbsp; Father Crisostomo but&nbsp; no final&nbsp; decree was entered&nbsp; until&nbsp; several years afterwards.<br><br>On February&nbsp; 15, 1918, Father&nbsp; Crisostomo executed his last will and&nbsp; testament devising all of&nbsp; his lands&nbsp; situated in the Province of&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Ecija&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands&nbsp; for certain benevolent&nbsp; purposes.&nbsp; He died shortly afterwards and on July 22,&nbsp; 1918, Esteban del Rosario and his wife Natividad Tiangco filed a motion in the cadastral case asking that the adjudication of lot No. 1442 be reviewed on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; the lot had&nbsp; been conveyed to them by Father Crisostomo prior to the institution of the&nbsp; cadastral proceedings.&nbsp; The motion was duly set down for hearing and notice thereof given the administrator of the estate of the deceased.&nbsp; At the hearing the Government was&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by the Attorney-General's Office and upon an examination of the deed executed December 4, 1914, the representative of that office withdrew all opposition.&nbsp; The motion was granted&nbsp; by order dated November 2, 1918, and in June 1920, a certificate of title for the land was issued in favor of&nbsp; the conjugal partnership of Esteban del Rosario and Natividad Tiangco.<br><br>Distribution of the estate of Father Gregorio Crisostomo was made&nbsp; by an&nbsp; order dated&nbsp; October&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; 1921,&nbsp; and on December 3, 1923, the Government represented by special attorney Villanueva filed&nbsp; a petition with the respondent court asking that the order of November 2, 1918, directing the issuance of the final decree&nbsp; in the&nbsp; name of Esteban del Rosario and Natividad Tiangco be set aside.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition was&nbsp; denied by an order dated&nbsp; December&nbsp; 28, 1923,&nbsp; on the ground that the decision in the&nbsp; cadastral case as to lot No. 1442 was final and could not then be corrected or amended. No further action seems to have&nbsp; been taken until the present&nbsp; petition was filed in June,&nbsp; 1926.<br><br>In&nbsp; this petition the Attorney-General on behalf of the petitioner alleges most of the facts above stated and maintains that the order of November 2, 1918, amounted to an amendment of the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; December&nbsp; 29, 1916,&nbsp; in the cadastral case, and that the Court of First Instance exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing&nbsp; such an order long after said decision became final.&nbsp; The respondents Esteban del Rosario and Natividad Tiangco contend that the land description in the deed of&nbsp; December 4, 1914, is incorrect and that they as a&nbsp; matter of fact purchased all of lot No. 1442&nbsp; from Father Crisostomo; that therefore the order of November 2, 1918, was not erroneous;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Government, through its proper representatives having renounced its opposition to said order,&nbsp; waived its claim to&nbsp; any interest in&nbsp; the property and cannot now assert&nbsp; that claim;&nbsp; and that not having appealed from the&nbsp; order and not having brought the present action&nbsp; until eight years after the issuance of the said order, it is guilty of laches and is not entitled to equitable relief.<br><br>In&nbsp; our opinion the respondent court did not exceed its jurisdiction in&nbsp; issuing the&nbsp; order of November 2,&nbsp; 1918, directing the General Land Registration Office to issue and enter the final&nbsp; decree in favor of the conjugal partnership of Esteban del Rosario and Natividad Tiangco.&nbsp; The motion upon&nbsp; which the order was issued, set forth facts which if true show fraud on the part of the person to whom the land was originally adjudicated, and were sufficient&nbsp; to justify a review of the decree under section 38 of the Land Registration&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; No final decree&nbsp; had been entered in the case and the motion was therefore presented in time (Rivera <i>vs.</i> Moran,&nbsp; 48&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 836).&nbsp; Though the&nbsp; interested&nbsp; parties had notice of the motion, no opposition was offered and while the ruling of the court on the motion may&nbsp; have been erroneous, it was&nbsp; nevertheless clearly within the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the court,&nbsp; and a writ of certiorari to correct that error will therefore&nbsp; not lie.<br><br>The evidence now before us indicates that the respondents Esteban del Rosario and Natividad Tiangco were only entitled to a portion of lot No. 1442 and that in claiming, and taking title to, the entire lot they were guilty of constructive fraud.&nbsp; If this be a fact, the&nbsp; remedy would seem to&nbsp; be&nbsp; an action to compel the conveyance to the Government" of the portion&nbsp; of the lot wrongfully held by the said respondents. An action for damages may also lie in&nbsp; such&nbsp; cases, but in the present instance that action is probably barred by the statute&nbsp; of&nbsp; limitations.&nbsp; (Section 55, Act No. 496; Macapinlac <i>vs.</i> Gutierrez&nbsp; Repide, 43 Phil., 770; Roman Catholic Bishop&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Caceres <i>vs.</i> Municipality of Tabaco,&nbsp; 46 Phil., 271.)<br><br>The petition for a writ of certiorari&nbsp; is denied without costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Johnson, Street, Villamor, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.&nbsp; </div>
