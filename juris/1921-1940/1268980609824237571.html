				<BR><BR><div align="justify">&nbsp; It is&nbsp; alleged in&nbsp; the complaint in&nbsp; the present&nbsp; case that on February 8, 1922, for and in consideration of the sum of P8,010, the defendants sold to the plaintiffs four parcels of land situated in the municipality&nbsp; of San&nbsp; Isidro,&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, on condition that the vendors&nbsp; might repurchase the&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; at the same&nbsp; price on or&nbsp; before November&nbsp; 12, 1922; that on July&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1923, the defendants ratified&nbsp; said contract of sale with&nbsp; the right to repurchase and recognized&nbsp; the plaintiffs' absolute&nbsp; and&nbsp; consolidated right of ownership,&nbsp; receiving from the latter&nbsp; an&nbsp; additional amount of P1,280.50 as a further consideration; and that notwithstanding the expiration of the term for the repurchase of the land the defendants&nbsp; refuse to surrender possession.&nbsp; The plaintiffs therefore ask judgment for the possession&nbsp; of the land together with damages in the sum of P8,000.<br><br>In their&nbsp; answer the defendants deny generally the allegations&nbsp; of the complaint and&nbsp; set up a&nbsp; "special defense,&nbsp; cross-complaint and counterclaim"&nbsp; in&nbsp; the following terms:<br><blockquote>"1. That the sum of P8,010&nbsp; mentioned in paragraph II of the complaint was never&nbsp; received by the defendants from the plaintiffs.<br><br>"2. That the contract&nbsp; mentioned in paragraphs II, III, and VI of the complaint was not one of purchase and sale with right of repurchase, but&nbsp; a renewal&nbsp; of&nbsp; another contract of loan with interest entered into by and between the same parties litigant herein on or about November 12, 1918, on which date the&nbsp; defendants, having received from the plaintiffs the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P2,800, which was added P85.16 which the defendants were owing on another account to the plaintiffs and&nbsp; the interest of said sums for two years at a higher rate than that fixed by the law, executed in favor of the plaintiffs a deed wherein it was fictitiously stated that the defendants transferred and sold to plaintiffs the properties described in paragraph II&nbsp; of the complaint with&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; to repurchase for&nbsp; the&nbsp; period of two years and the simulated price of P4,035.74.<br><br>"3. That the period having expired for the payment of said sum&nbsp; of F4,035.74 and the defendants not being able to pay said sum to&nbsp; plaintiffs, the former were compelled to execute in favor of said plaintiffs another fictitious deed of purchase and sale with right of repurchase of the date of February 3, 1921, and ratified on&nbsp; May 26,&nbsp; 1921, before Mr. Juan F.&nbsp; Gonzales, notary public, in which deed, by virtue of&nbsp; an agreement between the parties to extend to November 12,&nbsp; 1921,&nbsp; the period stipulated in the aforesaid deed of November 12, 1918, upon the condition that the herein defendants should&nbsp; pay higher&nbsp; interest&nbsp; than that authorized, by the law, that is compound interest at the rate of 37 percent&nbsp; per year&nbsp; on the said sum of P2,800, from November 12, 1918, to November 12, "1921, and it was stated that the defendants had received from the plaintiffs the&nbsp; sum of P7,200, as the value of the properties described in said second fictitious contract of purchase and sale with right of repurchase; and that not having&nbsp; been able to pay said sum of P7,200, through insidious machinations of the plaintiffs,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants executed in favor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter the&nbsp; deed of supposed purchase and sale mentioned in paragraph II&nbsp; of the complaint, wherein, by virtue&nbsp; of an agreement between the parties to&nbsp; extend until November 12, 1922, the&nbsp; period stipulated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of November 12, 1918, upon the condition that said defendants should&nbsp; pay compound interest at the rate&nbsp; of 30&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent per annum upon the sum&nbsp; of P2,800, from November&nbsp; 12, 1922, it was stated that the defendants received the sum&nbsp; of P8,010 as the price of the supposed contract of sale mentioned in paragraph II of the complaint.<br><br>"4. That&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants have not received&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P1,280.50 mentioned in paragraph V of the complaint, and that said sum is merely the interest of the sum of P8,010 from November 12, 1922, to&nbsp; July&nbsp; 6, 1923.<br><br>"5. That the defendants have paid to&nbsp; plaintiffs the sum of P1,992 on account&nbsp; of their debt."<br></blockquote>Upon&nbsp; these allegations&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants ask that&nbsp; they be absolved from the complaint and that judgment be rendered in their favor for&nbsp; usurious interest paid by them in the sum of P1,992&nbsp; and for the further sum of P2,000 as attorney's fees and for the costs.<br><br>After trial the court below declared that all of the contracts between&nbsp; the parties were usurious and void, and rendered judgment in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of P2,800 with legal interest from November 12, 1918, but ordered them to return to the&nbsp; defendants the sum of P1,992 collected as usurious interest, and to pay in addition thereto the sum of P2,000&nbsp; for&nbsp; lawyer's fees.&nbsp; From this judgment the plaintiffs appeal.<br><br>The assignments of&nbsp; error relate principally&nbsp; to questions of fact, in regard to which the findings&nbsp; of the court below are in the main sufficiently supported by&nbsp; the evidence.&nbsp; The defendant Alejandro Policarpio in his&nbsp; testimony gives&nbsp; a very full explanation of the&nbsp; various&nbsp; transactions had between the parties,&nbsp; and while it is true that his calculations in regard to the interest alleged to have been charged by the plaintiffs do not entirely tally with&nbsp; the&nbsp; final&nbsp; results, the discrepancies are not of sufficient importance to materially affect the credibility of the testimony as to the character of the aforesaid transactions.<br><br>The documents Exhibits 1, D, A and&nbsp; B tend to&nbsp; discredit the plaintiffs'&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; Exhibit 1 is dated November 12, 1918, and is a deed of sale with&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> of the land in question for the term of two years from&nbsp; the date of the document, the purchase price being P4,035.74.&nbsp; In the last' paragraph&nbsp; of the document it&nbsp; is provided&nbsp; that the sum of P594.39&nbsp; is to be repaid by the vendor on the 12th day of November, 1919, and that the balance of the purchase price, P3,441.35, must be repaid on the 12th day of November,&nbsp; 1920, in order to effect&nbsp; the repurchase. Exhibit D&nbsp; is a&nbsp; deed of sale of the same land executed by the defendants in favor of the plaintiffs on&nbsp; February 3, 1921,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to repurchase the same within a year from&nbsp; November 12,&nbsp; 1920.&nbsp; The consideration named is P7,200.<br><br>Exhibit A is also&nbsp; a deed of&nbsp; sale of the same land, with the right to&nbsp; repurchase, executed by&nbsp; the defendants in favor of the plaintiffs on February 8, 1922, in consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; P8,010,&nbsp; the&nbsp; term for the repurchase being one year from November 12, 1922.&nbsp; Exhibit B bears the date of July&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1923, and recites&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs have paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; the defendants the sum of P1,280.50&nbsp; as an increase of the purchase price of P8,010 named in the&nbsp; deed of February 8, 1922, Exhibit A.<br><br>The plaintiffs' contention is that Exhibit 1 was executed in consideration of a loan&nbsp; of P4,000 in cash plus the sum of P35.74 for certain merchandise received by the defendants and&nbsp; that no&nbsp; interest&nbsp; was charged.&nbsp; This does not&nbsp; seem probable in view of&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that the defendants&nbsp; were left in the possession of the land and apparently enjoyed the products thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendants' assertion that the&nbsp; loan was&nbsp; only for&nbsp; P2,800 and that the P594.39 to be paid on November&nbsp; 12, 1919,&nbsp; represented the first year's interest seems in these circumstances more plausible.&nbsp; Plaintiffs further&nbsp; maintain that&nbsp; the defendants effected the repurchase of land before the expiration of the term in Exhibit 1 and that Exhibit D was executed in consideration&nbsp; of a new loan of P7,200,&nbsp; separate and .distinct&nbsp; from the original loan.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if so, why did the term for the repurchase under Exhibit&nbsp; D relate&nbsp; back&nbsp; to November 12, 1920, the date of the expiration of the term for&nbsp; the right to repurchase under Exhibit 1?&nbsp; As already&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; Exhibit D bears the date of February 3,&nbsp; 1921, and was not acknowledged before notary until May&nbsp; 26, 1921.<br><br>The defendants allege in their cross-complaint, and have attempted to&nbsp; prove, that they in the early&nbsp; part&nbsp; of 1922 paid to the plaintiffs the sum of P1,992 on account of the debt and&nbsp; for&nbsp; usurious interest thereon.&nbsp; When carefully analyzed,&nbsp; their evidence as to such payment is&nbsp; not convincing, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs' contention that such payments as were made to them relate to other and different transactions, seems more&nbsp; reasonable.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Alejandro Policarpio appears to be an intelligent man and if the payments were made as stated by him, it is highly improbable that he,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the time of the execution of Exhibit A, some months afterwards, would have failed to claim credit for said payments and to have the amount deducted from the debt of P8,010 which he acknowledged in said exhibit.<br><br>The defendants' claim for allowance of attorney's fees is founded on section&nbsp; 6 of the&nbsp; Usury Law (Act No. 2655 as amended by&nbsp; Act No. 2992), which&nbsp; provides that&nbsp; any person or corporation&nbsp; who shall have paid or delivered a higher rate of interest than that authorized by law "may recover the whole interest paid&nbsp; or delivered with costs and attorney's fees in such sum as may be allowed by the court in an action&nbsp; against the person or corporation&nbsp; who took or received it, if such action is brought within two years after such payment or delivery."&nbsp; As we&nbsp; cannot find that any actual payment of interest has been made,&nbsp; and as it is well settled that usurious interest not actually paid but simply added to the capital from time&nbsp; to time, cannot be regarded as "taken or received" by the lender within the meaning of sections.2, 3, 4 and 6 of the Usury Act, it follows that this is not&nbsp; a&nbsp; case for&nbsp; a special allowance&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">attorney's fees</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i> Hodges, 46 Phil., 502; Brown <i>vs.</i> Marion Nat. Bank, 169 U.&nbsp; S., 416;&nbsp; Haseltine <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Central Nat. Bank, 183 U. S., 132.)<br><br>For the reasons stated&nbsp; the judgment appealed from is modified&nbsp; by absolving&nbsp; the plaintiffs from the defendants' counterclaim for&nbsp; the&nbsp; return of the&nbsp; sum of P1,992&nbsp; and for&nbsp; the payment of&nbsp; the further sum&nbsp; of P2,000 for&nbsp; attorney's fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the&nbsp; sum of P800&nbsp; with&nbsp; legal interest from the 12th day of November, 1918, is affirmed, without costs in either instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.
