				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Epifanio Diokno and Roman Diokno appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, the dispositive&nbsp; part of which reads as follows: "In view of the foregoing considerations, the court&nbsp; finds the accused Epifanio&nbsp; Diokno and Roman Diokno guilty of the crime of murder, beyond a reasonable doubt, and sentences each of them&nbsp; to&nbsp; <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, to indemnify jointly and severally&nbsp; the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased in the sum of P1,000 and to pay the costs of the suit.&nbsp; "It is so ordered."<br><br>In&nbsp; support of their appeal, the appellants&nbsp; assign the following alleged errors&nbsp; as committed by the&nbsp; court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> in its judgment in question, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The&nbsp; lower court erred in accepting&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; E&nbsp; as evidence.<br></li><li>The lower court erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; admitting&nbsp; Exhibit K&nbsp; as evidence.<br></li><li> The lower court erred in not acquitting the appellant Roman.<br></li><li>The lower court erred in sentencing the appellant Epifanio to <i>reclusion&nbsp; perpetua</i>."</li></ol></blockquote>The following facts have been proven&nbsp; beyond a reasonable doubt during the&nbsp; trial:<br><blockquote>The deceased Yu Hiong was a vendor of sundry goods in Lucena, Tayabas.&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 7 o'clock in the&nbsp; morning of January&nbsp; 4, 1935,&nbsp; Salome&nbsp; Diokno,&nbsp; to&nbsp; whom Yu Hiong was engaged for about a&nbsp; year, invited the latter to go with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yu Hiong&nbsp; accepted the invitation but he told Salome that&nbsp; her father&nbsp; was&nbsp; angry with him.&nbsp; Salome&nbsp; answered him:&nbsp; "No&nbsp; matter, I&nbsp;&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; responsible."&nbsp; At&nbsp; about&nbsp; 6 o'clock in the afternoon of said day, Yu Hiong and Salome Diokno took an&nbsp; automobile&nbsp; and&nbsp; went&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; of Vicente Verina, Salome's cousin,&nbsp; in&nbsp; Pagbilao.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; they found nobody in the house, they went on their way up&nbsp; to San Pablo, Laguna.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; January 5th&nbsp; or&nbsp; 6th of said year, Roman&nbsp; Diokno telegraphed his father&nbsp; Epifanio Diokno, who was in Manila, informing him that Salome had eloped with the Chinese Yu Hiong.&nbsp; On the morning of January 7, 1935, Epifanio Diokno and Roman Diokno went to San Pablo, Laguna, in&nbsp; search&nbsp; of the&nbsp; elopers.&nbsp; Having been informed that the latter were stopping at the house of Antonio Layco,&nbsp; they&nbsp; went there.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; arriving near&nbsp; the house, they saw Yu Hiong coming down the stairs.&nbsp; When Yu Hiong saw them, he ran upstairs and they pursued him. As the&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; found the door of the house locked, he shouted that&nbsp; it be opened for him.&nbsp; At that moment, he was&nbsp; overtaken by&nbsp; the accused who carried knives&nbsp; locally known as <i>balisong</i>, of different sizes.&nbsp; Yu&nbsp; Hiong fell on his knees and implored pardon.&nbsp; In that situation Roman Diokno stabbed him with the knife in the back and later in the&nbsp; left&nbsp; side. Epifanio Diokno also stabbed him&nbsp; once. Yu Hiong fell on the landing of the stairs in the balcony, and there he&nbsp; was again&nbsp; stabbed repeatedly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Roman Diokno said:&nbsp; "Enough, father."&nbsp; Yu Hiong lost consciousness. Juan Alcantara, who lived on the same street, Hermanos Belen, in&nbsp; front of Antonio Layco's house, saw&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; pursue Yu Hiong and fired shots for the police to come.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; hearing the shots,&nbsp; municipal policeman Francisco Curabo appeared and found Yu Hiong pale and lying on the&nbsp; landing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; stairs.&nbsp; He then asked who had wounded&nbsp; the Chinese and the accused Epifanio Diokno answered that it was he.&nbsp; The policeman took&nbsp; the knife (Exhibit C)&nbsp; which Epifanio Diokno carried in his&nbsp; right hand and brought him&nbsp; to&nbsp; police headquarters.&nbsp; Roman Diokno had left before the policeman arrived and he was not located until after three days.&nbsp;&nbsp; The municipal&nbsp; president of San&nbsp; Pablo, Laguna, also went to the scene of the crime, found the&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; almost&nbsp; unconscious and ques- tioned him, putting down his answers in Exhibit E.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese was&nbsp; brought to the provincial hospital of&nbsp; San Pablo where&nbsp; he was examined by Drs.&nbsp; David Evangelista and&nbsp; Manuel Quisiimbing, who found that he had five incised wounds in&nbsp; different parts of the&nbsp; body, one of them at the back and about three and a half inches long, piercing&nbsp; the&nbsp; pleura&nbsp; and&nbsp; penetrating the&nbsp; lower lobe of the right lung about an&nbsp; inch, which wound&nbsp; was necessarily mortal and which caused the death of the victim.&nbsp; On January&nbsp; 8, 1935, while&nbsp; the said Chinese was in a serious condition in the&nbsp; hospital, he made a statement telling how he was attacked by the accused (Exhibit&nbsp; K).</blockquote>The accused, testifying as witnesses in their own behalf, stated that they had&nbsp; not. gone to San Pablo together on the day&nbsp; in question;&nbsp; that when Roman Diokno arrived, his father&nbsp; Epifanio Diokno was coming down the stairs of Antonio Layco's house with a knife in his hand; that Epifanio Diokno told&nbsp; his&nbsp; son&nbsp; Roman to go home and tell their relatives what had&nbsp; happened; that when Epifanio Diokno overtook Yu Hiong on the landing of the stairs of Antonio&nbsp; Layco's house, he&nbsp; asked Yu&nbsp; Hiong whether he was willing to marry his daughter; that the Chinese answered him in&nbsp; the negative and at the same time tried to take something from&nbsp; his pocket;&nbsp; that as Epifanio knew that Yu&nbsp; Hiong carried&nbsp; a&nbsp; revolver,&nbsp; he&nbsp; feared the Chinese might harm him; he became obfuscated,&nbsp; drew his knife and&nbsp; knew not what happened afterwards.<br><br>The first question to&nbsp; be decided&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present appeal is whether or not the court a quo erred in admitting as evidence Exhibit E, consisting in the investigation conducted by the municipal president of San Pablo in the same place where Yu Hiong had fallen a few minutes before, at about 1.30 p. m. on January&nbsp; 7, 1935, and wherein Yu Hiong, answering&nbsp; the&nbsp; questions&nbsp; asked&nbsp; by&nbsp; said municipal president,&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was Roman&nbsp; Diokno and&nbsp; Epifanio Diokno who had wounded him.<br><br>It is argued by the defense that said document Exhibit E should not be&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; on the ground that some words had been altered and because it has not heen proven that the declarant had a sense&nbsp; of impending death.<br><br>It does not appear that said document was altered after it had been signed, but on the contrary, municipal president Jacinto Peiiaflor, upon&nbsp; being&nbsp; cross-examined by the defense,&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that&nbsp; he neither erased any&nbsp; word&nbsp; nor put another&nbsp; in&nbsp; its place after said document had&nbsp; been finished.<br><br>The fact that Yu&nbsp; Hiong failed to&nbsp; state that he&nbsp; had given up all hope of life, in answering the municipal president's questions, does not make his declaration inadmissible.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is enough if, from the circumstances of the&nbsp; case, it can be inferred with certainty that such&nbsp; must have been his state&nbsp; of mind (People vs. Chan Lin Wat, 50 Phil., 182). In&nbsp; the present&nbsp; case,&nbsp; Yu Hiong was&nbsp; semiconscious as&nbsp; a result of the&nbsp; wounds received&nbsp; by him and, consequently, he could&nbsp; not have the hope to live when he made his declaration immediately after&nbsp; he was mortally wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even if the document&nbsp; Exhibit E were not admissible as an ante mortem declaration,&nbsp; it is admissible as a part of the res gestse&nbsp; because&nbsp; it was made&nbsp; under circumstances so proximate&nbsp; to the incident that it&nbsp; may be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as a part thereof.&nbsp; (People vs. Portento and Portento, 48 Phil., 971; People vs.&nbsp; Palamos, 49 Phil., 601.)<br><br>The first assignment of alleged error is, therefore, untenable.<br><br>With respect to the second assignment of alleged error consisting&nbsp; in that the court a quo erred in admitting Exhibit K as an ante mortem declaration of Yu Hiong, because it does not&nbsp; appear that when the declarant made it he was aware of impending death&nbsp; and that he did not die&nbsp; until three&nbsp; days&nbsp; after making it, all&nbsp; that has been said relative to&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; E,&nbsp; which is the subject matter of the first assignment of alleged error, may be repeated&nbsp; in connection with said Exhibit K,&nbsp; in the sense that it is admissible as an&nbsp; ante&nbsp; mortem declaration.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; when the deceased made&nbsp; the declaration Exhibit K, he complained of great difficulty in breathing and&nbsp; of&nbsp; being very ill.&nbsp; The fact that he did not die until three days later neither implies that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had no sense of impending&nbsp; death when he made his declaration because he did not improve thereafter, but became worse&nbsp; until&nbsp; he died; nor detracts&nbsp; from its character&nbsp; of&nbsp; an ante&nbsp; mortem declaration because&nbsp; what gives the declaration such character is the declarants conviction, upon&nbsp; making it, that he is not going to live&nbsp; (U. S. vs. Mallari, 29 Phil., 14).<br><br>The third assignment of alleged error consists in the failure of the court a quo to acquit&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant Roman Diokno.<br><br>The testimony of the eyewitnesses Juan Alcantara and Antonio Layco, corroborated&nbsp; by the different dimensions of the wounds which, according to Dr. Manuel Quisumbing, .were caused&nbsp; by two instruments&nbsp; of different&nbsp; sizes, and the ante mortem declarations&nbsp; (Exhibits E and&nbsp; K) of the deceased, leave no&nbsp; room for&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; that Roman&nbsp; Diokno cooperated&nbsp; with his&nbsp; father and stabbed&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased Yu Hiong with a knife in&nbsp; different parts of the body.&nbsp; Furthermore, the deceased&nbsp; stated in his&nbsp; ante mortem declaration (Exhibit K) that it was&nbsp; Roman Diokno who inflicted the necessarily mortal wound in his back, which caused his death.<br><br>We&nbsp; find&nbsp; the&nbsp; fourth&nbsp; assignment of&nbsp; alleged error well founded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstance of abuse of superior strength, qualifying the crime of&nbsp; murder, which the trial court found to have been proven, has not been&nbsp; established&nbsp; beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In the case of United&nbsp; States&nbsp; vs. Devela (3 Phil., 625), this&nbsp; court said that&nbsp; "the mere&nbsp; fact that the number of the assailants is superior to that of those attacked by them is not sufficient to&nbsp; constitute the aggravating circumstance of&nbsp; abuse of superiority."&nbsp; In this case we have the photographs of the body of the deceased (Exhibits&nbsp; D and&nbsp; D-1)&nbsp; showing that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had a strong constitution ; but there is no evidence of the physical constitution of the&nbsp; accused Epifanio&nbsp; Diokno&nbsp; and&nbsp; Roman Diokno. Therefore, we cannot determine whether or not said accused were physical&nbsp; stronger than the deceased and whether or not they abused such&nbsp; superiority.<br><br>Neither does&nbsp; this court find the existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; other circumstance&nbsp; qualifying murder,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is, evident premeditation, proven beyond&nbsp; a reasonable doubt because, even assuming that both the accused went to San Pablo, Laguna, each carrying the knife used by him in attacking Yu Hiong, it being customary for the people of said province to carry it, it cannot be&nbsp; inferred with certainty from the mere fact that they carried knives that their intention in going to San Pablo was to look for the deceased in order to kill him. In order that premeditation may be considered either as an aggravating circumstance or as a qualifying circumstance, it must be evident, that is, the intention to kill must be manifest and it must&nbsp; have been planned in the mind of the offender and carefully meditated.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; not&nbsp; enough that it arose at the moment of the aggression.<br><br>Therefore,&nbsp; there having been&nbsp; neither abuse&nbsp; of superior strength nor evident&nbsp; premeditation, the crime committed by the accused&nbsp; is simple homicide.<br><br>The presence of the&nbsp; fifth mitigating circumstance&nbsp; of article 13 of the Revised Penal Code, that is, immediate vindication of&nbsp; a grave&nbsp; offense&nbsp; to said&nbsp; accused, may&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; into consideration in favor of&nbsp; the two accused, because&nbsp; although&nbsp; the elopement&nbsp; took place on&nbsp; January 4, Id35, and the&nbsp; aggression on the&nbsp; 7th of said&nbsp; month and year,&nbsp; the offense did not cease while Salome's&nbsp; whereabouts remained unknown and her marriage to the deceased unlegalized.&nbsp; Therefore, there was no interruption&nbsp; from the time the offense was committed&nbsp; to the vindication thereof. Our opinion&nbsp; on this&nbsp; point&nbsp; is based on&nbsp; the fact that the herein accused&nbsp; belong to a family of old customs to whom the elopement of a daughter with a man constitutes a grave offense to their&nbsp; honor and causes disturbance of the peace and tranquillity of the home and at the same time spreads uneasiness and anxiety in the minds of the members thereof.<br><br>The presence of the sixth&nbsp; mitigating circumstance of said article 13,&nbsp; consisting in having acted upon an impulse so powerful as naturally to have produced passion or obfuscation, may&nbsp; also be taken into consideration in favor of the accused.&nbsp; The fact that the accused saw the deceased run upstairs when he became aware of their presence, as if he refused to deal with them after having gravely offended them, was certainly a stimulus strong enough to produce in their&nbsp; mind&nbsp; a fit of&nbsp; passion&nbsp; which blinded them and led them&nbsp; to commit the crime with which they are charged, as held by the&nbsp; Supreme Court of Spain in similar cases in its decisions of February 3, 1888, July 9, 1898, February 8, 1908,&nbsp; May 25, 1910, July 3, 1909, and in other more recent ones.<br><br>The seventh circumstance&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 13 of the Revised Penal Code, consisting in having surrendered himself immediately to the agents of&nbsp; persons in authority, should also be taken into&nbsp; consideration in favor of the accused Epifanio Diokno.<br><br>In view of the foregoing considerations, this court concludes that&nbsp; the accused are&nbsp; guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; homicide defined&nbsp; and punished in article 249&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code, the&nbsp; penalty prescribed therein being <i>reclusion temporal</i> in&nbsp; its full extent. Three mitigating circumstances must&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; into consideration in favor of the accused Epifanio Diokno and two in favor of the accused Roman Diokno, with no aggravating circumstance, thus authorizing the imposition of the penalty next lower&nbsp; to that prescribed by law (<i>reclusion temporal</i>&nbsp; in its full extent), or prision mayor in its full extent, in the period that&nbsp; this&nbsp; court deems applicable,&nbsp; which is the medium period in&nbsp; this case,&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of article&nbsp; 64, rule&nbsp; 5, that is eight years and one day of prision mayor.<br><br>Both&nbsp; accused&nbsp; should&nbsp; be granted the benefits of&nbsp; the indeterminate sentence provided in Act No. 4103, as amended by Act No.&nbsp; 4225, which prescribes a penalty the&nbsp; minimum of which shall be taken from that next&nbsp; lower to&nbsp; <i>prision mayor</i>, or <i>prision correctional</i> of from six months and one day to six years.&nbsp; Taking into account the circumstances of the case,&nbsp; the indeterminate penalty to which each of said accused must be sentenced is fixed at from two years and one day of <i>prision correctional</i> to eight years and one day of prisidn mayor, crediting each with one-half&nbsp; of the time during which&nbsp; they have&nbsp; undergone preventive imprisonment (art. 29, Revised Penal Code).<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; this&nbsp; court&nbsp; declares the accused&nbsp; Epifanio Diokno and Roman Diokno guilty of the crime of homicide and&nbsp; sentences each of&nbsp; them to an indeterminate penalty from two years and one day of <i>prision correctiona</i>l to eight years and one day&nbsp; of <i>prision mayor</i>, crediting them&nbsp; with one-half of the time during which they&nbsp; have undergone preventive imprisonment, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, with the costs&nbsp; of both instances.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Abad Santos,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">CONCURRING AND D E C I S I O N<br></div><br>LAUREL, J., :<br><br>I accept the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; of the majority of my brethren that the crime committed by the defendants and appellants was simple homicide as the existence of either the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation&nbsp; (art.&nbsp; 14, par. 13, Revised Penal Code) or that of abuse of superior strength (art. 14, par. 15, Revised Penal Code),&nbsp; has not been clearly established. The mere fact that the two appellants&nbsp; were both armed with <i>balisong</i> knives and that&nbsp; the deceased knelt before them and implored forgiveness for what he had&nbsp; done is not, in my opinion, necessarily conclusive of the concurrence of abuse of superior strength in the commission of the crime (besides&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S. vs. Devela, 3&nbsp; Phil., 025, 629, vide I Viada,&nbsp; <i>Codigo Penal</i>, pp. 278, 279).&nbsp;&nbsp; To constitute abuse of superior strength, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; necessary to show&nbsp; with sufficient clearness&nbsp; (People vs. Trumata and Baligasa, 49 Phil., 192,&nbsp; 194), that the&nbsp; aggressors, individually and collectively, were greatly&nbsp; superior in strength to the offended party&nbsp; (People&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Dayug&nbsp; and Bannaisan, 49&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 423,<br><br>For the reason given&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority opinion, I&nbsp; also agree to the taking&nbsp; into account&nbsp; of the mitigating circumstance of the appellants having acted upon an impulse so powerful as&nbsp; naturally to&nbsp; have produced passion&nbsp; or obfuscation (art.&nbsp; 13, par. 6, Revised Penal Code).<br><br>I&nbsp; also agree in&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant,&nbsp; Epifanio Diokno, the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. (Art. 13, par. 7, Revised Penal&nbsp; Code.)<br><br>I am of the opinion, however, that the mitigating circumstance of immediate vindication&nbsp; of a grave offense&nbsp; (art. 13, par.&nbsp; 5, Revised&nbsp; Penal Code)&nbsp; should not be considered in favor of the appellants.&nbsp; It should be observed that the proximate cause of the&nbsp; tragedy was the&nbsp; elopement of Salome, the daughter of Epifanio and the sister of Roman. Salome&nbsp; and&nbsp; the deceased had been engaged&nbsp; for about a year and the evidence shows that the elopement took place at the instance of Salome herself.&nbsp; Under existing legisation, a&nbsp; woman eighteen years of age or over, can contract marriage without the consent of her parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; If she leaves the parental home for this&nbsp; purpose, neither she nor her lover commits any offense.&nbsp; Under the doctrine laid down by the majority in the present case, if a woman&nbsp; thirty or more years of age should leave the parental home for the purpose&nbsp; of marrying or for&nbsp; some kind or species of that romance described by Tennyson in his <i>Idylls of&nbsp; the King</i> or by Scott in his <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, against the wishes of her parents, and her father or&nbsp; brother should, in hot pursuit, overtake the impassioned Romeo and&nbsp; kill him on the spot, the enraged assailant or assailants would be accorded the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of having acted in immediate vindication of a "grave offense" committed against them,&nbsp; notwithstanding the maturity or overmaturity in age of the woman and the fact that&nbsp; the elopement was had at her&nbsp; instance and upon her invitation. It seems to me that the&nbsp; interpretation is&nbsp; not in keeping with&nbsp; the <i>mores</i> of the times. Filial&nbsp; respect and family traditions are best conserved by home education or environment, not to speak of other factors, rather than by the rigid or&nbsp; liberal application&nbsp; of the penal&nbsp; laws.&nbsp; The act of the deceased in eloping with Salome, at the invitation of the latter was not a "grave offense" which called for or justified immediate vindication.<br><br>Disregarding the mitigating circumstance of immediate vindication, considering, furthermore,&nbsp; that there are&nbsp; no aggravating circumstances attendant in the commission of the offense, and&nbsp; applying&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of article&nbsp; 64 of the Revised Penal Code and those of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Epifanio Diokno, having in his favor two mitigating circumstances,&nbsp; should be sentenced&nbsp; to an indeterminate prison&nbsp; term ranging from&nbsp; four years, two months and one&nbsp; day of <i>prision correctional</i> to ten years and one day of prisidn mayor, and Roman Diokno, having in his favor only one mitigating circumstance,&nbsp; should&nbsp; be sentenced to an indeterminate prison&nbsp; term ranging from six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> to twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>. <br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br>DIAZ, J.:<br><br>I am firmly convinced that the&nbsp; crime committed by the appellants is not simply homicide but murder.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so qualified by the proven fact that abuse of superior strength, which is one of the circumstances raising homicide, if committed,&nbsp; to the category of murder, was present in the commission thereof (art. 248, subsec. I, of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code).<br><br>From Juan Alcantara's testimony to which the court gives absolute credit, so that it is stated in the majority opinion that he&nbsp; saw the appellants pursue the deceased, Yu Hiong, on&nbsp; said occasion,&nbsp; and that he&nbsp; fired shots in the air&nbsp; in order to call the police for help, it appears that upon looking out of the&nbsp; window of his house, almost fronting that of Antonio Layco on the landing of whose stairs the crime was committed, he saw the deceased running along Hermanos Belen Street&nbsp; pursued&nbsp; at close range by the appellants, anxious to&nbsp; enter Layco's house&nbsp; about twenty or twenty-five meters away&nbsp; (t. s. n.,&nbsp; page 57), in order to escape&nbsp; from the aggression of which he was the victim. It likewise appears that as he saw, upon arriving at the landing of the stairs of Layco's house, that the same&nbsp; was closed and that he had no other means df escape, not having as he, in fact, did not then have any instrument to defend himself, he fell on his knees, and in&nbsp; that position asked the appellants, his pursuers, to forgive him.&nbsp; It finally appears that&nbsp; instead of stopping&nbsp; before such attitude of the deceased,&nbsp; which&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; indicated surrender&nbsp; and&nbsp; acknowledgment of his helplessness, said appellants attacked him with&nbsp; their respective weapons, wounding him&nbsp; in the back, in the side and in&nbsp; other parts of the body, giving him no peace until they saw him down., and bathed&nbsp; in his&nbsp; own blood.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that,when two armed persons attack another who is not armed, as the appellants did to Yu Hiong who was then completely unarmed&nbsp; and showed signs of submission to them by falling on his knees and imploring their forgiveness, the circumstance&nbsp; of abuse of superior strength&nbsp; clearly and undeniably exists.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is because one who flees, falls&nbsp; on his knees later when he&nbsp; can no longer evade his pursuers, and immediately asks their forgiveness, shows not only his desire not to resist but his conviction&nbsp; that he is powerless to offer resistance, thereby admitting&nbsp; his inferiority&nbsp; and the&nbsp; superiority of his assailants.&nbsp; The Supreme&nbsp; Court of Spain, after whose Penal Code&nbsp; ours&nbsp; is patterned, settled a similar question substantially in this sense, in its&nbsp; decision of June 17, 1872.<br><br>In a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; January 23, 1887, said court, resolving the question whether or not the circumstance&nbsp; of abuse of superior strength should be taken into consideration in a ease where two persons attack another,&nbsp; there&nbsp; being no disparity ,in physical strength between the attackers&nbsp; and the attacked,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the former&nbsp; committed the aggression with&nbsp; arms, the&nbsp; latter having only a small rod to defend himself, sustained&nbsp; the affirmative.<br><br>In another&nbsp; decision of January&nbsp; 14, 1899, the question whether or not there was abuse of superior strength in a case where two persons, one armed with a cane and the other with a big stone, attacked another who was unarmed, was likewise resolved by said court in the affirmative.<br><br>The&nbsp; question&nbsp; whether or not&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused, who simultaneously&nbsp; pursued their completely unarmed victim, over-took, surrounded and attacked him later with steel weapons, mortally&nbsp; wounding&nbsp; him,&nbsp; acted&nbsp; with abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; superior strength, was&nbsp; similarly determined&nbsp; in the decision of January 17, 1919,&nbsp; the court having held therein that singleness of action and purpose was present in taking advantage of the victim's lack of means&nbsp; of defense, with the correlative odds in favor&nbsp; of the aggressors.<br><br>Abuse of superior strength is&nbsp; generally determined&nbsp; by the excess of the aggressor's natural strength over that of the victim, taking into consideration&nbsp; the momentary&nbsp; positions of both and the employment of means weakening the defense, although not annulling it (decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of March 6, 1928).&nbsp; If the case under consideration were to be considered in this light, the conclusion must&nbsp; be&nbsp; that&nbsp; the appellants&nbsp; really acted&nbsp; with abuse&nbsp; of superior strength.<br><br>Considering the act committed by the appellants a manifest murder, and not homicide, due to the presence of the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength, and it&nbsp; being a fact that the mitigating&nbsp; circumstances stated in the majority opinion were present in the commission thereof, I&nbsp; am&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; that the penalty that&nbsp; should be imposed upon them,&nbsp; under article 64,&nbsp; rule 5,&nbsp; of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; is from ten years and&nbsp; one day&nbsp; of <i>prision mayor</i> to seventeen years and four months of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, said penalty being next&nbsp; lower to&nbsp; that prescribed for the crime of murder, or at least, the indeterminate&nbsp; penalty of from five years of <i>prision correctional</i> to ten years and&nbsp; one day of <i>prision mayor</i>,&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4103.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp; due respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority opinion, I dissent therefrom and vote as herein stated.</div>
