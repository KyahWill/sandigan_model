				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The rather unusual situation which arises in the instant case can best be 
understood and decision can best be made by a chronological narration of the 
controlling facts.
<p>In September, 1912, Felix Laureano sold to Eugenio Kilayco a piece of 
property situated in the city of Iloilo. Shortly thereafter, the property was 
brought under the Torrens system by a petition presented by Kilayco to the 
proper court which ordered the registration of the property in his name. 
Adjoining the property of Kilayco was other property belonging to Laureano.</p>
<p>When the cadastral survey was initiated in Iloilo in 1914, Kilayco made 
proper representations to confirm the title to his property. Thereafter, title 
was issued to him, but later, for some unknown reason, the certificate of title 
was ordered cancelled and a new one was issued. Then, presumably by mistake, the 
title was made to include not only Kilayco's property but property belonging to 
his neighbor, Laureano. The final decree to this effect was issued on August 29, 
1916.</p>
<p>Creditors of Kilayco, becoming aware of the existence of the title to the 
property above-mentioned, instituted actions and obtained writs of execution 
during the month of May, 1922. The proper annotations were made in the office of 
the register of deeds on the title to the property. The sale of the property was 
set for October 18, 1922.</p>
<p>During all of this time, Laureano had done nothing to protect his interests 
in the property which had been wrongfully adjudicated to Kilayco. He claims to 
have been absent in Spain at the time of the hearing in the cadastral case and 
to have known nothing of it. He only awakened to his danger following the levies 
made by the creditors of Kilayco on the property which Laureano claimed was his. 
On June 3, 1922, Laureano brought action in the Court of First Instance of Uoilo 
against Kilayco to obtain a judgment, declaring him to be the owner of the 
parcels of land, and ordering the cancellation of the certificate of title 
theretofore issued in the name of Kilayco. Kilayco in turn confessed judgment 
which accordingly was rendered practically in the terms of the complaint. The 
trial judge, however, failed to accede to a request to cancel the annotations on 
the certificate of title in favor of the creditors of Kilayco for the very good 
reason that the creditors were not parties to the action.</p>
<p>The present action arises from the foregoing facts. The object was to secure 
a preliminary injunction afterwards to be made permanent, stopping the sale of 
the property at public auction, to annul the levies made on the property, to 
obtain the cancellation in the registry of property of the annotations made, and 
to secure a new title for the plaintiff without these encumbrances. After trial, 
judgment was handed down in favor of the plaintiff. Defendants appealed.</p>
<p>The fundamental principles governing the Torrens system are well known. 
Ordinarily if one takes no steps to protect his property interests at the time 
of the cadastral survey, he is estopped to dispute the title. He has one year 
from the issuance of the decree to allege and prove fraud. But he may not wait 
longer than this period to assert his rights. And were this an ordinary 
registration case, we would reach a conclusion satisfactory to the appellants. 
But we think that there is more to the case than this.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that Kilayco never laid claim to this property; that 
the two lots Nos. 4267 and 4289 covered by the certificate of title No. 830 were 
mistakenly registered in the name of Eugenio Kilayco; that the court did not 
have jurisdiction to confirm the title of said two lots either in favor of 
Eugenio Kilayco or of anybody else, for the reason that no petition for title 
was filed, no trial was held, no evidence was presented, and no judgment was 
rendered regarding these two lots in the land registration proceedings; that 
Kilayco never asserted any right of ownership over the property; that the rent 
was paid to Laureano; and that judgment was obtained in the courts in favor of 
Laureano through the acquiescence and consent of Kilayco. Kilayco was, in 
effect, merely holding the title of the property in trust for Laureano. The 
creditors of Kilayco could acquire no higher or better right than Kilayco had in 
the property, which, in this case, was nothing.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that this was a proper case for the issuance of an 
injunction to prevent the execution of judgments which would be against 
conscience, and that it is just and legal to give to plaintiff Laureano full 
right and title to his property.</p>
<p>Finding no reversible error, judgment is affirmed with costs against the 
appellants. So ordered.</p><i>Johnson, Avance√±a, Villamor, Johns,</i> and 
<i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING</em></div>
<p><strong>STREET, J.:</strong></p>I concur and wish merely to add that in my 
view the case is controlled by the same rule that would govern if the property 
had been held by any other species of title than a Torrens title. By mistake 
property in which Kilayco had no interest or right whatever had become 
registered in Kilayco's name. In him this title was a nude title, the beneficial 
interest being in the true owner, Felix Laureano. Under these circumstances it 
was entirely legitimate and honest for Kilayco to confess judgment in the action 
brought by Laureano to correct the mistake. It is rudimentary that an execution 
creditor acquires only the interest which the execution debtor has in the 
property which is the subject of levy; and the purchaser at the execution sale 
in this case, if the property had been sold, would in any event have taken the 
property subject to the equitable right of Laureano to have the mistake 
corrected. This must be true regardless of the form of the title by which the 
property was held. Section 70 of Act No. 496 plainly shows that, generally 
speaking, registered land is held subject to the same rights and liabilities as 
unregistered land; and this case supplies a good illustration of a right and 
liability identical as regards both.</div>
