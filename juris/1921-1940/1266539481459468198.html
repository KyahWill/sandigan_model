				<H3>JOSE A. ANGARA, PETITIONER, VS. THE  ELECTORAL COMMISSION, PEDRO YNSUA, MIGUEL CASTILLO, AND DIONISIO C. MAYOR, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LAUREL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">This is an original action&nbsp; instituted in this court by the petitioner, Jose A. Angara, for the issuance of a writ of prohibition to restrain and prohibit the Electoral Commission, one of the respondents, from taking further cognizance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; protest filed by Pedro&nbsp; Ynsua,&nbsp; another&nbsp; respondent, against the&nbsp; election of said&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; as&nbsp; member of the National&nbsp; Assembly for the&nbsp; first&nbsp; assembly&nbsp; district of the Province of Tayabas.<br><br>The facts of this case as they appear in the petition and as admitted by the respondents are as follows:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">(1)&nbsp; That in the elections of&nbsp; September 17, 1935, the petitioner, Jose A. Angara, and the respondents, Pedro Ynsua, Miguel Castillo and Dionisio Mayor, were candidates voted for the position of member of the National Assembly for the first district of the Province of&nbsp; Tayabas;<br><br>(2) That on October 7,1935, the provincial board of canvassers, proclaimed&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner as member-elect of the National Assembly for the said district, for having received the most number of votes;<br><br>(3) That on November 15, 1935, the petitioner took his oath&nbsp; of office;<br><br>(4) That on&nbsp; December 3, 1935, the. National&nbsp; Assembly in session assembled, passed the following resolution:<br></font><blockquote><center><font size="4">"[No.&nbsp; 8] "<br>RES0LUCION CONFIRMANDO LAS ACTAS DE AQUE-LLOS DIPUTADOS CONTRA QIJIENES NO SE HA PRESENTADO PROTESTA.</font></center><font size="4"><br>"<i>Se resuelve:</i>&nbsp; Que las actas de eleccion de los Diputados contra quienes no se hubiere presentado&nbsp; debidamente una protesta antes de la adopcion de la presente resolucion&nbsp; sean, como por la presente, son aprobadas y confirmadas. "Adoptada, 3&nbsp; de diciembre, 1935."</font></blockquote><font size="4">(5) That on&nbsp; December 8,&nbsp; 1935,&nbsp; the herein respondent Pedro Ynsua filed&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Electoral&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; a "Motion of Protest" against the election of the herein petitioner, Jose A. Angara, being the only protest filed&nbsp; after the passage of Resolution No. 8 aforequoted, and praying, among other things, that said respondent be declared elected member of the National Assembly for&nbsp; the first district of Tayabas, or that the election of said position be nullified;<br><br>(6) That on December 9, 1935, the Electoral Commission adopted a resolution, paragraph&nbsp; 6 of which provides:<br><br>"6.&nbsp; La Comision no considerara ninguna protesta que no se haya presentado en o antes de este dia."<br><br>(7)&nbsp; That on&nbsp; December 20, 1935, the herein petitioner, Jose A. Angara, one of the respondents&nbsp; in the&nbsp; aforesaid protest, filed before the Electoral Commission a "Motion to Dismiss the Protest", alleging (a)&nbsp; that Resolution No. 8 of the National Assembly was adopted in the legitimate exercise of its&nbsp; constitutional prerogative to prescribe the period during which protests against the election of its&nbsp; members should be&nbsp; presented;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; that the aforesaid resolution has for its object, and is the accepted formula for, the limitation of said period;&nbsp; and (c)&nbsp; that the protest in question was filed out of the prescribed period;<br><br>(8)&nbsp; That on December 27, 1935, the herein respondent, Pedro Ynsua, filed an "Answer to the Motion of Dismissal" alleging that there is no legal&nbsp; or constitutional provision barring the presentation of a protest against the election of a member of the National Assembly, after confirmation;<br><br>(9)&nbsp; That on&nbsp; December 31, 1935, the herein petitioner, Jose A. Angara, filed a "Reply" to the aforesaid "Answer to the Motion of Dismissal";<br><br>(10)&nbsp; That the case being submitted for decision,&nbsp; the Electoral Commission promulgated a resolution on January 23,1936, denying herein petitioner's "Motion to Dismiss the Protest."</font></blockquote><font size="4">The application of the petitioner sets forth the following grounds for the&nbsp; issuance of the writ prayed for:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">(a)&nbsp; That the&nbsp; Constitution confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Electoral Commission solely as regards the merits of contested elections to the National Assembly;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; That the Constitution excludes from said jurisdiction the power to regulate the proceedings of said election contests, which power&nbsp; has&nbsp; been reserved to the&nbsp; Legislative Department of the Government or the&nbsp; National Assembly;<br><br>(c) That like&nbsp; the Supreme Court and other courts created in pursuance of&nbsp; the Constitution, whose exclusive jurisdiction relates solely to deciding the merits of controversies submitted to them&nbsp; for decision&nbsp; and to matters involving their internal&nbsp; organization,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Electoral Commission can regulate its proceedings only if the&nbsp; National Assembly has not availed&nbsp; of its primary power to so regulate such pro- ceedings;<br><br>(d)&nbsp; That Resolution No. 8 of the National Assembly is, therefore, valid and should be respected and obeyed;<br><br>(e) That under paragraph 13 of section 1 of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution and paragraph 6&nbsp; of article 7 of the Tydings-McDuffie Law (No. 127 of the 73rd Congress of the&nbsp; United States) as well as under sections 1 and 3&nbsp; (should be sections 1 and 2) of article VIII of the Constitution, this Supreme Court has jurisdiction to pass upon the fundamental question herein raised because it involves an interpretation of the&nbsp; Constitution of the Philippines.<br><br>On February 25,1936, the Solicitor-General appeared and filed an answer in behalf of the respondent Electoral Commission interposing the following special&nbsp; defenses:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; That the Electoral Commission has been created by the Constitution as&nbsp; an instrumentality&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Legislative Department invested with the&nbsp; jurisdiction to decide "all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the&nbsp; members of the National Assembly"; that in adopting its resolution of December 9, 1935,&nbsp; fixing&nbsp; this date as the last day for the presentation of protests against the election of any member of the National&nbsp; Assembly, it acted within its jurisdiction and in the legitimate exercise of the implied powers granted it&nbsp; by the Constitution&nbsp; to adopt the rules and&nbsp; regulations essential to carry out&nbsp; the powers and functions&nbsp; conferred upon the same by the fundamental law; that in adopting its resolution of January&nbsp; 23, 1936, over-ruling&nbsp; the motion of the petitioner to dismiss the election protest in question, and declaring itself with jurisdiction to take cognizance of said protest, it acted in the legitimate exercise of its quasi-judicial functions as&nbsp; an&nbsp; instrumentality of the&nbsp; Legislative Department of the Commonwealth&nbsp; Government, and hence said act is beyond the&nbsp; judicial cognizance or control of the Supreme&nbsp; Court;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; That the&nbsp; resolution of the National Assembly of December 3,1935, confirming the election of&nbsp; the members of the National Assembly against&nbsp; whom no protest had thus far been filed, could not and did not deprive the Electoral Commission of its jurisdiction to take cognizance of&nbsp; election protests filed within the time that might be set by its own rules;<br><br>(c)&nbsp; That the&nbsp; Electoral&nbsp; Commission is a body invested with quasi-judicial functions, created by the&nbsp; Constitution as an&nbsp; instrumentality of the&nbsp; Legislative Department, and is not&nbsp; an "inferior tribunal, or corporation, or board, or person" within the purview of sections 226 and 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against which prohibition would lie.<br><br>The respondent Pedro Ynsua, in his&nbsp; turn, appeared and filed an answer in his own behalf on March 2, 1936, setting forth the&nbsp; following as his&nbsp; special&nbsp; defense:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; That at the time of&nbsp; the approval of the rules of the Electoral&nbsp; Commission on December 9,&nbsp; 1935, there was no existing law fixing the period within which protests against the election of members of the National&nbsp; Assembly should be filed; that in fixing December 9,1935, as the last day for the filing of protests&nbsp; against the election of members of the National Assembly, the Electoral Commission was exercising a power impliedly conferred upon it by the Constitution, by reason of&nbsp; its quasi-judicial attributes;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; That said respondent presented his motion of protest before the Electoral Commission on December&nbsp; 9, 1935, the last day fixed by paragraph 6 of the rules of the said Electoral Commission;<br><br>(c)&nbsp; That therefore the&nbsp; Electoral Commission&nbsp; acquired jurisdiction over the&nbsp; protest filed&nbsp; by said respondent and over the parties thereto, and the resolution of the Electoral Commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; January 23,&nbsp; 1936, denying&nbsp; petitioner's motion to dismiss said protest was an act within the jurisdiction of the said commission, and is not reviewable by means of&nbsp; a writ of prohibition;<br><br>(d)&nbsp; That neither the law nor the Constitution requires confirmation&nbsp; by the National Assembly of the election of its members, and that such confirmation does&nbsp; not operate to limit the period within which protests should be filed as to deprive the Electoral Commission of&nbsp; jurisdiction over protests filed subsequent thereto;<br><br>(e)&nbsp; That the&nbsp; Electoral&nbsp; Commission is an&nbsp; independent entity created by the Constitution, endowed&nbsp; with quasi-judicial functions, whose decisions&nbsp; are&nbsp; final and unappealable;<br><br>(f)&nbsp; That the Electoral Commission, as a constitutional creation, is not an inferior&nbsp; tribunal, corporation, board or person, within the terms of sections 226 and 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and that neither under the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of article II (should&nbsp; be&nbsp; article VIII) of the Constitution and&nbsp; paragraph 13 of&nbsp; section 1 of the Ordinance appended thereto could it be subject in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions to a writ of prohibition from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court;<br><br>(g)&nbsp; That paragraph&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 7&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tydings-McDuffie Law (No. 127 of the 73rd Congress of the United States) has no application to the case at bar. The case was argued before us on March 13, 1936.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before it was submitted for decision, the petitioner prayed for the issuance of a preliminary writ of injunction against the respondent Electoral Commission which petition was denied "without passing upon the merits of the case"&nbsp; by resolution of this court of March 21,1936.</font></blockquote><font size="4">There was no appearance for the other respondents.<br><br>The issues to be decided in the case at bar may be reduced to the&nbsp; following two principal propositions:</font><br><blockquote><ol><font size="4"></font><li><font size="4"> Has the Supreme Court jurisdiction over&nbsp; the Electoral Commission and the subject matter&nbsp; of the controversy upon the foregoing related facts, and in the affirmative,<br><br></font></li><li><font size="4"> Has the said Electoral Commission acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction in&nbsp; assuming to take cognizance of the protest filed against the election of the herein petitioner notwithstanding the previous&nbsp; confirmation of&nbsp; such election by resolution of the National Assembly?</font></li></ol></blockquote><font size="4">We could perhaps dispose of this case by passing directly upon the merits of the controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the question of jurisdiction having been presented, we do not feel justified in evading the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a case primm impressionis, it would hardly be consistent with our sense of&nbsp; duty to overlook the broader aspect&nbsp; of the question and leave it undecided.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither would we be doing justice to the industry and vehemence of counsel were we not to pass upon the question of jurisdiction squarely presented to our consideration.<br><br>The separation of powers is a fundamental principle in our system of government.&nbsp; It obtains not through express provision but by actual division in our Constitution. Each department of the government has exclusive cognizance of matters within its jurisdiction, and&nbsp; is supreme within its&nbsp; own sphere.&nbsp; But it&nbsp; does not follow from the fact that the three&nbsp; powers are to be&nbsp; kept&nbsp; separate and distinct that the Constitution intended them to be absolutely unrestrained and independent of each other.&nbsp; The Constitution has&nbsp; provided for an elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings&nbsp; of the various departments of the government.&nbsp; For example, the Chief&nbsp; Executive under our Constitution is so far made a check on the legislative power that this assent is required in the enactment of laws.&nbsp; This, however, is&nbsp; subject to the further check that a bill may become a law notwithstanding the refusal of the President to approve it, by a vote of two-thirds or three-fourths, as the case may be, of the National Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The President has also the right to convene the Assembly in special&nbsp; session whenever he chooses.&nbsp; On the other hand, the National Assembly operates as a check on the Executive&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sense that its consent through&nbsp; its Commission on Appointments is necessary in the appointment of certain officers; and the concurrence of a majority of all its members is essential to the conclusion of treaties. Furthermore, in its power to determine what courts other than the Supreme Court shall be established, to define their jurisdiction and to appropriate funds for their support, the National Assembly controls the judicial department to a certain extent.&nbsp; The Assembly&nbsp; also exercises the judicial power of trying impeachments.&nbsp; And the judiciary in turn, with the Supreme Court&nbsp; as the final&nbsp; arbiter, effectively checks the other departments in the exercise of its power to determine the law, and hence to declare executive and legislative acts void if violative of the Constitution.<br><br>But in the main, the Constitution has blocked out with deft strokes and in bold&nbsp; lines, allotment of power to the executive, the legislative&nbsp; and the judicial departments of the government.&nbsp; The overlapping and interlacing of functions and duties between the several departments, however, sometimes makes it hard&nbsp; to say just where the one leaves off and the other begins.&nbsp; In times of social disquietude or political excitement, the great landmarks of the Constitution are apt&nbsp; to be forgotten or marred, if not entirely obliterated.&nbsp; In cases of conflict,&nbsp; the judicial department is the only constitutional organ which can be called upon to determine the proper allocation of powers between the several departments&nbsp; and among the&nbsp; integral or constituent units thereof.<br><br>As any human production, our Constitution is of course lacking perfection and perfectibility, but as much as it was within the power of our people, acting through their delegates to so provide, that instrument which is the expression of their sovereignty however limited, has established a republican government intended to operate and function as a harmonious whole, under a system of checks and balances, and subject to&nbsp; specific limitations and restrictions provided in the said instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constitution sets forth in no uncertain&nbsp; language the restrictions and limitations upon governmental powers and agencies.&nbsp; If these restrictions and limitations are transcended it&nbsp; wquoteuld be&nbsp; inconceivable if the Constitution&nbsp; had not provided for a mechanism by which to direct the course of government along constitutional channels, for then the distribution of powers would be mere&nbsp; verbiage, the bill of rights mere expressions of sentiment, and the principles of good government mere political apothegms.&nbsp; Certainly, the limitations and restrictions embodied in our Constitution are real as they should be in any living constitution.&nbsp; In the United States where no express constitutional grant is found in their constitution, the possession of this moderating power of the courts, not to speak of its historical origin and development there, has been set at rest by popular&nbsp; acquiescense for a&nbsp; period of more than one and a half centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; In our case, this moderating power is granted, if not expressly, by clear implication from section 2 of article VIII of our Constitution.<br><br>The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who&nbsp; is to determine&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature, scope&nbsp; and&nbsp; extent of such powers?&nbsp; The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and&nbsp; sacred obligation assigned to it by the&nbsp; Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish&nbsp; for the&nbsp; parties in an actual controversy the rights which that&nbsp; instrument secures and guarantees to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is in truth all that is involved in what is termed "judicial supremacy" which properly is the power of judicial review under the Constitution.&nbsp; Even&nbsp; then, this power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument&nbsp; by the parties, and&nbsp; limited&nbsp; further to the constitutional question raised or the very <i>lis mota</i>&nbsp; presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to&nbsp; actualities. Narrowed as its function is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency&nbsp; of legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than that, courts&nbsp; accord the&nbsp; presumption of&nbsp; constitutionality&nbsp; to legislative enactments, not only&nbsp; because the legislature&nbsp; is presumed to abide&nbsp; by the Constitution&nbsp; but also because the judiciary in the determination&nbsp; of actual cases&nbsp; and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.<br><br>But much as we&nbsp; might postulate on the internal checks of power provided in our Constitution, it ought not the less to be remembered that, in the language of James Madison, the system itself is not "the chief palladium of constitutional liberty&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; the people who are authors of this blessing must also be its guardians&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; their eyes must be ever ready to mark,&nbsp; their voice&nbsp; to pronounce&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * aggression on the authority of their constitution."&nbsp; In the last&nbsp; and ultimate analysis, then, must the success of our government in the unfolding years to come be tested in the crucible of Filipino minds&nbsp; arid hearts than in consultation rooms and court chambers. &nbsp;<br><br>In the case at bar, the National Assembly has by resolution&nbsp; (No.&nbsp; 8) of December 3, 1935, confirmed the election of the herein petitioner to the said body.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Electoral Commission has by resolution adopted on December 9,&nbsp; 1935, fixed said date as the last day for the filing of protests against&nbsp; the election, returns&nbsp; and qualifications of members of the National Assembly, notwithstanding the previous confirmation made by the National Assembly as aforesaid.&nbsp; If,&nbsp; as contended by the petitioner, the resolution&nbsp; of the National Assembly has the effect of cutting off the power of the Electoral Commission to entertain protests against the election, returns and qualifications of members of the National Assembly, submitted after December 3,1935, then the resolution&nbsp; of the Electoral Commission of December 9, 1935, is mere surplusage and had no effect.&nbsp; But, if, as contended by the respondents, the Electoral Commission has the sole power&nbsp; of regulating its proceedings to the exclusion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Assembly, then the resolution of December 9, 1935, by which the Electoral Commission fixed said&nbsp; date&nbsp; as the last day for filing&nbsp; protests&nbsp; against the election, returns and qualifications&nbsp; of members of the National Assembly, should be upheld.<br><br>Here is then presented an actual controversy involving as it does a conflict of a grave constitutional nature between the National Assembly on the one hand, and the Electoral Commission on the other.&nbsp; From the very nature of the republican government established in our country in the light of American experience and of our own, upon the judicial department is thrown the solemn and inescapable obligation of interpreting the Constitution and defining constitutional boundaries.&nbsp; The Electoral Commission, as we shall have occasion to refer hereafter, is a constitutional organ, created for a specific purpose,&nbsp; namely to determine all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Assembly.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; the&nbsp; Electoral Commission may not be interfered with, when and while act- ing within the limits of its authority, it does not follow that it is&nbsp; beyond the reach&nbsp; of&nbsp; the constitutional&nbsp; mechanism adopted by the people&nbsp; and that it is not subject to constitutional restrictions.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Electoral Commission is not a separate department of the government, and even if it were, conflicting claims of authority&nbsp; under the fundamental law between departmental&nbsp; powers and agencies of the government are necessarily determined by the judiciary in justi- ciable and appropriate cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discarding the English type and&nbsp; other&nbsp; European types of constitutional government, the framers of our Constitution adopted the American type where the written&nbsp; constitution is&nbsp; interpreted and given effect by the judicial department. In some countries which have&nbsp; declined to follow the American example, provisions have&nbsp; been inserted&nbsp; in their&nbsp; constitutions prohibiting the courts from exercising the power to interpret the fundamental law.&nbsp; This is taken as a recognition of what otherwise would be the rule that in the absence of direct prohibition courts are bound to assume what is logically their function.&nbsp; For instance, the Constitution of Poland of 1921, expressly provides that courts shall have no power to examine the validity of statutes (art. 81, chap. IV).&nbsp; The former Austrian Constitution&nbsp; contained a similar declaration.&nbsp; In countries&nbsp; whose constitutions&nbsp; are silent&nbsp; in&nbsp; this respect, courts have assumed this power.&nbsp; This is true in Norway, Greece,&nbsp; Australia and South&nbsp; Africa.&nbsp; Whereas, in&nbsp; Czechoslovakia (arts. 2 and 3, Preliminary Law to Constitutional Charter of the Czechoslovak Republic,&nbsp; February 29, 1920) and Spain (arts. 121-123, Title IX, Constitution of the Republic of 1931) especial&nbsp; constitutional&nbsp; courts&nbsp; are established to pass upon the validity of ordinary laws.&nbsp; In our case, the nature of the present controversy shows the necessity of a final constitutional arbiter to determine the conflict&nbsp; of authority between two agencies created by the Constitution.&nbsp; Were we to decline to take cognizance of the controversy, who will&nbsp; determine the conflict? And if the conflict&nbsp; were left undecided and undetermined, would not a void be thus created in our constitutional system which may in the long run prove destructive of the entire framework?&nbsp; To ask these questions is to answer them.&nbsp; Natura <i>vacuum abhorret</i>, so must we avoid exhaustion in our constitutional system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; principle* reason and authority, we are clearly of the opinion that upon the admitted facts of the present case, this court has jurisdiction over the Electoral Commission and the subject matter of the present controversy for the purpose of determining the character, scope and extent of the constitutional grant to the Electoral Commission as "the sole judge of&nbsp; all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the members of the National Assembly."<br><br>Having disposed of the question of jurisdiction, we shall now proceed to pass upon the second proposition and determine whether the Electoral Commission has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction in adopting its resolution of December 9, 1935, and in assuming to&nbsp; take cognizance of the protest filed against the election of the herein petitioner notwithstanding the previous&nbsp; confirmation thereof by the National Assembly&nbsp; on&nbsp; December 3, 1935.&nbsp; As able counsel for the petitioner has pointed out, the issue hinges on the interpretation of section 4 of Article VI of the Constitution which provides:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"SEC. 4. There shall be an Electoral Commission composed of three Justices of the Supreme Court designated by the Chief Justice, and of six Members chosen by the National Assembly, three of whom shall be nominated by the party having the largest number of votes, and three by the party having the second&nbsp; largest number&nbsp; of votes therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; The senior Justice in the Commission shall be its&nbsp; Chairman, The Electoral Commission shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the members of the National Assembly."&nbsp; It is imperative, therefore, that we delve into the origin and history of this constitutional provision and inquire into the intention of its framers and the people who adopted it so that we may properly appreciate its full meaning, import and significance.</font></blockquote><font size="4">The original provision regarding this subject in the Act of Congress of July 1,1902 (sec. 7, par. 5) laying down the rule that "the assembly shall be the&nbsp; judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its members", was taken from clause 1 of section 5, Article I of the Constitution of the United States providing that "Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members,&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; The Act of Congress of August 29, 1916 (sec. 18, par. 1) modified this provision by the insertion of the word "sole"&nbsp; as follows: "That the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, shall be the sole judges of the elections, returns,&nbsp; and qualifications of their elective members,&nbsp; * * *" apparently in order to emphasize the exclusive character of the jurisdiction conferred upon each House of the Legislature over the particular cases therein specified.&nbsp; This court has had occasion to characterize this grant of power to the&nbsp; Philippine Senate and&nbsp; House of Representatives, respectively, as "full, clear and complete"&nbsp; (Veloso vs. Boards of Canvassers of Leyte and&nbsp; Samar&nbsp; [1919], 39 Phil., 886, 888.)<br><br>The first step towards the creation of an independent tribunal for the purpose of deciding contested elections to the legislature was taken by the sub-committee of five appointed by the Committee on Constitutional Guarantees of the Constitutional Convention, which sub-committee submitted a report on August 30, 1934,&nbsp; recommending the creation&nbsp; of a Tribunal of&nbsp; Constitutional&nbsp; Security empowered&nbsp; to hear protests&nbsp; not only against the election of members&nbsp; of the legislature but also against the election of executive officers for whose election the&nbsp; vote of the whole nation is required, as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as to&nbsp; initiate impeachment proceedings against specified&nbsp; executive and judicial&nbsp; officers.&nbsp; For the purpose of hearing&nbsp; legislative protests, the tribunal was to be composed of three justices designated&nbsp; by the Supreme Court and six members of the house of the legislature to which the contest corresponds, three members to be designated by the majority party and three by the minority, to be presided over by the Senior Justice unless the Chief Justice is also a member&nbsp; in which case the latter shall preside.&nbsp; The foregoing proposal was&nbsp; submitted by the Committee on Constitutional Guarantees&nbsp; to the Convention on September 15, 1934, with slight modifications consisting in the reduction of the legislative representation to&nbsp; four members,&nbsp; that is, two senators&nbsp; to be designated one&nbsp; each&nbsp; from the two&nbsp; major parties in the Senate and two representatives to be designated one each from the&nbsp; two major parties in the&nbsp; House of Representatives, and in awarding representation&nbsp; to the executive department in the&nbsp; persons of two representatives to be designated by the President.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Committee on&nbsp; Legislative Power was also preparing its report.&nbsp; As submitted to the&nbsp; Convention on September&nbsp; 24, 1934, subsection, 5, section 5, of the proposed Article on the Legislative&nbsp; Department, reads as follows:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"The elections, returns and qualifications of the members of either House and all&nbsp; cases&nbsp; contesting the election of any of&nbsp; their&nbsp; members shall&nbsp; be judged&nbsp; by an Electoral Commission, constituted, as&nbsp; to each House, by&nbsp; three members elected by the members of the party having the largest number of votes therein, three elected by the members of the party having the second largest number of votes, and as&nbsp; to&nbsp; its Chairman, one&nbsp; Justice of the Supreme Court designated by the Chief Justice."</font></blockquote><font size="4">The idea of creating a Tribunal of Constitutional Security with comprehensive jurisdiction as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Guarantees which was probably inspired by the Spanish plan (art. 121, Constitution of the Spanish Republic of 1931), was soon abandoned in favor of the proposition of the Committee on Legislative Power to create a similar body with reduced powers and with&nbsp; specific and limited jurisdiction, to be designated as an Electoral Commission.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Sponsorship Committee&nbsp; modified&nbsp; the proposal of the Committee on Legislative Power with&nbsp; respect to the composition of the Electoral Commission and made further changes in phraseology to suit the project of adopting a unicameral instead of a bicameral legislature.&nbsp; The draft as finally submitted to the Convention on October 26, 1934, reads as follows:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"(6) The&nbsp; elections, returns and qualifications&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Members of the National Assembly&nbsp; and all cases contesting the election of any of its Members shall be judged by an Electoral Commission, composed of three members&nbsp; elected by the party having the largest number of votes in the National Assembly, three elected by the members of the party having the second largest number of votes, and three justices of the Supreme Court designated by the Chief Justice, the Commission to be presided over by one of said justices." </font></blockquote><font size="4">During the&nbsp; discussion of the amendment&nbsp; introduced by Delegates Labrador, Abordo, and others, proposing to strike out the whole subsection of the foregoing draft and&nbsp; inserting in lieu thereof the following: "The National Assembly shall be the sole&nbsp; and exclusive judge of the&nbsp; elections, returns,&nbsp; and&nbsp; qualifications of the Members",&nbsp; the following illuminating remarks were made on the floor of the Convention in its session of December 4, 1934, as to the scope of the said draft:</font><br><blockquote><font size="4"><br>&nbsp;

From the time when the commons established their right to be&nbsp; the exclusive judges of the elections,&nbsp; returns, and qualifications of their members,&nbsp; until the year 1770, two modes of proceeding prevailed, in the determination of controverted elections, and rights of membership.&nbsp; One of the standing committees&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; at the commencement of each session, was denominated the committee of privileges and elections, whose function was to hear and investigate all questions of this&nbsp; description which might be referred to&nbsp; them, and&nbsp; to report&nbsp; their proceedings,&nbsp; with their opinion thereupon, to&nbsp; the house, from time&nbsp; to time. When an&nbsp; election petition was referred to this committee. they&nbsp; hearo? the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; and their&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; and other evidence, and made a&nbsp; report of all the evidence, together with&nbsp; their opinion thereupon, in the form of resolutions, which were considered and agreed or disagreed to by the house.&nbsp; The other mode of proceeding was by a hearing at the bar of the house itself.&nbsp; When this court was adopted, the case was heard&nbsp; and&nbsp; decided by the house, in substantially the same manner as by a committee.&nbsp; The committee of privileges and elections although a select committee was usually what is called an open one; that is to say, in order to constitute the committee, a quorum of the members named was required to be present, but all the members of the house were at liberty to attend the committee and vote if they pleased.<br><br>"154. With the growth of political&nbsp; parties in parliament questions relating to the right of membership&nbsp; gradually assumed a political character; so that for many years previous to the year&nbsp; 1770,&nbsp; controverted elections&nbsp; had been tried and determined&nbsp; by the house of commons, as mere party questions, upon which the strength of contending factions might be tested.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; for example, in&nbsp; 1741, Sir Robert Walpole, after repealed attacks upon his government, resigned his office in consequence of&nbsp; an adverse vote upon the Chippenham election.&nbsp; Mr. Hatsell remarks, of the trial of election cases, as conducted under this system, that 'Every principle of decency and justice were notoriously and openly prostituted, from whence the younger part of the house were insensibly,&nbsp; but too successfully, induced to adopt the same licentious conduct in more serious matters, and in questions of higher importance to the public welfare. Mr. George Grenville, a distinguished member of the house of commons, undertook to propose&nbsp; a&nbsp; remedy for&nbsp; the&nbsp; evil, and, on the 7th of March,&nbsp; 1770, obtained the unanimous leave&nbsp; of the house to bring in a bill, 'to regulate the trial of controverted elections, or returns of&nbsp; members&nbsp; to&nbsp; serve in parliament.' In his speech to explain his plan, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion for leave, Mr. Grenville alluded to the existing practice in the following terms: 'Instead of trusting to the merits of their respective causes, the&nbsp; principal&nbsp; dependence of both parties&nbsp; is their private interest among us; and it is scandalously notorious that we are as earnestly canvassed to attend in favor of the opposite sides, as if we were wholly self-elective, and not bound to act by the principles of justice,&nbsp; but by the discretionary impulse of our own inclinations; nay, it is well known, that in every contested election, many members of this house, who are ultimately to judge in a kind of judicial capacity between the competitors, enlist themselves as parties in the contention, and take upon themselves the partial management of the very business, upon which they should determine with the strictest&nbsp; impartiality.'<br><br>"155. It was to put an end to the practices thus described, that Mr. Grenville brought&nbsp; in a bill&nbsp; which&nbsp; met with the approbation of both houses,&nbsp; and received the royal assent on&nbsp; the 12th of April, 1770.&nbsp; This was&nbsp; the celebrated&nbsp; law since known by the name of the Grenville Act; of which Mr. Hatsell declares, that it *was one of the noblest works, for the honor of the house of commons, and the security of the constitution, that was&nbsp; ever&nbsp; devised&nbsp; by any minister or statesman.&nbsp; It is probable, that the magnitude of&nbsp; the evil, or the&nbsp; apparent success of the remedy, may have led many of the contemporaries of the measure to the information of a judgment, which was not acquiesced in&nbsp; by some of the leading statesmen of the day, and has not been entirely confirmed by subsequent experience. The bill was objected to by&nbsp; Lord&nbsp; North, Mr. De Grey, afterwards chief justice of the common pleas, Mr. Ellis, Mr. Dyson,&nbsp; who had been clerk of&nbsp; the house,&nbsp; and Mr.&nbsp; Charles James Fox,&nbsp; chiefly on the ground, that the introduction of the new system was an essential alteration of the constitution of parliament,&nbsp; and a total abrogation of one of the&nbsp; most&nbsp; important rights and jurisdictions of the house of&nbsp; commons."</font></blockquote><font size="4">As early&nbsp; as 1868,&nbsp; the House of Commons in England solved the problem of insuring the non-partisan settlement of the controverted elections of its members by abdicating its prerogative to two judges of the King's Bench of the High Court of Justice selected from a rota in accordance with rules of court made for the purpose.&nbsp; Having proved successful,&nbsp; the practice has become imbedded in English jurisprudence (Parliamentary Elections Act,&nbsp; 1868 . [31 &amp; 32 Viet. c. 125] as amended by Parliamentary Elections and Corrupt Practices Act, 1879 [42 &amp; 43 Viet. c.&nbsp; 75],&nbsp; s. 2; Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act, 1883 [46 &amp; 47 Viet. c. 51], s.&nbsp; 70; Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1911 [1 &amp; 2 Geo. 5, c. 22]; Laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; England, vol.&nbsp; XII, p. 408, vol. XXI, p. 787).&nbsp; In the Dominion&nbsp; of Canada, election contests which were originally heard by the Committee of the House of Commons, are since 1922 tried in the courts. Likewise, in the Commonwealth of Australia,&nbsp; election con- tests&nbsp; which were originaHy determined by&nbsp; each&nbsp; house, are since 1922&nbsp; tried&nbsp; in the&nbsp; High&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; In Hungary, the organic law provides that all protests&nbsp; against the election of members of the Upper House&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Diet&nbsp; are to be resolved&nbsp; by the Supreme Administrative Court (Law 22 of 1916, chap. 2, art. 37, par. 6).&nbsp; The&nbsp; Constitution of Poland of March&nbsp; 17, 1921 (art. 19)&nbsp; and the Constitution, of the Free City of Danzig of&nbsp; May 13, 1922 (art. 10) vest the authority to&nbsp; decide contested elections to the Diet or National Assembly in the Supreme Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of&nbsp; deciding&nbsp; legislative contests, the Constitution of the German Reich of July 1, 1919 {art. 31), the Constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic of February 29,&nbsp; 1920&nbsp; (art. 19)&nbsp; and the Constitution of the Grecian Republic of June 2, 1927 (art. 43), all provide for an Electoral Commission.<br><br>The creation of an Electoral Commission whose membership is recruited both from the legislature and the judiciary is by no&nbsp; means&nbsp; unknown in the United&nbsp; States.&nbsp; In the presidential elections of 1876 there&nbsp; was a dispute as to the number of electoral votes received&nbsp; by each of the two opposing candidates.&nbsp; As the Constitution made no adequate provision for such a contingency, Congress passed a law on January 29, 1877 (United States Statutes&nbsp; at Large,&nbsp; vol. 19, chap. 37, pp. 227-229), creating a special&nbsp; Electoral Commission composed of five members elected by the Senate, five members elected by the House of Representatives,&nbsp; and five justices of the Supreme Court, the fifth justice to be selected by&nbsp; the four designated in the Act.&nbsp; The decision of the commission was to be binding unless rejected by the two houses voting separately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is not much of&nbsp; a&nbsp; moral lesson to&nbsp; be derived from the experience of America in this regard, .judging from the observations of Justice Field, who was a member of that body on the part of&nbsp; the Supreme Court (Countryman,, the Supreme&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; the United States and its Appellate Power under the Constitution [Albany, 1913]—Relentless&nbsp; Partisanship of Electoral Commission, p. 25 <i>et seq.</i>)t the experiment&nbsp; has at least abiding historical interest.<br><br>The members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Constitutional&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; who framed&nbsp; our fundamental law were&nbsp; in their majority men mature in years and experience.&nbsp; To be sure, many of them were&nbsp; familiar with&nbsp; the history and political&nbsp; development of&nbsp; other countries of&nbsp; the world.&nbsp; When, therefore,&nbsp; they deemed it&nbsp; wise&nbsp; to create an Electoral Commission as a constitutional organ and invested it with the exclusive function of passing upon and determining the election, returns and qualifications of the members of the National Assembly, they must have done so not only in the light of their own experience but also having in view the experience of other enlightened peoples of the world.&nbsp; The creation of the Electoral&nbsp; Commission was designed to&nbsp; remedy certain evils of which the framers of our Constitution were cognizant. Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of some members of the Convention to its creation, the plan, as hereinabove stated, was approved by that body by a vote of 98 against 58.&nbsp; All that can be&nbsp; said now is that, upon the approval of the Constitution, the creation of the Electoral Commission people".&nbsp; (Abraham&nbsp; Lincoln,&nbsp; First&nbsp; Inaugural&nbsp; Address, March&nbsp; 4, 1861.)<br><br>From the deliberations of our Constitutional Convention it is evident that the purpose was to transfer in its totality all&nbsp; the&nbsp; powers&nbsp; previously exercised by the legislature in matters pertaining to contested elections of its members, to an independent and impartial tribunal.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not so much the knowledge and appreciation of contemporary constitutional precedents,&nbsp; however, as the&nbsp; long-felt&nbsp; need of determining legislative&nbsp; contests devoid of partisan considerations which prompted the people, acting through their delegates to the&nbsp; Convention, to provide for this body known as the&nbsp; Electoral Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this&nbsp; end in view,&nbsp; a composite body&nbsp; in which both the majority and minority parties&nbsp; are equally represented to off-set partisan influence in its deliberations was created, and further endowed&nbsp; with judicial temper&nbsp; by including in its membership three justices of the 'Supreme Court.<br><br>The Electoral Commission&nbsp; is a constitutional creation, invested with the necessary authority in the performance and execution of the limited and specific function assigned to it by the&nbsp; Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is not a power in our tripartite scheme of government, it is, to all intents and purposes, when&nbsp; acting within the limits of its authority, an independent organ.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is, to be sure, closer to the legislative department than to&nbsp; any other.&nbsp; The location of the provision&nbsp; (section 4)&nbsp; creating the Electoral&nbsp; Commission under Article VI entitled "Legislative Department"&nbsp; of our Constitution&nbsp; is&nbsp; very&nbsp; indicative.&nbsp; Its composition is&nbsp; also significant in that it is constituted by a majority of members of the legislature.&nbsp; But it&nbsp; is a body separate from and in- dependent of the legislaturer.<br><br>The grant of power to the Electoral Commission to judge all contests&nbsp; relating to the election, returns and qualifications of members of the National Assembly, is intended to be as complete and unimpaired as if it had remained originally in the legislature.&nbsp; The express lodging of that power in the Electoral Commission is an implied denial of the exercise of that power by the&nbsp; National Assembly.&nbsp; And this is as effective a restriction upon the legislative power as an express prohibition in the Constitution (Ex parte Lewis, 45 Tex. Crim. Rep., 1; State&nbsp; vs. Whisman, 36 S. D., 260; L. R. A.,&nbsp; 1917B, 1).&nbsp; If we concede the power claimed in behalf of the National Assembly that said body may regulate the proceedings of the Electoral Commission and cut off the power&nbsp; of the&nbsp; commission to&nbsp; lay down the period within which protests should be filed, the grant of power to the commission would be ineffective.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Electoral Commission in such case would be invested with&nbsp; the power to determine contested cases involving the election,&nbsp; returns&nbsp; and qualifications of the members of the National Assembly but subject at all times to the regulative power of the National Assembly.&nbsp; Not only would&nbsp; the purpose of the framers of our Constitution of totally transferring this authority from the legislative body be frustrated, but a dual authority would be&nbsp; created&nbsp; with the&nbsp; resultant inevitable clash of powers from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sad spectacle would then be presented of the Electoral&nbsp; Commission retaining the bare authority of taking cognizance of cases referred&nbsp; to,&nbsp; but in reality without the necessary means to render&nbsp; that authority effective whenever and wherever the&nbsp; National Assembly has chosen to act, a situation worse than&nbsp; that intended to be remedied by the framers of our Constitution.&nbsp; The power to regulate on the part of&nbsp; the National Assembly&nbsp; in procedural matters will inevitably lead&nbsp; to the ultimate control by the Assembly of the entire&nbsp; proceedings of the Electoral Commission, and, by indirection,&nbsp; to the entire abrogation of the constitutional grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious that this result should not be permitted.<br><br>We are not insensible to the impassioned argument of the learned&nbsp; counsel for the petitioner regarding the importance and&nbsp; necessity of respecting the dignity&nbsp; and independence of the National Assembly as a coordinate department of the government and of according validity to its acts, to avoid what he characterized&nbsp; would be practically an unlimited power of the commission in the admission of protests against members of the National Assembly.&nbsp; But as we have pointed out hereinabove, the creation of the Electoral Commission carried with it ex necessitate to the power regulative in character to limit the time within which protests intrusted to its cognizance should be filed.&nbsp; It is a settled rule of construction that where a general power is conferred or duty enjoined, every particular power necessary for the exercise of the one or&nbsp; the performance of the other is also conferred&nbsp; (Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, eighth ed., vol. I, pp.&nbsp; 138, 139).&nbsp; In the absence of any further constitutional provision relating to the procedure to be followed in filing protests before the Electoral Commission, therefore, the incidental power&nbsp; to promulgate such&nbsp; rules necessary for the proper exercise of its exclusive power&nbsp; to judge all contests relating to the election, returns and Qualifications of members of the&nbsp; National Assembly, must be deemed&nbsp; by necessary&nbsp; implication to have been lodged also in the Electoral Commission.<br><br>It is,&nbsp; indeed, possible that,&nbsp; as suggested by counsel for the petitioner,&nbsp; the Electoral&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; may&nbsp; abuse its regulative&nbsp; authority&nbsp; by admitting protests&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; any reasonable&nbsp; time, to the disturbance of the tranquillity and peace of mind of the members of the National Assembly.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; possibility of&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; is&nbsp; not an argument against the concession&nbsp; of the power as&nbsp; there is no power that is not susceptible of abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second place,&nbsp; if any mistake has been committed in the creation of an Electoral Commission and in investing it with exclusive jurisdiction in all cases relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of members of the National Assembly, the remedy is political, not judicial, and must be sought through the ordinary processes of democracy.&nbsp; All the possible abuses of the government are not intended to be corrected by the judiciary.&nbsp; We believe, however, that the people in creating the Electoral Commission reposed as much confidence in this body in the exclusive determination of the specified cases&nbsp; assigned to it, as they&nbsp; have given to the Supreme Court in the proper cases entrusted to it for decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the agencies of the government were designed by the&nbsp; Constitution to&nbsp; achieve specific purposes, and each&nbsp; constitutional organ working within its&nbsp; own&nbsp; particular sphere&nbsp; of&nbsp; discretionary action must be deemed to be&nbsp; animated with the&nbsp; same zeal and honesty in accomplishing the great ends for which they were created by&nbsp; the sovereign will.&nbsp; That the actuations of these constitutional agencies might leave much to be desired in given instances, is inherent in the imperfections of human institutions.&nbsp; In the third place,&nbsp; from the&nbsp; fact that the Electoral Commission may not be interfered with in the exercise&nbsp; of its legitimate&nbsp; power, it does not follow that its acts, however illegal or unconstitutional, may not be challenged in&nbsp; appropriate cases over&nbsp; which the&nbsp; courts may exercise jurisdiction.<br><br>But independently of the legal and constitutional&nbsp; aspects of the present case, there are considerations of&nbsp; equitable character that should not&nbsp; be overlooked in the appreciation of the intrinsic merits of the controversy.&nbsp; The Commonwealth Government was inaugurated on November 15,1935, on which date the Constitution, except as&nbsp; to the provisions mentioned&nbsp; in section 6 of Article&nbsp; XV thereof, went&nbsp; into effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new National Assembly convened on November 25th of that year, and the&nbsp; resolution confirming the election of the petitioner, Jose A. Angara, was approved by that body on December 3, 1935.&nbsp;&nbsp; The protest by the herein respondent Pedro Ynsua against the election of the petitioner was filed on December 9 of the same year.&nbsp; The pleadings do not show when the Electoral Commission was formally organized but it does appear that on December&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1935, the Electoral Commission met for the first time and approved a resolution fixing said&nbsp; date as the last day for the filing of election&nbsp; protests.&nbsp; When, therefore, the&nbsp; National Assembly passed its resolution of December 3,1935, confirming the election of the petitioner to the National Assembly, the Electoral Commission had not yet met;&nbsp; neither does it appear&nbsp; that said&nbsp; body had&nbsp; actually been organized.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a matter of fact, according to certified copies of official records on file in the archives division of the National Assembly attached&nbsp; to the record&nbsp; of&nbsp; this case&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; petition of the petitioner, the three justices of the Supreme Court and&nbsp; the&nbsp; six&nbsp; members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Assembly constituting the&nbsp; Electoral Commission were respectively designated only on December&nbsp; 4&nbsp; and 6,&nbsp; 1935.&nbsp; If Resolution No. 8 of the&nbsp; National Assembly confirming non-protested elections of members of the National Assembly had the effect of limiting or tolling the time for the presentation of protests, the result would be that the National Assembly—on the hypothesis that it still retained the incidental power of regulation in such cases—had already barred the presentation&nbsp; of protests before the Electoral Commission had had time&nbsp; to&nbsp; organize itself and deliberate&nbsp; on the mode and method to be followed in a matter entrusted to its exclusive jurisdiction by the&nbsp; Constitution.&nbsp; This result was&nbsp; not and could not have been contemplated, and should be avoided.<br><br>From&nbsp; another angle, Resolution No.&nbsp; 8&nbsp; of the National Assembly confirming the election of members against whom no protests had&nbsp; been filed at&nbsp; the time of&nbsp; its passage on December 3,1935, can not be construed as a limitation upon the time for&nbsp; the initiation of election contests.&nbsp; While there might have been good&nbsp; reason for the legislative practice of confirmation of the election of members of the legislature at the time when the power to decide election contests was still lodged in the legislature, confirmation alone by the legislature&nbsp; cannot be construed&nbsp; as&nbsp; depriving the Electoral Commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; incidental to its constitutional power to be "the sole&nbsp; judge&nbsp; of all contests relating to the election,&nbsp; returns, and qualifications of the&nbsp; members of the National Assembly", to fix the time for the filing&nbsp; of said election protests.&nbsp; Confirmation by the National Assembly of the returns of its&nbsp; members against whose election&nbsp; no protests have been filed is, to all legal purposes, unnecessary.&nbsp; As contended by the Electoral Commission in its resolution of January 23, 1936, overruling the motion of the herein petitioner&nbsp; to dismiss&nbsp; the&nbsp; protest filed by the respondent Pedro Ynsua, confirmation of the election of any member is not required by the Constitution before he can discharge his duties as such member.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, certification by the proper provincial&nbsp; board of canvassers is sufficient to entitle&nbsp; a member-elect to a seat in the National Assembly and to render him eligible&nbsp; to any office in said body (No. 1, par. 1, Rules of the National Assembly, adopted December 6, 1935).<br><br>Under the practice prevailing both in the English House of Commons and in the Congress of the United States, confirmation is neither necessary in order&nbsp; to entitle a member-elect to take his&nbsp; seat.&nbsp; The return of the&nbsp; proper election officers is sufficient, and the member-elect presenting such return begins to enjoy the&nbsp; privileges of a member from the time that he takes his&nbsp; oath of office (Laws of England, vol. 12, pp. 331, 332; vol. 21, pp. 694, 695; U. S. C. A., Title 2, sees. 21, 25, 26).&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirmation is in order only in cases of contested elections where the decision is adverse to the claims of the protestant.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; England, the judges' decision or report in controverted elections is certified to the Speaker&nbsp; of the House of Commons, and the House, upon being informed of such certificate or report by the Speaker, is required&nbsp; to enter the same upon the Journals, and to give such directions for confirming or altering the return, or for the issue of a writ for a new election, or for carrying into execution the determination&nbsp; as circumstances may require (31 &amp; 32 Viet., c. 125, sec. 13).&nbsp; In&nbsp; the United States, it is believed, the order or decision of the particular house itself is generally regarded as sufficient, without any actual alteration or amendment of the return&nbsp; (Cushing, Law and Practice of Legislative Assemblies, 9th ed., sec.&nbsp; 166).<br><br>Under the practice prevailing when&nbsp; the Jones Law was still in force, each house of the Philippine Legislature fixed the time when protests against the election of any&nbsp; of its members&nbsp; should be filed.&nbsp; This was expressly authorized by section 18 of the Jones Law making each house the sole judge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the election, returns and qualifications&nbsp; of its members, as well as by a law (sec. 478, Act No. 3387) empowering each house to respectively&nbsp; prescribe by resolution the time&nbsp; and manner of filing&nbsp; contest in the election of members of said bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of formality, after the time fixed by its rules' for the filing of protests had already expired, each house passed a resolution confirming or approving the returns of such members&nbsp; against&nbsp; whose election no&nbsp; protests had been filed&nbsp; within the prescribed time.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was interpreted as cutting off the filing of further protests&nbsp; against the&nbsp; election of&nbsp; those members not theretofore&nbsp; contested (Amistad&nbsp; vs. Claravall&nbsp; [Isabela], Second&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Legislature, Record—First Period,&nbsp; p. 89; Urgello vs.&nbsp; Rama [Third District,&nbsp; Cebu], Sixth Phil- ippine Legislature; Fetalvero&nbsp; vs. Festin [Romblon],&nbsp; Sixth Philippine Legislature, Record—First Period, pp. 637-640; Eintanar vs. Aldanese [Fourth District, Cebu], Sixth Phil- ippine, Legislature, Record—First Period, pp.&nbsp; 1121,&nbsp; 1122; Aguilar vs.&nbsp; Corpus [Masbate],&nbsp; Eighth&nbsp; Philippine Legislature, Record—First Period, vol. Ill, No. 56,&nbsp; pp. 892,&nbsp; 893). The Constitution has&nbsp; repealed section 18 of the Jones Law. Act No. 3387, section 478, must be deemed to have been impliedly&nbsp; abrogated&nbsp; also,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that with the power to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; all&nbsp; contests relating&nbsp; to the election, returns and qualifications of members of the National Assembly, is inseparably linked the authority to prescribe regulations for the exercise of that power.&nbsp; There was thus no&nbsp; law nor constitutional provision which&nbsp; authorized the National Assembly to fix, as it is alleged to have fixed on December 3, 1935, the time for the filing of contests&nbsp; against the election of its members.&nbsp; And&nbsp; what the National Assembly could not do directly, it could not do by indirection through the medium of confirmation.<br><br>Summarizing, we conclude:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">(a)&nbsp; That the government established by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution follows fundamentally&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; of separation of powers into the legislative, the executive and the judicial.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; That the system of checks and balances and the over-lapping of functions and duties&nbsp; often makes difficult the delimitation of the powers granted.<br><br>(c)&nbsp; That in cases of conflict between the several&nbsp; departments&nbsp; and among the agencies thereof, the judiciary, with the Supreme Court&nbsp; as the final arbiter, is the only constitutional mechanism devised finally to&nbsp; resolve the conflict and allocate constitutional boundaries.<br><br>(d)&nbsp; That judicial supremacy is but the power of&nbsp; judicial review in actual and appropriate cases and&nbsp; controversies, and&nbsp; is the power and duty to see&nbsp; that no one&nbsp; branch or agency of the&nbsp; government&nbsp; transcends&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution, which is the source of all authority.<br><br>(e)&nbsp; That the Electoral&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; is an independent constitutional creation with specific powers and&nbsp; functions to execute and perform, closer for purposes of classification to the&nbsp; legislative than to any of the other two departments of the government.<br><br>(f)&nbsp; That the Electoral Commission is the sole judge of all contests&nbsp; relating to the election, returns and qualifications of members of the&nbsp; National Assembly.<br><br>(g)&nbsp; That&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; organic law prevailing before the present&nbsp; Constitution went into effect,&nbsp; each&nbsp; house of the legislature was respectively the sole judge of the elections, returns,&nbsp; and qualifications of their elective members.<br><br>(h)&nbsp; That&nbsp; the present Constitution has transferred all the powers previously exercised by&nbsp; the legislature with respect to contests relating to the election, returns and quali- fications of its members, to the Electoral Commission.<br><br>(i) That such transfer of power from the legislature to the Electoral Commission was full, clear and complete, and carried&nbsp; with it&nbsp; <i>ex&nbsp; necesitate rei</i> the implied power inter alia to prescribe the rules and regulations as to the time and manner of filing protests.<br><br>(j) That the&nbsp; avowed purpose in&nbsp; creating the Electoral Commission was to have&nbsp; an independent&nbsp; constitutional organ pass upon all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications&nbsp; of members of the National Assembly, devoid of partisan influence or consideration, which object would be frustrated if the National Assembly were to retain the power to prescribe rules and regulations regarding&nbsp; the manner of conducting said&nbsp; contests.<br><br>(k) That section 4 of article VI of the Constitution repealed not only&nbsp; section 18 of the Jones Law making each house of&nbsp; the Philippine Legislature respectively the sole judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its elec- tive members, but&nbsp; also section 478 of Act No. 3387 empowering each house to prescribe by resolution the time and manner of filing contests against the election of its members, the time and manner of notifying&nbsp; the adverse&nbsp; party, and bond&nbsp; or bonds, to be required, if any, and to fix the costs and expenses of contest.<br><br>(l)&nbsp; That confirmation by the National&nbsp; Assembly&nbsp; of&nbsp; the election of any member, irrespective&nbsp; of whether his election is contested or not, is&nbsp; not&nbsp; essential before such member-elect may discharge the duties and enjoy&nbsp; the privileges of a member of the National Assembly.<br><br>(m) That confirmation by the National&nbsp; Assembly of&nbsp; the election of any member against whom no&nbsp; protest had been filed prior to said confirmation, does not and cannot deprive the Electoral Commission of its&nbsp; incidental power to prescribe the time within which protests against the election of any member of the National Assembly should be filed.</font></blockquote><font size="4">We hold, therefore, that the Electoral Commission was acting within the legitimate exercise of its constitutional prerogative in assuming to take cognizance of the protest filed by the respondent Pedro Ynsua against the election of the herein petitioner Jose A. Angara, and that the resolution of the National Assembly of December 3,1935 can not in any manner toll the time for filing protests against the election, returns and qualifications of members of the National As* sembly, nor prevent the filing of a protest within such time as the rules of the Electoral Commission might prescribe.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the conclusion reached by us relative to the character of the Electoral Commission as a constitutional creation and as to the scope and extent of its authority under the facts of the present controversy, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether the Electoral Commission is an inferior tribunal, corporation, board or person within the purview of sections 226 and&nbsp; 516 of the Code of Civil Procedure.<br><br>The petition for a writ of prohibition against the Electoral Commission is hereby denied, with costs&nbsp; against the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C.&nbsp; J., Diaz, Conception</i>, and <i>Arellano, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br></font><hr style="height: 4px;" align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><font size="4"></font><center><font size="4"><b>CONCURRING</b></font></center><font size="4"><br>ABAD SANTOS, J.:<br><br>I concur in the result and in most of the views so ably expressed in the preceding opinion.&nbsp; I am, however, constrained to withhold my assent to certain conclusions therein advanced.<br><br>The power vested&nbsp; in the Electoral&nbsp; Commission by the Constitution of judging of all&nbsp; contests relating to the election, returns, and&nbsp; qualifications&nbsp; of the&nbsp; members of&nbsp; the National Assembly, is judicial in&nbsp; nature.&nbsp; (Thomas vs. Loney,&nbsp; 134 U. S., 372;&nbsp; 33 Law. ed.f&nbsp; 949,&nbsp; 951.)&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the power to regulate the time in which notice of&nbsp; a&nbsp; contested&nbsp; election may be&nbsp; given,&nbsp; is legislative&nbsp; in character.&nbsp;&nbsp; (M'Elmoyle vs.&nbsp; Cohen, 13 Pet., 312;&nbsp; 10 Law. ed., 1,77; Missouri vs. Illinois, 200 U. S., 496; 50 Law. ed., 572.)<br><br>It has been correctly stated that the government established by the Constitution follows fundamentally the theory of the separation of powers into legislative, executive, and judicial.&nbsp; Legislative power is vested 'in the National Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Article VI, sec. 1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of any clear constitutional provision to the contrary, the power to regulate the time in which notice of a contested election may be given, must be deemed to be included in the grant of legislative power to&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Assembly.<br><br>The Constitution of the United States contains a provision similar to that found in Article VI,&nbsp; section 4, of the Constitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article I, section&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; of the Constitution of the United States provides that each house of the Congress shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its&nbsp; own&nbsp; members.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this provision, the Congress has assumed the power to regulate the time in which&nbsp; notice of a contested election may be given.&nbsp; Thus section 201, Title 2, of the United States Code Annotated prescribes:<br><blockquote>"Whenever any person intends to contest an election of any Member of the House of Representatives of the United States, he shall, within thirty days after the result of such election shall have been determined&nbsp; by the officer or board of canvassers&nbsp; authorized by&nbsp; law to determine&nbsp; the same, give notice, in writing, to the Member whose seat he de- signs to contest, of his intention to contest the same, and, in such notice, shall specify particularly the grounds upon which he&nbsp; relies in the contest."&nbsp; (R. S., par. 105.)</blockquote>The Philippine Autonomy Act, otherwise known as the Jones Law, also contained a provision to the effect that the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, shall be the sole judges of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their elective members.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this provision, the Philippine Legislature passed the Election Law, section 478 of which reads as follows:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"The Senate and the House&nbsp; of Representatives shall by resolution respectively prescribe the time and manner of filing contest in the election of&nbsp; members of said bodies, the time and manner of notifying the adverse party, and bond or bonds, to be required, if any, and shall fix the costs and expenses of contest which may be paid from&nbsp; their respective funds."</font></blockquote><font size="4">The&nbsp; purpose sought to be attained by the creation of the Electoral Commission was not to erect a body that would be above the law, but to raise legislative election contests from the category of political&nbsp; to that of justiciable questions.&nbsp; The purpose was not to place the commission beyond the reach of the law, but to insure the determination of such contests with due process of law.<br><br>Section 478 of the Election Law was in force at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, Article'XV, section 2, of which provides that—<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"All laws of the Philippine Islands shall continue in force until the inauguration of the&nbsp; Commonwealth of the Philippines ; thereafter, such laws shall remain operative, unless inconsistent with this Constitution, until amended, altered, modified, or repealed by the&nbsp; National Assembly, and all references in such laws to the Government or officials of the Philippine Islands shall be construed, in so far as applicable, to&nbsp; refer to the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; and&nbsp; corresponding officials under&nbsp; this Constitution."</font></blockquote><font size="4">The&nbsp; manifest purpose of this constitutional provision was to insure the orderly processes of government, and to prevent any hiatus in its operation&nbsp; after the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was thus&nbsp; provided that all laws of the Philippine Islands shall remain operative even after the inauguration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, unless inconsistent with the&nbsp; Constitution, and that all references in such laws to&nbsp; the&nbsp; government or officials of the Philippine Islands shall be construed,&nbsp; in so far as applicable, to refer to the government and corresponding officials under the Constitution.&nbsp; It would seem to be consistent not only with the spirit but with the letter of the Constitution to hold that section 478 of the Election Law remains operative and should now be construed to refer to the Electoral Commission,&nbsp; which, in so^far as the&nbsp; power to judge election contests is concerned, corresponds&nbsp; to either the&nbsp; Senate&nbsp; or the&nbsp; House of Representatives under&nbsp; the former regime.&nbsp; It is important to observe in this connection that said section 478&nbsp; of the Election Law vested the power to regulate the time and manner in which&nbsp; notice of a contested election may be&nbsp; given, not in the Philippine Legislature but in the Senate and House of Representatives singly.&nbsp; In other words, the authority to prescribe the time and manner of filing contests in the election of members of the Philippine Legislature was by statute lodged separately in the bodies clothed with power to decide&nbsp; such&nbsp; contests. Construing section 478 of the Election Law to refer to the National Assembly, as required by&nbsp; Article XV, section 2, of the Constitution, it seems reasonable to conclude that the authority to prescribe the time and manner of filing contests in the election of members&nbsp; of the National Assembly is vested in the Electoral Commission,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is now&nbsp; the body clothed with power to decide such contests.<br><br>In the light of what has been said, the resolution of the National Assembly of December 3,1935, could not&nbsp; have the effect of barring the&nbsp; right of the respondent Pedro Ynsua to contest the election of the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, the Electoral Commission was authorized by law&nbsp; to adopt its resolution of December 9,1935, which fixed the time with- in which written contests&nbsp; must be filed with the&nbsp; commission.<br><br>Having been filed within the time fixed by its resolution, the Electoral Commission has jurisdiction to hear and determine the&nbsp; contest&nbsp; filed by the respondent&nbsp; Pedro Ynsua against the petitioner Jose A. Angara.&nbsp; Writ denied.</font></div>
