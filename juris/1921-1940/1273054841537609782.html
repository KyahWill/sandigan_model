				<BR><STRONG>VICKERS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Leyte 
finding the defendant guilty of the crime of homicide, with the presence of the 
mitigating circumstances of obfuscation and lack of instruction, and sentencing 
him to suffer ten years and one day of presidio mayor, and the accessory 
penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 
P1,000, and to pay the costs.
<p>The accused was tried on a plea of not guilty to the following 
information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Que en o hacia el 4 de octubre de 1930, en el Municipio de Dulag, Provincia 
de Leyte, Islas Filipinas, y dentro de la jurisdiccion de este Juzgado, el 
acusado arriba mencionado voluntaria, ilegal y criminalmente con un bolo que 
consigo llevaba, agredio a Evaristo Amarilla causando a este varias lesiones en 
las diferentes partes de su cuerpo y a consecuencia de las mismas dicho Evaristo 
Amarilla murio instantaneamente."</p></blockquote>
<p>The attorney <em>de oficio</em> of the appellant alleges that the trial court 
erred in finding the accused guilty of the crime imputed to him in the 
information, and in sentencing him for said crime.</p>
<p>The assignments of error raise only questions of fact, and after considering 
the evidence, we find that the conclusions of the trial court as to the guilt of 
the accused are fully sustained by the evidence of record. </p>
<p>It appears from the evidence that on October 3, 1930 the defendant and the 
deceased played the card game known as "junkian" in the house of the deceased. 
After winning a peso, the deceased refused to play any longer. The defendant was 
angered by this action of the deceased. He went downstairs, and challenged the 
deceased to fight, but the deceased refused to go outside, and at the instance 
of his wife the defendant went home.</p>
<p>The next day at noon the deceased went to the house of his mother-in-law to 
call for his wife, who had gone there to iron some clothes. While the deceased 
was waiting at the door of his mother-in-law's house, the defendant arrived and 
challenged the deceased, who replied that it depended on the defendant. The 
defendant then attacked the deceased with a bolo, and inflicted on him seven 
wounds, two of which were mortal, one in the right side and one in the stomach. 
The deceased was carrying a cane, and defended himself with it as well as he 
could until the defendant gave him a blow on the wrist that nearly severed his 
hand. The injured man died immediately.</p>
<p>The contention of the accused is that he was attacked by the deceased, and. 
that he acted in self-defense, but the evidence shows that the defendant's 
contention is false and without merit. The incident over the card game furnished 
the motive for the crime.</p>
<p>The trial court found that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the 
mitigating circumstances of obfuscation and lack of instruction, but it does not 
appear from the evidence that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the 
mitigating circumstance of obfuscation, as the dispute between the accused and 
the deceased over the card game occurred the day prior to the commission of the 
crime. It does appear, however, that in accordance with the Revised Penal Code 
the accused is entitled to the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of 
voluntary surrender, and there being present two mitigating circumstances and no 
aggravating circumstance, the penalty to be imposed should be one degree lower 
than <em>reclusion temporal</em>, or <em>prision mayor</em>, in accordance with 
the new Code. The accused is therefore sentenced to suffer eight years and one 
day of <em>prision mayor</em>, and the accessory penalties provided by law, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased Evaristo Amarilla in the sum of P1,000, 
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>

Santos, Hull, Imperial, </em>and <em>Butte, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
