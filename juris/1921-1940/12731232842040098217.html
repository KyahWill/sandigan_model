				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
dated October 13, 1931, in an action for infringement of trade-mark and unfair 
competition under Act No. 666 as amended by Act No. 3423. 
<p>On December 2, 1930, the plaintiff-appellee filed in said court its complaint 
alleging in substance that on October 24, 1904, it duly registered in the 
Philippine Islands its trade-mark, consisting of the picture of a peacock (pavo 
real), which it again registered on March 12, 1924; that. for forty years last 
past it has been selling high grade men's undershirts of a distinctive pattern 
and design in Manila and elsewhere in the Philippine Islands under said 
trade-mark, and its goods became generally known to the buying public by the 
name of "PAVO"or "Marca PAVO"; that the defendant has sold and is offering for 
sale in the Philippine Islands a cheap imitation of the plaintiff's goods 
stamping thereon a trade-mark consisting of the picture of a turkey with the 
name "PAVO" or "Marca Pavo" printed thereon; that there is such a similarity 
between the trade-mark used by the defendant and the plaintiffs that the buying 
public has been and is being deceived thereby to the grave damage and injury of 
the plaintiff's business; that plaintiff has suffered damages to the extent of 
P10,000 and prays for an order of injunction against the defendant and an 
accounting of profits realized by the defendant from its unlawful and unfair 
competition in the use of said deceptive trade-mark. </p>
<p>The defendant, on January 31, 1931, answered with a general denial and set 
up, as a special defense, that its trade-mark, consisting of the picture of a 
turkey and the words "Marca Pavo", was acquired by the defendant from other 
firms which had been using the same for fifteen years; that the words and 
trade-mark "Marca Pavo" used by the plaintiff instead of the correct words 
"Marca Pavon" are an infringement on the defendant's trade-mark and that 
defendant prays damages resulting from such infringement in the sum of P2,000 
and injunction restraining the plaintiff from using the words or label "Marca 
Pavo" or "Pavo"; in other respects, the prayer of the cross complaint is similar 
to the prayer of the complaint. On February 14, 1931, the plaintiff filed a 
general denial to the cross complaint. </p>
<p>The court below, in a well considered decisio.n, dismissed the cross 
complaint and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, granting a permanent 
injunction prohibiting the defendant from using its alleged trade-mark on 
undershirts and fixing the plaintiff's damages at P10,000. </p>
<p>The first assignment of error of the defendant-appellant is as follows: "The 
court below erred in holding that defendant's registered trade-mark has 
infringed plaintiff's, whereas as a matter of fact it might have been 
otherwise."</p>
<p>A comparison of the alleged trade-marks used by appellant and appellee 
respectively during the period when the infringement took place, that is, during 
the years 1928 to 1931, with the original certificates filed by them, reveals at 
a glance that neither the appellant nor the appellee was using the identical 
trade-mark authorized by its original certificate. Essentially, therefore, the 
action is not for infringement of trade-mark but rather for unfair competition 
under section 7 of Act No. 666 as amended by Act No. 3423 (1927). </p>
<p>The evidence in the court below satisfactorily establishes that the plaintiff 
has been selling its goods continuously since at least the year 1913 under the 
trade name of "Marca Pavo" and established under that trade name a reputation 
for its goods and a volume of business of substantial value. The defendant first 
commenced selling imitation goods under the trade name "MARCA Pavo" in 1928. It 
well knew that the plaintiff's goods were sold under the trade name of "Marca 
Pavo" because it bought 50 dozen "Marca Pavo" undershirts from the plaintiff on 
February 28, 1928. Thereafter, it imported and sold large quantities of goods 
almost identically in appearance with plaintiff's, using the words "Marca Pavo" 
in conspicuous letters over the picture of a turkey as its trade name. We have 
carefully examined the exhibits and the testimony produced at the trial and we 
hold that they amply sustain the conclusion of the court below thafthe defendant 
was guilty of unfair competition in its use of the alleged trade-mark which is 
enjoined by the judgment appealed from. </p>
<p>The second assignment of error is covered by what we have said with regard to 
the first error.</p>
<p>The third assignment of error is that the court erred in "allowing damage to 
the plaintiff, especially in an amount at once excessive, not supported by 
evidence and contrary to law." We find no force in the argument that the 
plaintiff under the facts established is not entitled to any dama'ges. The only 
question that needs to be discussed is whether P10,000 is an excessive amount. 
</p>
<p>The appellant insists that there should be deducted from the gross profits, 
as found by the court below, the following items of expense as stated in its 
brief: Ocean freight, marine insurance, landing charges and transportation, 10 
per cent to 15 per cent of the cost of the goods in Japan (estimated at 12 per 
cent); customs duties, 25 per cent ad valorem; discounts on sales, 1 per cent to 
8 per cent (on basis of 2 per cent on selling price); overhead expenses for 
selling, etc. based on average of 5 per cent, sales taxes, 1 per cent. </p>
<p>According to appellant's own admission, the only evidence concerning these 
expenses is the oral testimony of the defendant's manager, part of which is 
quoted in appellant's brief. We have read the complete testimony and find 
nowhere any reference to a specific amount actually paid for any of the expenses 
above listed. The manager's testimony is confined to general estimates. The 
profits found by the court below were realized upon the sale of 1,828 dozen of 
underwear specifically set out in the defendant's invoices shown in Exhibits K 
to K-12. The books and receipts kept by the defendant should, and doubtless do, 
show the exact amount paid, if any, on the items of expense above listed. This 
conclusive evidence was in the possession of the defendant and should have been 
produced, if the defendant honestly desired to enlighten the court as to the 
correct amount of the necessary and proper expenses that were actually paid.</p>
<p>The judgment below is affirmed with costs against the appellant. So ordered.
