				G.R. Nos. 32394, 32395, September 05, 1930</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SANDAL, ARIMAO, LONSING, MAMA, AND PAMPANG, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Moros Sandal, Arimao, Lonsing, Mama, and Pampang appeal from the judgment 
of the Court of First Instance of Lanao convicting them of murder committed on 
the 18th of February, 1929, upon the person of Eleno Lamorena, and sentencing 
each of them to twenty years of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal,</span> with the accessories of law, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly and severally in the amount of 
P1,000, and to pay their proportional part of the costs.</p>
<p>On the date mentioned, in Abaga, District of Monungan, Province of Lanao, 
Inambar, a Moro woman, heard the appellant Sandal call the deceased, and later 
saw them engaged in conversation. While the two were talking, appellant Pampang 
went up to them and with a hammer struck the deceased on the back of the neck, 
felling him to the ground. Sandal and the, rest of the appellants, Lonsing, 
Arimao, and Mama, then closed in on the fallen man beating him to death.</p>
<p>Moro Dimaponong testified that early in the morning of that day, he saw 
Eleno, the deceased, in Tomas Permites' warehouse, while the appellants were 
nearby constructing a house. When witness returned to the warehouse, he saw 
neither the deceased nor the defendants where he had seen them before. On that 
night as he was going home, witness saw appellants near a sawmill, carrying the 
corpse of Eleno, which they threw into the river. During the inquiry made by the 
Constabulary lieutenant into Eleno's disappearance, Dimaponong testified to this 
effect, and the corpse was found in that part of the river indicated by him.</p>
<p>Doctor Pablo Hamoy in the <span style="font-style: italic;">morpost-tem</span> examination found the following 
lesions: The right side of the neck and the right shoulder were bruised; the 
neck was fractured and the right shoulder dislocated; the right eye was bruised; 
marked cyanosis and acute hemorrhage of both eyes which were somewhat sunken; 
marked cyanosis of the lips with the incisors jutting forward and loose cyanosis 
and hemorrhage of the gums, and hemorrhage of the nose; cyanosis of the whole 
face, a wound in the left arm and forearm, and a contusion on the breast and 
abdomen.</p>
<p>The following facts of record explain the motive of the assault: When Tomas 
Permites went to Manila to look after certain matters he left Eleno in charge of 
his interests in Monungan. While Permites was in Manila, the appellants caused 
some injuries to his carabaos, as a result of which Eleno had a dispute with 
them. Eleno sent word of what had happened to Permites in Manila, and when the 
latter returned to Monungan, he verified the facts and filed a complaint against 
the appellants. Eleno was to be the principal witness, and the defendants knew 
it.</p>
<p>The appellants denied the facts set forth and attempted to prove an 
alibi.</p>
<p>Upon consideration of the evidence for both sides, we agree with the 
conclusion of the trial court that the appellants killed Eleno in the manner 
described above. The court below did not err in weighing the evidence.</p>
<p>Another assignment of error alleged by the appellants in this instance deals 
with the trial court's refusal to admit a certain witness presented by the 
defense. The court took this stand for the reason that this witness had been 
present during the hearing notwithstanding the court's order that all witnesses 
leave the court room. Under such circumstances it lies within the court's 
discretion to admit or reject the testimony of the witness. And although we are 
of opinion that the court below should have admitted the testimony of this 
witness, especially when he stated that he did not hear what the other witnesses 
testified, yet there is nothing to show that this error has affected the 
appellants' defense. There is nothing to show what this witness would have 
testified if admitted, and so it cannot be held that his failure to testify has 
materially affected the appellants' defense.</p>
<p>The appellants also assign as an error the fact that the trial court failed 
to require the fiscal to exhibit the testimony given by the witnesses during the 
preliminary investigation conducted by the justice of the peace. But the only 
effect of this failure was to entitle the defense to adduce secondary evidence 
touching the testimony of said witnesses, for the purpose of attacking their 
veracity, should they have been presented as witnesses during the trial.</p>
<p>Neither did the trial court commit an error in refusing the defense an 
extension of time to present Doctor Feliciano, for this is a matter wholly 
within the court's discretion, the abuse whereof has not been shown, especially 
in view of the fact that it was not informed of the nature of this witness's 
testimony.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Street, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez </i>and<i> Villa-Real, JJ</i>., 
concur.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Johns, J.</span>, dissents. </p></div>
