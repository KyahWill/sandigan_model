				G.R. No. 29506, December 11, 1928</h4>
				<H3>CONCEPCION PELAEZ ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. EULALIA BUTAO ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It is an undisputed fact in this case that the plaintiffs are 
legitimate children of Nicolas Pelaez and his deceased wife Demetria Mercado, 
just as the defendants are the legitimate children of Pedro de Lara. It is 
likewise indisputable that Nicolas Pelaez sold the two parcels of land in 
controversy, together with their improvements, to Pedro de Lara on June 5, 1908. 
Plaintiffs pray for the annulment of this sale, because they contend that the 
said two parcels of land were property belonging to their deceased mother 
Demetria Mercado and therefore their father Nicolas Pelaez could not validly 
convey it to the defendant's father. 
<p align="justify">Whether the lands belonged exclusively to the deceased Demetria 
Mercado or to the conjugal partnership between Nicolas Pelaez and his deceased 
wife Demetria Mercado, the evidence of both parties is contradictory; but, the 
trial court held, and to our mind with reason, that the preponderance of the 
evidence leads to the conclusion that they were the property of the partnership 
of said, spouses. </p>
<p align="justify">The defendants, in turn, allege that the lands claimed by the 
plaintiffs belonged to the deceased Pedro de Lara who acquired them by a just, 
legal, and valid title; that they inherited the same as legitimate heirs of 
their deceased father Pedro de Lara; that they have been in possession of said 
two parcels for many years, in good faith and to the exclusion of the whole 
world, publicly and without interruption, and that the action taken by the 
plaintiffs has prescribed. </p>
<p align="justify">In view of the evidence adduced in this case, the trial court 
decided "that the sale of the two parcels of land in controversy made by Nicolas 
Pelaez is void, because said land did not at that time belong to the vendor, who 
was only entitled to one-half thereof after liquidation: wherefore the said two 
parcels in dispute belong jointly to the plaintiffs and defendants;" and 
declaring, further, that "the parties may by agreement ask for the division of 
the two parcels by commissioners to be appointed by the court upon application 
of said parties." The defendants appealed to this court from such judgment, 
alleging among other grounds that the trial court erred in holding the deed of 
sale Exhibit 3 of the defendants, executed by Nicolas Pelaez in favor of the 
deceased Pedro de Lara, defendants' father upon the land in question, to be null 
and void. </p>
<p align="justify">Admitting the conclusion of the court below, that the property 
in litigation belonged to the conjugal partnership Nicolas Pelaez and Demetria 
Mercado, and it appearing from the record that the present sale was made by the 
surviving spouse in order to pay off certain debts contracted during the illness 
of his deceased wife Demetria Mercado, we believe the following doctrine laid 
down in the case of Nable Jose vs. Nable Jose (41 Phil., 713), is applicable: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * That the husband, acting as liquidator of the conjugal 
partnership, and charged with the payment of the community debts, may sell or 
mortgage all or any part of the conjugal property, real or personal, in the 
fulfillment of the duties imposed upon him and give good and valid title to the 
purchaser or mortgagee." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the same case, the court said, among other things, that: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The purchasers in good faith of community property from the 
surviving husband take a good and valid title which cannot be set aside 
thereafter upon proof that in making the sale, or in the use made of the 
proceeds, the husband-liquidator acted in fraud of the rights of the heirs. The 
heirs must seek their remedy against their father, who is accountable to them 
for their share of the net remainder of the partnership property, after the 
affairs of the partnership have been liquidated." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And in Manuel and Laxamana vs. Losano (41 Phil., 855), again 
confirming the doctrine established in the case of Nable Jose vs. Nable Jose, 
the court said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In the absence of fraud and collusion, sales or mortgages of 
community property, either real or personal, made by a husband administrator 
clothed with the insignia of ownership and in whose name the property is held, 
after the death of his spouse, are valid and effective, the purchaser being 
entitled to presume that such sales or mortgages are executed for the purpose of 
securing money to pay community debts and that the vendor has authority to 
dispose of the property thus administered by him and held in his name—but all 
this without prejudice to the right of any interested person to hold the husband 
responsible for any loss or damage resulting from his failure to liquidate the 
conjugal partnership and secure judicial sanction for the disposition of the 
property pending such liquidation, or to compel the husband by appropriate 
proceedings to proceed to the liquidation of the conjugal partnership in 
accordance with law." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is true that on November 24,1924, the Philippine Legislature 
approved Act No. 3176, amending section 685 of Act No. 190, and providing a new 
procedure for the liquidation of conjugal property when the partnership is 
dissolved by the death of one of the spouses, the first section of which, among 
other things, provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In case it is necessary to sell any portion of said community 
property in order to pay the outstanding debts and obligations of the same, such 
sale shall be made in the manner and with the formalities established by this 
Code for the sale of the property of deceased persons. Any sale, transfer, 
alienation or disposition of said property effected without said formalities 
shall be null and void, except as regards the portion that belonged to the 
vendor at the time the liquidation and partition was made." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">But this is not applicable to the present case, because we are 
dealing with a contract entered into by the surviving spouse with respect to the 
conjugal partnership in June 1908, that is, before said Act was published. 
Therefore, we are of opinion, and so hold, that the contract in controversy is 
valid and cannot be annulled by the vendor's heirs, that is, the plaintiffs, 
there being no evidence of record that when the vendor sold the parcels of land 
now litigated, he did so in bad faith. </p>
<p align="justify">By virtue whereof, the appealed judgment is reversed, and the 
defendants are hereby absolved from the complaint, without special pronouncement 
of costs. So ordered. </p>
