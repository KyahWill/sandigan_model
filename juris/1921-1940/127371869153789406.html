				<H3>PROVINCIA DEL SANTISIMO NOMBRE DE JESUS DE FLLIPINAS, DE LA ORDEN DE ERMITAÑOS DE NUESTRO PADRE SAN AGUSTIN, VULGARMENTE CONOCIDA POR "CORPORACION DE PP. AGUSTINOS," PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LEON DEL REY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment foreclosing a mortgage executed by the 
defendant in favor of the Compania Agrieola de Ultramar. The mortgage was 
afterwards transferred to the herein plaintiff, and the defendant failing to 
fulfill the terms of the mortgage, the present action was brought. The mortgaged 
property is a tract of land situated in the barrio of Ermitaño, municipality of 
San Juan del Monte, Province of Rizal, and contains an area of 19,959 square 
meters.</p>
<p>Upon appeal, the mortgagor's contention is that the court below exceeded its 
jurisdiction and discretion in denying a motion for the continuance of the trial 
of the case in order to give him an opportunity to prepare his evidence. That 
contention cannot be sustained. The continuance of trials lays largely in the 
discretion of the court, and we can find no indication that the judge presiding 
over the court below abused his discretion. The action was brought on August 19, 
1928, and the trial did not take place until a year afterwards. It would seem 
that the defendant had ample time to prepare his evidence, if any he had.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><i>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez 
</i>and<i> Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.<br></p></div>
