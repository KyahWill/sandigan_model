				<H3>RAFAEL VILLANUEVA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. AURELIA DADIVAS DE VILLANUEVA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The parties in this case are husband and
wife. Finally the misconduct of the husband was so great as to compel
the wife to withdraw from the family home, and it was necessary for the
wife to have recourse to the courts for support for herself and their
minor children.
<p> After trial in which judgment was given against the husband, he
appealed to this court, which likewise decided against his contentions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
Instead of complying with his obligations, he mortgaged some of his
properties and left the Islands, leaving his wife and children without
means of support.</p>
<p> The judgment in the former case having become final, a writ of
execution was issued, and certain of plaintiff's properties were seized
and duly sold by the sheriff. The wife bought in those properties at
the sale as part payment of the judgment which she had secured, and
after the expiration of the statutory period, sheriff's deeds in favor
of the wife were duly executed.</p>
<p> Plaintiff in these proceedings asks that those deeds be annulled.</p>
<p> After trial, judgment was given in favor of defendant, and
plaintiff brings this appeal. Appellant's main contention is that a
purchase at a sale is in effect a contract which a married woman cannot
enter into except with the consent of the husband, and therefore the
husband has a right to have the sale annulled and the property restored
to him. Appellant likewise contends that judgment for support of a wife
can only be enforced by contempt proceedings and that therefore
execution was unlawful.</p>
<p> No authorities are cited to sustain the second proposition which is
obviously incorrect. The wife secured a definite judgment against the
husband, which because of its nature may be enforced by contempt
proceedings, but it is nevertheless also a judgment for which
^execution can issue. The contention of the husband, appellant, as to
the first proposition is likewise erroneous. Annulment of a deed given
by a sheriff is an equitable action, and he that comes into a court of
equity must do so with clean hands. Certainly appellant in this case
has no grounds to appeal to a court of equity in a suit in which his
wife is concerned. He has violated his marital obligations and yet
seeks to exercise the power which the law gives to the husband for the
protection of the conjugal partnership, not for the protection of the
partnership, not for the protection of the home. but to leave his wife
and minor children in absolute want.</p>
<p> Appellant overlooks the fact that the law authorized the wife to
secure the judgment against him. She has the same rights to a writ of
execution and to follow through thereon as any other party litigant. If
it is necessary for her protection to bid in the property at a
sheriff's sale, the husband has no power whatsoever to defeat her
rights by a claim of being the head and manager of the conjugal
partnership. In fact in many instances it might well be that the
purchase by the wife would be to the benefit of the conjugal
partnership rather than that the property should be bought in by an
outsider for an inadequate sum.</p>
<p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed. Costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
