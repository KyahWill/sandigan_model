				<H3>IN RE ESTATE OF JOSE MACROHON TIAHUA. FRANCISCO BARRIOS, ADMINISTRATOR AND APPELLEE, VS. EDUARDA ENRIQUEZ ET AL., HEIRS AND APPELLANTS. IGNACIO MACROHON, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by Eduarda Enriquez, surviving spouse 
of the deceased Jose Macrohon Tiahua, and the latter's legitimate children on 
the one side, and Ignacio Macrohon, his adulterous son, on the other, from an 
order of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga, laying down the following 
conclusions of law: (1) That an adulterous child may be instituted heir within 
the limits provided by law; (2) that in making Ignacio Macrohon an heir under 
his will, the testator did not observe the limitations prescribed by law; (3) 
that the institution of Ignacio Macrohon as heir under the will ought not to be 
declared absolutely void, but he should so share in the inheritance as not to 
prejudice the legitime of the other heirs; (4) that as Exhibit 1 deals with 
certain acts contrary to law, such as not presenting the will to the court, and 
as some minors took part in it through their guardian without the latter being 
authorized by the court to enter into the transaction in their behalf, said 
exhibit cannot bind the parties, nor do the admissions made by them therein 
constitute estoppel; whereupon it disapproved the scheme of partition presented 
by the administrator and ordered him to file another in consonance with the 
conclusions therein laid down. 
<p align="justify">In support of their appeal, Eduarda Enriquez, widow of Jose 
Macrohon Tiahua, and the latter's legitimate children, assign the following 
alleged errors as committed by the trial court in its judgment, to wit: </p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>"Now come the herein surviving spouse, Eduarda Enriquez, and 
the legitimate heirs of Jose Macrohon Tiahua, deceased, by their undersigned 
attorney, and allege that under the law and the evidence in the above-entitled 
proceeding, the lower court committed the following errors:<p></p>"I. In not approving the project of distribution of the estate 
of the herein deceased, Jose Macrohon Tiahua, as submitted by the herein 
executor, Francisco Barrios. 
<p align="justify">"II. In holding that the deceased, Jose Macrohon Tiahua, had 
any right to institute and name his bastard son, Ignacio Macrohon, as an heir in 
his will, together and in a like manner with his legitimate descendants and 
heirs. </p>
<p align="justify">"III. And in holding that the said bastard son, Ignacio 
Macrohon, having been so instituted and named in the will of the said Jose 
Macrohon Tiahua, deceased, said Ignacio Macrohon had a right under the terms of 
the will and the law, to inherit a portion of the estate of the deceased, to the 
prejudice of the legitimate descendants and heirs of the said Jose Macrohon 
Tiahua, deceased."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Ignacio Macrohon, adulterous son of the deceased Jose Macrohon 
Tiahua in turn, assigns the following alleged errors as committed by the trial 
court in its judgment, in support of his appeal, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Comes now the appellant Ignacio Macrohon, thru the undersigned 
attorneys, and to this Honorable Court respectfully submits that the lower court 
erred, as follows: </p>
<p align="justify">"1. In holding that its order dated November 10, 1926, did not 
constitute <span style="font-style: italic;">res adjudicata</span> as to question of the right of the appellant Ignacio 
Macrohon to inherit from his deceased father, Jose Macrohon Tiahua, under and in 
accordance with the will of the latter.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. In not holding that the right of the said Ignacio Macrohon 
as heir of said deceased cannot, by reason of the doctrine of estoppel, be 
questioned by the other heirs. </p>
<p align="justify">"3. In holding that the manner the institution of the heirs was 
made in the will of the testator herein falls under, or is the case contemplated 
by, article 765 of the Civil Code. </p>
<p align="justify">"4. In not allowing said Ignacio Macrohon the full share 
allotted to him in and by the will of the testator, that is, a portion equal to 
that granted in said will to each of the legitimate children of the deceased, or 
one-tenth of the whole hereditary estate."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The questions, all of law, raised by the respective parties in 
their respective appeals, may be reduced to the following: </p>
<p align="justify">(1) Did the deceased Jose Macrohon Tiahua have a right to 
dispose of a part of his estate by will in favor of his adulterous son? (2) If 
so, has the deceased Jose Macrohon Tiahua infringed the limitations prescribed 
by the law in putting his adulterous son Ignacio Macrohon on the same footing as 
his legitimate children by giving him a share equal to that of each of the 
latter? </p>
<p align="justify">As to the first question, while it is true that article 845 of 
the Civil Code provides that "illegitimate children who have not the status of 
natural children shall be entitled to support only," and therefore cannot demand 
anything more of those bound by law to support them, it does not prohibit said 
illegitimate children from receiving, nor their parents from giving them, 
something more than support, so long as the legitimate children are not 
prejudiced. If the law permits a testator to dispose of the free third of his 
hereditary estate in favor of a stranger (art. 808 of the Civil Code), there is 
no legal, moral or social reason to prevent him from making over that third to 
his illegitimate son who has not the status of a natural son. On the contrary, 
by reason of blood, the son, although illegitimate, has a preferential right 
over a stranger unless by his behaviour he has become unworthy of such 
consideration. </p>
<p align="justify">For these reasons, we are of opinion and so hold, that Jose 
Macrohon Tiahua could dispose of the free third of his estate in favor of his 
adulterous son, Ignacio Macrohon.</p>
<p align="justify">With respect to the second question of law, Jose Macrohon 
Tiahua states the following in his will: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"After all my debts, obligations, and funeral expenses have 
been paid, I hereby bequeath and devise all my property, real, personal, and 
mixed, as follows, to wit: </p>
<p align="justify">"One-half (1/2) <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span> of my whole estate to my wife 
Eduarda Enriquez, and the other half (1/2) in equal parts pro indiviso to each 
of my children, including Fernando Quintas and Julia Quintas, son and daughter, 
respectively, of my deceased daughter, Gregoria Macrohon, who shall receive the 
portion corresponding to the share of my said daughter, that is, 1/44 for each 
of the two." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Included among the childden mentioned by the testator in said 
will, and to whom he gave the one-half of the property corresponding to him from 
the conjugal partnership, is the herein appellant Ignacio Macrohon, his 
adulterous son. Dividing this half, that is ten-twentieth parts (10/20), among 
his nine legitimate children and his adulterous son, Ignacio Macrohon, into 
equal parts, each of them will be entitled to one-twentieth of the whole estate. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Now then, does the twentieth part corresponding to the share of 
Ignacio Macrohon impair the legitime corresponding to each of the nine 
legitimate children? </p>
<p align="justify">According to article 808 of the Civil Code, the legitime of 
legitimate children and descendants consists of two-thirds of the hereditary 
estate of the father and of the mother, the latter being allowed to dispose of 
one of said two parts in order to give it as a betterment to their legitimate 
children or descendants. In the present case the testator has not disposed of 
any of the two parts forming the legitime in order to give it as betterment to 
any of his children, and the said legitime therefore remains intact, and 
according to article 806 of the same Code, is by the law reserved for the forced 
heirs and the testator cannot dispose of it in any other way. </p>
<p align="justify">Hence, the nine legitimate children are entitled to twothirds 
of said half, or two-sixths of the whole, which, divided equally among them 
would give to each, two fiftyfourths or one twenty-seventh of the whole estate. 
When Jose Macrohon Tiahua, therefore, provided in his will that the one-half of 
the conjugal property belonging to him was to be divided equally among his nine 
legitimate children and one adulterous son, each to receive one-twentieth part, 
he did not go beyond the limits provided by law for such cases, because, 
one-twentieth for each of his legitimate children is more than each of his 
legitimate children should receive as his legitime, which only amounts to one 
twenty-seventh. In other words, since Jose Macrohon Tiahua could dispose of the 
free third of his hereditary estate in favor of his adulterous son, Ignacio 
Macrohon, and as he only gave a part of said free third to the latter, he did 
not infringe any legal prohibition and his testamentary disposition to this 
effect is valid and effective. </p>
<p align="justify">Having arrived at these conclusions there is no need to discuss 
the other questions of law raised by the parties in their respective assignments 
of error. </p>
<p align="justify">By virtue whereof, the order appealed from is modified and it 
is ordered that the dispositions made by Jose Macrohon Tiahua in his last will 
and testament be strictly complied with, without special pronouncement of costs. 
So ordered.</p>
