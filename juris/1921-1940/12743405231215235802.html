				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appeal taken in this case from a judgment of the Court of First Instance 
of the City of Manila necessitates the scrutiny of the proceedings to determine 
their legality and a decision as to the amount of the damages which should be 
allowed the plaintiff.
<p>On March 3, and March 16, 1927, La Vanguardia, a daily newspaper published in 
the City of Manila, printed two articles which mentioned Guillermo B. Guevara, 
the Fiscal of the City of Manila. The author of the articles was Rosauro 
Almario. They were clearly and flagrantly libelous. In addition to casting 
aspersions on the plaintiff in a manner which need not be described, the 
articles assailed his official integrity. They passed beyond the bounds of 
legitimate criticism of a public official to attack the individual and to 
indulge in personalities.</p>
<p>A criminal action was instituted, and after the evidence for the prosecution 
had been received, the accused Rosauro Almario was permitted to acknowledge 
authorship of the defamatory articles and to change a plea of not guilty to a 
plea of guilty, with certain qualifying explanations on his part. Thereupon, he 
was sentenced to pay a fine of P400. Subsequently, Guillermo B. Guevara 
instituted civil proceedings to recover a total of P100,000 by way of damages. 
Defendant Almario pleaded the truth and justifiable motives.</p>
<p>When the case was called for trial, the plaintiff submitted his evidence 
Consisting exclusively of the record, exhibits, and judgment in the criminal 
case. The defendants proeduced no evidence and contented themselves with filing 
a motion for the dismissal of the case, which was denied.) The trial judge 
thereafter rendered judgment against Rosauro Almario for P5,000 as general 
damages and an equal sum of P5,000 as punitive damages. The defendants La 
Vanguardia Incorporated, Marciano Almario, and Manuel V. Villareal were absolved 
from the complaint.</p>
<p>Certain minor points can be disposed of quickly. For example, the action of 
the trial court in refusing to grant Marciano Almario legal costs, and in 
ordering on its own initiative the amendment of the complaint so that it 
contained allegations relating to the judgment of conviction in the criminal 
case, are matters which addressed themselves to the discretion of the trial 
judge and should not be interfered with here.</p>
<p>A major question has to do with the action of the trial court in admitting 
evidence, over the objection of the defendants, consisting of proof filed in a 
previous criminal case. On this point we find in our Code of Civil Procedure, 
section 298, number 8, the provision that evidence may be received upon a trial 
of "The testimony of a witness deceased or out of the jurisdiction, or unable to 
testify, given in a former action between the same parties, relating to the same 
matter." We have also the rule sanctioned by authoritative decisions that facts 
may be established by evidence thereof given on a former trial, provided the 
court is satisfied: (1) That the party against whom the evidence is offered, or 
his privy, was a party on the former trial; (2) that the issue is substantially 
the same in the two cases; (3) that the witness who proposes to testify to the 
former evidence is able to state it with satisfactory correctness; and (4) that 
a sufficient reason is shown why the,original witness is not produced. In the 
same connection, it is well settled that a judgment of conviction in a criminal 
proceeding cannot be admitted in evidence in a civil action. But a record in a 
criminal case may be admitted by way of inducement, or to show a collateral 
fact. (Ed. A. Keller &amp; Co. vs. Ellerman &amp; Bucknall Steamship Co. and 
Collector of Customs [1918], 38 Phil., 514; Chantangco <em>vs.</em> Abaroa 
[1910], 218 U. S., 476; City of Manila <em>vs.</em> Manila Electric Co. [1928]. 
52 Phil., 586.) Here, all other considerations to one side, there has not been 
any sufficient reason, in truth no reason at all, shown why the original 
witnesses in the criminal case could not be produced in the civil case. A 
showing of this character is necessary to justify the court in receiving 
evidence given on a former trial. However, the general rule is qualified, and 
properly so, by permitting the fact of defendant's conyiction to be proved in 
the civil action. TArambulo <em>vs.</em> Manila Electric Company [1930], 55 
Phil, 75.) We feel also that there would be no nullification of the rule to 
permit further the record to disclose the express admission by the defendant in 
the criminal case of his authorship of the libel.</p>
<p>The controlling facts to be deduced from all the foregoing are that an 
article which grossly libeled Guillermo B. Guevara, Fiscal of the City of 
Manila, of which Rosauro Almario was the author, was published in the press;that 
on the criminal charge Almario pleaded guilty and was sentenced accordingly, and 
that neither the truth nor justifiable motives were established. But all other 
portions of the record in the criminal case, including the transcript of the 
testimony, are inadmissible in the civil record.) Discarding the personal 
equation, for the plaintiff and the defendant alike are well known to the 
public, and considering the matter abstractly as we should, what should be the 
measure of damages?</p>
<p>The Libel Law permits the person libeled to recover the actual pecuniary 
damages sustained by him, damages for injury to his feelings and reputation, and 
punitive damages. Otherwise stated, special damages have not been proved. 
Nominal damages are not generally recognized under the civil law. Punitive 
damages have been imposed in the criminal action. As to general or actual or 
substantial damages, as variously described, these arise from legal inferences 
and need not be proved. So likewise is the good reputation of the plaintiff 
presumed until the contrary is established by proper evidence. </p>
<p>The authorities offer little aid in solving our problem, except as disclosing 
a tolerant attitude on the part of the appellate court—more likely to reduce 
damages for libel than to increase them. The case of Worcester <em>vs.</em> 
Ocampo [1912], 22 Phil., 42), which was taken as a model by the trial judge is 
hardly such, considering the marked differences in the two cases and the vast 
amount of evidence to be found in the Worcester case, which is not to be found 
in the Guevara case. In other cases offended parties have been allowed all the 
way from P50 to 5,000. (See Phee <em>vs.</em> La Vanguardia [1923], 45 Phil., 
211, P50; Causin <em>vs.</em> Jakosalem [1905], 5 Phil., 155, P100;. Montinola 
<em>vs.</em> Montalvo [1916], 34 Phil., 662, P200; Choa Tek Hee <em>vs</em>. 
Philippine Publishing Co. [1916], 34 Phil., 447, P300; Jimenez <em>vs.</em> 
Reyes [1914], 27 Phil., 52, P500; Sotelo Matti <em>vs.</em> Bulletin Publishing 
Co. [1918], 37 Phil., 562, P500; Oliver and Chamblise Oliver <em>vs.</em> La 
Vanguardia, Inc. [1925], 48 Phil., 429, P4,000; Perfecto <em>vs.</em> Contreras 
[1914], 28 Phil., 538, P2.500; Macleod <em>vs.</em> Philippine Publishing Co. 
[1909], 12 Phil., 427, P5,000.) But for comparative purposes, the decisions are 
of little value for the specific amount of damages in a libel case must depend 
upon the facts of the particular case and the sound discretion of the court. 
</p>
<p>When we come to give direct application to the proven facts and the governing 
legal principles, we are not surprised to find about as great a variety of 
opinions as there are members participating in the discussion. The suggestions 
regarding the amount of the damages have ranged all the way from P200 proposed 
by the writer to P6,000 proposed by another member of the court. Eventually, 
after an exchange of impressions, a majority of the court have reached the 
conclusion that the plaintiff should be awarded damages in the sum of 
P1,000.</p>
<p>The various errors assigned will be overruled except as to the first and 
sixth on the appeal of Rosauro Almario, which will be partially sustained, with 
the result that the judgment appealed from will be modified by condemning the 
defendant Rosauro Almario to pay the plaintiff the sum of P1,000 and the costs 
of both instances.</p>
