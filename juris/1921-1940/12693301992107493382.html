				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">STATEMENT<br></div><br>This is an appeal by Leopoldo Hormillosa and&nbsp; "Viuda de Tan Toco" from an order&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Occidental&nbsp; Negros,&nbsp; granting&nbsp; a motion of the Director of Forestry for&nbsp; the reopening of the above-entitled case with respect to lot&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1156.<br><br>The proceedings were initiated by the Director of Lands under Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2259, known&nbsp; as the Cadastral Act.<br><br>On&nbsp; November&nbsp; 28, 1920, the Court of First Instance of Occidental&nbsp; Negros&nbsp; set&nbsp; the case&nbsp; to be heard on&nbsp; February 21, 1921,&nbsp; in the municipality&nbsp; of Cadiz, of&nbsp; that&nbsp; province. December 8, 1920, the provincial fiscal on behalf of the Bureau of&nbsp; Forestry filed an&nbsp; opposition to the registration alleging that lot&nbsp; No. 1156 and others therein named&nbsp; were within the proposed "Northern&nbsp; Negros Forest Reservation," and, for that reason, that such lands were the property of the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States and&nbsp; under the administration of the Government of the Philippine Islands.<br>About March 7,&nbsp; 1921, Leopoldo Hormillosa filed an answer in which he claimed to be the owner of lot No. 1156 with its improvements.&nbsp; In&nbsp;&nbsp; February, 1921,&nbsp; Uvilfredo&nbsp; Duyuñgan,&nbsp; on behalf of the heirs of Custodio&nbsp; Duyungan, filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; answer&nbsp; also claiming&nbsp; the&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp; that lot and the improvements.&nbsp; The&nbsp; respective answers were duly noted&nbsp; by the cadastral attorney, with the words "contested by the Bureau of&nbsp; Forestry" and "contested by the heirs&nbsp; of Custodio Duyungan and the Insular Government." April 22, 1921,&nbsp; Hormillosa, the Duyungan heirs&nbsp; and Lao Sangco filed a motion for the subdivision of&nbsp; lot No. 1156, which was&nbsp; granted on June 15, 1921, and the&nbsp; surveyor was ordered to&nbsp; designate the&nbsp; subdivisions as lots&nbsp; Nos. 1156-A, 1156-B, and 1156-C.&nbsp; October 10,1921, the provincial fiscal filed another opposition&nbsp; alleging&nbsp; that lot No. 1156 and others were "public forest lands."&nbsp; December 8, 1921, the court adjudicated&nbsp; lot No. 1156-A with its improvements to Leopoldo Hormillosa.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot No.&nbsp; 1156-B with its&nbsp; improvements to Uvilfredo Duyungan and his coheirs, subject&nbsp; to a right of way in favor of "The Negros Philippine Lumber Co."&nbsp; and lot No. 1156-C&nbsp; with its improvements to Lao Sangco.&nbsp; May 27,&nbsp; 1924, the provincial fiscal, on behalf&nbsp; of the Bureau of Forestry,&nbsp; filed a motion to reopen&nbsp; the case as to those particular lots, alleging in substance&nbsp; that the decision of&nbsp; the court had been obtained through fraud and in bad faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Objections were filed to the granting of the motion, and after a hearing&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; it was ordered that the case&nbsp; be reopened, to which Leopoldo Hormillosa and "Viuda de&nbsp; Tan Toco" duly excepted and moved for a rehearing,&nbsp; which was denied, from which they appeal and assign the following errors:<br><blockquote>"I.&nbsp; The trial court erred in not holding that on December 8, 1921, the decree of registration of the land in&nbsp; question was entered within the meaning of section 38 of Act No. 496; and that, no&nbsp; fraud having been proven, and no petition for a review having been filed within one year from the entry of said decree, the same became irrevocable.<br><br>"II. The trial court erred in entering its order&nbsp; of August 15, 1925 (B. E., pp. 36-38),&nbsp; and in not holding that the Director of Forestry, not having&nbsp; formulated his claim pursuant to the mandatory requirements of the law and within the period last granted by the&nbsp; court,&nbsp; had lost&nbsp; all right to lay such claim and. all right to be notified of the hearing."<br><br></blockquote>JOHNS, J.:<br><br>The first assignment of error is squarely decided adverse to the appellants by this&nbsp; court in De los Reyes <i>vs.</i> De Villa (48 Phil., 227), in which the decision was promulgated on November 12, 1925.<br><br>The second assignment is largely based upon the contention that the protest of the Bureau of Forestry was not verified, and that for such reason it has no legal force or effect.<br><br>It must be noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; the original proceedings were initiated upon the petition of the Director of Lands&nbsp; in and by&nbsp; which all parties&nbsp; having any interest in the lands in question were cited&nbsp; and required to appear,&nbsp; claim, and assert their interests.&nbsp; In response to that notice, the Bureau of Forestry, through the provincial fiscal,&nbsp; appeared and filed an&nbsp; opposition claiming that lot No. 1156 and others therein named were within the proposed "Northern&nbsp; Negros Forest Reservation," and as such were the property of the Government of the United States and under the administration of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; Based upon that opposition, the cadastral attorney made a notation on the records that the lands were "contested by the Bureau of Forestry" and "contested by the heirs of Custodio Duyuñgan and the&nbsp; Insular Government."<br><br>That became a matter of official record&nbsp; in the proceedings,&nbsp; and within itself was notice of the fact that the Government was claiming&nbsp; the&nbsp; lands and&nbsp; contesting&nbsp; the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of any other claimant, upon the ground that it was within the proposed "Northen Negros Forest Reservation."<br><br>It is true, as the appellants claim, that&nbsp; the protest was not verified.&nbsp; Whatever&nbsp; may be the rule&nbsp; as to&nbsp; a&nbsp; protest filed by a private party,&nbsp; it does not apply&nbsp; to a case where the proceedings were initiated&nbsp; by one branch of the Government and&nbsp; an&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; was filed by&nbsp; another&nbsp; branch against private&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; who had&nbsp; appeared and asserted their respective rights against the alleged right of the Government itself.&nbsp; It is also maintained that no fraud was alleged&nbsp; or&nbsp; proven.&nbsp; Be that&nbsp; as&nbsp; it may, the original order of the court was made without giving the Bureau of Forestry an opportunity to be heard, and the court set aside that order,&nbsp; the doing of&nbsp; which&nbsp; was a&nbsp; matter largely in its discretion.<br><br>If appellants have a valid claim to the lands in question, that fact can&nbsp; be ascertained and determined by a&nbsp; hearing on the merits.&nbsp; If they do not have a valid claim, it would be a fraud upon the Government to have&nbsp; the titles to the lands in question adjudged&nbsp; to them.<br><br>Again, although the point is not made&nbsp; in the brief of the Attorney-General,&nbsp; under numerous decisions of this court, an&nbsp; order of the lower court, setting aside and vacating a judgment and granting&nbsp; a new&nbsp; trial, is&nbsp; not a final order from which an appeal will lie.<br><br>It follows that there&nbsp; is no merit in the appeal; that it was prematurely taken; and that it is dismissed, with costs. So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Street, Villamor, Ostrand</i>, and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
