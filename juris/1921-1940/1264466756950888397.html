				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCENA, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appealed judgment declares the
plaintiff Alfredo A. Sanson absolute owner of the land described in the
complaint, entitled to one-third of the palay produced thereon and
deposited in the hands of the provincial sheriff of Iloilo, and orders
the defendant Valentin Dignadice to deliver the possession of said land
to the, plaintiff.
<p> On March 20, 1923, the defendant sold the land in question to Leonardo Soriano for the sum of P7,200 with <em>pacto de retro</em>
for a period of ten years (Exhibit 2). It was also stipulated in the
deed of sale that said land would be leased by the defendant, who
agreed to pay one hundred cavans of palay annually as rent therefor.
Leonardo Soriano died on July 20, 1927, and his intestate proceedings
having been instituted, the land was adjudicated to his widow Joaquina
Ganzon, in accordance with the partition made to that effect in June,
1929.</p>
<p> Shortly afterwards, the defendant applied for the registration of
various parcels of land, including the one now under consideration,
designated as lots Nos. 1 to 9. Joaquina Ganzon opposed the application
as to said lots, alleging that they belonged to her, having been
adjudicated to her in the intestate proceedings of her husband Leonardo
Soriano, In said registration proceedings, the defendant confirmed the
sale of said lots to Soriano, as well as the fact that he later leased
them, agreeing to pay rent therefor. In the decision rendered in said
case, the court stated: "It appears that parcels Nos. 1 to 9 have been
sold with <em>pacto de retro</em> for the sum of P7,200 to Joaquina
Ganzon Viuda de Soriano, as successor in interest of the deceased
Leonardo Soriano, subject to a right of repurchase expiring on March
20, 1933, said parcels being in the possession of the applicant, as
lessee, in consideration of an annual rent of one hundred provincial
cavans of palay." The dispositive part of said decision reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore, parcels or lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 and 9, which are the subject matter of the application, together
with all the improvements thereon, are ordered adjudicated and
registered in favor of Valentin Dignadice, widower, of age, resident of
Ajuy, Province of Iloilo, and a citizen of the Philippine Islands; it
being understood that this adjudication is subject to the right of
repurchase in favor of Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de Soriano for the sum of
seven thousand two hundred pesos (P7,200) expiring on March 20, 1933/'
Pursuant to the terms of this decision, the certificate of title was
issued in favor of the defendant with said right of repurchase
annotated thereon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> As the period for repurchase had expired on March 20, 1933, without
the vendor's having exercised said right, the certificate of title
issued in favor of the defendant was cancelled and another issued in
favor of Joaquina Ganzon.</p>
<p> On March 24, 1933, Joaquina Ganzon sold the land to Concepcion
Araneta. The latter, in turn, sold it to Alfredo Sanson, the herein
plaintiff, who, by virtue of said sale, instituted the present action
for recovery of possession against the defendant.</p>
<p> The defendant's entire defense in this instance is based upon the
ground that the contract entered into between him and Leonardo Soriano
relative to the land in question, was not a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
but a mere loan. However, as this same question had been raised in the
above-cited registration case and the decision rendered therein has
already become final, the entire question is reduced to what was the
decision rendered in this respect. Examining the decision rendered in
said case, it clearly appears that it was held by the court that the
contract entered into between Leonardo Soriano and the defendant was a
sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>. The terms of said decision are clear and unequivocal in this sense. The fact that the court used the word <em>gravamen</em>
in stating that the purpose of Joaquina Ganzon's opposition was merely
to have a lien on the property recorded in her favor, does not affect
the clear sense of the decision, inasmuch as this lien, in the opinion
of the court, evidently consists in the contract of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em> entered into between Leonardo Soriano and the defendant. Furthermore, the word gravamen in its broad sense includes <em>pacto de retro</em> in so far as it is a limitation of ownership of the property affecting the vendor as well as the purchaser.</p>
<p> While the clearness of the language used in the dispositive part of the decision<em> ordering the adjudication and registration</em>
of the land in favor of the defendant leaves much to be desired, there
is no doubt that said adjudication and registration refer only to the
remaining right of the defendant after the sale and during the period
of the <span style="font-style: italic;">right of repurchase</span>, because the law (section 19 [e], of Act No.
496, as amended by Act No. 2164), which permits the vendor under <em>pacto de retro</em>
to apply for the registration of the real property sold, requires as
condition the annotation of the sale for the purposes thereof.</p>
<p> Therefore, if the finding of the court in the registration case
that the contract entered into between Leonardo Soriano and the
defendant was a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em> and not a loan constitutes <em>res judicata</em>, this question cannot again be raised now.</p>
<p> The fact that after the decision! in the above-cited registration
case had been rendered, Joaquina Ganzon, who was not the one who had
entered into the contract of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>, wrote
letters wherein she called the defendant's obligation to refund the
purchase price a debt, cannot affect the sense given by the court to
its decision. Furthermore, it cannot be alleged that what Joaquina
Ganzon meant by debt in said letters is an obligation arising from a
loan, because she clearly stated in one of them that the contract
between the defendant and her deceased husband was a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>. This conclusion arrived at by this court disposes of all the other alleged errors assigned in this case. </p>
<p> Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs to the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, </em>and<em> Laurel, JJ.,</em> concur.<br><br></p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em>
</p><p><strong>CONCEPCION,</strong><em> J., </em></p>
<p>I regret to have to dissent from the majority opinion. Taking for
granted that the judgment rendered in the case for registration of the
nine lots described in the complaint for recovery of possession is <em>res judicata</em>,
the only final conclusion that may be arrived at, according to said
judgment, is that the appellant and not the plaintiff is the true owner
of the lands in question.</p>
<p> Said judgment reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Wherefore, parcels or lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 and 9, which are the subject matter of the application, together
with all the improvements thereon, are ordered adjudicated and
registered in favor of Valentin Dignadice (the appellant), * * *; it
being understood that this adjudication is subject to the right of
repurchase in favor of Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de Soriano for the sum of
seven thousand two hundred pesos (P7,200) expiring on March 20, 1933."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> According to the foregoing judgment, the appellant is the owner of
the lands, but Soriano's widow, the appellee's predecessor in interest,
had a right of repurchase of said lands. This is the ordinary and legal
sense of the underlined words. However, it does not seem to be the
truth, because according to the evidence the appellant applied for the
registration of the lands in question in his name. Joaquina Ganzon
opposed it and during the hearing the appellant testified as follows:</p>

<p>  (Exhibit J, pages 20-22. Underscoring ours.)</p>
<p> Now, taking into consideration the foregoing testimony and the
language in which the dispositive part of the abovequoted judgment is
couched, it will be noted that the sale with <em>pacto de retro</em> of the lands in question was considered as a lien. However, as the contract of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
is not exactly a lien, the judgment on this point is rather ambiguous
and we should ascertain in what sense the appellant has used the word
"lien" and what was the idea of the judge in decreeing that the lands
belonged to the appellant, declaring that said adjudication was subject
to a right of repurchase in favor of Soriano's widow. The reason for
all of these is because the appellant, in the registration case as well
as in this case, has always and invariably maintained that the sale
with <em>pacto de retro</em> executed by him in favor of the deceased
Leonardo Soriano was merely a loan of P7,200 secured by his lands,
under the guise, of a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>. It is not
attempted herein to again raise the question whether the contract
executed by the appellant in favor of Leonardo Soriano was a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
or simply a loan. It is only attempted to clarify the ambiguity of the
judgment by showing the true meaning of the judgment rendered in the
registration case. Had the judge considered the sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
in question as a transfer of the right of ownership pending the
resolutory condition of repurchase and not as a simple loan secured by
the lands, he would not have decreed therein that the lands belonged to
the appellant. He would have adjudicated them to Soriano's widow
subject to the right of repurchase in favor of the appellant, as the
provisions of the Civil Code relative to <em>pacto de retro</em> sales are not repealed.</p>
<p> It is not strange for the judge to have given the contract of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
executed by the appellant, such character, inasmuch as this court
itself, in various decisions, has also held certain contracts, which
had been executed in the form of a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>, to be mere loans secured by mortgage. (Cuyugan <em>vs.</em> Santos, 34 Phil., 100; Villa <em>vs.</em> Santiago, 38 Phil., 157.)<br>
    <br>
It has been established by the evidence, for the defendant that the
interpretation given to the contract executed by the appellant in the
judgment rendered in the registration case, considering it as a lien,
is correct and just, and the parties have so understood it prior to as
well as after the judgment, until the moment Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de
Soriano committed the fraud which will be shown later.</p>
<ol><li> With respect to Leonardo Soriano, predecessor in interest
of his widow Joaquina Ganzon, it appears that the origin of the alleged
contract of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em> was a loan of P6,000
obtained by the appellant from said Leonardo Soriano. In order to have
a security for the payment of the loan, Leonardo Soriano required the
appellant to execute a deed of sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>,
Exhibit 1, which was in fact executed by him on August 17, 1918,
transferring to Soriano 24 parcels of land together with 10 heads of
carabao for said sum of P6,000. As the interest agreed upon was 20 per1
cent, Soriano, in order to disguise the usurious nature of the
transaction, caused the appellant to execute 3 days later, or on August
20th of said year, another separate deed stating that said appellant
remained in possession of the lands and carabaos allegedly sold, as
lessor, agreeing to pay on the 20th of August of every year the sum of
P1,200 representing exactly 20 per cent of P6,000. As the appellant
could not pay the supposed rent of P1,200 in the year 1922, Soriano
caused the appellant to execute, as he in fact executed on March 20,
1923, the deed Exhibit 2, which was also apparently a contract of sale
with <em>pacto de retro</em>, but instead of transferring said 24
parcels of land described in the previous deed, he transferred only 5
parcels which are the subject matter of this litigation, the
consideration thereof being the sum of P7,200, that is, the amount of
the original loan, P6,000, plus the unpaid interest of P1,200. It was
stipulated in this contract that the appellant would pay 100 cavans of
palay as alleged annual rent, thereby reducing the interest on the loan
because "Mr. Soriano said that he took pity on the Dignadices" (the
appellant and his children * * * page 69, t. s. n.). The period for the
right of repurchase was likewise extended to 10 years from the date of
the execution of the deed Exhibit 2. Soriano never requested that the
land tax be put in his name, the lands which were the subject matter of
the former deed as well as those of the second deed having remained
assessed in the name of the appellant. Soriano died on July 20, 1927,
and the 5 parcels of land were adjudicated in the partition of his
estate to his widow Joaquina Ganzont.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>
Joaquina Ganzon's behaviour in connection with the lands in question
likewise shows that she considered the contract of sale with pweto de
retro executed by the appellant in favor of her deceased husband, as a
simple loan se7 cured by said lands, because neither did she ever apply
tor the transfer of the assessment thereon to her name and she
consented to the issuance of the title to said lands in favor of the
appellant. Furthermore, according to her letters Exhibits 8, 9, 10 and
11, the respective translations of which are Exhibits 8-A, 9-A, 10-A,
and 11-A, she acted in this case with the conviction that what she had
inherited from her husband was a credit of P7,200 secured by the
appellant's lands. This is the reason why in her letter, Exhibit 8,
addressed to the appellant, she said that, as she was in need of money,
the appellant and his children should try to transfer said debt to
other persons; and in her letter Exhibit 10, she was glad to hear that
Alfredo A. Sanson, the herein plaintiff-appellee, intended to purchase
the lands in question, so that the money might be refunded to her. All
the foregoing clearly showed that Soriano's widow was talking about a
loan, and it was only because the appellant had not answered her
letters and because she found herself in dire financial necessity that
she threatened to enforce her rights, that is, to take advantage of the
fact that the documents executed by the appellant appeared on their
face as a contract of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro. </span>In fact, by
fraudulently inducing the register of deeds to believe that she was the
owner of the lands in question and that the appellant had failed to
repurchase them, she applied for and obtained the cancellation of the
certificate of title issued in favor of the appellant and the issuance
of another in her favor. On the day following the transfer of the title
in her name, that is, on March 24,1933, she sold the lands to
Concepcion Araneta for the sum of P8,322, that is, the amount of the
loan of P7,200 plus the interest thereon for about three years at the
rate of PP600 a year, which was equivalent to 100 cavans of palay
formerly paid by the appellant but which he failed to pay regularly and
entirely from the year 1930.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li> Scarcely
one month and several days after Concepcion Araneta had purchased the
lands, she, in turn, sold them to the plaintiff-appellee Alfredo A.
Sanson for P9,000, with the particularity that in the deed, Exhibit D,
it was stated that she would not be responsible for warranty and
eviction nor for the real estate tax on the lands sold by her, because
it had not been paid by the appellant.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li> The plaintiff-appellee is not a <em>bona fide</em>
purchaser and the certificate of title issued in his favor should be
annulled on the ground that in February, 1933, he attempted to purchase
a part of the lands and learned from the appellant himself and his
children that said lands had been given as security for a debt
contracted by the appellant with the deceased Leonardo Soriano.</li></ol>
<p> If in spite of all the above-stated facts, which clearly showthat
the parties very Well knew that the true contract executed by the
appellant was a loan secured by the lands, and it had been so
considered by Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de Soriano until the moment it
occurred to her to fraudulently induce the register of deeds to believe
that her right was that of a purchaser and that the vendor had failed
to exercise his right of repurchase; if, in spite of all the foregoing
facts, the appellee were declared the legitimate owner of the nine
parcels of land in litigation, it would be permitting the appellant to
lose some lands assessed at P27,360 in 1929, for the sum of P7,200;
while, if the appellant were declared the owner of the lands, no
prejudice would be caused to the appellee because he would be able to
recover the sum of P9,000 paid by him for said lands, inasmuch as by
adding the accrued interest from the year 1930, at the rate of P600 per
annum, to the amount of the loan of P7,200, the appellant's debt to
this date would amount to about P11,400. I am of the opinion that the
appealed judgment should be reversed, by declaring the transfer of
title made in favor of Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de Soriano fraudulent, and
that the appellant should be ordered to pay the amount of the loan of
P7,200 plus the interest thereon at the rate of P600 per annum, from
the year 1930 until the date of payment thereof.</p>
<p><strong>ABAD SANTOS,</strong> <em>J.:</em></p>
<p>I concur in the dissenting opinion of Justice Concepcion.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p align="center"> RESOLUTION ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>
<p align="right"> <em>July 6, 1937</em></p><p>
  <strong>AVANCENA,</strong> <em>C. J</em>.:</p>
<p> The question raised in this case is whether the contract entered
into between the defendant and Leonardo Soriano, from whom the
plaintiff originally derives his right, was a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>
or a mere loan secured by mortgage. As stated in the decision rendered
and in the dissenting opinion, and repeated in the motion for
reconsideration, the same question having been previously raised in a
registration case wherein judgment, now final, was rendered, the entire
question is reduced to determining what was the decision rendered in
said registration case.</p>
<p> In said decision the following conclusion of fact was established :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "It appears that parcels Nos. 1 to 9 have been sold
with pacto de retro for the sum of P7,200 to Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de
Soriano, as successor in interest of the deceased Leonardo Soriano,
subject to a right of repurchase expiring on March 20, 1933, said
parcels being in the possession of the applicant, as lessee, in
consideration of an annual rent of one hundred provincial cavans of
palay."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The dispositive part rendered reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Wherefore, parcels or lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 and 9, which are the subject matter of the application, together
with all the improvements thereon, are ordered adjudicated and
registered in favor of Valentin Dignadice, widower, of age, resident of
Ajuy, Province of Iloilo, and a citizen of the Philippine Islands; it
being understood that this adjudication is subject to the right of
repurchase in favor of Joaquina Ganzon Viuda de Soriano for the sum of
seven thousand two hundred pesos (f7,200) expiring on March 20, 1933."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It is not claimed that the language used in the abovequoted
conclusion of fact is not clear, but it is alleged that the dispositive
part is ambiguous. Granting that such ambiguity exists, if, on the
other hand, it must be presumed that the court understood what it said
upon holding that the contract was a sale with<span style="font-style: italic;"> pacto de retro,</span> the
dispositive part in question cannot be interpreted in such a way that
the effect of the contract would not be a sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>, but
a mere loan. In the memorandum in support of the motion for
reconsideration, the doctrine that <em>where a judgment is susceptible
of two interpretations, that one will be adopted which makes the
judgment harmonized with the facts and law of the case, </em>is cited.
The fact in this case, as accepted by the court, is that the contract
entered into was a sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> and the effect of this
contract, under the law, is that the purchaser acquires ownership of
the thing sold subject only, for a certain period, to a resolutory
condition. If the allegedly ambiguous dispositive part were interpreted
as holding that the contract was a mere loan and, consequently, did not
transfer the ownership of the land to the purchaser, in spite of the
fact that said land had been sold to him at least with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>,
the judgment so interpreted would be contrary to law.</p>
<p> Although the allegedly ambiguous dispositive part could have been
couched in a clearer language, this court is of the opinion that it is
not ambiguous and is substantially in accordance with law. It must be
remembered that prior to the passage of Act No. 1108, a vendor under
<span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> could not apply for the registration of the land sold
(Villaruel <em>vs.</em> Encarnacion, 5 Phil, 360). Act No. 1108,
however, authorized the vendor under <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> to apply for the
registration of the land sold, on condition that the sale be recorded.
This court is of the opinion that the purpose of the law was to have
the registration so applied for made in the name of the vendor,
because, prior to the passage of Act No. 3621, which took place many
years later, although the oppositor in a contested registration case
proved that he was the owner of the land, which was the subject matter
of the application, it could not be registered in his name. So that,
where it has been proven that the land, the registration of which is
sought, had been sold under <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> by the applicant to the
oppositor, as the land could not be registered in the name of the
latter, it should be registered in the name of the vendor, he being
authorized to apply for the registration thereof under Act No. 1108. It
was so held in the case of Montiero <em>vs.</em> Salgado (27 Phil.,
631), where, as the land the registration of which was applied for
turned out to have been sold under <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> by the applicant to
the oppositor, the registration thereof in the name of the applicant
was ordered with a notation of the sale.</p>
<p> Therefore, the fact that the court ordered the <em>adjudication and registration</em> of the land in the name of the applicant, does not necessarily mean that it declared the applicant the owner thereof.</p>
<p> It should be noted that in no part of the decision has the court
declared that the land belongs to the applicant. It simply ordered the
adjudication and registration thereof in his name.</p>
<p> Of course, this is not an instance where it has been held by the
court that, notwithstanding the fact that the terms of the contract
express a sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>, the contract entered into between
the parties is, in reality, a simple loan secured by mortgage, because
no such statement was made in the case under consideration.</p>
<p> The motion for reconsideration is denied and the decision rendered upheld. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz, </em>and<em> Laurel, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>ABAD SANTOS, </strong><em>J.:</em></p>
<p> I dissent for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of Justice Concepcion heretofore filed in this case.</p>
