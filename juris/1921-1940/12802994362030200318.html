				<BR><STRONG>BUTTE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of 
First Instance of Occidental Negros in an action for writ of mandamus to
 compel the defendant-appellant Chief of Constabulary to pay the 
plaintiff-appellee a monthly pension out of the pension and retirement 
fund of the Philippine Constabulary from February 1, 1925.
<p align="justify"> The evidence shows that the plaintiff served as a 
member of the Philippine Constabulary from September 12, 1901, without 
interruption to January 21, 1922, when he was retired with the rank of 
sergeant under the provisions of section 874 of the Administrative Code.
 From the date of his retirement and up to January 31, 1925, he received
 a monthly pension of P28.30 from said fund.</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 24, 1925, the plaintiff was convicted on 
appeal by this court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  of 
the crime of robbery committed on June 22, 1923, and sentenced to three 
years, eight months and one day of <em>presidio mayor</em> with the 
accessories prescribed in article 57 of the Penal Code. Because of this 
conviction, the defendant Chief of Constabulary, with the approval of 
the Governor-General, dropped the name of the plaintiff from the roll of
 retired Constabulary soldiers effective February 1, 1925, and suspended
 the payment of the plaintiff's monthly pension from and after said 
date.</p>
<p align="justify"> Exhibit B proves that the plaintiff was born on 
November 15, 1868. He was not recalled to the service while he was 
serving his sentence which he served in part only because he was 
pardoned by the Governor-General. On this appeal, the Solicitor-General,
 on behalf of the Chief of Constabulary, makes the following assignments
 of error:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "1. The trial court erred in holding that the 
conviction of the plaintiff of the crime of robbery, for which he was 
sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three years, eight months and one 
day of <em>presidio mayor</em>, with the accessories prescribed in 
article 57 of the Penal Code, to return to the offended parties the sum 
of P14, and to pay the costs. did not terminate his right to further 
participation in the benefit of, and to receive further pension from the
 pension and retirement fund of the Philippine Constabulary.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "2. The trial court erred in sentencing the 
defendant to pay to the plaintiff the pension he may have failed to 
receive from February 1, 1925, up to September 26, 1933, at the rate of 
P28.30 a month, and thereafter and until the date of his demise a 
monthly pension of P28.30.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "3. The trial court erred in denying defendant's 
motion for a new trial."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The principal argument in support of the first and 
second assignments of error is that the petitioner has violated section 
875 of the Administrative Code and thereby forfeited his right to a 
pension. This section is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "SEC. 875. <em>Requirement of active service from 
retired officers and men</em>.—All officers and enlisted men of the 
Constabulary drawing pensions or retirement pay and residing in the 
Philippine Islands may at any time be called by the Governor-General for
 active service, during the period of which service they shall be 
entitled to receive the full pay of their rank or grade. Refusal on the 
part of any officer or enlisted man to perform such duty shall terminate
 his right to further participation in the benefit of this fund, 
provided he is physically fit for service, such fitness to be determined
 under regulations to be prescribed by the Department Head."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The argument is that although the petitioner has not
 at any time since his retirement been called to active service and 
although he has not directly refused to perform such duty, he has 
nevertheless indirectly refused by putting himself in a condition by his
 voluntary act where he could not render such service if he had been 
called. It is stated by the counsel for the appellant: "The case, 
therefore, would amount to an indirect refusal to rejoin the 
organization for active service in case he should be called to do so by 
the Governor-General." But section 875 does not speak of indirect 
refusals nor of, contingent or hypothetical refusals. Section 875 
relates to cases where there has been an actual call to active service 
and an actual refusal on the part of any officer or enlisted man to 
perform that duty.</p>
<p align="justify"> Moreover, the petitioner was more than fifty-five 
years of age at the time he was convicted of the crime of robbery. Under
 the provisions of Act No. 3157 which amended section 874 of the 
Administrative Code, the petitioner was already exempt from the duty of 
joining the active service. Said Act No. 3157 took effect on March 8, 
1924, and the defendant, as above stated, was not finally convicted 
until January 24, 1925, after which date he began to serve his sentence.</p>
<p align="justify"> In his brief, the Solicitor-General raises a 
question not raised in the court below, namely, that although the 
Governor-General is not made a party to this action, the decision 
invades his power to exercise his discretion as Commander in Chief and 
General Supervisor of the Philippine Constabulary. Section 826 of the 
Administrative Code is relied on. This reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "SEC. 826. <em>Authority of Governor-General over 
Philippine Constabulary.</em>—In the exercise of its power to maintain 
peace, law, and order, the Philippine Constabulary shall be subject to 
the command and general supervision of the Governor-General." The 
administration of the pension fund does not seem to us to be covered by 
section 826 but rather by section 829 of the Administrative Code which 
is as follows:</p>
  <p align="justify"> "SEC. 829. <em>Chief of Constabulary clothed with 
powers of Bureau chief.</em>—For administrative purposes the Philippine 
Constabulary shall be deemed to be a Bureau, and the chief of 
Constabulary shall have all the powers conferred generally on the Bureau
 chief." Except for the provision in section 875 of the Administrative 
Code, <em>supra</em>, there is no provision in law for the forfeiture of
 life pensions paid to officers and enlisted men of the Philippine 
Constabulary who have rendered twenty or more years of actual 
satisfactory service and attained the age of fifty-five years or who, on
 account of their physical or mental condition, are prevented from 
continuing in active service. But though it is true that ordinarily a 
pension is a mere gratuity, it is to be noted that in this case the 
pension and retirement fund is made up in considerable part of the three
 <em>per centum </em>of the pay of every enlisted man of the 
constabulary which is deducted from said pay monthly. Not only isPhe 
Governor-General not a party to this action but it appears from the 
record that he pardoned the offense. The effect of a pardon, subject to 
the conditions thereof, is to wipe out the offense as if it had never 
been committed. As the only ground upon which the petitioner was denied 
the further payment of his pension was his conviction of crime as 
aforesaid, and as said crime in itself did not constitute a refusal ta 
answer a call to service, even assuming that he was still liable to be 
called, and as the pardon of the Governor-General was accepted by the 
petitioner and restored him to all his civil rights and relieved him of 
all of the accessory penalties attaching to his conviction, we conclude 
that the judgment of the trial court is just and correct and should be 
affirmed. We take judicial notice of the official acts of the Executive,
 including pardons, under the provisions of section 275 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure.</p>
