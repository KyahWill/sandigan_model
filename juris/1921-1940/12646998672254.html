				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In the proceedings for the liquidation of the Mercantile Bank of China, the appellant presented a written claim alleging: that when this bank ceased to operate on September 19, 1931, his current account in said bank showed a balance of P9,657.50 in his favor; that on the same date his savings account in the said bank also showed a balance in his favor of P20,000 plus interest then due amounting to P194.78; that, on the other hand, he owed the bank in the amount of P13,262.58, the amount of the trust receipts which he signed because of his withdrawal from the bank of certain merchandise consigned to him without
    paying the drafts drawn upon him by the remittors thereof; that the credits thus described should be set off against each other according to law, and on such set off being made it appeared that he was still the creditor of the bank in the sum of P16,589.70. And he asked that the court order the Bank Commissioner to pay him the aforesaid balance and that the same be declared as a preferred credit. The claim was referred to the commissioner appointed by the court, who at the same time acted as referee, and this officer recommended that the balance claimed be paid without interest and as an ordinary credit. The court
 approved the recommendation and entered judgment in accordance therewith. The claimant took an appeal.</p>
  <p>In his report the commissioner classified the claims presented under the following six groups: "(First) Current
        accounts, savings and fixed deposits. (Second) Checks or
        drafts sold by the Mercantile Bank of China and not paid
        by the correspondents or banks against which they were
        drawn. (Third) Checks or drafts issued by the Mercantile Bank of China in payment or reimbursement of drafts
        or goods sent to it for collection by banks and foreign
        commercial houses against merchants or commercial entities of Manila. (Fourth) Drafts for collection received
        by the Mercantile Bank of China to be collected from merchants and commercial entities in Manila, and which were
        pending collection on the date of the suspension of payments. (Fifth) Claims of depositors who are at the
  same time debtors of the Mercantile Bank of China. (Sixth) Various claims." And referring to the claim of
  the appellant, he states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Mr. Tan Tiong Tick claims from the Mercantile Bank
              of China the amount of P27,597.80, the total amount of
              the following sums which he has in his favor in said bank
      including the corresponding interests:</p>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
    <p> "Adding to this total the interest also claimed by Mr.
            Tan Tiong Tick, that is, P194.78 on the savings account
            and P12.91 on the current account, the amount claimed
    makes a total of P27,597.80.</p>
    <p>"Notwithstanding the fact that the Bank Commissioner
                found the claim in accordance with the books of the Mercantile Bank of China, he declined to issue the corresponding certificate of proof of claim because the said claimant
                has pending in the said bank obligations for accepting
      drafts amounting to a total of $6,631.29.</p>
    <p>"At the hearing of this claim, the claimant admitted such
                  pending obligations, alleging at the same time that to guarantee the payment of drafts accepted by him, he pledged
      his bank book No. 2266, which also answered for the payment of any credit which the said bank may extend to him.</p>
    <p>"In Exhibit A presented by the claimant as evidence,
                     consisting of a letter dated November 4, 1931, addressed
                     by Mr. H. J. Belden to the then Bank Commissioner, Mr.
                     Leo. H. Martin, it appears that the said savings account
                     was constituted for the sole purpose of securing the payment of drafts against the claimant, the bill of ladings of
                     which were delivered to him upon trust-receipts, and that,
                     according to the records of the bank, Mr. Tan Tiong Tick
        did not obtain any other accommodation from the bank except the trust-receipts.</p>
    <p align="center">"RECOMMENDATION</p>
    <p>"Having, established the existence of such deposits in the
                       name of Tan Tiong Tick and the latter having recognized
                       the obligation in favor of the bank alleged by the Bank
                       Commissioner, for the security of which he constituted the
                       savings deposit in the amount of P20,000, it is recommended that from this amount there be deducted the amount
                       of the obligation of P13,778.90 which the claimant acknowledges in favor of the Mercantile Bank of China, and
                       that the difference, plug the other current account deposit
                       of P7,390.11, be considered as ordinary credits subject to
      the equal division of the funds of the said bank.</p>
    <p>"As to the interest on said deposits also claimed by Mr.
                         Tan Tiong Tick, the rejection thereof is recommended in
                         view of the fact that the Bank Commissioner has not credited any interest to the current and savings accounts of
                         the Mercantile Bank of China, and it would be unfair that
      interest, not credited to the others, be allowed to this claimant."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    It will be noted that in the report of the commissioner
the credit of the claimant for the balance of his deposit
on current account has been reduced to P7,390.11, instead
of P9,657.50 alleged in his claim, the total balance recommended in favor of the appellant being P13,611.21, without
including interest, instead of P16,589.70. In his brief the
appellant admits the figures appearing in the report, with
the exception of the interest on which we shall presently
dwell.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>     Resolving the claims under the first group of the report of the commissioner, the court rejected the recommendation of this official to the effect that they be declared
                       ordinary credits only, and approved them as preferred credits. However, in considering the other claims, among
                       them that of the appellant, classified under the fifth group,
                       the court approved the recommendation of the commissioner that they be declared ordinary credits; in other
                       words, the court considered and declared the claim of the
                       appellant as an ordinary credit just because the latter is
                       at the same time a debtor of the bank, notwithstanding
                       the fact that his claim is of the same kind as those classified under the first group, inasmuch as they are also current account and savings deposits. To this part of the
      decision is addressed the appellant's first assignment of
error.<br>
<br>
In truth, if the current account, savings, and fixed deposits are preferred credits for the reasons stated by the
court in its decision, we see no reason why the preference
should disappear when the depositors are at the same time
debtors of the bank for amounts less than their credits.
If the ground to declare them preferred credits is sound,
the balances resulting after the set off should likewise be
preferred, unless there be a law providing that a set off,
when it takes place, produces such an effect, a law which
does not exist as far as we know.<br>
<br>

    But we are of the opinion, for the reason presently to be
                  stated, that current account and savings deposits are not
                  preferred credits in the cases, like the present, involving
                  the insolvency and liquidation of a bank, where there are
                  various creditors and it becomes necessary to ascertain the
    preference of various credits.<br>
    <br>
    The court held that these deposits should be governed
by the Civil Code, and applying articles 1758 and 1768 of
the said Code, ruled that the so-called irregular deposits
being still in vogue, as Manresa, the commentator, maintains, and as held by this court in the case of Rogers <i>vs.</i> Smith, Bell &amp; Co. (10 Phil., 319), the former are preferred
                      credits because partaking of the nature of the irregular
    deposits.<br>
    <br>
    In our opinion, these deposits are essentially mercantile
contracts and should, therefore, be governed by the provisions of the Code of Commerce, pursuant to its article 2 reading:<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Art. 2. Commercial transactions, be they performed
                            by merchants or not, whether they are specified in this
                            Code or not, shall be governed by the provisions contained
                            in the same: in the absence of such provisions, by the
                            commercial customs generally observed in each place; and
        in the absence of both, by those of the common law.<br>
        <br>
"Commercial transactions shall be considered those enumerated in this Code and any others of a similar character."</p>
</blockquote>
    There is cited in support of the application of the Civil
                          Code to these deposits article 310 of the Code of Commerce
    providing:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p> "Art. 310. Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing articles, deposits made with banks, with general
                                warehouses, with loan or any other associations, shall be
                                governed in the first place by the by-laws of the same, in
                                the second by the provisions of this Code, and finally by the
        rules of common law, which are applicable to all deposits."</p>
    </blockquote>
        But apparently there was a failure to consider that, according to the order established by the article, the Civil
Code or the common law is mentioned after the Code of
Commerce, which means that the provisions of the latter
Code should first be applied before resorting to those of
the Civil Code which are supplementary in character.<br>
<br>
    The Code of Commerce contains express provisions regulating deposits of the nature under consideration, and they
                        are articles 303 to 310. The first and the second to the
    last of the said articles are as follows:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p> "Art. 303. In order that a deposit may be considered
        commercial, it is necessary—<br>
        <br>
"1. That the depositary, at least, be a merchant.<br>
"2. That the things deposited be commercial objects.<br>
"3. That the deposit constitute in itself a commercial
                                    transaction, or be made by reason or as a consequence of
        commercial transactions."<br>
        <br>
"Art. 309. Whenever, with the consent of the depositor,
                                      the depositary disposes of the articles on deposit either for
                                      himself or for his business, or for transactions intrusted
                                      to him by the former, the rights and obligations of the
                                      depositary and of the depositor shall cease, and the rules
                                      and provisions applicable to the commercial loans, commission, or contract which took the place of the deposit shall
        be observed."</p>
    </blockquote>
        In accordance with article 309, the so-called current
account and savings deposits have lost the character of deposits properly so-called, and are converted into simple
commercial loans, because the bank disposed of the funds
deposited by the claimant for its ordinary transactions and
for the banking business in which it was engaged. That
the bank had the authority of the claimant to make use of
the money deposited on current and savings accounts is
deducible from the fact that the bank has been paying interest on both deposits, and the claimant himself asks that
he be allowed interest up to the time when the bank ceased
its operations. Moreover, according to sections 125 of the
Corporation Law and 9 of Act No. 3154, said bank is
authorized to make use of the current account, savings,
and fixed deposits provided it retains in its treasury a certain percentage of the amounts of said deposits. Said sections read:<br>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 125. Every such commercial banking corporation
                                        shall at all times have on hand in lawful money of the
                                        Philippine Islands or of the United States, an amount
                                        equal to at least eighteen per centum of the aggregate
                                        amount of its deposits in current accounts which are payable on demand and of its fixed deposits coming due within
                                        thirty days. Such commercial banking corporation shall
                                        also at all times maintain reserve equal in amount to at
                                        least five per centum of its total savings deposits. The
                                        said reserve may be maintained in the form of lawful money
                                        of the Philippine Islands or of the United States, or in
                                        bonds issued or guaranteed by the Government of the
        Philippine islands or of the United States. * * *<br>
        <br>
"The percentage of reserve to deposits in the case of
                                          the Philippine National Bank and the Bank of the Philippine
                                          Islands is hereby fixed at eighteen per centum of demand deposits and fixed deposits payable within thirty days and five per centum of savings deposits, in the same manner
                                          as is prescribed in tins section for commercial banking corporations in general, which reserve against savings deposits may consist of Philippine Government or United
        States Government bonds."<br>
        <br>
"Sec. 9. Every bank organized under this Act shall at
                                            all times have on hand, in lawful money of the Philippine
                                            Islands or of the United States, an amount equal to at
                                            least twenty per centum ox the aggregate amount of its
                                            deposits. The term 'lawful money of the Philippine Islands'
                                            shall include the Treasury certificates authorized by Act
                                            Numbered Three thousand and fifty-eight, and the term
                                            'lawful money of the United States' shall include gold and
        silver certificates of the United States and bank notes issued by the Federal Reserve Banks."</p>
</blockquote>
    Therefore, the bank, without the necessity of the claimant a consent, was by law authorized to dispose of the deposits, subject to the limitation indicated.<br>
    <br>
    We, therefore, conclude that the law applicable to the
appellant's claims is the Code of Commerce and that ma
current and savings accounts have been converted into
simple commercial loans.<p>
    
    </p></li><li> The next point to decide is the applicable law, if any,
                                    to determine the preference of the appellant's credits, considering that there happens to be other creditors. Section
                                    V of Title I of Book IV of the Code of Commerce contains
                                    provisions relative to the rights of creditors in case of
                                    bankruptcy and to their respective gradation, but these
                                    provisions have been repealed by section 524 of the Code
    of Civil Procedure reading as follows:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <p> "Sec. 524. <em>No new proceedings to be instituted</em>.—No
                                              new bankruptcy proceedings shall be instituted until a new
                                              bankruptcy law shall come into force in the Islands. All
                                              existing laws and orders relating to bankruptcy and proceedings therein are hereby repealed: <em>Provided</em>, That
                                              nothing in this section shall be deemed in any manner to
        affect pending litigation in bankruptcy proceedings."</p>
    </blockquote>
        The Philippine Legislature subsequently enacted Act No.
1956, also known as the Insolvency Law, which took effect
on May 20, 1909, containing provisions regarding preference of credits; but its section 52 provides that all the
provisions of the law shall not apply to corporations engaged principally in the banking business, and among them
should be understood included the Mercantile Bank of China.
Said sections provide:<br>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 48. Merchandise, effects, and any other kind of
                                              property found among the property of the insolvent, the
                                              ownership of which has not been conveyed to him by a legal
                                              and irrevocable title, shall be considered to be the property
                                              of other persons and shall be placed at the disposal of its
                                              lawful owners on order of the court made at the hearing
                                              mentioned in section forty-three or at any ordinary hearing, if the assignee or any creditor whose right in the estate
                                              of the insolvent has been established shall petition in
                                              writing for such hearing and the court in its discretion shall

</blockquote>    
It appears that even after the enactment of the Insolvency Law there was no law in this jurisdiction governing
the order or preference of credits in cases of insolvency
and liquidation of a bank. But the Philippine Legislature
subsequently enacted Act No. 3519, amending various sections of the Revised Administrative Code, which took effect
on February 20, 1929, and section 1641 of this latter Code,
as amended by said Act, provides:<br>
<blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 1641. <em>Distribution of assets</em>.—In the case of the
                                                                    liquidation of a bank or banking institution, after payment
                                                                    of the costs of the proceedings, including reasonable expenses, commissions and fees of the Bank Commissioner,
                                                                    to be allowed by the court, the Bank Commissioner shall
                                                                    pay the debts of the institution, under decree of the court
                                                                    in the order of their legal priority."</p>
</blockquote>
    From this section 1641 we deduce that the intention of
the Philippine Legislature, in providing that the Bank Commissioner shall pay the debts of the company by virtue of
an order of the court in the order of their legal priority,
was to enforce the provisions of sections 48, 49 and 50 of
the Insolvency Law in the sense that they are made applicable to cases of insolvency or bankruptcy and liquidation of banks. No other deduction can be made from the
phrase "in the order of their legal priority" employed by
                                                                  the law, for there being no law establishing any priority in
                                                                  the order of payment of credits, the legislature could not
                                                                  reasonably refer to any legislation upon the subject, unless
                                                                  the interpretation above stated is accepted.<br>
                                                                  <br>
    Examining now the claims of the appellant, it appears
that none of them falls under any of the cases specified by
sections 48, 49 and 50 of the Insolvency Law; wherefore,
we conclude that the appellant's claims, consisting of his
current and savings accounts, are not preferred credits.<p>
    
    </p></li><li> The commissioner set off the claims of the appellant
                                                              against what the bank had against him. The court approved this set off over the objection of the appellant The
                                                              appellees contend that the set off does not lie in this case
                                                              because otherwise it would prejudice them and the other

                                                              is not error. "It may be stated as a general rule that when

    claims against the bank.<p>
    
    </p></li><li> The court held that the appellant is not entitled to.
charge interest on the amounts of his claims, and this is
the object of the second assignment of error. Upon this
point a distinction must be made between the interest which
the deposits should earn from their existence until the
bank ceased to operate, and that which they may earn
from the time the bank's operations were stopped until the
date of payment of the deposits. As to the first class, we
hold that it should be paid because such interest has been
earned in the ordinary course of the bank's business and
before the latter has been declared in a state of liquidation.
Moreover, the bank being authorized by law to make use
of the deposits, with the limitation stated, to invest the
same in its business and other operations, it may be presumed that it bound itself to pay interest to the depositors
as in fact it paid interest prior to the dates of the said
claims. As to the interest which may be charged from the
date the bank ceased to do business because it was declared
in a state of liquidation, we hold that the said interest
should not be paid. Under articles 1101 and 1108 of the
Civil Code, interest is allowed by way of indemnity for
damages suffered, in the cases wherein the obligation consists in the payment of money. In view of this, we hold
that in the absence of any express law or of any applicable provision of the Code of Commerce, it is not proper
to pay this last kind of interest to the appellant upon his
deposits in the bank, for this would be anomalous and unjustified in a liquidation or insolvency of a bank. This
rule should be strictly observed in the instant case because
it is understood that the assets should be prorated among
all the creditors as they are insufficient to pay all the obligations of the bank.<p>
    
    </p></li><li> The last assignment of error has to do with the denial by the court of the claimant's motion for new trial.
                                                                No new argument have been made in its support and it
                                                                appears that the assigned error was inserted as a mere
                                                                corollary of the preceding ones.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In view of all the foregoing considerations, we affirm the
  part of the appealed decision for the reasons stated herein,
  and it is ordered that the net claim of the appellant,
  amounting to P13,611.21, is an ordinary and not a preferred
  credit, and that he is entitled to charge interest on the said
  amount up to September 19, 1931, without special pronouncement as to the costs. So ordered.</p>
