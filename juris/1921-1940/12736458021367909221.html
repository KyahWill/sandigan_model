				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF JULIA DE LA PENA, DECEASED. DIEGO DE GUZMAN ET AL., PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. RUPINO SEVILLA ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is an appeal from an order dated July 20, 1923, of the Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija, denying the petition both of the petitioners and of the 
opponents for declaration of heirs and denying also the authority to sell 
certain property, which was applied for by the former.
<p>Both parties have appealed from this order, each assigning errors 
thereto.</p>
<p>This case is concerned with the inheritance of the deceased Julia de la 
Pena.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that this Julia de la Pena was daughter of Julio Sevilla 
and Catalina de la Pena, who were not married. The petitioners have introduced 
evidence to the effect that Julia de la Pena was an adulterous child because 
Julio Sevilla was married with Josefa Gutierrez who was alive at the time. The 
fact is that Julia de la Pena was a child of unmarried parents, and therefore 
she was not a legitimate child, nor does she appear to have been legitimated, 
and is, at most, an acknowledged natural child, supposing it not to have been 
proven that she was an adulterous child, as alleged by the petitioners.</p>
<p>Now, the persons entitled to succeed a natural child in an intestate 
succession are the father or mother who acknowledged it (art. 944, Civil Code), 
and in default of either, its natural brothers (art. 945, Civil Code). It was 
not proven nor is it contended that the petitioners or the opponents are parents 
or brothers of the deceased Julia de la Pefia; and with the exception of the 
relatives mentioned in said articles 944 and 945 of the Civil Code, no other 
relative of the natural child has the right to succeed it, as is clearly 
provided by article 943 of the same Code.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, clear that neither the petitioners nor the opponents can be 
declared heirs of the deceased Julia de la Pena without a will.</p>
<p>We find no error in the order appealed from, except in its last disposition 
which says "In lieu thereof, the estate is awarded to the State." We think this 
awarding is premature because the requirements of sections 750 to 752 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure have not previously been complied with.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed in other respects, without pronouncement 
as to costs, with instruction to the lower court to furnish the provincial 
fiscal of Nueva Ecija a copy of this decision for such action as may be proper 
under the aforesaid sections 750 to 752 of the Code of Civil Procedure. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avancena, Villamor,</em> and <em>Ostrand, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
