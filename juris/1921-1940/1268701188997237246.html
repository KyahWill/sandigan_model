  </blockquote>
  <p>
Upon the termination of the trial, Judge Felix Samson found the
defendant guilty as charged, and sentenced him to suffer eight years of
<em>prision mayor</em>, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of
P1,963.74, to suffer an additional penalty of thirteen years, one
month, and eleven days of <em>reclusion temporal</em> for being a habitual delinquent, and to pay the costs.</p>
  <p>    The defendant appealed to this court. His attorney<em> de oficio</em>
concurred in the findings of the trial judge, and advised the defendant
to withdraw his appeal, but the defendant refused to follow this
advice. Defendant's attorney then filed a motion, wherein he set forth
the facts of the case and discussed them, and prayed that he be
relieved from filing a brief for the appellant. Thereupon this court
ordered the Solicitor-General to file the brief for the Government.</p>
  <p>
It appears from the evidence that Uy Chay Hing was doing business as a
merchant in the municipality of Iguig, Cagayan Province, and that he
slept in the same building. On the morning of January 6, 1933, he found
that one of the doors of the store which he had closed the night before
was open and also three drawers in a showcase. These three drawers
contained P100 in small coins. The drawers were not locked. The money
had disappeared. Before retiring the night before Uy Chay Hing had
counted and placed in the drawer of a table in the room where he was
accustomed to sleep the sum of P1,963.74 consisting of bank notes and
coins. He locked this drawer and left the key in a pocket of his
trousers. Next morning Uy Chay Hing found that this drawer had been
opened with his key and that the money had disappeared. Among the bank
notes placed in this drawer there was one for $20. Uy Chay Hing had
made a note of the number of this American bank note in a memorandum
book, and when he reported to the authorities that his store had been
robbed he gave the number of this twenty-dollar bank note.</p>
  <p>
The defendant had been in the offended party's store for an hour on the
night of January 5th. Next day he was seen in Tuguegarao buying goods
in the store of an Indian merchant, and from there he went to Aparri.
He was arrested and searched in pursuance of a search warrant, and the
sum of P218.50 consisting of bank notes and coins was found in his
possession, and among this money was the twenty-dollar bank note which
had been stolen from Uy Chay Hing. The defendant denied any
participation in the crime in question, and attempted to show that the
money found in his possession had been won by him by playing<em> monte</em>,
but it clearly appears that this defense of the accused was a mere
fabrication, and it was rightly rejected by the trial judge. As P218.50
or a part of the stolen money was found in the possession of the
defendant, and as he was unable to give any satisfactory explanation as
to how he came into possession of it, the trial court was justified in
finding that he had stolen not only the sum found in his possession,
but the total sum lost by Uy Chay Hing amounting to P2,063.74.</p>
  <p>
It appears that the defendant entered the store of Uy Chay Hing by
prying the door out of the groove in which the lower extremity of it
was placed, and then pushing it inward. Signs of the instrument used by
the defendant were found on the door. As we have already stated, the
three drawers containing a total of P100 were not locked, and the other
drawer containing P1,963.74 was locked, but it was opened by the
defendant with the key which the offended party had left in the room.
The question then is whether the crime committed by the defendant under
those circumstances was robbery or theft.</p>
  <p> The defendant
opened the drawer containing most of the money by making use of the
owner's key which the defendant had stolen, but the defendant had
already entered the house when he stole this key, and the fact that he
opened the money drawer by using this stolen key did not convert the
crime into robbery.</p>
  <p>    Did the prying open of the door in the manner hereinabove indicated convert the taking of the money into robbery?</p>
  <p>    Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code reads, as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Art. 299. <em>Robbery in an inhabited house or public building or edifice devoted to worship</em>.—Any
armed person who shall commit robbery in an inhabited house or public
building or edifice devoted to religious worship, shall be punished by <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium period to <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its minimum period, of the value of the property taken shall exceed 250 pesos, and if—</p>
    <p>"(<em>a</em>) The malefactors shall enter the house or building in which the robbery was committed, by any of the following means:</p>
    <p>"1. Through an opening not intended for entrance or egress; </p>
    <p>"2. By breaking any wall, roof, or floor or breaking any door or window;</p>
    <p> "3. By using false keys, picklocks or similar tools;</p>
    <p> "4. By using any fictitious name or pretending the exercise of public authority;</p>
    <p>"Or if,</p>
    <p>"(<em>b</em>) The robbery be committed under any of the following circumstances:</p>
    <p>"1. By the breaking of doors, wardrobes, chests, or any other kind of locked or sealed furniture or receptacle;</p>
    <p> "2. By taking such furniture or objects away to be broken or forced open outside the place of the robbery.</p>
    <p>"When
the offenders do not carry arms, and the value of the property taken
exceeds 250 pesos, the penalty next lower in degree shall be imposed.</p>
    <p>"The same rule shall be applied when the offenders are armed, but the value of the property taken does not exceed 250 pesos.</p>
    <p>"When
said offenders do not carry arms and the value of the property taken
does not exceed 250 pesos, they shall suffer the penalty prescribed in
the two next preceding paragraphs, in its minimum period.</p>
    <p>"If
the robbery be committed in one of the dependencies of an inhabited
house, public building, or building dedicated to religious worship, the
penalties next lower in degree than those prescribed in this article
shall be imposed."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The accused was charged with a violation of (<em>a</em>) 2 and (<em>b</em>) 1 of article 299 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
  <p>    (<em>b</em>)
1 refers to the breaking of doors, wardrobes, chests, or any other kind
of locked or sealed furniture or receptacle within the house, and does
not relate to the means made use of in entering the house. It is not
applicable in the present case.</p>
  <p>    The Spanish text of (<em>a</em>)
2 is as follows: "Por rompimiento de pared, techo o suelo, o fractura
de puerta o ventana." The words "fractura de puerta o ventana" clearly
mean "the breaking of a door or window", and imply more than the mere
forcing open of a door or window. If the defendant had forced open a
window and entered in that way, he would of course be guilty of robbery
because of having entered the house through an opening not intended for
entrance; but in the case at bar the defendant entered by forcing open
the door by means of some instrument. It was neither alleged nor proved
that the door was broken. The accused did not enter the store by any of
the means specified in article 299, and we are therefore of the opinion
that the crime committed by him was theft.</p>
  <p> The aggravating
circumstances of dwelling and nocturnity were present in the commission
of the crime. It being alleged and proved that the defendant was a
habitual delinquent, his prior convictions should not be taken into
account for the purpose of increasing the principal penalty. The
penalty applicable to the defendant is therefore the maximum degree of <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum and medium periods, and the defendant is sentenced to suffer four years and two months of <em>prision correccional</em>,
and to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P1,845.24, the value
of the money not recovered, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, which shall not exceed one-third of the principal penalty,
and to pay the costs, and to suffer the additional penalty of thirteen
years, one month, and eleven days of <em>reclusion temporal</em> for
being a habitual delinquent, as imposed by the trial court. As thus
modified, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with the costs of
this instance against the appellant. </p>
