				<H3>THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, IN BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TARLAC ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
<p align="justify">The ground for this petition for a writ of certiorari is that 
the respondent court has exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the issuance of a 
writ of possession in cadastral proceeding No. 15 of the Court of First instance 
of Tarlac (G. L. R. O. Record No. 22), entitled the Director of Lands, 
applicant, vs. Juliana Abaya et al., claimants, in favor of the herein 
respondents surnamed Villa-Abrille, pending the approval in said court of the 
bill of exceptions presented by the petitioner, to perfect the appeal taken by 
him from the judgment of the respondent court decreeing the adjudication and 
registration of the parcels of land in question, and it is prayed that an order 
be issued requiring the respondent court to forward and certify to this court 
the record of the proceedings in question, in order that they may be reviewed by 
this court and that in due time the proceedings had and orders issued with 
respect to said writ of possession be held void and of no effect.</p>
<p align="justify">For the solution of the question of procedure raised in the 
present appeal, the following are the necessary and pertinent facts gathered 
from the pleadings and evidence in the record.</p>
<p align="justify">The Villa-Abrille brothers, respondents herein, applied for the 
confirmation and registration of their title to certain parcels of land in 
accordance with the Land Registration Law, which originated proceeding No. 369 
(G. L. R. O. Record No. 14366). During the pendency of said registration 
proceeding, cadastral proceeding No. 15 was instituted in the Court of First 
Instance of Tarlac (G. L. R. O. Record No. 225), in which the Director of Lands 
was the applicant and Juliana Abaya and others, the claimants, and which 
included the two parcels of land covered by said application, which were also 
claimed by the same parties in the aforesaid registration proceeding, each party 
alleging to have been in possession of the same. Both cases having been jointly 
heard and submitted for decision, the presiding judge of the Court of First 
Instance of Tarlac applied for a vacation.</p>
<p align="justify">While said proceedings were in this state, the justice of the 
peace of the capital of Tarlac, exercising the jurisdiction delegated to him by 
the Judge of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, and upon petition of the 
Director of Lands, issued a writ of preliminary injunction <em>ex parte</em> 
against the herein respondents, the Villa-Abrille brothers, claimants in said 
proceedings, forbidding them to enter upon said lands. Said respondents 
immediately moved for the dissolution of the said injunction, but this petition 
was denied by the court, which, however, ordered those represented by the 
Director of Lands, to give a bond of P12,000 in order that said injunction might 
stand.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the return of the Judge of the Court of First Instance 
from his vacation, the said respondents, the Villa-Abrille brothers, filed 
another motion for the dissolution of the injunction, with a complaint for 
indemnity of damages. After the proper evidence had been introduced, the Court 
of First Instance of Tarlac rendered judgment in favor of said respondents 
awarding them damages, and vacating the writ of preliminary injunction issued on 
April 30, 1927, by the justice of the peace of the capital, the Villa-Abrilles 
entering upon the possession of the land in question. In order to avoid being 
disturbed in the possession of said land, the aforementioned respondents 
Villa-Abrille applied for a writ of possession, which was granted by the lower 
court, a decree being issued on May 11, 1928, ordering that the possession of 
the lands adjudicated to them in the judgment rendered in the cadastral 
proceeding be given them, notwithstanding the appeal taken from said judgment, 
unless the opponents gave a bond in the sum of P7,000. Counsel for the Director 
of Lands took exception to this ruling and filed a motion for reconsideration, 
which was denied by the court.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the facts just related, the question arises as to 
whether or not the respondent court exceeded its powers in issuing a writ 
ordering that the petitioners be placed in the possession of the lands to which 
a decree of confirmation and registration of title had been issued in their 
favor, which was excepted to by the opponents, who appealed and presented a bill 
of exceptions, the approval of which is still pending.</p>
<p align="justify">The pertinent part of section 17 of Act No. 496, as amended by 
section 3 of Act No. 1680, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 17. The Court of Land Registration, in all matters over 
which it has jurisdiction, may enforce its orders, judgments, or decrees in the 
same manner as orders, judgments, and decrees are enforced in the Courts of 
First Instance, including a writ of possession directing the governor or sheriff 
of any province, or the sheriff of the City of Manila, to place the applicant in 
possession of the property covered by a decree of the court in his favor; * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The petitioner maintains that this legal provision does not 
authorize the issuance of a writ of possession except when there is a final 
decree of registration and not a mere confirmation of title subject to an 
appeal, and that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relative to the 
execution of judgments are inapplicable to the writ of possession in 
registration cases, citing in support of this contention the case of Manlapas 
and Tolentino vs. Llorente (48 Phil., 298), wherein the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The law has not made applicable to the writ of possession 
provided for in section 17 of Act No. 496 and its amendments, the provisions of 
the Code of Civil Procedure regarding execution of judgments."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In said case, the precise questions raised were whether the 
successor of an applicant in whose favor a decree of registration had been 
issued can ask for the issuance of a writ of possession after five years had 
elapsed since said decree had become final, and whether the right to ask for the 
execution of said decree through the issuance of a writ of possession had 
prescribed.</p>
<p align="justify">When this court said, in the above-quoted decision, that the 
provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure with respect to the execution of 
judgments are inapplicable to the writ of possession, it referred to the time 
within which it can be issued, and not to whether or not it can be issued before 
the expiration of the period assigned for the filing of the bill of 
exceptions.</p>
<p align="justify">As to whether or not the word "decree" used in the legal 
provision above quoted, refers to the final decree of registration, said legal 
provision does not exactly say so. The English text of section 38 of Act No. 496 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 38. If the court after hearing finds that the applicant 
has title as stated in his application, and proper for registration, a decree of 
confirmation and registration shall be entered. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And the Spanish text of the same law is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"ART. 38. Si despues de la vista el tribunal estimare que el 
titulo del solicitante es tal y como lo manifiesta en la solicitud y que se 
puede registrar, dictara el decreto correspondiente que lo legalice y se 
procedera a hacer la inscripcion. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It may be deduced from both texts that the word "decree" refers 
not only to the registration but also to the confirmation of the title.</p>
<p align="justify">Paragraph 2 of section 10 of Act No. 2347, entitled "An Act 
providing for the judicial reorganization of the Courts of First Instance and of 
the Court of Land Registration," provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 10 * * * * * * *</p>
<p align="justify">"In the dispatch of registration cases, the rules and 
provisions contained in Act Numbered Four Hundred and ninety-six, the Land 
Registration Act, as amended, shall be applied, unless otherwise provided by 
this Act. In all matters of procedure not provided in said Act, the rules and 
provisions contained in the Code of Procedure in civil actions and special 
proceedings shall be applied in so far as the same may be 
applicable."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">If, as has been said, the word "decree," used in section 17 of 
Act No. 496, as amended by section 3 of Act No. 1680 quoted above, is used in 
section 38 of said Act No. 496, in connection with the confirmation as well as 
registration of title, and if said section 17 of Act No. 496, as amended, does 
not limit the use of the said word "decree" to the registration, it must be 
taken in its general sense and applied, not only to the registration, but also 
to the confirmation of title. If this is so, the provisions and rules contained 
in the Code of Civil Procedure, especially those in section 144 of said Code, 
are applicable to the issuance of writs of possession.</p>
<p align="justify">The only legal provision which seemed in conflict with this 
conclusion is that contained in section 14 of Act No. 496, as amended by section 
4 of Act No. 1108, the pertinent part of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 4. Section fourteen of said Act is hereby repealed and a 
new section fourteen is hereby inserted, to read as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 14. Every order, decision, and decree of the Court of 
Land Registration may be reviewed by the Supreme Court in the same manner as an 
order, decision, decree, or judgment of a Court of First Instance might be 
reviewed, and for that purpose sections one hundred and forty-one, one hundred 
and forty-two, one hundred and forty-three, four hundred and ninety-six, four 
hundred and ninetyseven (except that portion thereof relating to assessors), 
four hundred and ninety-nine, five hundred, five hundred and one, five hundred 
and two, five hundred and three, five hundred and four, five hundred and five, 
five hundred and six, five hundred and seven, five hundred and eight, five 
hundred and nine, five hundred and eleven, five hundred and twelve, five hundred 
and thirteen, five hundred and fourteen, five hundred and fifteen, five hundred 
and sixteen, and five hundred and seventeen of Act Numbered One hundred and 
ninety, entitled 'An Act providing a Code of Procedure in civil actions and 
special proceedings in the Philippine Islands,' are made applicable to all the 
proceedings of the Court of Land Registration and to a review thereof by the 
Supreme Court, except as otherwise provided in this section. * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It will be seen that in enumerating in said section, the 
sections of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the revision by this court 
of any order, judgment, or decree of the Court of Land Registration, section 144 
of the Code of Civil Procedure mentioned above was omitted. Upon careful 
examination of the purpose of said section, it will be noted that the same 
refers to the revision of the orders, judgments and decrees of the Court of Land 
Registration. For such revision, the provisions of section 141 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure defining exceptions, are necessary; of section 142, which 
establish the manner in which they are to be presented; of section 143 which 
provide for the manner in which bills of exceptions are to be perfected; of 
section 496 which gives the procedure to be followed in the Supreme Court; of 
section 497 which gives the questions of law to be reviewed; of section 499, 
which provides how a judge who fails to certify bills of exceptions may be 
compelled to do so; of section 500 which enumerates the cases wherein bills of 
exceptions must be dismissed; of section 501, which prescribes how incomplete 
records are to be amended; of section 502 on the effect of dismissing a bill of 
exceptions; of section 503 which provides that a judgment is not to be reversed 
on technical grounds; of section 504 on the power of the Supreme Court to 
designate another judge to hold a new trial of the case; of section 505 on the 
procedure to be followed in the new trial; of section 506 on the remission of a 
certified copy of the judgment to the Court of First Instance; of section 507 on 
the notification of the judgment by the clerk of the Court of First Instance; of 
section 508 on the remission to the Court of First Instance of a certified copy 
of the Supreme Court's decision; of section 509 relative to the excepting party 
who is not entitled to the reversal with respect to another party; of section 
511 referring to extraordinary orders to be enforced by the lower courts; of 
section 512 referring to the printing of the bill of exceptions; of section 513 
referring to the procedure in case of default caused by fraud, accident, or 
mistake; of section 514 referring to the procedure relating to writs of 
certiorari; of section 515 referring; to the procedure relative to mandamus; of 
section 516 referring to procedure in prohibition proceedings; of section 517 
referring to preliminary injunctions in proceedings relating to certiorari, 
mandamus and prohibition.</p>
<p align="justify">It will be seen that all these sections of the Code of Civil 
Procedure refer strictly to the requisites and necessary procedure for the 
revision through an appeal as well as through certiorari, mandamus and 
prohibition of the orders, judgments and decrees of the Court of Land 
Registration.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, in registration proceedings, whether ordinary or 
cadastral, the only question involved is the claimant's or applicant's title, 
the confirmation and registration of which are sought, and the review of a 
decree rendered to that effect has no other object than to see if said judicial 
order is in accordance with the facts proven and the law.</p>
<p align="justify">The power conferred upon the court by section 144 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure that, for special reasons appearing in the bill of 
exceptions, and before the expiration of the term for the filing thereof, it may 
order that the execution of the judgment be not suspended, is not strictly a 
requisite or rule of necessary procedure for the review of an order, judgment or 
decree of a Court of Land Registration; hence it was not included in the 
enumeration of the sections of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to the 
review of the orders, judgments and decrees of said court, contained in section 
14 of Act No. 496, as amended by Act No. 1108.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Soriano vs. Aquino (31 Phil., 176, 180), this 
court held section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to land 
registration cases in solving the question raised by the appellant relative to 
the requirement of the bond for the suspension of the issuance of a writ of 
possession before the expiration of the period for the filing of the bill of 
exceptions, in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Notwithstanding the provision that the filing of a bill of 
exceptions shall stay execution of the judgment until the final determination of 
the action, it is also within the discretion of the court, according to section 
144 of the Code of Civil Procedure to require as a condition of a stay of 
execution that a bond shall be given reasonably sufficient to secure the 
performance of the judgment appealed from in case it be affirmed in part or 
wholly. The trial court has not, therefore, incurred the fifth error specified 
in appellant's brief, with reference to requiring the filing of the bond 
mentioned in the order of the court of August 11, 1913."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">As to the contention that the exercise of the right to obtain 
the confirmation and registration of a title is not an "action" as this word is 
defined in section 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure and as used in section 144 
of the same Code, which makes this section inapplicable to ordinary registration 
or cadastral proceedings, it suffices to cite this court's decision in the case 
of Lopez Castelo vs. Director of Lands (48 Phil., 589), the first paragraph of 
the syllabus of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"LAND REGISTRATION; ACTION 'IN REM'; CONCLUSIVENESS OF 
DECREE.—A land registration proceeding is in the nature of a suit <em>in 
rem</em>; the decree entered therein operates directly on the land and, in the 
absence of fraud, is 'conclusive upon and against all persons' (sec. 1, Act No. 
496) though they may not have received actual notice of the proceedings."</p>
<p align="center">*******</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is also contended that section 144 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, above cited, refers to the execution of a judgment and not of a 
decree, and that a decree is not a judgment. In answer to this it is sufficient 
to cite what this court said in the case of Government of the Philippine Islands 
vs. Abural (39 Phil., 996, 1001), which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">*******</p>
<p align="justify">"After trial in a cadastral case, three actions are taken. The 
first adjudicates ownership in favor of one of the claimants. This constitutes 
the decision—the judgment—the decree of the court, and speaks in a judicial 
manner.</p>
<p align="center">* * *"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Moreover, public order and the interests of the parties demand 
that once a judgment of confirmation of title has been rendered, the successful 
party's interest be protected from any damage which the defeated party may cause 
him by remaining in the possession to which the successful party is entitled by 
virtue of his title and of the court's decree confirming it, unless said 
defeated party secures the successful party from said damage.</p>
<p align="justify">For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion, and so hold, 
that section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable to the execution 
of decrees of confirmation of title through the issuance, for special reasons 
which must appear in the bill of exceptions, of a writ of possession before the 
expiration of the period for the filing of said bill.</p>
<p align="justify">By virtue whereof, the remedy sought is denied and the writ of 
preliminary injunction issued is hereby dissolved, without express pronouncement 
as to costs. So ordered.</p> <em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</em> 
and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
