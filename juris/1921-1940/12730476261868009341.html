				<H3>IN RE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED GABINA MEDINA. ALEJANDRO SAMIA, ADMINISTRATOR AND APPELLANT, VS. IRENE MEDINA ET AL., OPPONENT AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This refers to a motion filed by the appellees praying for the dismissal of 
the appeal taken by Alejandro Samia, as administrator of the testamentary estate 
of the late Gabina Medina, from an order of the Court of First Instance of 
Pampanga granting the motion for the reopening of proceedings for the probate of 
the aforementioned decedent's will, setting aside the order of allowance of the 
will, and ordering a new trial.
<p>The motion for dismissal is based upon the contention that the order appealed 
from is interlocutory and therefore not appealable. The appellant opposes this 
motion upon the ground that the order, granting the petition for the reopening 
of the proceedings for the allowance of the will, is final and therefore 
appealable. The issue then is, whether an order granting a motion to reopen 
proceedings upon a will, under section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is 
interlocutory and therefore unappealable, or, final and therefore 
appealable.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of similarity between an order granting a motion for a 
new trial based upon "accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not 
have guarded against" under section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and an 
order granting a motion for a new trial based upon "mistake, inadvertence, 
surprise, or excusable neglect," under section 113 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, as both set aside the judgment, order, or proceeding complained of; 
both call for a new trial, and in both the injured party may question the order 
granting the motion for the new trial upon appeal from the new judgment rendered 
upon the merits of the case. The only fundamental difference lies in this, that 
while the judgment, order, or proceeding coming under section 145 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure is not final, that coming under section 113 is final. But this 
does not alter the nature or effect of the order granting the new trial, for 
this order does not put an end to the litigation in the sense that the party 
injured thereby has no other remedy short of appeal; he may question the 
propriety of the new trial on appeal from an adverse judgment rendered after 
such trial.</p>
<p>In a long line of decisions this court has ruled that an order granting a 
motion for a new trial under section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure is 
interlocutory, and therefore, not appealable. (Veloso <em>vs.</em> Pacheco, 1 
Phil., 271; Gruindrod <em>vs.</em> Lizarraga Hermanos, 1 Phil., 515; Behn, Meyer 
&amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Mitchell, 7 Phil., 420; Garcia <em>vs.</em> Balanao, 8 
Phil., 465; Limpangco <em>vs.</em> Mercado, 10 Phil., 508; Smith <em>vs.</em> 
Mijares, 23 Phil., 619; Santa Ana <em>vs.</em> Santa Ana, 28 Phil., 65; Soriano 
<em>vs.</em> Aquino, 31 Phil., 176.)</p>
<p>It is true that the courts of appeal of the State of California, interpreting 
that portion of section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the state, from 
which our section IIS is taken, have uniformly held such orders to be 
appealable, for the reason that the order or judgment sought to be annulled is 
already final. (Magee <em>vs.</em> Superior Court, 10 Cal. App., 154, 161; Davis 
<em>vs.</em> Superior Court, 184 Cal., 691; Livermore vs. Campbell, 52 Cal., 75, 
77; Moorse <em>vs.</em> Thompson, 138 Cal., 23-27; Nicoll <em>vs.</em> Weldon, 
130 Cal., 666-668; Glenn Will <em>vs.</em> Lyttle Creek etc., 100 Cal., 544); 
but this court laid down the following doctrine in Escudero and Marasigan 
<em>vs.</em> Esguerra (48 Phil., 511)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Land Registration; Review of Final Decree; Order Reopening Case and Setting 
it Down for Hearing, Merely Interlocutory.—A tract of land was registered in the 
name of the appellees and final decree entered. The appellant claimed a portion 
of the tract, and presented a petition for review on the ground of fraud. Upon 
hearing, the court on June 8, 1923, reopened the case stating in its order that 
the registration has been obtained by fraud and directing the appellant to file 
an adverse claim in the land registration case. Upon filing the adverse claim 
the case was set for trial upon the merits of the case. After receiving the 
evidence of both parties the court in March, 1924, rendered a decision revoking 
the order reopening the case and directed that a certificate of title be issued 
in conformity with the original decree. Held; that the order of June 8, 1923, 
reopening the case, was merely interlocutory and not a final adjudication of the 
ultimate rights of the parties, and that the court did not err in revoking it by 
the final decision." </p></blockquote>
<p>In the case just cited, there was not only a final judgment but a final 
decree as well, issued pursuant thereto, and yet the order granting the motion 
for a new trial and setting aside the decree was held to be interlocutory, and 
therefore not appealable.</p>
<p>If there is no difference in point of effect between an order granting a 
motion for a new trial under section 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure and an 
order under section 113 of the Code, there is no legal or logical reason why the 
first should be deemed interlocutory and therefore unappealable, and the second 
final and therefore appealable.</p>
<p>Between an order denying a motion for a new trial under section 145 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, which this court has Held to be interlocutory and hence 
unappealable (Co-Yengco <em>vs.</em> Reyes, 4 Phil., 709; Benedicto <em>vs.</em> 
De la Rama, 3 Phil., 34; Bryan, Landon Co. <em>vs.</em> American Bank, 5 Phil., 
672; Artadi Co. <em>vs.</em> Chu Baco, 8 Phil., 677), and an order denying a 
motion for a new trial under section 113 of the Code, which this court held to 
be final, and therefore, appealable (Philippine Manufacturing Co. and Government 
of the Philippine Islands <em>vs.</em> Cabangis, 49 Phil., 107; Philippine 
Manufacturing Co. <em>vs.</em> Imperial, 47 Phil., 810; Pecson <em>vs.</em> 
Coronel, 43 Phil., 358; Gustilo <em>vs.</em> Sian, 53 Phil., 155) there is this 
fundamental difference:</p>
<p>In the first case, since the judgment sought in the motion for a new trial to 
be annulled is not final, the question of the denial of this motion may be 
raised on appeal from such judgment; in the second, since the judgment sought in 
the motion for a new trial to be annulled is already final, there is no other 
remedy than an appeal from the order denying the motion, in order that the 
question as to its correctness can be raised.</p>
<p>There is this same difference in legal effect between an order granting and 
another denying a motion for a new trial under section 113 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, and therefore, by analogy, the doctrine regarding the appealability 
of an order granting a motion for a new trial under section 113 of said Code 
cannot be applied to an order denying said motion.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we are of opinion, and so hold, that an order 
granting a motion for a new trial under section 113 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure is interlocutory, and therefore, unappealable.</p>
<p>By virtue whereof, the motion for dismissal is granted. So ordered.</p>
