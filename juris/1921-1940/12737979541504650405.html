<p>An information was tiled against the defendant in the Court of First Instance 
of Surigao, the charging part of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"That on or about the 31st of August, 1921, in the municipality of Surigao, 
Province of Surigao, Philippine Islands, and within the jurisdiction of this 
court, the aforesaid accused, being a Government officer and employee, to wit, 
municipal treasurer of said municipality and deputy provincial treasurer, and in 
charge, by reason of his office, of the public funds, did willfully unlawfully, 
and criminally, and with abuse of his official position and for the purpose of 
defrauding the Government, falsify his cashbook by entering thereon the sum of 
P3,277.88 as paid to the provincial treasury under receivable accounts, instead 
of P277.88, which was the true amount paid by him, said accused knowing it to be 
false, and that the truth was that he (the accused) on the date and in the place 
aforementioned willfully, unlawfully, and criminally and abusing of his position 
and for the purpose of defrauding, took away the amount of P3,000, after making 
said entry, which he misappropriated and converted to his own use and benefit, 
to the damage of the Government, particularly of the municipal treasury of the 
aforesaid municipality, the accused having caused all the vouchers of said entry 
to disappear in order to avoid the discovery of its falsity and secure the 
impunity of this crime. Contrary to law, specially section 2672 of the Revised 
Administrative Code and article 300 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 
2712, in connection with article 89 of said Penal Code."</p>
<p>To this information the defendant filed the following demurrer :</p>
<p>"Come now the undersigned attorneys on behalf of the accused and demur to the 
information on the ground of multiplicity of crimes alleged which are separately 
punished by our penal laws."</p>
<p>It was overruled and as a result of a trial the defendant was found guilty of 
malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents as 
defined in and penalized by section 2672 of the Administrative Code, in 
connection with article 300 of the Penal CJode, and sentenced to ten years and 
one day of <em>prision mayor</em> and to pay a fine of 12,500 <em>pesetas</em>, 
with the legal accessories, and to indemnify the municipality in the sum of 
P2,000, and to pay the costs. From this judgment the defendant appealed and 
assigns the following errors:</p>
<p>"I. The lower court erred in finding and concluding upon the evidence that 
the defendant and appellant was guilty of the crime charged in the information 
and in rendering sentence of conviction.</p>
<p>"II. The lower court erred in refusing to render a judgment of acquittal 
exonerating defendant and appellant upon the law and the evidence.</p>
<p>"III. The lower court erred in overruling defendant and appellant's demurrer 
to the information."</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Under our view error No. 3 is the only one which is material to this 
decision. The information charges, first, that the defendant "did willfully, 
unlawfully, and criminally, and with abuse of his official position and for the 
purpose of defrauding the Government, falsify his cashbook by entering thereon 
the sum of P3,277.88 as paid to the provincial treasury under receivable 
accounts, instead of P277.88, which was the true amount paid by him." Standing 
alone it charges the defendant with falsification of a public document, which in 
itself is a specific crime. The information further charges that the defendant 
did "willfully, unlawfully, and criminally, and abusing of his position and for 
the purpose of defrauding, take away the amount of P3,000 after making said 
entry, which he misappropriated and converted to his own use and benefit, to the 
damage of the Government, particularly the municipal treasury of the aforesaid 
municipality." Standing alone that portion of the information is a specific 
charge "that after making said entry he took and appropriated the P3,000 to his 
own use," which under the law is a separate and distinct crime. The information 
further alleges that the defendant "having caused all the vouchers of said entry 
to disappear in order to avoid the discovery of its falsity and secure the 
impunity of this crime." That portion of the information charges the defendant 
with the loss and destruction of a public document for the purpose of concealing 
a crime which within itself is also a separate and distinct crime.</p>
<p>Section 11 of General Order No. 58 provides:</p>
<p>"A complaint or information must charge but one offense; except only in those 
cases in which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for various allied 
offences." Section 21 provides that "the defendant may demur to the complaint or 
information, when it appears on the face thereof that more than one offense is 
charged."</p>
<p>In the instant case, a demurrer upon such ground was promptly filed. It is 
true that in the argument on the demurrer, the defendant did not point out or 
specify that the information charges the defendant with the conversion of the 
P3,000 to his own use, but the specific grounds of the demurrer were "that more 
than one offense is charged," and it called the attention to that fact of both 
the prosecution and the trial court, and the information upon its face charges 
three separate and distinct crimes, each of which is complete within itself.</p>
<p>The law against charging more than one offense in an information is 
fundamental, and when properly challenged by a demurrer, as in this case, should 
be sustained by the trial court and an opportunity given to amend.</p>
<p>Without passing upon the guilt or innocence of the defendant and without 
prejudice to the rights of the prosecution, the case is reversed and remanded, 
with leave to the prosecution to file any further pleas or information. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Villamor,</em> and <em>Ostrand, JJ.,</em> concur. </p>
<p><strong>ROMUALDEZ, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>AVACEÃ‘A, 
J.</strong>, concurring and dissenting:</p>
<p>I concur in that the complaint is defective. I dissent from the disposition 
of the case for I believe that the evidence is insufficient to convict the 
accused who must, therefore, be acquitted.</p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J</strong>., dissenting:</p>
<p>My vote is to affirm the judgment on the merits.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed and case remanded with instructions.</p>
