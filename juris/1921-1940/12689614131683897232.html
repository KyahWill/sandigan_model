				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought&nbsp; to reverse a judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros,&nbsp; finding the appellant, Sia Lianting, guilty of the offense of arson&nbsp; with homicide, and sentencing him to undergo <span style="font-style: italic;">cadera perpetua,</span> with&nbsp; the&nbsp; accessories prescribed by&nbsp; law,&nbsp; to&nbsp; indemnify (jointly and&nbsp; severally with&nbsp; Quieng Ket)&nbsp; various persons, who had been damnified by the fire, in the following amounts, to Wit, Quieng Bungco&nbsp; in the amount of P18,000,&nbsp; Enrique Magalona in the amount of P12,000,&nbsp; Rufo Yorac in the amount of P11,000,&nbsp; Jose Sajo in the amount of P20,000,&nbsp; Gregorio&nbsp; Sajo&nbsp; in the amount of P15,000,&nbsp; and Wong Hang&nbsp; On&nbsp; &amp; Co. in&nbsp; the amount of P10,000,&nbsp; and requiring him to pay one-half of the costs of prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; coaccused, one Quieng Ket, (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Tuñga), pleaded guilty in open court and was sentenced before the proof against the present appellant was submitted. Quieng Ket did not appeal.<br><br>It appears that&nbsp; at about 1 o'clock a. m. on the night of November 19, 1925, a fire&nbsp; of incendiary origin&nbsp; broke out in the house of Quieng Bungco, located in the municipality of Saravia, Province of Occidental Negros.&nbsp;&nbsp; The building was&nbsp; so&nbsp; quickly&nbsp; consumed&nbsp; that a son of Quieng Bungco, Tuñga by name, of the age&nbsp; of 11 years, was unable to make his escape and was burned to death.&nbsp; The fire also&nbsp; spread to adjacent properties and&nbsp; destroyed various buildings, of ownership and value as indicated in the indemnifying clause of the appealed decision.<br><br>&nbsp;Quieng Bungco,&nbsp; prior to&nbsp; this fire, was a prosperous Chinese merchant&nbsp; in&nbsp; Saravia.&nbsp; In times past&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant, Lianting,&nbsp; had&nbsp; been associated in business&nbsp; with&nbsp; Quieng Bungco, but several years ago they severed relations, since which event Lianting has not prospered.&nbsp; Owing to some misunderstanding&nbsp; between&nbsp; the two, mingled perhaps&nbsp; with envy, Lianting entertained deep resentment against&nbsp; Quieng Bungco&nbsp; and on more than&nbsp; one occasion had threatened to take vengeance upon him.&nbsp; One Florentino&nbsp; Javellana testified that Lianting offered&nbsp; him&nbsp; money to&nbsp; burn Bungco's store.&nbsp; Rufo Yorac, a councillor of the municipality, testified that shortly before the fire&nbsp; the appellant had made threats in Yorac's&nbsp; presence&nbsp; against Bungco, with the result that Yorac's fears were aroused&nbsp; and he began to observe the doings of Lianting with suspicion.&nbsp; Among the Chinese subjects living in Saravia prior to the fire was Quieng Ket (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Tunga),&nbsp; an indolent and&nbsp; worthless creature,&nbsp; who lived&nbsp; with&nbsp; his&nbsp; brother-in-law,&nbsp; Alfredo Pedrajas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a short while before&nbsp; the fire, Yorac says he had seen Lianting in the company of Tuñga&nbsp; and Pedrajas under suspicious circumstances, a fact which he called to the&nbsp; attention of the police.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proof shows that Lianting had&nbsp; a devoted querida, named Isabel Jamilaren,&nbsp; at whose&nbsp; house Lianting was a frequent visitor.&nbsp; Two or three days before the fire occurred Lianting called upon&nbsp; Isabel and told&nbsp; her that a can of gasoline would&nbsp; be&nbsp; brought&nbsp; there by Pedrajas, and that later it would be taken from the place by Quieng Ket. The proof further shows that at about that time Pedrajas was&nbsp; sent&nbsp; to the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">tienda </span>of Lianting&nbsp; upon an&nbsp; errand for Quieng Ket.&nbsp; Upon the arrival&nbsp; of Pedrajas at the&nbsp; store of Lianting, the latter gave Pedrajas&nbsp; the sum of P5 and told him to go to the store&nbsp; of&nbsp; Yap Tico and purchase a can of gasoline to be taken by him to the house of Isabel Jamilaren.&nbsp; This errand was performed, the&nbsp; gasoline being placed on the upper porch (<span style="font-style: italic;">azotea</span>) of Isabel's&nbsp; house.&nbsp; On the day&nbsp; preceding the fire, Lianting again called upon Isabel in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; ascertain&nbsp; whether the can&nbsp; of&nbsp; gasoline had been taken there by Pedrajas according to instructions. Finding it there Lianting told the&nbsp; woman that&nbsp; Quieng Ket would call for it.&nbsp; Accordingly on&nbsp; the night&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fire Quieng&nbsp; Ket&nbsp; came&nbsp; and removed the gasoline.&nbsp; Although Isabel did not see Quieng Ket when he came on this mission, she recognized his voice.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fire had been set, Quieng Ket&nbsp; carried the empty can with him from the scene of action, and as&nbsp; he ran away he was seen by a policeman who recovered the empty can.<br><br>After the fire occurred Rufo Yorac, remembering Lianting's threats against Bungco, came to the conclusion that Lianting was probably the author&nbsp; or instigator of the fire. Yorac accordingly went to Lianting's place of business and charged him with the&nbsp; offense,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the result&nbsp; that a personal encounter between the two resulted.&nbsp; After Lianting had been&nbsp; arrested and while Quieng Ket was yet at large, Lianting, being in jail,&nbsp; spoke to a policeman, named Gabriel Arcangel, and proposed to pay him&nbsp; a reward in money if he would&nbsp; convey&nbsp; to Pedrajas a message to the effect that Pedrajas should inform Quieng Ket to get away.<br><br>When Quieng Ket was&nbsp; arrested&nbsp; he made a confession in which he told precisely how he had&nbsp; perpetrated the crime at the instigation of Lianting and upon promise of a reward by the&nbsp; latter, which he said had not been&nbsp; paid.&nbsp; After Quieng&nbsp; Ket had been convicted upon his separate plea of guilty, the attorney for the prosecution placed him on the stand as a witness against Sia Lianting.&nbsp; His testimony, however, was disappointing to the prosecution as, though still admitting his own guilt, he said that the crime had been committed on his own initiative,&nbsp; and without his being moved thereto by anyone.<br><br>The confession of Quieng Ket is of course not admissible in evidence against the appellant, but it is proper to say that Quieng&nbsp; Ket's story, as told upon the witness&nbsp; stand, with respect&nbsp; to the manner in which he got the P5 to purchase the gasoline, is a manifest fabrication,&nbsp; as the trial judge declared.<br><br>Upon the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; above stated, we have no hesitancy in saying that the guilt of the appellant as joint principal and coauthor by&nbsp; induction of&nbsp; this crime is fully&nbsp; established. We concede full credence to the testimony of Isabel Jamilaren, given under circumstances extremely trying to her, since she&nbsp; was speaking the words that would&nbsp; consign to prison a man who was the father of&nbsp; her&nbsp; children and to whom she was evidently devoted.&nbsp; The conduct of Lianting in procuring and placing the gasoline&nbsp; where it would be accessible to&nbsp; his agent is incompatible with the possibility of his&nbsp; innocence.&nbsp; His&nbsp; anxiety&nbsp; to get Quieng Ket out of the community before he should be arrested, as shown by the message which&nbsp; Lianting attempted to&nbsp; send&nbsp; through Gabriel&nbsp; Arcangel, indicates&nbsp; his guilty conscience.&nbsp; The enmity entertained by Lianting against Bungco supplies the necessary motive to&nbsp; the crime.<br><br>It results&nbsp; that the lower court committed no error in finding&nbsp; the appellant guilty; but as to the qualification of the offense, we are of the opinion that the judgment entered by the lower court requires modification.<br><br>The offense of arson committed in this case would have been punishable under article 549 of the Penal Code, if all of the ingredients&nbsp; of the offense there defined had been stated in the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; The information, however, contains&nbsp; no allegation that at the time&nbsp; the fire was set the accused knew it to be occupied by one or&nbsp; more persons. Knowledge of this fact on the part of the incendiary is a qualificative element in the offense&nbsp; defined in article 549, and without&nbsp; an&nbsp; allegation&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; fact, conviction under said&nbsp; article cannot be&nbsp; sustained (People <i>vs.</i> Macalma, 44 Phil., 170).&nbsp;&nbsp; The offense of arson charged in the information must therefore be penalized, in view of&nbsp; the amount of damage done, under subsection 2 of article 550 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; But the proof shows that the same act&nbsp; of arson resulted in homicide, as one of the&nbsp; occupants of&nbsp; Bungco's house was burned to death.&nbsp; This homicide is&nbsp; sufficiently charged in the information and the situation&nbsp; resulting from the concurrence of the two offenses must be dealt with under article 89- of the Penal Code, which prescribes that, in a&nbsp; combination of two or more crimes, when one&nbsp; offense is a&nbsp; necessary means for committing the other, only the penalty for the more serious crime&nbsp; shall be imposed, the same&nbsp; to be applied in its maximum degree.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; accordance with this&nbsp; provision, the appellant can only be sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years, <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal</span>, with the accessories prescribed&nbsp; in article 56&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Penal Code,<br><br>The appealed&nbsp; judgment must therefore be modified by substituting twenty years,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal,</span> with accessories for the <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena perpetua</span> imposed by the lower court.<br><br>With&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to the obligation of the appellant to indemnify the injured&nbsp; parties, the judgment&nbsp; will be&nbsp; affirmed, with costs,&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña,&nbsp; C. J., Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
