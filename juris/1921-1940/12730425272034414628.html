				<h4>
				G.R. No. 35763, March 18, 1932</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CANUTO TUZON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The information charges the appellant with the crime of homicide, and the 
Court of First Instance of Tayabas that tried the case, after due hearing, found 
the defendant guilty of the crime charged and sentenced him to fourteen years, 
eight months, and one day of <em>reclusion temporal,</em> the accessory 
penalties, P1,000 indemnity, and the costs.
<p>The above judgment is now assailed upon the ground that the trial court erred 
in giving credit to the sole testimony of Eulalio Rutaquio, and in not 
concluding that the case for the prosecution was weakened by the failure of the 
prosecuting attorney to present the witnesses listed in the information, which 
failure gives rise to a presumption adverse to the prosecution. It is also 
contended that the accused should have been given the benefit of a reasonable 
doubt.</p>
<p>We have examined the record and find nothing to justify a holding that the 
trial court erred in its findings of fact. The defense of alibi has not been 
established, for the evidence adduced to that end is insufficient and lacking in 
weight to overcome the convincing testimony of witness Eulalio Rutaquio.</p>
<p>With reference to the witnesses listed in the information, some of whom were 
not presented, there is nothing to show, or from which to infer that their 
testimony was absolutely necessary to establish the crime, inasmuch as the only 
eyewitness, besides the defendant and the deceased, has been produced and 
testified. Even if the omitted witnesses were eyewitnesses, which by no means 
appears, failure to bring them in to testify shall not of necessity give rise to 
the presumption as provided in section 334, No. 5, of the Code of Civil 
Procedure. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Gonzalez, 22 Phil., 325.) At any rate the 
testimony of the omitted witnesses would be simply corroborative evidence, and 
the presumption referred to does not apply to the suppression of merely 
corroborative evidence. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Dinola, 37 Phil., 797.)</p>
<p>As the crime and the defendant's guilt have been sufficiently proved, and 
there being no merit in the assignments of error made by the defense, the 
judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, 
Villa-Real,</em> and <em>Imperial, JJ.</em>, concur.<br></p></div>
