				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VICKERS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">The defendant appeals from a decision of the Court 
of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, finding him guilty of robbery and 
sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate sentence of not more than six 
years, ten months, and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> and not less 
than four months and one day of <em>arresto mayor,</em> and of attempted
 rape with physical injuries and to suffer therefor an indeterminate 
sentence of not more than four years, two months, and one day of <em>prision
 correccional</em> and not less than four months and one day of <em>arresto
 mayor,</em> to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P16, without 
subsidiary imprisonment in the case of robbery, but with subsidiary 
imprisonment, if he should be insolvent, in the case of the attempted 
rape, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and to pay the 
costs.
</p><p align="justify"> The attorney <em>de oficio </em>of the appellant 
contends that the lower court erred in not giving credit to the 
testimony of the witnesses for the defense to the effect that the 
defendant could not have committed the alleged crimes when it is alleged
 that they were perpetrated. We find no merit whatever in this 
contention.</p>
<p align="justify"> The evidence clearly shows that the defendant 
attempted to rape the offended woman at the time and in the manner 
alleged in the information, and that by means of violence he took from 
her "P4, and in so doing inflicted upon her physical injuries, which 
incapacitated her for labor for a month.</p>
<p align="justify"> This action was begun in the justice of the peace 
court of Bongabon on February 14, 1933, when Eugenio Rosal, a private in
 the 49th Company of the Philippine Constabulary, subscribed and swore 
to the complaint. It was alleged therein that the defendant taking 
advantage of the weakness of Eugenia Santiago took from her possession 
the sum of P4. To the foregoing allegation the following words were 
added: "* * * and voluntarily, maliciously, the said accused with intent
 to have carnal intercourse with Eugenia Santiago against her will and 
consent." The language quoted does not contain any verb. Nothing is 
therefore asserted.</p>
<p align="justify"> The case was remanded to the Court of First 
Instance, and on March 21,1933 the provincial fiscal filed an 
information charging the defendant with robbery and slight physical 
injuries accompanied by attempted rape, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "That on or about the 29th day of January, 1933, 
in the municipality of Bongabon, Province of Nueva Ecija, P. I., and 
within the jurisdiction of this court, the above-named accused Luis 
Mandia, with intent to have sexual inter Course with Eugenia Santiago, 
did by means of violence and intimidation and with lasciviousness 
voluntarily, maliciously, illegally and criminally embrace and drag down
 on the ground said Eugenia Santiago, put himself on her top, raise her 
skirt and try to introduce his penis into her genital organ but he could
 not do it because of her resistance, and said accused, while he was 
abusing of said Eugenia Santiago, did by means of violence and 
intimidation voluntarily, maliciously, illegally and criminally take, 
with intent to gain, the amount of P4, belonging to said Eugenia 
Santiago against her will, slight physical injuries which needed medical
 attendance to heal for less than 9 days and incapacitated her for labor
 for a like period of time having been caused unto her because of the 
violence dealt upon her by said accused on occasion of such robbery and 
attempted rape."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The attorney for the accused asked for the dismissal
 of the case on the ground that the crimes charged in the information 
were different from those imputed to the accused in the justice of the 
peace court. The Court of First Instance found that the crime of robbery
 with attempted rape was not clearly charged in the complaint, and that 
the accused was entitled to a preliminary investigation on the crimes 
alleged in the information. Thereupon the trial judge made a preliminary
 investigation, and finding there was probable cause ordered the case to
 be set for trial, and in due course the accused was tried and sentenced
 as herein above stated.</p>
<p align="justify"> Article 434 of the Penal Code provided that no 
penalty should be imposed for the crime of adultery except upon a 
complaint (<em>querella</em>) filed by the injured husband.</p>
<p align="justify"> Article 448 provided that the offense of seduction 
should not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by and in the 
name of (sino a instancia) the offended party or her parents, 
grandparents, or guardian, that it should be sufficient to authorize a 
prosecution for the offenses of rape and abduction with lewd designs 
that charges had been preferred by the offended party or by her parents,
 grandparents, or guardian, without the filing of a complaint by such 
person or persons; that if the person offended should be disqualified by
 reason of nonage or mental incapacity to maintain the suit, and should 
furthermore be absolutely destitute, having no parents, grandparents, 
brothers or sisters, guardian or curator, by whom the charge might be 
brought, such charge might be made by the prosecuting officer upon 
general information.</p>
<p align="justify"> Sections 3, 4, and 5 of General Orders, No. 58 read 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"> "SEC. 3. All public offenses triable in Courts of 
First Instance or in courts of similar jurisdiction, now established or 
that hereafter may be established, must be prosecuted by complaint or 
information.<br>
      <br>
"SEC. 4. A complaint is a sworn written statement made to a court or 
magistrate that a person has been guilty of a designated offense.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "SEC. 5. An information is an accusation in 
writing charging a person with a public offense, presented and signed by
 the promotor fiscal or his deputy and filed with the clerk of the 
court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Section 1 of Act No. 1773, enacted on October 11, 
1907, provided that after said date the crimes of <em>adulterio, 
estitrpro, rapto, violation, calumnia, </em>and <em>injuria, </em>as 
defined by the Penal Code of the Philippine Islands should be deemed to 
be public crimes and should be prosecuted in the same manner as are all 
other crimes defined by said Penal Code or by the Acts of the Philippine
 Commission: <em>Provided,</em> however, That no prosecution for the 
crimes of <em>adulterio, estupro, </em>or<em> injuria </em>committed 
against persons other than public officials or employees should be 
instituted except upon the complaint of the aggrieved person or of the 
parents, grandparents, or guardian of such person.</p>
<p align="justify"> Interpreting this provision of Act No. 1773, the 
Supreme Court held in the case of the United States <em>vs.</em> Narvas 
(14 Phil., 410), that in order to give the court jurisdiction over the 
person of the defendant and the subject matter of the action it is 
necessary in cases of <em>adulterio, estupro, </em>or <em>injuria </em>that
 the complaint be made and executed in writing by the offended party 
personally, if that person be competent to do so, and, if not, then by 
one of the persons named in the section in the order in which they are 
named therein. This ruling was reaffirmed in the case of the United 
States <em>vs.</em> Ortiz and Regalado (19 Phil., 174), notwithstanding 
the fact that the evidence showed that the offended husband had 
denounced the crime to the fiscal and requested him to file the 
complaint.</p>
<p align="justify"> It has been consistently held by this court as to 
the crimes mentioned in Act No. 1773 that if the complaint is not 
presented by the aggrieved person or by the parents, grandparents, or 
guardian of said person the court acquires no jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify"> Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code provides that 
the crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted except 
upon a complaint filed by the offended spouse (No puede procederse por 
adulterio, amancebamiento o concubinato sino en virtud de denuncia del 
c6nyuge agraviado); and that the offenses of seduction, abduction, rape 
or acts of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a 
complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or 
guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned 
by the above named persons, as the case may be (Tampoco puede procederse
 por causa de estupro, rapto, violaci6n o abusos deshonestos, sino en 
virtud de denuncia de la parte agraviada, o de sus padres, o abuelos o 
tutor, ni despues de haberse otorgado al ofensor, perd6n expreso por 
dichas partes, segun los casos).</p>
<p align="justify"> In accordance with the foregoing provisions of law 
and the decisions of this court, we are of the opinion that the crime of
 rape cannot be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended
 party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian. (Samilin <em>vs.</em> 
Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, 57 Phil., 298; People <em>vs.</em>
 Trinidad, 58 Phil., 163; where it was held that the information for 
attempted rape, which was not signed by the offended party, was 
insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court to hear and determine 
the charge therein made.)</p>
<p align="justify"> The acts complained of in the present case were 
committed on January 29, 1933, or subsequent to the date when the 
Revised Penal Code became effective. It is clear therefore that in this 
case the complaint could be filed only by the offended woman, who was of
 age. Since the original complaint, even if it had been in due form, was
 not filed by the offended party, and the appellant was prosecuted on an
 information filed by the provincial fiscal, the court acquired no 
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant or the subject matter of 
the action in so far as it related to the crime of attempted rape, and 
the conviction of the appellant for said crime must be set aside.</p>
<p align="justify"> The defendant is guilty of the crime of robbery with
 violence against persons. The physical injuries, which according to the
 information incapacitated the offended party for labor for less than 
nine days, are inherent in" the crime of robbery with violence against 
persons, and there being present in the commission of the crime the 
aggravating circumstances that the crime was committed in the nighttime 
and in an uninhabited place, the penalty, which is <em>prision 
correccional</em> to <em>prision mayor </em>in its medium period, must 
be imposed in the maximum degree.</p>
<p align="justify"> The accused was sentenced to indemnify the offended 
party in the sum of P16, or the P4 taken, plus the value of the offended
 party's earnings for a month; but it being alleged in the information 
that the offended party was incapacitated for less than nine days, she 
is not entitled to recover for the loss of earnings for a greater period
 than eight days at the rate of P12 a month, or a total of P7.20.</p>
<p align="justify"> The defendant is therefore sentenced to suffer six 
years, ten months, and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> and to 
indemnify the offended party in the sum of P7.20, without subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency and in accordance with the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law and the facts of the case the minimum 
sentence of the defendant is fixed at two years of prisidn correctional.
 (People <em><em>vs.</em></em> Mallari and Lao Yu, p. 400, post.)</p>
