				</CENTER>

<p align="center">STATEMENT</p>
<p align="justify">At all the times alleged, the plaintiff was and is now a 
foreign banking corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State 
of New York of the United States, and duly licensed to transact business in the 
Philippine Islands, with its branch office in the City of Manila, and, for 
brevity, it will be named and styled as the Bank. The defendant, Asuncion Nable 
Jose, is of legal age, unmarried, and a resident of the City of Manila, and will 
be known as Nable Jose. The defendant, Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., is a domestic 
corporation, with its principal office also in the City of Manila, and, for 
brevity, will be hereinafter referred to as the Lichauco Corporation.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff alleges that on December 17, 1921, the Lichauco 
Corporation was the registered owner of the haciendas known as "Sevitanan" and 
"Sapangbalen," specifically described in the complaint. That upon that date, the 
Lichauco Corporation was indebted to the Bank in the sura of P146,242.11, to 
which it made and executed a public document marked Exhibit A, which is attached 
to, and made a part of, the complaint, in and by which, and to secure the 
payment of that amount, it agreed to deliver to the Bank 37 1/2 per cent of all 
sugar coming from the said haciendas until the whole amount of the debt was 
fully paid, and that the contract was well known to the defendant Nable Jose. 
That at the time of the execution of Exhibit A, the Lichauco Corporation was 
under the exclusive management and control of Faustino Lichauco, whose brother, 
Zacarias Lichauco, is married to the sister of the defendant, Asuncion Nable 
Jose, and that the stockholders of the corporation were Faustino Lichauco, Luisa 
Fernandez, his wife, Cornelia B. Lichauco, Tomas Lichauco, his son, and Jose 
Barbaza, the bookkeeper, the last of whom held one share only to qualify him as 
a director. That upon the date in question, the Lichauco Corporation was 
indebted in large amounts to various firms, persons and corporations. That on 
January 16, 1922, said Faustino Lichauco, Luisa Fernandez, Cornelia B. Lichauco, 
Tomas Lichauco and Jose Barbaza illegally attempting to act for and on account 
of the Lichauco Corporation, and conspiring with the defendant Nable Jose, her 
sister Amparo Nable Jose, and Maria Corcuera, the widow of Galo Lichauco, 
deceased brother of said Faustino Lichauco, and for the purpose of defrauding 
the plaintiff and hindering and delaying it in the collection of its claim 
against the Lichauco Corporation, executed and caused to be recorded a simulated 
and fictitious deed to the defendant Nable Jose of that portion of the property 
described in clauses 1, 2 and 3 of paragraph II of the complaint, known as the 
"Sevitanan" and "Sapangbalen" <em>haciendas</em>. A copy of the deed is attached 
to, and made a part of the complaint marked Exhibit B.</p>
<p align="justify">That it is falsely recited therein that it was executed in 
consideration of P70,000 which was delivered to the Lichauco Corporation on 
August 2, 1920, as and from the proceeds of a loan for that amount obtained by 
the defendant Nable Jose from the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., 
Ltd., and which the Lichauco Corporation agreed to repay in installments of the 
same amounts and at the same time as those which she agreed to pay to the 
Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., Ltd. That the Lichauco Corporation has 
no other property from which the plaintiff can satisfy its claim. That the 
P70,000 was never delivered to the Lichauco Corporation, and that there was no 
consideration for Exhibit B. That at the time of the conveyance, the lands 
therein described were of the value of at least P300,000, and that the purchase 
price was and is grossly inadequate even if it had been paid by the defendant 
Nable Jose to the Lichauco Corporation. That Exhibit B was never executed by the 
Lichauco Corporation, and that it never sold and conveyed the property in 
question to the defendant Nable Jose. That on August 11, 1922, Nable Jose caused 
the deed in question to be registered with the register of property of the 
Province of Pampanga, and a certificate of title was issued in her favor No. 
454. That on October 26, 1922, the Lichauco Corporation having refused to 
deliver the sugar in accord with the terms and provisions of Exhibit A, 
plaintiff filed a complaint against the Lichauco Corporation in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila for the recovery of the P146,242.11 due and owing it 
from the Lichauco Corporation. That on January 24, 1923, it obtained a 
corresponding judgment for that amount against that corporation, with interest 
thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, but that execution was suspended 
for a period of three months. That on July 24, 1923, execution was issued 
against the property of the Lichauco Corporation, and plaintiff caused all of 
the right, title and interest of that corporation in and to the property 
described, to be levied upon and sold by the sheriff of the Province of 
Pampanga, at which sale the Bank bid in the property for P 70,000, but it was 
unable to register its deed in the registry of property of the Province of 
Pampanga, by reason of the fraudulent and illegal and simulated deed of 
conveyance to the defendant Nable Jose, which was previously recorded. That the 
conveyance to her constitutes a cloud upon plaintiff's title. That at the time 
of the sheriff's sale to the defendant, there was still due and unpaid on the 
judgment, the sum of P113,251.69, and that no part of it will be satisfied, 
unless the deed to the defendant Nable Jose is annulled and set aside, and the 
sheriff's deed to the Bank is recorded, for all of which the plaintiff prays for 
a corresponding judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">The Lichauco Corporation filed an answer in the nature of a 
general and specific denial.</p>
<p align="justify">October 11, 1923, the defendant Nable Jose filed her answer 
which was amended on April 30, 1926, in which she made a general and specific 
denial, and, as a special defense, alleges that the judgment obtained by the 
Bank against the Lichauco Corporation was obtained by collusion and a conspiracy 
between the Bank and the Lichauco Corporation, and that the actual debt is about 
P70,000, and, as a cross-complaint, alleges that for a valid consideration, 
Nable Jose acquired an undivided share equivalent to 23/25 of the rural estate 
described in the complaint and in the transfer certificate of title No. 454, 
issued in her name by the register of deeds of Pampanga. That the Bank does not 
have any right, title or interest in that land, and, as a counterclaim, she 
alleges the securing of the judgment by the Bank against the Lichauco 
Corporation, as alleged, the issuance of the writ of execution, in and by which 
the sheriff of Pampanga levied upon the state of Nable Jose in and to the real 
property in question, upon the pretext of attaching it as the property of the 
Lichauco Corporation. That by reason thereof, she filed a third-party claim to 
the property, and that the Bank, to secure the sale of the property, indemnified 
the sheriff whereby the property was sold to the Bank "on account of the writ of 
execution of the judgment in civil case No. 23110 of the Court of First Instance 
of Pampanga against Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc." That at the time of the sale and 
purchase, the Bank well knew that Nable Jose was the sole and exclusive owner of 
the property.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"7. Asuncion Nable Jose had a contract for the sale of her 
share in this realty for the sum of four hundred and forty thousand pesos 
(P440,000), Philippine currency, which was about to be consummated, she 
receiving the P440,000, Philippine currency, and selling her share when the sale 
of her said share by the sheriff of the Province of Pampanga at public auction 
took place under the writ of execution of the judgment against Lichauco &amp; 
Co., Inc., in civil case No. 23110 of the Court of First Instance of Manila.</p>
<p align="justify">"8. The purchaser, who was ready to purchase the share of 
Asuncion Nable Jose and pay its price in the manner agreed upon, learned that 
her said share had been sold by the sheriff of the Province of Pampanga, as 
aforesaid, and had been acquired by the Asia Banking Corporation, and, for that 
reason, desisted entirely from his purchase, alleging that he wanted to buy 
properties not in litigation and did not want any litigation.</p>
<p align="justify">"9. Notwithstanding that Asuncion Nable Jose, through her 
attorney in fact, Amparo Nable Jose, told this purchaser that the Asia Banking 
Corporation had no title, interest or share in her undivided property, and that 
said bank has not acquired anything through the sale at public auction, because 
the same was her exclusive property and not that of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., 
said purchaser answered that he had everything ready for the consummation of the 
purchase, and that he was ready to carry out the same upon the terms stipulated, 
but he withdrew because he did not want to buy a litigation, nor properties in 
litigation.</p>
<p align="justify">"10. This attitude of the Asia Banking Corporation injuring 
Asuncion Nable Jose and acting with fault, for the deliberate purpose of causing 
her a damage, has in fact caused an irreparable damage to Asuncion Nable Jose in 
the sum of three hundred and seventy thousand pesos (P370,000), Philippine 
currency."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">She prays that she be absolved from the complaint and have a 
decree on her cross-complaint, that she is the sole and exclusive owner of the 
property in question, and that she have judgment on her counterclaim against the 
plaintiff for P370,000 as damages.</p>
<p align="justify">After the taking of the evidence upon such issues, the lower 
court rendered judgment denying plaintiff any relief, and absolved the defendant 
Nable Jose from all of the allegations made in the complaint, and quieting her 
title to the lands in question, and denying her any damages on her 
cross-complaint.</p>
<p align="justify">On appeal the Bank assigns the following errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I. The trial court erred in failing to find that under the 
by-laws of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., neither its board of directors nor other 
officers had any power to hypothecate or convey or to ratify the hypothecation 
or conveyance of the real estate in question to the defendant Asuncion Nable 
Jose.</p>
<p align="justify">"II. The trial court erred in finding that the deed of the 16th 
of January, 1922, by the alleged shareholders of the defendant Lichauco &amp; 
Co., Inc., in favor of its codefendant Asuncion Nable Jose (Exhibit B, 
complaint), even though executed in good faith validly conveyed the 
<em>haciendas</em> therein described as against the creditors of Lichauco &amp; 
Co., Inc.</p>
<p align="justify">"III. The trial court erred in failing to find that the 
delivery to Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., of the check representing the loan of 
P70,000 by the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co. to the defendant 
Asuncion Nable Jose on the 2d day of August, 1920, the subsequent execution on 
November 21, 1921, of an unrecorded instrument of mortgage by Lichauco &amp; 
Co., Inc., to its codefendant Asuncion Nable Jose (Exhibits EE and 5) to secure 
the payment of the P70,000 and the final execution of the deed to Asuncion Nable 
Jose by the shareholders of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., on January 16, 1922 
(Exhibit B, complaint), of the same <em>haciendas</em> described in the mortgage 
were fraudulent, simulated and fictitious transactions consummated in pursuance 
of a conspiracy between members and relatives of the Lichauco family consisting 
of the defendant Asuncion Nable Jose and the shareholders and directors of 
Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., to cheat and defraud the appellant and other creditors 
of the said corporation.</p>
<p align="justify">"IV. The court erred in failing to find that the alleged 
consideration for the conveyance even though genuine was grossly inadequate and 
therefore fraudulent as to creditors.</p>
<p align="justify">"V. The trial court erred in rendering judgment in favor of the 
defendant and against the plaintiff."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><strong>JOHNS, J.: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">The records in this and its companion cases are voluminous, yet 
under the view which we have taken, only a very small portion of them is 
material. Nearly all of the important facts are admitted, and there is no 
serious dispute over those which are contested.</p>
<p align="justify">It appears that the Lichauco Corporation was organized in the 
year 1914, and to all intents and purposes, it was a typical family corporation, 
and £hat at the time of its organization, the defendant Nable Jose was the 
subscriber and owner of about 40 per cent of its capital stock.</p>
<p align="justify">At the trial the following stipulation was made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That the parties to the deed Exhibit B hereinbelow mentioned 
bear ties of kinship as follows: Luisa Fernandez is the wife of Faustino 
Lichauco, sr. he being the same Faustino Lichauco who signed the document 
Exhibit C; Cornelia B. Lichauco is a daughter of Luisa Fernandez and the same 
Faustino Lichauco; Tomas Lichauco is a son of the same Luisa Fernandez and 
Faustino Lichauco; that Asuncion Nable Jose, one of the defendants in this case, 
is a sister of Amparo Nable Jose, and the latter is the wife of Zacarias 
Lichauco, Zacarias Lichauco being the brother of Faustino Lichauco, sr." (P. 4, 
s. n., case G. R. No. 28495. To the same effect is the stipulation found on p. 
4, 8. n.t., G. R. No. 26882).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It also appears that on the same day and before the same notary 
and signed in the same manner, other deeds and transfers of the corporate 
property were made to different members of the Lichauco family.</p>
<p align="justify">The following stipulation was also made;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is stipulated between the parties that in the book of 
inventories of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., commencing February 28, 1915, it 
appears that Asuncion Nable Jose was indebted to the corporation in the sum of 
P70,662.31, and that on February 29, 1916, she was indebted to the corporation 
Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., in the sum of P110,971.83; and on February 28, 1917, 
she was indebted to the corporation Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., in the sum of 
P163,881.46; that in the inventory of February 28, 1918, the name of Asuncion 
Nable Jose does not appear as a debtor of the corporation; and that none of the 
books of account of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc.—the ledger, journals, or cash book 
from which it might be ascertained in what manner she paid if she ever paid 
anything exist." (G. R. No. 28495, s. n., 462-464.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Based upon this stipulation, and for the want of evidence 
tending to show when and how and in what manner Nable Jose paid the P163,881.46 
due and owing from her to the Lichauco Corporation on February 28, 1917, the 
appellant vigorously contends that this amount has never been paid.</p>
<p align="justify">It is admitted that on August 2, 1920, Nable Jose executed a 
mortgage to the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Ltd., a domestic 
corporation, to secure a loan from it of P70,000, "which I promise to return 
within the period of one (1) year extendible for another year from this date," 
with interest at the rate of 11 per cent per annum, payable monthly in advance, 
and that to secure the payment of that amount, she duly executed a mortgage on 
some of her real property in the City of Manila. It is also admitted that Nable 
Jose received P70,000 from the Sugar Estates Development Company at the time the 
mortgage was executed, and that concurrent therewith, she paid over and 
delivered that amount to the Lichauco Corporation. It is also admitted that on 
the 12th day of November, 1921, Faustino Lichauco and Luisa F. de Lichauco in 
person and claiming to act for and on behalf of the Lichauco Corporation, 
executed a mortgage to the defendant Nable Jose upon the real property now in 
question, to secure her in the payment of the P70,000, which among other things 
recites that on August 2, 1920, Nable Jose acknowledged herself "to be in debt 
to the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Ltd., in the sum of seventy 
thousand pesos (P70,000) by way of loan, payable in one year, extendible to 
another year, with interest at eleven per centum (11%) per annum, interest to be 
paid monthly in advance." That to secure its payment, she executed a mortgage on 
two pieces of real property in the City of Manila in which it was said that 
Luisa Fernandez de Lichauco, as president of the Board of Directors of Lichauco 
&amp; Co., Inc., "hereby declare and acknowledge that all of the said sum of 
seventy thousand! pesos (P70,000) received from the Philippine Sugar Estates 
Development Company, Ltd., by the said Asuncion Nable Jose was delivered by her 
to Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., for whose interest and benefit, in reality, said 
loan was contracted, with the express condition that said Lichauco &amp; Co., 
Inc., should deliver in due time to Asuncion Nable Jose all the amounts which 
she, by virtue of the deed of August 2, 1920, is obliged to deliver to the 
Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Ltd., to realize the payment of 
the interest and the capital of said loan, upon the termination of the terms 
stipulated in the said deed." And it further recites that Luisa Fernandez de 
Lichauco "hereby create a mortgage in favor of the aforementioned Asuncion Nable 
Jose, over the share of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., in the properties hereinbelow 
described with their improvements, to secure the payment by Lichauco &amp; Co., 
Inc., to said Asuncion Nable Jose of the above-mentioned sum of seventy thousand 
pesos (P70,000) and its interest." And, further, "7th. I, the declarant, Luisa 
Fernandez de Lichauco, further declare that Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., had to 
contribute to the capital stock of the Pampanga Sugar Development Co. the sum of 
thirty-six thousand pesos (P36,000) and in consideration of the contribution of 
this sum, of the assignment of one half of the annual crop of the lands 
above-described and the authorization granted to be able to encumber or mortgage 
the share of Lichauco &amp; Co. in the same, the said Pampanga Sugar Development 
Co. has obliged itself to assign, and within a short time will issue in favor of 
Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., a certain number of shares of said company, the 
Pampanga Sugar Development Co., the number and amount of which will be fixed in 
proportion to the contribution and the importance of the lands of the persons 
who also entered into a contract with the said Pampanga Sugar Development Co., 
identical with that celebrated by it with Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc." It was also 
therein recited that "to deliver to the said Asuncion Nable Jose by way of 
pledge, all of said shares in said company, the Pampanga Sugar Development 
Company, as soon as said shares are issued in favor of, and received by, 
Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc. Provided, That without the need of the execution of a 
special contract, the mere delivery, under receipt of said shares to the said 
Asuncion Nable Jose will produce the effect of constituting automatically the 
pledge over said shares in favor of Asuncion Nable Jose to insure the payment of 
said loan of seventy thousand pesos (¥70,000) and its interest." And "that the 
shares of the Pampanga Sugar Development Co., mentioned in the foregoing 
paragraph, at the time of executing this deed, are free from all charges, 
encumbrances and responsibility and said Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., obliges 
itself not to alienate them or encumber them until the whole of said loan of 
seventy thousand pesos (P70,000) have been paid, together with its interest, 
contracted by Asuncion Nable Jose with the Philippine Sugar Estates Development 
Co."</p>
<p align="justify">It will be noted that, although Nable Jose executed her 
mortgage to secure the payment of the P70,000 on August 2, 1920, the above 
mortgage, to secure her, was not executed until November 12, 1921, or about 
sixteen months later, and that during that period she did not have any security 
for the P70,000. It is also admitted that on January 12, 1922, another 
instrument was signed by Luisa F. de Lichauco, Cornelia B. Lichauco, Tomas 
Lichauco, Jose Barbaza, Faustino Lichauco and Asuncion Nable Jose and duly 
acknowledged before a notary public and duly registered, which purports to 
convey the real property in question to the defendant Nable Jose, in which it is 
recited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That said sum of P70,000, given by way of loan by the 
Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., Ltd., to Asuncion Nable Jose, was 
delivered by the latter to Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., this company, on its part, 
obligating itself to deliver to said Asuncion Nable Jose, within the periods 
fixed in said deed of August 2, 1920, the amounts necessary to settle and pay 
said sum of P70,000 and its interest."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The aforementioned Asuncion Nable Jose having assumed the 
obligation to pay to the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., Ltd., said 
sum of P63,000 and its interest, relieving Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., from the 
obligation of paying said sum of P63,000 and its interest, the parties of the 
first part, as president and members of the Board of Directors of Lichauco &amp; 
Co., Inc., and as the only shareholders of said company, by these presents, 
sell, cede and convey, absolutely and forever, to said Asuncion Nable Jose the 
full ownership, with all its improvements, of the twentythree twenty-fifths 
parts of the rural estates, belonging to Lichauco &amp; Co., 
Inc."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Then follows a description of the real property involved in 
this suit.</p>
<p align="justify">It further recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"And considering further that Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., 
contributed to the capital of the Pampanga Sugar Development Co. in cash the sum 
of thirty-six thousand pesos (P36,000), the Pampanga Sugar Development Co. has 
obligated itself to cede to Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., a certain number of shares 
of said company, in proportion to its contribution to the capital of the same. 
It is well understood between the parties that all these shares are hereby 
conveyed in fee simple from now to the purchaser Asuncion Nable Jose, together 
with the ownership of the three (3) estates described in clause 3 for the 
above-mentioned sum of P63,000 and its interest which said Asuncion Nable Jose 
obliges herself to pay personally by these presents, to the Philippine Sugar 
Estates Development Co., Ltd."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And that by reason thereof, "both parties hereby declare that 
said deed of mortgage and pledge of November 12, 1921 is totally cancelled."</p>
<p align="justify">The amount of land thus conveyed is 410 hectares, and the 
consideration specified in the deed is P70,000. But it will also be noted that 
in addition to the land, the deed also conveys to the defendant Nable Jose the 
amount of P36,000 which the Lichauco Corporation contributed in cash "to the 
capital of the Pampanga Sugar Development Co.," and for which that company had 
obligated itself to cede to the Lichauco Corporation "a certain number of shares 
of said company, in proportion to its contribution to the capital of the same." 
At the argument it was conceded that such shares of stock then had a valuation 
of P36,000, and it was claimed that they now have a valuation of something near 
P100,000. That is to say, by this conveyance Nable Jose also received shares of 
stock in the Pampanga Sugar Development Company which were then of the value of 
P36,000, and the consideration for the deed was P70,000; hence, it must follow 
that the true consideration for the 410 hectares of land would be only 
P34,000.</p>
<p align="justify">It appears from the record of the Lichauco Corporation that the 
land in question had a book value of P250,000, and Faustino Lichauco, its 
president and manager, testified that it had a reasonable value of P600,000. In 
addition to all of which, in her verified answer, the defendant under oath said 
that she had given an option on the property at a price of P440,000, and that 
the parties were ready and willing to make the purchase, and that the deal 
would have been consummated, had it not been for the action of the bank in 
prosecuting this suit.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence, in the final analysis, the deed in question to Nable 
Jose purports to convey to her 410 hectares of land for an actual consideration 
of P36,000, the real value of which, as shown by the evidence, ranges from 
P250,000 to P600,000.</p>
<p align="justify">After the rendition of the judgment in the lower court, the 
Bank filed a motion for reconsideration in which specific attention was called 
to this inadequacy of consideration, pointing out that the land involved was 
about 410 hectares, in which motion it was stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We submit that this Honorable Court should have found that the 
consideration of P70,000 for the sale of said <em>haciendas</em> is inadequate 
and that as a matter of equity and justice plaintiff herein, being one of the 
creditors of Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc., is entitled to said <em>haciendas</em> 
upon payment of P70,000 to the defendant Asuncion Nable Jose, for there is no 
reason why Asuncion Nable Jose should be allowed to have said <em>haciendas</em> 
for the meager sum of P70,000 when the same are reasonably worth P400,000, to 
the prejudice of the other creditors and especially the plaintiff 
herein."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">That motion was also denied.</p>
<p align="justify">The rule upon that question is well stated in Ruling Case Law, 
volume 12, as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">Pages 477-479.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * If a debtor be actually insolvent, he may still dispose 
of his property for a valuable consideration in good faith, but it seems to be 
well settled that he will not be permitted to alienate his property and place it 
in a position where it is not subject to process in behalf of his creditors, 
unless there has been received a full and fair consideration for the property 
transferred, and the same has been made in good faith, and any transfer made in 
contemplation of insolvency is invalid under the same circumstances as if made 
by the debtor where actually insolvent. * * * </p>
<p align="justify">"11. <em>Disparity between Consideration and Real 
Value.</em>—Gross disparity between the consideration and the actual value of 
the property conveyed is a badge of fraud, and this even in the case of an 
execution sale. Under such circumstances it is generally held that equity will 
in any event subject the property conveyed to the claims of creditors to the 
extent that the real value exceeds the consideration, for such a conveyance is 
partially voluntary. If the disparity of consideration is deliberate, with 
intent to defraud creditors, the transaction is utterly void as to creditors, 
and gross disparity may under some circumstances of itself justify the inference 
that there was actual fraud, especially where the disparity is occasioned not by 
the absence, but by the illegality of the consideration. A man must be just 
before he is generous, and consequently he will not be permitted to prejudice 
his creditors by giving away his property for little or nothing. The courts will 
not weigh the value of the goods sold and the price received in very nice 
scales, but all circumstances considered, there should be a reasonable and fair 
proportion between the one and the other. Inadequacy of price does not mean an 
honest difference of opinion as to price, but a consideration so far short of 
the real value of the property as to startle a correct mind. * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">That is good law.</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence in the instant case is conclusive that the 
consideration for the deed to Nable Jose was grossly inadequate. It is also 
conclusive that at the time of the execution of the deed and even before that, 
the Lichauco Corporation was insolvent. That it did not have any liquid assets, 
and that all of its other assets were pledged or mortgaged, some of which were 
for far more than their actual value.</p>
<p align="justify">It also appears that the undisputed facts bring this case 
squarely within the terms and provisions of article 1292 of the Civil Code, 
which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Payments made by a debtor while in a state of insolvency on 
account of obligations which were not enforcible at the time the payment was 
made may also be rescinded."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">As stated, on August 2, 1920, Nable Jose borrowed the P70,000 
in question, to secure the payment of which she executed a mortgage on her 
Manila property, and by its terms and provisions, she expressly had one year in 
which to pay the debt, and was also given another year at her own option. That 
is to say, by the express terms and conditions of her mortgage, the principal 
debt would not become due and payable until the 2nd of August, 1922. This 
specific debt was for the first time secured by the mortgage of the Lichauco 
Corporation on the property in question executed on November 12, 1921, in which 
it is specifically recited that the Lichauco Corporation should and agreed to 
pay the P70,000 at the same time and manner and on the same terms and conditions 
specified and defined in the mortgage which Nable Jose executed on her Manila 
property. That is to say, that the deed of the property in question was executed 
on January 16, 1922, and that by the express terms and provisions of the two 
different mort and payable until August 2, 1922. Hence, it must follow that, if 
the deed in question is treated as a sale and purchase, the payment of the 
P70,000 was made while the Lichauco Corporation was "in a state of insolvency," 
and it was made January 16, 1922, on account of the obligation of the Lichauco 
Corporation which was "not enforcible at the time the payment was made," or at 
any time prior to August 2, 1922.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff's Exhibit A was executed on December 17, 1921, one 
month and five days after the Lichauco Corporation executed its mortgage to 
Nable Jose. By the express provisions of Exhibit A, the Lichauco Corporation 
transferred and assigned to the Bank 37 1/2 per cent of all of its interest in 
the sugar produced on the <em>haciendas</em> in question, and in which it is 
said: "It being the intention hereby to assign and transfer all free sugar 
derived by the debtor from said <em>haciendas</em> until such time as said 
indebtedness as shown by the books of the Bank may be satisfied."</p>
<p align="justify">The deed of Nable Jose of January 16, 1922, expressly 
recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The parties of the first part declare that this sale is made 
with the depress condition that the crops of sugar and palay corresponding to 
the agricultural year 1921-1922 are not understood as included, whether 
harvested or about to be harvested in said lands sold, crops which belong to the 
vendor Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It will thus be seen that on December 17, 1921, the Lichauco 
Corporation transferred and assigned to the Bank 37 1/2 per cent of all of the 
sugar received from the <em>haciendas</em> until such time as its indebtedness 
to the Bank should be satisfied, and yet on January 16, 1922, it executed the 
deed in question to Nable Jose, in which it is recited that the crops for the 
agricultural year 1921-1922 are not included, and that such crops "belong to the 
vendor Lichauco &amp; Co., Inc." The legal effect of which, if any, was to 
nullify the sale and assignment to the Bank of the sugar crops from the 
<em>haciendas</em> until such time as its debt was paid.</p>
<p align="justify">There is much force in the contention of the Bank that the debt 
of Nable Jose to the Lichauco Corporation on February 28, 1917, admitted to be 
P163,881.46 has not been paid, and that the proof of its payment is not clear 
and convincing. Be that as it may, it does appear from the corporate record that 
the old debt no longer existed, and that on August 2, 1920, a new account was 
opened in which Nable Jose had a credit on the books of the corporation for 
P70,000, which later was wiped out by the execution of the deed now in question, 
and it is admitted that on August 2, 1920, Nable Jose paid the P70,000 to the 
Lichauco Corporation, and there is other evidence tending to show that the old 
original debt for P163,881.46 was paid.</p>
<p align="justify">While the question is not free from doubt, yet all things 
considered, we hold that the Lichauco Corporation on August 2, 1920, was 
indebted to Nable Jose in the sum of P70,000.</p>
<p align="justify">The mortgage of November 12, 1921, was executed to secure a 
preexisting debt, and it was intended that the deed of January 16, 1922, should 
be a payment of that debt.</p>
<p align="justify">We deem it fair to say that Nable Jose never saw the 
<em>haciendas</em> described in her deed, and that she did not have any personal 
knowledge of the questions involved in this litigation, and that in all of such 
matters, she acted through, and was represented by, her attorney in fact, Amparo 
Nable Jose.</p>
<p align="justify">Also, that the court is not in the least interested in the 
personal attacks made on the attorneys for the plaintiff in the brief of the 
Lichauco Corporation, which have nothing to do with the merits of the case. 
Suffice it to say that they are wholly unwarranted and are not in any manner 
justified or sustained by anything in the record.</p>
<p align="justify">We have given this case the careful consideration which its 
importance demands, in which we have had the use and benefit of the able and 
exhaustive briefs of opposing counsel. In the final analysis, we are clearly of 
the opinion that the consideration for the deed of the Lichauco Corporation to 
the defendant Nable Jose, executed on January 16, 1922, is grossly inadequate, 
and that at the time of its execution and even before, the Lichauco Corporation 
was insolvent, and that the alleged payment of the debt of P70,000 by the 
Lichauco Corporation to Nable Jose was made while the corporation was in the 
state of insolvency, and that it was made on account of an obligation which was 
not due and enforcible at the time of its alleged payment within the meaning of 
article 1292 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p align="justify">The title to the shares of stock evidenced by the P36,000 paid 
by the Lichauco Corporation to the Pampanga Sugar Development Company is hereby 
confirmed in the defendant Nable Jose as her sole, separate and exclusive 
property, and we find that the true and only remaining consideration for the 
deed of the two <em>haciendas</em> involved in this litigation was P34,000, for 
and on account of which, Nable Jose has a prior and equitable lien, with 
interest from January 16, 1922, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum. That 
should plaintiff Bank pay or cause to be paid to her that amount with such 
interest on or before July 1, 1928, that the Bank shall then be and become the 
sole and exclusive owner of the <em>haciendas</em> described in plaintiff's 
complaint, free and clear of any charge, lien or encumbrance, and that in the 
event such payment is made, the defendant Nable Jose shall convey to the Bank by 
a good and sufficient deed, all of her right, title and interest to the land in 
question, and that for the failure to make such conveyance, the decree of this 
court shall legally operate as a deed. It is further decreed that on the making 
of such payment, the sheriff's deed as to this particular property in favor of 
the Bank be ordered registered in the registry of property for the Province of 
Pampanga, and that the deed to Nable Jose be set aside, cancelled and held for 
naught. Neither party to recover costs. So ordered.</p>
