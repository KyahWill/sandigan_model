				<BR><STRONG>RECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Filomeno del Rosario y Natividad stands charged with possession of <i>jueteng</i> lists in violation of section 824 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila.&nbsp; This case originated from the municipal court of Manila where the accused had been sentenced to fifteen days imprisonment, with costs, which penalty had been affirmed, on appeal, by the Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; In&nbsp; both instances, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge. The accused, as a last resort, appeals to this court,&nbsp; but here raises no question for our determination involving error&nbsp; either&nbsp; of law or fact, and simply implores clemency "because the accused is a sickly man of 55, with a wife and six children to support."<br><br>The offense to which the accused pleaded guilty is punish- able with a fine not exceeding P200, or with imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, at&nbsp; the discretion of the court.&nbsp; The mitigating circumstance&nbsp; of plea&nbsp; of&nbsp; guilty is offset by that of recidivism, as the record shows that the accused had formerly been convicted of a kindred offense to that in&nbsp; question.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; viewed, the appealed judgment sentencing him to fifteen days imprisonment,&nbsp; with costs, may be considered lenient.<br><br>The reasons alleged in&nbsp; support of the appeal show that the same should have been addressed to the Chief Executive and not to this court whose mission is confined to correcting errors committed by inferior courts in ascertaining the facts and&nbsp; in applying the&nbsp; law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; committed no error of&nbsp; either kind and&nbsp; its judgment should&nbsp; be affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Abad Santos, Hull,</i> and <i>Vickers, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
