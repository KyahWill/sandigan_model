				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This was originally an action for the recovery of land brought in the Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros.&nbsp; An incidental question raised toy the defendant was whether or not he was the natural son of Monaco Catalan and Alexandra Asin.&nbsp; The evidence was taken before two judges, after which Judge Garcia rendered judgment absolving the defendant from the complaint, with costs against the plaintiffs.<br><br>Cipriano Catalan, the defendant, was born on September 26, 1908, and according to the church record was "el primer hijo legitimo y de legitimo matrimonio de Monico y de Alejandra Asin".&nbsp; It has,&nbsp; however, not been shown that Monico Catalan and Alejandra Asin were legally united in marriage.&nbsp; The godfather mentioned in the church certificate was Benito Gumaran,&nbsp; who testified relative to the baptism and the questions propounded by the priest.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also in the record other oral testimony that Monico Catalan treated Cipriano Catalan as his son, and that Cipriano was so considered in the community.&nbsp; Monico died in 1920, and apparently the son, although then a minor, went into possession of the little property left by his father.&nbsp; As against this, the plaintiffs now contend&nbsp; that Cipriano is not the son of Monico and Alexandra but is the son of Apolonio Catalan and Juana Aranas.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the trial Judge rejected this theory as untenable, and we think properly.<br><br>The action, although begun in a defensive manner, was brought within time under article 137 of the Civil Code and further conforms to the provisions of No. 2 of article 135 of the same Code.;&nbsp; The plaintiffs have raised a number, of interesting question which need not be decided, for it suffices for us to say that we are of the opinion that the findings made below conform to a clear preponderance of the evidence.<br><br>Judgment affirmed, with, the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br><br>Ten days from the publication of this decision, judgment will be entered,&nbsp; and five days thereafter, the record will be remanded to the court below.<br><i><br>Avanceña, C.
