				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the 20th day of July,&nbsp; 1925, the chief of police of the municipality of San Pablo, Province of Laguna, presented a complaint in the court of the justice of the peace of said municipality,&nbsp; charging the defendant with the crime of assassination.&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint alleged that&nbsp; the crime was committed on the 18th day of July, 1925,&nbsp; in said municipality.&nbsp; Upon the presentation of the complaint a warrant of arrest was issued and the defendant&nbsp; was arrested and brought before the&nbsp; court for a preliminary examination.&nbsp; At the close of the preliminary examination the justice of the peace found that there was probable cause for believing that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged, and the cause was remanded to the Court of&nbsp; First Instance for trial.<br><br>On the 10th day of September,&nbsp; 1925, the prosecuting attorney of the Province of&nbsp; Laguna presented a complaint, charging the&nbsp; defendant with the crime of assassination. The&nbsp; complaint alleged:<br><blockquote>"On&nbsp; or about the 18th day of July,&nbsp; 1925, in&nbsp; the municipality of San&nbsp; Pablo,&nbsp; Province of Laguna, Philippine Islands,&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein accused&nbsp; did&nbsp; voluntarily, illegally, maliciously, and&nbsp; criminally, with treachery and known premeditation,&nbsp; and with the&nbsp; deliberate&nbsp; intention to&nbsp; kill, attack and assault Baldomero Abril&nbsp; with a Smith 38 calibre revolver,&nbsp; which he had in his&nbsp; possession, and with the said revolver fired at Baldomero Abril, mortally wounding him in the left side of the neck, which wound was the direct and sole cause of the death of the said Baldomero Abril."<br></blockquote>Upon said complaint the defendant was duly brought to trial, at the close of which and after a careful consideration of the evidence adduced,&nbsp; and in a&nbsp; carefully&nbsp; prepared&nbsp; opinion in which&nbsp; reference is made to all&nbsp; of&nbsp; the important facts proved&nbsp; during&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; of the cause,&nbsp; the Honorable Isidro Paredes,&nbsp; judge, found&nbsp; that the defendant&nbsp; Maximo Capitania was guilty&nbsp; beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of assassination of the&nbsp; person of Baldomero Abril, committed with the concurrence of the attenuating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code and without any aggravating circumstances,&nbsp; and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a period of seventeen years, four months, and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal,</span> to suffer the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the family of the&nbsp; deceased in the sum of P1,000 and&nbsp; to pay the costs.&nbsp; From that sentence the defendant appealed.<br><br>From an examination of the evidence&nbsp; adduced during the trial of the&nbsp; cause, the&nbsp; following facts are established beyond a reasonable doubt:&nbsp; On the 18th day of April, 1925, a number of&nbsp; persons, including the defendant and the deceased were assisting&nbsp; Norberto Flores <i>en la Limpieza&nbsp; del caiñgin</i>.&nbsp; Among the persons who were thus&nbsp; assisting Norberto Flores&nbsp; was his&nbsp; daughter Remedios Flores.&nbsp; In the afternoon of said day Norberto&nbsp; Flores advised&nbsp; his helpers to retire for the day.&nbsp; Said persons left the <i>caiñgin</i> in three groups.&nbsp; The first group was made up of men and women; the second group was made up of Maximo Capitania—the defendant—Martin de Mesa and Basilio Sanchez; the third&nbsp; group was composed of Gaudencio Eiseo, Jose&nbsp; Cuasay and Baldomero&nbsp; Abril,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased.&nbsp; Said persons left the <span style="font-style: italic;">caiñgin </span>in the order of said groups.&nbsp; After the groups had gone some distance from the <i>caiñgin</i>&nbsp; the second group stopped beside the path or road and waited for the arrival of the third group.&nbsp; Upon the arrival of the third group, without any warning or notice,&nbsp; Baldomero Abril was shot through the&nbsp; neck, from the effect of which wound he died almost immediately.&nbsp; He was shot with a revolver carried by the appellant Maximo Capitania.<br><br>The appellant admits that Baldomero Abril&nbsp; was killed by a shot fired by his revolver.&nbsp;&nbsp; He contends, however, that the discharge of the revolver was accidental; that just at the time of the arrival of Baldomero Abril, Basilio Sanchez, a member of his group, desired to possess himself of&nbsp; the revolver in order to fire a&nbsp; shot; that he refused to give his revolver to Basilio Sanchez; that Basilio&nbsp; Sanchez attempted by force to take possession of his revolver, and in the scuffle to secure the possession, the revolver was discharged accidentally and&nbsp; Baldomero Abril was killed by virtue of said discharge.<br><br>The alleged scuffle between the appellant and Basilio Sanchez for&nbsp; the possession of the revolver is sustained only by the declaration of the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; The record does not disclose where the first group&nbsp; was at the time of the incident described in&nbsp; the complaint.&nbsp; The record&nbsp; does, however,&nbsp; disclose that at the&nbsp; place&nbsp; where&nbsp; the crime was committed&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the second and third groups were&nbsp; present.&nbsp; The&nbsp; members of the second&nbsp; and&nbsp; third groups who were&nbsp; present, besides the defendant and the deceased, were Martin de Mesa, Basilio Sanchez, Gaudencio Eseo and Jose Cuasay.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the persons present&nbsp; agree that the&nbsp; alleged scuffle&nbsp; of Basilio Sanchez&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain the revolver from the possession of the appellant did not take place, and&nbsp; that Basilio Sanchez made&nbsp; no effort to&nbsp; obtain the possession of the revolver.&nbsp; The story told by Gaudencio Eseo, even in his own language during the trial of the cause,&nbsp; concerning the commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Q. Do you&nbsp; know that Baldomero Abril is dead?—A. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. Do you remember the&nbsp; day&nbsp; that he died?—A. Yes, sir, the 18th of July, 1925.<br><br>"Q. Do you know what person or persons killed him?— A. Maximo Capitania.<br><br>"Q. Where is Maximo Capitania now?—A. He is over there (pointing to the accused).<br><br>"Q. Were you in the barrio when Baldomero Abril was killed?—A. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. Let&nbsp; us&nbsp; see; tell, briefly, what&nbsp; occurred.—A.&nbsp; After breakfast Baldomero Abril invited me to go with him and clean the lot belonging to Norberto&nbsp; Flores, and at&nbsp; about 10 o'clock in the morning, more or less, we arrived at the place where&nbsp; we were going to&nbsp; work, at which&nbsp; moment the accused Maximo Capitania also arrived and&nbsp; the two began talking.&nbsp; During the conversation between Maximo Capitania and Baldomero Abril I heard Maximo Capitania say to Baldomero 'I ask you not to court that girl' to which Baldomero answered, 'but I have already sacrificed a great deal for that girl,' to which&nbsp; Maximo replied,&nbsp; 'I can do nothing if you do not want to listen to me,' and we started to work cleaning the lot.&nbsp; In the afternoon of the same day the owner of the land told us that we could cease cleaning the&nbsp; lot, saying that each one of us had&nbsp; animals to take care of and, consequently, we could leave.&nbsp; We left in three groups.&nbsp; The first was composed of certain men and&nbsp; women;&nbsp; the second group was composed of the accused Maximo Capitania,&nbsp; Martin de&nbsp; Mesa and&nbsp; Basilio Sanchez, and the third&nbsp; group consisted of myself (Gaudencio Eseo), Jose&nbsp; Cuasay and Baldomero Abril.<br><br>"Q. In what group was&nbsp; the deceased?—A. In the third group.<br><br>"Q. Did you belong to that group also?—A. Yes, sir.<br><br>"Q. Very well, now relate what happened?—A. While we were walking along&nbsp; we saw&nbsp; Maximo Capitania, Martin de&nbsp; Mesa&nbsp; and Basilio Sanchez stop in the middle of the field, but we paid no attention to them and continued our way, Baldomero Abril walking about ten <i>varas</i> ahead of us, leaving the two of us, Jose Cuasay and I, behind.&nbsp; On passing the place where&nbsp; Maximo Capitania, Basilio Sanchez, and Martin de Mesa were, the accused&nbsp; Maximo Capitania, with his revolver, fired at Baldomero Abril.<br><br>"Q. Wasn't there even an&nbsp; exchange of words&nbsp; between the two before the shot was fired?—A. No, sir, Baldomero was shot while he was walking.<br><br>"Q. Were they in front of you when&nbsp; the killing or shooting took place or&nbsp; were they behind you?&nbsp; You said you were walking;.—A.&nbsp; They were in front of me.<br><br>"Q. What&nbsp; distance were&nbsp; you from them?—A. About fifteen brazas.<br><br>"Q. Did the shot hit Baldomero Abril or not?—A. It hit him.<br><br>"Q. In what part of the body did it hit him?—A. In the left side of the neck and he fell.<br><br>"Q. How did he fall?—A. Towards the right side.<br><br>"Q. Was he stretched out and in what manner?—A. He remained lying on his side.<br><br>"Q. Sideways, face down or face up?—A.&nbsp; Sideways.<br><br>"Q. Could he talk?—A. No, sir.<br><br>"Q. And what else happened?—A. Upon seeing him fall I approached him and Maximo Capitania said to me 'Do not say anything of what you have seen, because if you do I will kill you also.'&nbsp; I started to run up the road because I was afraid.<br><br>"Q. Look at the revolver that is here exhibited and&nbsp; say if you&nbsp; recognize this firearm?—A. Yes, sir."<br></blockquote>The facts related by Gaudencio Eseo&nbsp; are corroborated by the testimony of&nbsp; other witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant&nbsp; did&nbsp; not take pains&nbsp; even to call Basilio Sanchez to corroborate his statement that the firing of the revolver was accidental.<br><br>The&nbsp; real motive for the&nbsp; commission of the crime is difficult to say. There are two theories advanced: First, it appears that the deceased and his father and the appellant had had a dispute concerning the products of a certain piece or parcel of land; second, it is contended that a quarrel existed between the appellant and the&nbsp; deceased concerning their relation with Remedios Flores, a daughter of Norberto Flores.&nbsp; The first theory is supported by the testimony of the father of the deceased.&nbsp; He testified that he and his son and the appellant had had a dispute concerning the products&nbsp; of a parcel of land very soon before the commission of the crime. The other theory as to the motive of the crime&nbsp; and supported by the testimony of two or three witnesses is, that the appellant and the deceased were each giving more or less attention to the daughter of Norberto Flores.&nbsp; Whether one or both of said theories concerning the motive for the commission of the crime, and we are quite sure that one or both constituted the motive for the commission of the crime, the record shows that the crime was committed and the evidence&nbsp; shows beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did, with a revolver which he had in his possession at the&nbsp; time, shoot and kill Baldomero Abril.<br><br>Whether the killing was premeditated&nbsp; or not is not altogether clear.&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant stopped&nbsp; on the path or road and waited for the arrival of Baldomero Abril and his companions is&nbsp; a strong indication that he had premeditated the killing.&nbsp; The fact however, that he waited by the wayside until the arrival&nbsp; of&nbsp; Baldomero Abril, and without warning, without giving Baldomero Abril time to offer resistance, and in a sudden and unexpected attack, under circumstances which rendered Baldomero Abril unable to defend himself by reason of the suddenness and the severity of the attack, in our judgment constitutes the qualifying circumstance of cdevosia in the present case, and is sufficient to qualify the crime as that of assassination.&nbsp; (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Babasa, 2 Phil., 102; Q. S. <i>vs.</i> Cabiling, 7 Phil., 469; U.&nbsp; S. <i>vs.</i> Matanug, 11 Phil.,&nbsp; 188; U. S. <i>vs.</i> De Silva, 14 Phil., 413.)<br><br>The lower court gave the defendant the benefit of article 11 and&nbsp; reduced&nbsp; the penalty to the minimum of that prescribed by law.&nbsp; While generally this court abides by the decision of the lower court in matters which&nbsp; are purely within his discretion, yet in the present case we are not inclined so to do.&nbsp; The appellant was the owner of a revolver and had a license for its&nbsp; possession.&nbsp; We cannot bring ourselves to&nbsp; believe that the Constabulary Bureau, which issues licenses for the possession of firearms, issues the same to persons entitled to the benefit of article 11 of the Penal Code.&nbsp; The fact that the appellant had a license issued by the Government for the possession of a firearm would indicate a degree of intelligence and instruction beyond that of persons who are entitled to the benefit of article 11.<br><br>Our conclusions are, from all of the foregoing,&nbsp; that the crime committed by the appellant is that of assassination with the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia</i>, and that there are&nbsp; neither aggravating nor attenuating circumstances.&nbsp; He must therefore be punished with the penalty prescribed by law or that&nbsp; of <i>cadena perpetua</i>.&nbsp; Therefore, the sentence of the lower court is hereby modified and the appellant is hereby sentenced, in accordance with the recommendation of the Attorney-General, to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena perpetua</span> and to pay to the family of the deceased the sum of P1,000, with the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C.&nbsp; J., Street, Villamor, Ostrand,&nbsp; Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
