				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition to reverse and set
aside a certain decision rendered by the Secretary of the Interior on
April 14, 1937, in an administrative case arising from a complaint
filed by the petitioner Gonzalo Tolentino against the respondents
Artemio Rodis, Tito Alegre, and Bernardo Capupos, chief of police and
policemen, respectively, of the municipality of Alfonso, Province of
Cavite, charging them with grave coercion and arbitrary detention, and
praying for their dismissal from the service, in accordance with the
provisions of section 2272 of the Administrative Code.
<p> The petitioner alleges in his brief that the Secretary of the
Interior acted in excess of his jurisdiction in rendering his decision
in question, and that he has no recourse in view of the fact that there
is no appeal or any other remedy available to him. The decision in
question literally reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "It appears that sometime in January, 1935, Gonzalo
Tolentino filed an administrative complaint against the respondents for
grave coercion. On the date set for trial, Tolentino defaulted and the
council forthwith dismissed his complaint. From this dismissal
Tolentino appealed to the provincial board. Said board not only
entertained the appeal but also allowed the complainant to file an
additional charge against the respondents for arbitrary detention and
set a date for trial. The respondents refused to submit to the
investigation alleging that the board had not legally acquired
jurisdiction to try the case. The board nevertheless proceeded with the
trial of the case <em>ex parte</em> and dismissed the respondents from office.</p>
  <p>
"Under the facts above stated the action of the provincial board was
not in accordance with law. The provincial board should have remanded
the case to the municipal council for investigation of the case and not
try the same on its merits, for under the law then in force, the
provincial board had no original jurisdiction to investigate charges
against members of the police force. Under section 2272 of the
Administrative Code, as amended, the provincial board was vested with
appellate jurisdiction and not original. In exercising original
jurisdiction in this case, therefore, the provincial board had gone
beyond the powers vested in it by the law and consequently its decision
was without legal effect.</p>
    <p> "In view of the foregoing, the
respondents should be, and they are hereby, reinstated in office from
the date they receive copy of this decision, without prejudice to such
administrative action as may be warranted by the findings of the
Commissioner of Public Safety who is hereby requested to have the
charges against the respondents fully and thoroughly investigated in
accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 88.</p>
    <p> "Done at the City of Manila, this 14th day of April, in the year of Our Lord, nineteen hundred and thirty-seven.<br>

  </blockquote>
<p> It appears from the pleading before this court and from the
documents attached thereto that the petitioner, on January 22, 1935,
filed a complaint with the municipal council of Alfonso, Cavite,
charging the last three respondents with the crime of grave coercion
only, alleging that, by means of, threats, and revolver in hand, they
prevented him and his companions from continuing their journey by car
on the pretext that they then had <em>jueteng</em> paraphernalia with
them and that said respondents wanted said paraphernalia to be turned
over to them. The investigation of the charges was to have been made
before the committee of three councilors appointed by the municipal
council of Alfonso, on the date set by said committee for that purpose,
that is on December 19, 1935; but as the petitioner, as complainant,
had failed to appear at the hearing, notwithstanding the fact that he
had been notified of his obligation to do so two days prior thereto
(Exhibit 3), the committee had to dismiss the case, without taking
further action except that of informing the municipal council of its
act, which was approved by the latter on January 2, 1936 (Exhibit 5).</p>
<p> As soon as the petitioner was informed of the action taken by the
investigation committee of the municipal council, he appealed therefrom
to the provincial board of Cavite, alleging in the pleading filed by
him to that effect (Exhibit 6), that the decision of said committee is
"against the law and the weight of authority for the reason that the
herein complainant (referring to himself) has presented his waive of
right to declare before the Committee on Investigation before the
investigation was conducted."</p>
<p> After the case had been brought to the provincial board, the
petitioner, on April 8, 1936, filed with it a new complaint (Exhibit
7), then charging the respondents not only with grave coercion but also
with arbitrary detention. The provincial board of Cavite, ignoring the
objections interposed by the respondent policemen who alleged (<em>a</em>)
that it had no original jurisdiction to try the new complaint or the
administrative case filed against them, on the ground that there was no
decision of the municipal council of Alfonso from which the petitioner
could have appealed; (<em>b</em>) that the only jurisdiction conferred upon it by law is appellate jurisdiction; and (<em>c</em>)
that the municipal council of Alfonso did not conduct any investigation
and did not even receive any evidence in connection with the complaint,
because the petitioner failed to appear, went ahead and started to
investigate the new charges' preferred against the respondent
policemen, after requiring the interested parties to present their
respective evidence. The respondent policemen refused to submit to the
investigation.</p>
<p> After receiving the evidence for the petitioner, the provincial
board, in April, 1936, found that the respondent policemen really
committed the crime of grave coercion against the petitioner and his
companions and, therefore, ordered them dismissed from their respective
positions. It later appointed others to substitute them, and the
persons so appointed continued in their positions until the Secretary
of the Interior, in April, 1937, issued the order in question by virtue
of which the respondents were reinstated.</p>
<p> I. Section 2272 of the Administrative Code, as amended by Act No. 3206, reads, among other things, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Members of the municipal police shall not be
removed and, except in cases of resignation, shall not be discharged
except for misconduct or incompetency, dishonesty, disloyalty to the
United States or Philippine Government, serious irregularities in the
performance of their duties, and violation of law or duty, and in such
cases charges shall be preferred under oath by the municipal president
or by any other person and investigated by the municipal council, or a
committee of three councilors designated for said purpose by a majority
of the council, in public hearing, and the accused shall be given
opportunity to make their defense. In every case filed against a member
of the municipal police, a copy of the charges shall be furnished the
accused by the municipal president personally or by registered mail,
within five days from the date of the filing of the charges, and the
council or its committee shall try the case within ten days from the
date the accused has been notified of the charges, unless the accused,
for good reasons, shall ask for a longer period to prepare his defense.
The trial of the case shall be finished within a reasonable time, and
if it is tried by a committee, the same shall submit its report and
findings to the council within ten days after the conclusion of the
trial, and the council shall decide the case within fifteen days from
the receipt of the report of the committee. If the trial is conducted
by the council itself, it shall decide the case within fifteen days
after the conclusion of the trial. The decision of the council shall in
all cases be appealable to the provincial board. The appellant shall
exercise this right by filing with the municipal president a written
appeal within fifteen days from the date he has been notified of the
decision, and if within this period no appeal is taken, the decision
shall stand final. In case of appeal, the municipal president shall
forward the case with all its records to the provincial board within
twenty days from the receipt by him of the appeal, and the provincial
board shall investigate the case anew and render decision thereon
within thirty days from the receipt of the records of the-case and its
decision shall be final and conclusive."
</p></blockquote>
<p> It will be noted that the jurisdiction conferred upon the
provincial board by the above-quoted legal provision—and it does not
appear that there is another altering it—, is the appellate one, it
being necessary, therefore, that charges filed against members of the
municipal police be acted upon or investigated, in the first place, by
the municipal council. This was neither done nor followed in the case
under consideration because the petitioner, so as not to submit to the
jurisdiction of the municipal council of, Alfonso, presented, as stated
by him in his notice of appeal Exhibit 6, "his waive of right to
declare before the Committee on Investigation" of said council, and it
appears that he presented absolutely no evidence before said body in
support of his complaint. This simply means that in interposing his
appeal from the resolution dismissing his complaint on the ground of
desistance on his part, he did so with the sole purpose of transferring
the jurisdiction conferred by law upon the municipal council to the
provincial board of Cavite whose authority in cases of this nature
should only be exercised secondarily, that is, after action has been
taken thereon by the municipal council. Jurisdiction or authority to
try a certain case is conferred by law and not by the interested
parties, much less by one of them, and should be exercised precisely by
the person in authority or body in whose hands it has been placed by
the law. Therefore, the provincial board acted without jurisdiction in
trying the petitioner's charges and in ordering the dismissal of the
respondent policemen from their respective positions, after an
investigation conducted by it by halves. If it had any jurisdiction to
act upon the case at all, by virtue of the petitioner's appeal, it
should have confined its act to remanding the case to the municipal
council for the latter to take action thereon in accordance with the
law.</p>
<p> II. Taking into account the foregoing considerations, the Secretary
of the Interior did not commit any excess of jurisdiction because, the
act of the provincial board of Cavite, dismissing as it did the
respondent policemen without having authority to do so, being null and
void, inasmuch as it tried the complaint filed by the petitioner
against said respondent policemen originally instead of trying it only
on appeal, it was the Secretary's prerogative and even his duty, under
the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 88, which took effect on October
26, 1936, long before he rendered his decision in question, to
reinstate said respondent policemen in their positions. Section 2 of
said Act is sufficiently clear with respect to the fact that the
Secretary of the Interior is the person in authority called upon to
sanction the appointments to and removal from the police force and who
has said force under his immediate charge and direction, with powers to
carry out whatever may be advisable to promote the efficiency of its
service.</p>
<p> For all the foregoing, the remedy applied for is denied, without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Laurel, </em>and<em> Concepcion, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p> <em>Imperial, J.,</em> concurs in the result.</p></div>
