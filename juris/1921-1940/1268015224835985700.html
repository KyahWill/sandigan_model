</blockquote>
<p> A well stated in the brief of the appellant, the principal question
involved in this case is whether lot No. 778 aforesaid was community
property of the spouses Vicente Veloso and Josefina Gantuangco or
paraphernal property of the latter. If community property, the
appellant a the heir of the deceaed Vicente Veloso, are entitled to an
undivided half interest in the same. It is to be noted that the
genuinene of the deed of gift made by Josefina Gantuangco in favor of
the defendant is not questioned nor do we find in the brief of the
appellant any serious claim that Josefina had no interest in the lot
which he could donate to the defendant.</p>
<p> Upon the decisive issue whether said lot was the community property
of the spouses or the paraphernal property of Joefina, the evidence
both documentary and oral is conflicting. It appear that Vicente Veloso
and Josefina Gantuangco were lawfully married in the year 1877 and
lived for about two year in the municipality of Carcar in the Province
of Cebu; that they had no resources of their own and lived with the
mother of Josefina named Placida Regis. In 1879 Vicente served for one
year as assistant teacher with a alary of P10 a month. But a he was
given to drinking excessively and maltreated his wife, they separated
in the year 1880 and never lived together again. Vicente left home
without bidding farewell and since that time Josefina had no new of
him. She lived in the barrio of Valladolid in the municipality of
Carcar with her mother until the year 1890 when he moved to Manila.
Later he moved to Romblon where he remained till the year 1902 when he
returned to Cebu where he lived with her mother till her (Joefina's)
death in April, 1929.</p>
<p> Lot No. 778 was acquired in part in the name of Josefina by her
mother and after the death of the mother Josefina purchased the
remaining outstanding interest of Victoriana Regis with fund Josefina
inherited from her mother. We think the trial court was entirely
correct in rejecting the testimony of Dorotea Veloso, one of the
plaintiff, who was the only witness who attempted to assert that
Vicente Veloso had any interest in lot No. 778.</p>
<p> It is to be noted that Josefina obtained a Torrens title to lot No.
778 by virtue of a final decree of the Court of First Intance of Cebu
dated November 29,1921. Vicente Veloso died on October 1, 1921, and
Josefina on April 29, 1929. This suit was filed on June 21, 1929. The
fact that Vicente Veloso, in his lifetime, and his heir for so many
year after his death, took no action to challenge the Torren
certificate issued to Josefina by decree of the Court of First Instance
of Cebu in the year 1916 is a circumstance strongly corroborating the
direct evidence that Vicente Veloso had no interest in lot No. 778.</p>
<p> The judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs againt the appellant.</p>
<p> <em>Villa-Real, Abad Santo, Hull, </em>and<em> Diaz, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
