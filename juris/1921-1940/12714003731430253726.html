				<H3>BONEFACIA DE LOS SANTOS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VA. FATHER LAUREANO DE LOS REYES, AURELIO LAGMAN, AMBROSIO LAGMAN, SIMEON DUQUE, AND MARCELO SANTA CRUZ, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This action was originally commenced in the court
of the justice of the peace of Santa Rita, Pampanga, under section 80
of the Code of Civil Procedure to recover the possession of a piece of
land. The justice of the peace gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff.
From that judgment, the defendants appealed, and the Court of First
Instance having dismissed the complaint, the plaintiff in turn appealed
to this court.
<p> According to the agreed statement of facts, the rural estate
described in paragraph 2 of the complaint in this case was given in
lease to the plaintiff, Bonifacia de los Santos, by the parish priest
of Santa Rita, Pampanga, in May, 1915, for the rental price of P70,
payable yearly, under a verbal contract that specified no time, and
that Father Braulio Pineda himself received from the lessee, Bonifacia
de los Santos, the rents of said estate for the years 1916, 1917, and
1918.</p>
<p> In 1919 and under date of March 24 of that year, Father Tomas
Dimacali, as parish priest of the town of Santa Rita, issued a receipt
(Exhibit A) reciting that the plaintiff had paid to him the sum of
seventy pesos (P70) as rental for the period from May, 1919, to May,
1920.</p>
<p> It seems that Father Dimacali received instructions from the
Archbishopric of Manila to hand over to Father Laureano de los Reyes
the management of the estate, which belongs to a chaplaincy of Santa
Rita, and in July, 1919, Father Laureano de los Reyes through his
agents, the herein defendants, took possession of the land in question,
the subject-matter of the contract of lease.</p>
<p> Supposing that the lease is from year to year, as it began in May,
1915, it should have terminated in May of each subsequent year, unless
an extension or implied renewal of the contract has been effected. By
virtue of said contract, the plaintiff has been in possession of the
land, cultivating it until July, 1919, when she was turned out of
possession by the defendants. At that time, the contract of lease was
in force, it having been impliedly renewed on account of the plaintiff
having paid the rental for that year.</p>
<p> Under such circumstances, can the lessor terminate the contract by
requiring the lessee to return the property, and oust her therefrom?
Such is the question that presents itself for consideration, which, in
our opinion, must be decided in the negative.</p>
<p> The lower court found that upon demand of the defendant, Father
Laureano de los Reyes, the plaintiff had delivered the land without any
objection on her part, and, therefore, she was not turned out of
possession, as alleged in the complaint. We cannot accept this finding,
as in our opinion the testimony of the plaintiff, uncontradicted by the
defendant, Father Laureano de los Reyes, and corroborated by the
witness, Vicente Sibal, establishes the fact that she, the plaintiff,
refused to deliver the land, though she did not use any force. Indeed,
it is unbelievable that she should deliver the land voluntarily after
having paid the rent for the period 1919-1920.</p>
<p> The witness, Father Dimacali, attempted to contradict the contents
of Exhibit A, but there being no question as to the authenticity and
due execution of said document, the maker thereof cannot legally
gainsay what he spontaneously and deliberately stated in writing. </p>
<p>As to whether or not all the land was ready for planting, although
not devoid of importance, is not, however, decisive. It is the contract
that gives existence to, and supports, the action of the plaintiff. As
already stated, the contract was in force during the period from May,
1919, to May, 1920, and the plaintiff being in possession of the land
in the month of July, by virtue of the implied renewal of the contract,
she was entitled to be respected in her possession.</p>
<p> In the case of Schultz <em>vs.</em> Concepcion (32 Phil., 1), this court held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The act of entering and trespassing upon a parcel
of tillable land without the knowledge of the person who manages and
administers it is an act of usurpation and dispossession of real
property, performed by stealth, strategy or fraud, and is provided for
in section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended by Act No.
1778. An appeal from a judgment rendered in proceedings brought by the
person dispossessed should be filed within the period of five days
prescribed by section 88 of the said code and by section 2 of Act No.
1778."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> And in the case of Roman Catholic Church <em>vs.</em> Familiar (11 Phil., 310), this court laid down the following doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "A landlord can not summarily enter and dispossess
his tenant, even for nonpayment of rent, and until the lease is legally
terminated the tenant has a right to the possession. A tenant may,
therefore, institute summary proceedings under section 80 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, even against his landlord who has taken possession
without due process of law and against the will of the tenant. (Flor
Bago <em>vs.</em> Garcia, 5 Phil., 524.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion, and so decide,
that the plaintiff is entitled to the peaceful possession of the leased
property during the term of the contract, and, therefore, the judgment
appealed from is hereby affirmed in so far as it affects the defendants
Aurelio Lagman, Ambrosio Lagman, Simeon Duque, and Marcelo Santa Cruz,
who appear to be mere agents of their codefendant Father Laureano de
los Reyes, and reversed as to the latter who is hereby ordered to
deliver to the plaintiff, in accordance with the contract, the
possession of the land which is the subject-matter of the contract,
without special finding as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Johnson, Araullo, Street, </em>and<em> Avancena, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
