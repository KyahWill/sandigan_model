				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">In civil case No. 42163 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, Luneta Motor Co., Inc., <em>vs.</em> Nicanor de 
Guzman, the plaintiff attached the defendant's certificates of public 
convenience and the same were sold at public auction to said plaintiff. 
Said sale was approved by the Public Service Commission in cases Nos. 
33031 and 35810 and was confirmed by this court in cases Nos. 39902 and 
39903.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"> Luneta Motor Co., Inc., sold the same certificates 
for P4,000 to Laguna-Tayabas Bus Co. and both filed application in case 
No. 36603 praying the commission to approve the second sale. It was in 
this case where the appellant Raymundo Transportation Co., Inc., opposed
 the approval of the sale praying that it be given preference to buy 
said certificates for the same amount on the ground that it is an 
operator on the same Pililla, Rizal-Manila line and that to approve the 
sale in question would be to sanction a ruinous competition between it 
and the buyer. After due hearing, the commission denied the opposition 
and approved the sale. The oppositor appealed.</p>
<p align="justify"> The appellant assigns the following alleged errors 
in the decision appealed from:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> <em>"Error No. </em>1.—That the Public Service 
Commission erred in permitting and authorizing the appellee, 
Laguna-Tayabas Bus Co., to invade the territory of the herein appellant.</p>
  <p align="justify"> <em>"Error No.</em> 2.—That the Public Service 
Commission erred in perpetuating the ruinous competition in the line 
Pililla— Manila and in not attempting to protect the old existing 
operators in the said line, more particularly the appellant herein, 
knowing fully well that there is ruinous competition in the said line.</p>
  <p align="justify"> <em>"Error No. </em>3.—That the Public Service 
Commission erred in not holding that the appellant has a preferential 
right to acquire the line in question as pioneer operator in the said 
line, thereby avoiding ruinous competition.</p>
  <p align="justify"> <em>"Error No. </em>4.—That the Public Service 
Commission erred in denying the appellant's motion for reconsideration 
and rehearing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In approving the sale, the commission, based its 
decision on the following considerations, to wit: that the sale of the 
certificates to Luneta Motor Co., Inc., already constitutes <em>res 
judicata</em> on the ground that it was approved and sanctioned by final
 judgment; that the appellant had had opportunity to acquire the said 
certificates at the public auction but it did nothing to that effect; 
that the circumstances stated did not show that a ruinous competition 
would necessarily arise between the operators and that the objection 
based on this ground cannot be interposed in the case for the approval 
of the sale in favor of the appellee but that it should have been raised
 when the original operator had applied for the issuance of the said 
certificates, and that the appellant cannot successfully invoke the 
established doctrines on preference, improvement and increase of 
equipment on the ground that the case does not involve an application 
for new certificates.</p>
<p align="justify"> This court has carefully exa-nined the record and 
found nothing to support the appeal. The decision is supported by the 
facts and is in accordance with the general principles governing the 
matter involved in the case. The fact that the original operator did not
 succeed in his business for which reason his certificates were attached
 and finally sold at public auction, does not necessarily mean that his 
failure was due to ruinous competition because it might as well have 
been due to other causes, such as poor management. On the contrary, the 
acquisition of the same business by the appellee is an indication that 
it is not a poor one and that it may be continued with possibilities of 
obtaining a reasonable profit.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed,
 with the costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Butte,</em> and <em>Goddard,
 JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
