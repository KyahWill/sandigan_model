</div><p>Plaintiff is a domestic corporation with its principal office in the City of 
Manila. The defendant Jing Kee &amp; Co. is a partnership organized in Japan 
doing business there as well as in the City of Manila. The Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., 
is a corporation organized under the banking laws of the Empire of Japan with 
its principal office at Kobe. Koon Kee &amp; Co. is a duly organized and 
registered domestic partnership. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants Teng Kim 
Kiiy of Kobe, Japan, and Teng Kim Tong of Manila, P. I., are members of the 
partnership of Jing Kee &amp; Co., and that they are also members of the firm of 
Koon Kee &amp; Co, That December 18, 1919, the defendant Jing Kee &amp; Co. drew 
a draft on Koon Kee &amp; Co. of Manila for Y. 5,909.47, payable sixty days 
after sight. That the defendant bank endorsed the bill of exchange to the order 
of the Bank of the Philippine Islands. That it was presented for acceptance to, 
and was accepted by, Koon Kee &amp; Co. January 6, 1920. That at its maturity 
the draft was presented for collection to the drawee, dishonored and duly 
protested. Thereafter it was reaccepted payable April 5, 1920, at which time it 
was again presented and dishonored. That the plaintiff was a surety on a bond 
for the production of the bill of lading at the Customs House, Manila, for the 
merchandise evidenced by the amount of the draft. That the Collector of Customs 
required the production of the bill of lading or the payment of the amount of 
the bond. That in order to obtain it and to be released from its obligation 
under its bond, the plaintiff was compelled to, and did, purchase the bill of 
exchange from the Bank of the Philippine Islairds on August 3, 1920, for which 
it paid P7,845.94, and then became and is now the owner and holder of the draft. 
That the defendants are indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of the draft 
with interest thereon from August 3, 1920, until it is paid. Like allegations 
are made as to another draft amounting to P9,380.33. Plaintiff prays judgment 
against the defendants for the amount of both drafts, with costs.</p>
<p>The defendants Teng Kim Kuy and Teng Kim Tong demurred to the complaint upon 
the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action.</p>
<p>After the overruling of the demurrer, they filed an answer in which it is 
alleged that when the defendant Jing Kee &amp; Co. delivered the bills of 
exchange to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., it also delivered to the bank the bills of 
lading for the merchandise shipped by it to Koon Kee &amp; Co. with express 
instructions to deliver the bills of lading to the consignee only when the bills 
of exchange were paid. That the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., forwarded the bills of 
lading and the drafts to the Bank of the Philippine Islands with the same 
instructions, and that the plaintiff with intention of getting possession of the 
bills of lading paid the Bank of the Philippine Islands the amount of the 
drafts, and took possession of the bills of lading and the merchandise covered 
by them, and prays judgment for costs.</p>
<p>The Bank of the Philippine Islands was not made a party, and no service was 
made upon the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd.</p>
<p>In a well-considered opinion, the trial court rendered judgment for the 
defendants from which the plaintiff appeals, claiming that it committed error in 
presuming that it was the plaintiff who secured the merchandise evidenced by the 
drafts, in finding that, if the plaintiff did not receive the merchandise, it 
permitted a third person to do so and secured its value, and in finding that the 
drafts sued upon were without consideration, in rendering judgment dismissing 
plaintiff's complaint, and in overruling its motion for a new trial.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In legal effect, the answer of the defendants admits all of the material 
allegations of the complaint, including the fact that the defendants Teng Kim 
Kuy and Teng Kim Tong are members of the Japan firm of Jing Kee &amp; Co. and 
the Manila firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. Hence, we have this state of facts: The 
firm of Jing Kee &amp; Co. drew the drafts for the bills of lading attached on 
the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co., and the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., endorsed the 
drafts and delivered all of the papers to the Bank of the Philippine Islands. 
The drafts were duly presented to the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. and duly 
accepted and later dishonored. In the ordinary course of business the plaintiff 
became a surety on a bond for the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. for the production 
of the bills of lading at the customs house at Manila for the merchandise 
evidenced by the drafts. The Collector of Customs required the production of the 
bills of lading or the payment of the amount of the bond. To obtain it and to be 
released from its liability on the bond, the plaintiff was compelled to, and 
did, purchase the bills, of exchange from the Bank of the Philippine Islands, 
for which it paid their full value, and it then became and is now the owner and 
holder of the drafts. The complaint alleges and the answer admits that the 
plaintiff "was the surety on a bond for the production at the Manila Customs 
House of a bill of lading covering the merchandise for the purchase price of 
which said bill of exchange was drawn." Under this allegation, we have a right 
to assume that the bond in question was executed in the ordinary statutory form, 
and that it "was done to indemnify and hold the Collector of Customs harmless in 
the delivery of the merchandise to Koon Kee &amp; Co. upon whom the drafts were 
drawn. The bond was executed at the instance and request of that firm and for 
its sole use and benefit, and the plaintiff became its surety on the bond in the 
usual and customary manner. The primary purpose of the bond was to insure the 
delivery of the merchandise to the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. by the Collector 
of Customs. Otherwise, it would never have been executed. Hence, it must follow 
that in the ordinary course of business, the merchandise would be delivered to 
the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. If it be a fact that it was not or that it was 
delivered to the plaintiff or some third person, it would be a complete defense 
to the action. But the duty to allege and prove that fact devolved upon the firm 
of Koon Kee &amp; Co. Under the admissions made in the pleadings, all that this 
Court has before it is the fact, that the drafts were duly accepted by the firm 
of Koon Kee &amp; Co. and dishonored, and that the plaintiff purchased and paid 
the full amount of the drafts. The acceptance of the drafts <i>ipso facto</i> 
placed a legal liability upon the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. for their payment, 
which was not done, and for such reason they were purchased by the plaintiff. 
When the plaintiff acquired the drafts it became the owner and holder of all of 
the legal liabilities of Koon Kee &amp; Co. as acceptor. That is to say that 
Koon Kee &amp; Co. then became liable to the plaintiff as acceptor of the 
drafts, and it devolved upon the defendants to both allege and prove any defense 
which they had to such liabilities. This was not done. The defendants have not 
shown how or in what manner the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. was discharged or 
released from its liabilities on the drafts.</p>
<p>Article 127 of the Code of Commerce as to general co-partnership 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All the members of the general copartnership, be they or be they not 
managing partners of the same, are liable personally and <i>in solidum</i> with 
all their property for the results of the transactions made in the name and for 
the account of the partnership, under the signature of the latter, and by a 
person authorized to make use thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>In substance, the same provisions exist in article 148 as to a limited 
partnership.</p>
<p>The pleadings admit that the defendants Teng Kim Kuy and Teng Kim Tong are 
members of the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co., and the facts show the liability of 
Koon Kee &amp; Co. to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and one will be entered here in 
favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants Teng Kim Kuy and Teng Kim Tong 
jointly and severally for the sum of P17,226.27, with interest thereon from the 
3d day of August, 1920, at the rate of 9 per cent per annum, together with 
costs. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Ostrand,</i>

<div align="center"><br><br>RESOLUTION UPON PETITION FOR A REHEARING </div>
<p align="right"><i>March 31, 1923</i>.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The attorney for the defendants Teng Kim Kuy and Teng Kim Tong has filed a 
vigorous petition for a rehearing in which he contends that the holder of drafts 
accepted by a partnership one of whom is the managing partner cannot sue and 
recover from two partners who are not managers without making the partnership or 
the managing partner a defendant to the action.</p>
<p>There might be some merit in that question if it had been raised or presented 
in the trial court by an appropriate plea. But here, again, it appears that the 
question was not raised or presented in the lower court or even in this court 
until after its decision was rendered. There was no demurrer filed to the 
complaint or any suggestion that the corporation itself or its managing agents 
was not or should be made a party defendant. Counsel's principal difficulty 
seems to be that he construes the action as one against the drawer pnly and has 
failed to notice that the complaint also states a complete cause of action upon 
the acceptance.</p>
<p>The defendants' petition for a rehearing is denied.</p>
<p>The plaintiff also filed a petition for a rehearing in which it prays for a 
judgment against the firm of Jing Kee &amp; Co. as the original drawer of the 
drafts. The record is conclusive that Jing Kee &amp; Co. shipped the goods from 
Japan to the firm of Koon Kee &amp; Co. in ManiJa, with the express 
understanding that they were not to be delivered until the drafts were paid, and 
the drafts were stamped D. P., which, in commercial usage, means "do not deliver 
bill of lading until draft is paid."</p>
<p>Upon such a state of facts, the drawer of the drafts is not liable to 
plaintiff, and its petition for a rehearing is denied. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Ostrand,</i> and 
<i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
