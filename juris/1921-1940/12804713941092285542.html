				<H3>PEDRO REYES, PETITIONER, VS. JESUS M. PAZ AND THE JUDGE OF COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAMARINES SUR, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BUTTE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This is a petition for annulment of a judgment based
 on section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
</p><p align="justify"> It appears from the petition, and not controverted 
in the answer, that the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance 
of Camarines Sur, in civil case No. 5649 of said court, in which the 
respondent Jesus M. Paz was the plaintiff and the petitioner Pedro Reyes
 was the defendant on October 18, 1932, rendered a judgment by default 
against the defendant condemning the defendant to pay to the plaintiff 
the sum of P1,302.50 with legal interest; that the defendant in said 
case (petitioner here) entered no voluntary appearance in said case; 
that due summons was issued on June 20, 1932, requiring the defendant to
 appear and answer within twenty days after service of such summons. The
 deputy sheriff, Monico Imperial, made the following returns of service 
which was filed in said case:</p>
<p align="center"> "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<br>
"PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</p>
<p align="center">"PROVINCE OF CAMARINES SUR</p>

<div align="center">
    <blockquote>"I have this day served a copy of the within complaint 
and process upon Chino Yu Chan for the absence of the defendant Chino 
Pedro Reyes.</blockquote>
</div>
<div align="justify">
  <table align="center" border="0" width="50%">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td width="50%">&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="16%">(Sgd.) </td>
      <td width="34%">"MONICO IMPERIAL </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td><div align="right">"<em>Deputy Sheriff</em>"</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>
</div>
<p align="justify"> It is manifest at a glance that this return shows no
 legal service of summons in compliance with section 396, paragraph 6, 
of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, the court acquired no 
jurisdiction over the defendant and the judgment rendered against the 
defendant in said civil case No. 5649 is void.</p>
<p align="justify"> The defendant Reyes was apparently absent in China 
when said judgment was rendered and learned of it for tjie first time on
 or about June 23, 1934. Upon the allegation of his petition that a writ
 of execution on said judgment was about to be issued, this court 
granted a temporary injunction restraining the respondents from 
enforcing said judgment until the further order of this court.</p>
<p align="justify"> Section 513 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides 
in part:</p>

<div align="justify">
    <blockquote>"* * * The court shall summarily on notice to both 
parties hear such petition, upon oral or written testimony as it shall 
direct, and the judgment shall be set aside and a trial upon the merits 
granted, upon such terms as may be just, if the facts set forth in the 
complaint are found to be true, otherwise the complaint shall be 
dismissed with costs."</blockquote>
</div>
<p align="justify">In view of the complete record which we have before 
us as set out in the petition and in the answer with the accompanying 
exhibits, we have deemed it unnecessary to grant the motion of the 
petitioner that a commissioner be appointed and testimony taken. The 
judgment complained of being void is hereby set aside, vacated and held 
for naught, and it is directed that a trial upon the merits of said 
cause be had when said court shall have acquired jurisdiction over the 
defendant either by his voluntary appearance or by compulsory process 
lawfully served as shown by a proper return, with costs in this instance
 against the respondent Jesus M. Paz.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Imperial,</em> and <em>Goddard,
 JJ.,</em> concur.
