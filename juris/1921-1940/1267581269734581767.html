				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the applicant in a land registration case from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Mindoro denying the registration of various portions of the land described in the application.<br><br>The application for registration was filed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1914, the land being described as follows:<br><blockquote>"A parcel of agricultural land situated in Subaan, barrio of Tacligan, <i>poblacion</i> of San Teodoro,&nbsp; in the jurisdiction of the township of Calapan, of the&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Mindoro, Philippine Islands,&nbsp; bounded&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; north by the sea;&nbsp; on the south by&nbsp; the River Gumalpong; on the west by the lands of Modesto Alcones,&nbsp; Leon Redama and Macario Arguelles; and on the east by the&nbsp; lands of Pedro Quiambao, Patricio Dimalibot, Ambrosio Alban and the River Catmon. Said property has an area of 937 hectares&nbsp; and 50 ares."<br></blockquote>The document under which the applicant claims title to the land is a&nbsp; possessory information issued in 1894 and in which&nbsp; the land is described as situated in the place of Subaan,&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; of Tacligan, township of&nbsp; Calapan, and bounded&nbsp; on the north by&nbsp; the sea;&nbsp; on the south by the mountain; on&nbsp; the west by the lands of&nbsp; Alejandro Alcones and Lucas Gonzales; and on the east by the land&nbsp; of Alipio Alcones.&nbsp;&nbsp; The area&nbsp; is not stated.<br><br>A large number of oppositions to the registration&nbsp; of the land was presented and the case was not finally decided by the Court&nbsp; of First Instance until November 24,&nbsp; 1924. A range of hills called "Monte&nbsp; Lumang-Bayan" traverses the land described&nbsp; in the&nbsp; application from&nbsp; east to&nbsp; west, and in its decision the trial court held that this range must be considered "the mountain" referred to in the possessory information as the southern boundary&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land.&nbsp; The court therefore denied the application as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; land situated to&nbsp; the south of the hills mentioned and&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; that, upon&nbsp; the corresponding amendment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plan,&nbsp; the&nbsp; land situated to the north, with the exception of a small parcel in the eastern part of the land marked on the plan accompanying&nbsp; the&nbsp; application as "Ipd-70,&nbsp; connection,"&nbsp; be registered in the name of the applicant.<br><br>The principal&nbsp; point&nbsp; of controversy is the location&nbsp; of "the mountain" above-mentioned, the appellant contending that it&nbsp; must be&nbsp; Mount Alcon, and that he therefore is entitled to the registration of the entire tract described in his application.&nbsp; At first blush the appellant's contention seems plausible, but in our opinion it is sufficiently refuted&nbsp; by the&nbsp; uncontradicted testimony that Mount Alcon is situated very far from the land, and that between that mountain and the River Gumalpong which forms the southern boundary of the land described&nbsp; in the application, there is an extensive plain completely cultivated by persons other than the&nbsp; applicant.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is further to be noted that while the possessory information was issued under the provisions of article 19 of the Royal Decree of February 13, 1894, the so-called Maura Decree, and that it therefore, with a proper land description,&nbsp; might be considered equivalent to a title obtained&nbsp; by&nbsp; <i>composition gratuita</i>, it can hardly,&nbsp; in this instance, by reason of the vague and imperfect description of the land, be so considered unless accompanied by actual possession.&nbsp; The weight of the evidence shows clearly that the&nbsp; southern half&nbsp; of the land described in the&nbsp; application,&nbsp; so far from being in the possession of the appellant, is to a very large extent occupied by persons who, by themselves and through their predecessors in interest, have been there under a claim of ownership for more than the length of time required&nbsp; for the acquisition of prescriptive title.<br><br>The parcel marked "Ipd-70, confliction" was&nbsp; excluded by the court below on the ground that it had already been declared the property&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; in land registration&nbsp; case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 9560, instituted under&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of section&nbsp; 61 of Act No. 926.&nbsp; The appellant maintains that neither he nor his predecessors in interest had actual notice of the proceedings in said case; that he therefore was not&nbsp; a party&nbsp; to the action; and that the decision&nbsp; therein is not binding upon&nbsp; him.&nbsp; This question was decided adversely to the appellant's contention in the case of Aquino <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands (39 Phil., 850), as well as in other decisions of&nbsp; this&nbsp; court.&nbsp; A&nbsp; land&nbsp; registration&nbsp; proceeding is in the nature of a suit in rem; the decree entered therein operates directly on the land&nbsp; and, in the absence of fraud, is "conclusive upon and against all persons"&nbsp; (section 1, Act No. 496) though they may not have received actual notice of the proceedings.<br><br>The decision appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed with the costs of this instance against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avancena,&nbsp; C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.<br></div>
