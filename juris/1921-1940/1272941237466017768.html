				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">STATEMENT<br></div><br>Plaintiff alleges  that it is a general mercantile copartnership  duly  registered in the mercantile  register of the City of Manila, engaged in the sale and purchase of general merchandise, with its principal office at 1001 Calle Aceyteros in  the City of Manila.   That defendant is a foreign insurance company duly licensed to do business in the Philippine Islands,  where  it is represented by F. E. Zuellig, Inc., 90  Calle Rosario,  Manila.  That on April 20, 1926, the defendant undertook to and did insure against loss and damage by fire the property, goods, wares and merchandise of the plaintiff for the sum of  P30,000, -all of which  is evidenced by its policy No. 90119.  That on May 10, 1926, and while the policy was in full force and effect, the property therein described was  destroyed  by fire without  the fault  or  negligence  of  the plaintiff.  That  in accord with the terms and conditions of the policy, plaintiff notified the defendant of the fire and of its loss, and requested payment of the P30,000, the full amount  of the policy, and at  the same time submitted evidence  to  verify its claim, but that defendant, without  any legal  or just ground, refused  to pay the claim or any part of it.   Wherefore, plaintiff prays for a corresponding judgment against  the  defendant, with interest and costs.<br><br>For answer the defendant makes a general  and specific denial, and as a special defense  alleges that in the policy in question, it was agreed that in the event of loss, should the plaintiff make a fraudulent claim or any false declaration or use any fraudulent means or devices to obtain payment  for its  loss, the policy should become null and void. That  after the fire plaintiff  did present a claim under oath of its manager for P30,000, the alleged amount of its loss. That  said claim was false and fraudulent, in  that it was therein represented  that the value of merchandise at  the time of the fire was P32,523.30, whereas in truth  and in fact a large  part of the merchandise claimed and represented in plaintiff's proof of loss was not in the building at the time of the fire, and that the value of the merchandise which was actually  consumed or damaged by the fire was a very small  part of the claim made by the plaintiff, "and by  reason of such  fraudulent claim and false declaration made and used in  support  thereof, all benefit under said policy has been forfeited."  Defendant prays that  plain tiff's  complaint be dismissed, and that it have judgment for costs.<br><br>As a result of the trial, the lower court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for P16,000, with legal interest from June  10, 1926, and  costs, to which both plaintiff and defendant  duly excepted  and filed their respective  motions for a new trial which were overruled, and exceptions duly taken, from  which  both parties appeal, and the  plaintiff assigns the following error:<br><br><blockquote>"The lower court erred in rendering judgment against the defendant, sentencing it to pay the plaintiff the sum of sixteen thousand  pesos (P16,000)  only  instead of  thirty thousand pesos (P30,000),  which is the amount stipulated in the insurance policy, and  to  which the plaintiff has a right, in the light of the evidence adduced in this case."<br></blockquote><br>The defendant  assigns the following  errors:<br><br><blockquote>"I. The trial court erred  in admitting in evidence in  this case  over the objections of counsel for the defendant the alleged Chinese books of the plaintiff,  Exhibits  H and G, and the supposed  translations of parts of said books, Exhibits  L and M, the Secret Service report, Exhibit E,  the alleged invoices of the plaintiff, Exhibits  N-1 to N-104, with the supposed translations of those in the Chinese language.<br><br>"II.  The trial court erred in finding  that the reasonable amount of the loss suffered by the  plaintiff in this case by reason of the fire  in question was  P16,000, instead of  the sum of P4,823.20, as claimed by the  defendant.<br><br>"III. The trial court erred in failing to hold under  the evidence in this case that the plaintiff's claim for loss in the  sum  of  P30,000,  under  the policy  in question,  was fraudulent, and that false declarations and proofs had been made and used in support of said claim, by reason of which all benefits under the policy had been forfeited by the plaintiff.<br><br>"IV.  The trial court erred in failing to hold that  the plaintiff had violated condition 11, of  the policy, Exhibit B, by  refusing  to produce and deliver  to  the defendant  the invoices or duplicates thereof of the merchandise upon  demand of the adjusters.<br><br>"V.  The trial court  erred in rendering judgment in this case in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant  for the sum of P16,000, with legal interest thereon from June 10,  1926,  and costs, and in  not dismissing the  complaint, with costs against the plaintiff."</blockquote><br>JOHNS, <span style="font-style: italic;">J.</span>:<br><br>The policy in question purports to insure plaintiff's goods, wares  and merchandise against loss by fire in the amount of P30,000  between April 20, 1926,  and April  20, 1927.  Among other conditions, the policy provides:<br><br><blockquote>"11.  On the happening of any loss or damage the Insured shall forthwith  give notice thereof to  the Company,  and shall within  15 days  after  the loss  or  damage, or such further time as the Company may in  writing allow in that behalf, deliver to the  Company<br><br>"(a) A claim in writing for the loss and damage containing as particular  an account  as  may  be reasonably practicable of all the several articles  or items of property damaged or destroyed, and of the amount  of the loss or damage thereto respectively having regard to their value at the time of the loss or damage, not including profit of any kind.<br><br>"12. On the happening of any loss or damage the Company may, so long as the claim is not adjusted, and without incurring any liability, (a) Enter and take and keep possession of the building or premises where the loss or damage has  happened,  (b)  Take possession of or require to be delivered to it any property of the Insured in the building or on the premises at the time of the loss or damage,   (c) Examine, sort, arrange or remove all or any of such property,  (d) Sell or dispose of,  for account of whom it may concern,  any salvage or other  property taken possession of or removed.<br><br>"13. If the  claim be in any  respect fraudulent,  or if any false declaration be made or  used in support thereof, or if any fraudulent means or devices are used  by the Insured or anyone acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under this Policy; or, if the  loss or  damage be occasioned by the wilful act, or with the connivance of the Insured; or, if the  Insured or anyone acting on his behalf  shall hinder or obstruct the Company in doing any of the acts referred to in Condition 12; or, if the claim be made  and rejected and an action or suit be not commenced within three months after such rejection or  (in case of an Arbitration taking place in  pursuance of the 18th Condition of  this Policy) within three months after the Arbitrator or  Arbitrators or Umpire shall have  made their award, all benefit under this Policy shall  be forfeited."</blockquote><br>The fire in  question occurred on the 10th of May, 1926, and on the 14th  of May, the  plaintiff submitted proof of its  loss in the usual form verified by the oath of its manager, known  in the record as Exhibit  F,  to which  was attached what is known as the "Particulars of the Claim," which among other things recites:<br><br><blockquote>"When Goods are the subject of the claim the quantities and prices must be verified by Account Books and Vouchers, or by Independent Persons, the prices being the net market prices immediately before the fire, exclusive of any profits." And follows a description of the property lost and damaged in the fire, and its "Value before the fire," amounting to P32,523.30, together with a statement of  the  "Amount Claimed" as P30,000.</blockquote><br>It is vigorously  contended by the defendant  that this proof of loss and the "Particulars of the  Claim" are false and fraudulent, and that they were made with the  intent to mislead and deceive  as to the amount and value  of the goods in the building at the  time of the fire, and that  by reason thereof, under the terms and conditions of the policy, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover anything.  Prom our point of view, that is the important and decisive question in this case.   If plaintiff's proof of loss was made in good faith and  is substantially correct, then it  should have a judgment for the full  amount of its policy.  If, on the other hand, it is false and fraudulent and was knowingly and  willfully made with intent to deceive  and commit a fraud,  plaintiff ought not to recover anything on its policy.<br><br>On the morning of the fire  the manager  of the insurance agent and  a  Mr. Heintsch, one of its employees, went  to the building in question for the purpose of making an inspection, after which and upon return to their office, Henry Hunter Bayne &amp; Co., certified  public accountants and adjusters of fiue losses, were employed to take an inventory of the  damaged  merchandise  and to  adjust the amount  of the loss.  James R. Herridge and James  Chalmers  Glegg of that firm also went at once to the scene of the fire and placed  a guard around  the premises to see that nothing was  removed.  The evidence shows  that the fire was an ordinary one, and that it did not start in plaintiff's <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> but in those marked M and N on the plan Exhibit D. Plaintiff's  <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> were constructed mostly of stone,  and the roof was of iron and  strong materials, to which very little damage was done.  In  truth  and in fact,  plaintiff  was damaged much  more by water than  by fire.  May 11th p. m. Glegg and Zulueta of the firm of Bayne &amp; Company went to the plaintiff's  premises  where the  fire occurred, and took an actual, detailed inventory of all of the merchandise found in plaintiff's store and <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span>.  The merchandise in the store was not damaged  either  by fire or water, and all of it was turned over to,  and accepted by, the plaintiff, with an  estimated  value  of P1,453.13. It appears from the inventory which they  made, known in the record as Exhibit 8, that the merchandise and  effects in plaintiff's <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> after the fire was of  the  value of P4,823.20, and under the heading of the "Name of  Article," is listed all of the different articles and merchandise found in the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span>  after the fire, and under the heading of "Quantity definitely ascertained"  is given the  amount of each  specific article found there at that time,  and under another heading is a  statement  of  "Quantity estimated including that definitely ascertained" showing the  different estimates  as to  articles that may have been mutilated or destroyed by the fire, and under the heading of "Total Loss" is given the value of the amount  of each article, making a total  of  P4,823.20,  as  compared  with  the  total  of "P32,523.30," as claimed by the plaintiff.  For example, in plaintiff's proof of loss, claim is made for 100  cases of sardines of  the value of P915, and under this heading in the inventory of Glegg and Zulueta, Exhibit 8, appears 15 full cases,  2 broken cases and loose  tins 25 cases of the value of P228.75.   Plaintiff claims 60 cases of  salmon of the value of P630.  There is no salmon at all in Exhibit 8. Plaintiff claims  30 cases of condensed milk of the value of P523, and on Exhibit 8, there is  no condensed milk. Plaintiff claims 10 cases of Bear milk of the value  of P165. On Exhibit 8 appear 2 cases  only of Bear  brand milk of the value of P33.   Plaintiff claims 500 sacks of Mayaban rice of the value of P4,700, 200 sacks of Makan rice  of the value of P1,840, and 350 sacks of Tikitiki of the value of P1,225.  The corresponding entry on Exhibit  8  is Mayaban rice and Makan rice 20 sacks  of both kinds actually found and  150 sacks of both kinds estimated of the value of P1,380.   Tikitiki 492 sacks found and 500 sacks estimated of the value of P1,750.  Plaintiff claims chocolates and candies of the value of P3,500, cigars and cigarettes of the value of P8,500, fixtures in the bodega of the value of P800. On Exhibit 8, it appears that there are 3 cases of candy figs of the value of P15, and there are no  cigars or cigarettes.  Such is  a fair  comparison  between the two statements  as to the articles destroyed by the fire, from which it is very  apparent that either plaintiff's  claim  or the inventory made  after the fire  is false  and fraudulent.<br><br>After  Exhibit 8 was completed  showing that the value of the merchandise in the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> at the time of the fire was P4,823.20, Glegg, Zulueta and Heintsch, as the representative of the insurance company, went with Tan Chong  U, the manager of the plaintiff, and F. M. Britto to plaintiff's <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> for the purpose of checking the inventory made  by the adjusters and comparing it with the claim made by the plaintiff.  Arriving upon the scene, they  asked Tan Ghong U to point out to them where the missing merchandise and effects had been stored which he was unable" to do, and the only explanation which he could make was that the missing merchandise  and effect had been completely  consumed  by the fire,  and  that no trace of them whatever was left.  It also appears that Mr. Herridge on behalf of  the adjustors made demand upon  Tan Chong U as the manager  of the plaintiff to furnish him with  all the  invoices of the merchandise which the plaintiff claims to have stored in his <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> at the time of the fire, with the exception of the alleged invoices  of the cigars, cigarettes and candies, which were previously  delivered, in response to which Tan Chong U stated that it was impossible for him to deliver the invoices because many of them were not in his possession as he had made the purchases  in cash.<br><br>It further appears that immediately after the fire four different photographs were taken of  the merchandise as it appeared after the fire, all of which corroborate the inventory known as Exhibit 8 as to the  amount,  kind and quality of the merchandise in the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> at the time of the fire, and are  conclusive  proof  that plaintiff's claim for P30,000 is both false and fraudulent.<br><br>While it  is true that a small portion of the merchandise might have been consumed, and the evidence of its existence completely  destroyed by  the fire, yet in the very nature of things,  a large portion of it would  not  be destroyed, and some evidence  would be left by which the  amount, kind  and quality of it could  be substantially ascertained and determined.<br><br>Photography is an exact science.  Witnesses pro and con may testify falsely, but a photograph of a scene is not a false witness, and is conclusive evidence  of the actual facts appearing on the photograph.<br><br>Based  upon the oral evidence of the defendant, together with the photographs in question, which  convincingly show the  actual  conditions in  the  <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span>  immediately  after the fire, we are clearly of the opinion that plaintiff's  claim is false and fraudulent within the terms and definitions of the policy, and that the value of the merchandise destroyed by the fire would not exceed P5,000.<br><br>Although much latitude should be given to  the  insured in  presenting his proof  of claim  as  to the value of his loss, in particular as to the price,  kind  and  quality of the property destroyed,  yet where the proof is  conclusive, as in this case,  that the insured made a  claim  for  a  large amount of  property  which was never in  the <span style="font-style: italic;">bodegas</span> at the time of the fire and  for a much larger amount of property than was actually in the bodegas, it makes the whole  claim false and fraudulent, the legal  effect of which is to bar plaintiff from the recovery of the amount of its actual loss.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court  is  reversed  and the complaint dismissed, with  costs.  So  ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña C. J., Johnson, Street,  Malcolm, Ostrand,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Villa-Real, JJ</span>., concur.</div>
