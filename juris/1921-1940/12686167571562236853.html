				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The applicants reverse successful&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Abra in securing the registration&nbsp; in their names of the lands described in their application. The basis for the adjudication has a sale to them in 1876, long and continuous possession, and payment of the land taxes.&nbsp; It is undoubtedly true, however,&nbsp; as contended&nbsp; lay the appellants, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; declarations for tax purposes have gradually increased the area of the land&nbsp; of the&nbsp; applicants. But as against this, in the instant case, as pointed out by the attorney for the applicants, the oppositors&nbsp; have presented no proof to show that the applicants were&nbsp; tenants, no proof to show the filing of any, action in court to&nbsp; protect their interests, if they had any, and no proof&nbsp; to show payment of the land taxes.&nbsp; A somewhat similar&nbsp; case was recently before the Court, No. 34733, and was decided adversely to the appellants.&nbsp; But here the evidence&nbsp; is&nbsp; not even as strong as in that case.&nbsp; Accordingly, no reason is shown for disturbing in the slightest the conclusions and judgment of the trial court.<br><br>Judgment affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs of this instance against the appellants.<br><br>Ten days from the publication of this decision, judgment will be entered,&nbsp; and five days thereafter,&nbsp; the record will he remanded to&nbsp; the court below.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Street, Romualdez,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
