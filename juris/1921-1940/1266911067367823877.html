				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila, Wise &amp; Co. instituted civil case No. 41129 against Cornelio C. David for the recovery of a certain sum of money.&nbsp; David was an agent of Wise &amp;&nbsp; Co. and the amount claimed from him was&nbsp; the result of a liquidation of accounts showing that he was&nbsp; indebted in said amount.&nbsp; In said case Wise &amp; Co. asked an i obtained a preliminary&nbsp; attachment of David's property.&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid the execution of said attachment, David succeeded in having his Attorney Tanglao execute on January 16,&nbsp; 1932, a&nbsp; power&nbsp; of attorney (Exhibit A)&nbsp; in his favor, with the following clause:<br><blockquote>"To sign for me as guarantor for himself in his indebtedness&nbsp; to Wise &amp; Company of Manila,&nbsp; which indebtedness appears in civil case No. 41129, of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; and to mortgage&nbsp; my lot (No. 517-F of the subdivision plan Psd-20, being a portion of lot No. 517&nbsp; of the cadastral survey of Angeles, G. L.&nbsp; R. O.&nbsp; Cad. Rec No. 124), to guarantee the said obligations to the&nbsp; Wise &amp; Company, Inc.,&nbsp; of Manila."</blockquote>On the 18th of said&nbsp; month David subscribed and on the 23d&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in court, the&nbsp; following document&nbsp; (Exhibit B):<br><blockquote><center>"COMPROMISE</center><br>"Come now the&nbsp; parties, plaintiff by the undersigned attorneys and defendant in his own behalf and respectfully state:<br><blockquote>"I. That defendant confesses judgment for the sum of six hundred&nbsp; forty pesos&nbsp; (P640), payable at the rate of eighty pesos&nbsp; (P80)&nbsp; per month,&nbsp; the&nbsp; first payment to&nbsp; be made oh&nbsp; February&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1932 and successively&nbsp; thereafter until the&nbsp; full amount&nbsp; is paid; that plaintiff accepts this stipulation.<br><br>"II. That as security for the payment of the said sum of P640, defendant binds in favor of, and pledges to the plaintiff,&nbsp; the following real properties:</blockquote><blockquote><ol><li> House of light materials described under tax declaration No. 9650 of the municipality of Angeles, Province of Pampanga, assessed at P320.<br><br></li><li> Accesoria apartments&nbsp; with a ground floor of&nbsp; 180 sq. m. with the first story of cement&nbsp; and&nbsp; galvanized of iron&nbsp; roofing located&nbsp; on the lot belonging to Mariano&nbsp; Tablante Geronimo, said accesoria is described under tax declaration No. 11164 of the municipality of Angeles, Pampanga, assessed at P800.<br><br></li><li> Parcel&nbsp; of land described under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2307 of the Province of Pampanga recorded in the name of&nbsp; Dionisio&nbsp; Tanglao of which defendant herein holds a special power of attorney to pledge&nbsp; the same in favor of Wise &amp; Co., Inc., as a guarantee for the payment of the claim against him in the above entitled cause.&nbsp; The said&nbsp; parcel of land is bounded as follows: NE. lot No. 517 'Part'&nbsp; de&nbsp; Narciso Garcia; SE. Calle Rizal; SW. lot&nbsp; No. 517&nbsp; 'Part' de Bernardino Tiongco; NW. lot No. 508 de Clemente&nbsp; Dayrit;&nbsp; confaining 431 sq.&nbsp; m. and&nbsp; described in tax declaration No. 11977 of the municipality of Angeles, Pampanga, assessed at P423.</li></ol></blockquote>"That this guaranty is attached to the properties above mentioned as first lien and for this reason the parties agree to register this compromise with the Register of Deeds of Pampanga, said lien to be cancelled only on the payment of the full amount of the judgment in this case.<br><br>"Wherefore, the parties pray that the above compromise be admitted and that an order issue requiring the Register of Deeds of Pampanga to register this compromise previous to the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of the legal fees."</blockquote>David paid the sum of P343.47 to Wise &amp; Co., on account of the P640 which he bound himself to pay under Exhibit B, leaving&nbsp; an unpaid balance of P296.53.<br><br>Wise &amp; Co. now institutes this case against Tanglao for the recovery of said balance of P296.53.<br><br>There is no doubt that&nbsp; under Exhibit A, Tanglao empowered David,&nbsp; in&nbsp; his name, to enter&nbsp; into a contract&nbsp; of suretyship&nbsp; and a contract of mortgage of the property described in the document, with Wise &amp; Co.&nbsp; However, David used said power of attorney only to mortgage the property and did not enter into the contract of suretyship.&nbsp; Nothing is stated in Exhibit B to the effect that Tanglao became David's surety for the payment&nbsp; of the sum in question. Neither is&nbsp; this inferable from&nbsp; any of the clauses&nbsp; thereof, and even if this inference&nbsp; might be made,&nbsp; it would be insufficient to create an obligation of suretyship which, under the law, must be express and cannot be presumed.<br><br>It appears from&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing that defendant Tanglao could not have contracted&nbsp; any personal responsibility for the payment of the sum of P640. The only obligation which Exhibit B, in connection with&nbsp; Exhibit A,&nbsp; has created&nbsp; on the part of Tanglao, is that resulting from the mortgage of a property belonging to him to secure the payment of said P640.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; a foreclosure suit is not instituted in this case against Tanglao,&nbsp; but a purely personal action for the&nbsp; recovery of the amount&nbsp; still&nbsp; owed&nbsp; by David.<br><br>At any rate, even granting that defendant Tanglao may be considered as a surety under Exhibit B,&nbsp; the action does not yet&nbsp; lie against him on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that all the legal remedies against the debtor have&nbsp; not previously been exhausted&nbsp; (art. 1830 of the Civil&nbsp; Code, and decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of March 2,&nbsp; 1891).&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff has in its favor a judgment against debtor David for the payment of the debt.&nbsp; It does not appear that the execution of this judgment has been asked for and Exhibit B, on the other hand, shows that David has two pieces of property the value of which is in excess of the balance of the debt the payment of which is sought of Tanglao&nbsp; in his alleged capacity as surety.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the appealed&nbsp; judgment is reversed and the defendant is absolved from the complaint, with the costs to the plaintiff.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, Recto,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
