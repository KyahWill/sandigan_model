				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the accused
from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, sentencing
him for the crime of theft to one month and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>,
to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P1.20, with the
corresponding subsidiary imprisonment In case of insolvency, and to the
additional penalty of two years, four months and one day of <em>prision correctional</em>, the accused being a habitual delinquent,-with costs.
<p> The appellant assigns the following alleged errors as committed by
the trial court, to wit: (1) having found him guilty of the crime with
which he had been charged; (2) having sentenced him to the above-stated
penalty, and (3) not having dismissed the case.</p>
<p> The first assignment of alleged error is based upon the fact that
the appealed judgment states: "Upon arraignment, he entered a plea of
guilty." The appellant, without denying the fact in itself, contends
that the record does not show when, where or how he was arraigned.
According to him, neither does it appear of record that he has waived
the right to be arraigned. However, this court is of the opinion that
the statement in the judgment that the accused had been arraigned and
that he pleaded guilty is sufficient compliance with the provisions of
sections 16 and 25 of General Orders, No. 58, inasmuch as it may be
presumed from said statement that the law has been obeyed by causing
the accused to appear before the court, and it is shown thereby that he
has really been arraigned, his plea entered personally being that of
guilty. All this is not a mere conclusion as the appellant gratuitously
contends, because this court is of the opinion that generally a
conclusion is the averment or denial of a fact deduced from some
evidence, or the averment or denial of a point of law derived from a
law or principle of law. In this case, however, the court's averment in
the judgment that the accused was arraigned and that he pleaded guilty,
is not a deduction or consequence of an evidence, legal provision or
principle of law, but a positive statement of facts.</p>
<p> What difference would it make if the court, after hearing the
accused plead guilty upon arraignment, stated such facts in the
judgment rendered immediately, in open court and in the presence of
said accused, or caused said arraignment and plea of the accused to be
stated in the minutes ? Absolutely none. What is important and
essential is that the accused be arraigned and that he enter his plea.
It is immaterial how or in what manner such facts are stated. For legal
purposes, it makes no difference whether they appear in the minutes or
in the judgment itself.</p>
<p> The other error assigned by the appellant refers to alleged lack of
compliance with the provisions of section 15 of General Orders, No. 58,
inasmuch as, according to him, the record fails to show that he was
given the opportunity to appear and defend himself by counsel. The
presumption, however, is that the law has been obeyed. Furthermore, the
fact that the record fails to disclose affirmatively that the judge
advised the accused of his right to have counsel does not constitute a
reversible error (People <em>vs.</em> Lim Tiam, G. R. No. 44936, October 31,1936; People <em>vs.</em> Del Rosario, G. R. No. 44239, 62 Phil., 975).</p>
<p> Although the appellant has not raised any question relative to his
habitual delinquency, which has been taken into consideration by the
court in imposing upon him an additional penalty, this court is of the
opinion, in justice to him that said circumstance should not be taken
into consideration in this case on the ground that the allegations of
the complaint that the accused had already been previously convicted
twice of the same crime of theft, to wit: on October 6, 1933, one month
and one day, and on November 3, 1933, one month and one day, are
insufficient, in accordance with the doctrine laid down in the case of
People <em>vs.</em> Venus ([1936], 63 Phil., 435), and in other
subsequent cases decided by this court. However, as the aggravating
circumstance of recidivism, compensated by the mitigating circumstance
of plea of guilty, should be taken into consideration, end taking into
account the fact that the value of the thing stolen was P1.20,
modifying the appealed judgment, and pursuant to the provisions of
article 309, subsection 6, of the Revised Penal Code, the accused is
sentenced to the medium period of <em>arresto mayor</em> in its minimum and medium periods, that is, two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>,
to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P1.20, with the
corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay
the costs. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, </em>and<em> Laurel, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
<p><em> Judgment modified.</em></p><hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p align="center"> RESOLUTION ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>
<p align="right"> <em>July 20, 1937</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>CONCEPCION,</strong> <em>J.:</em></p>
<p> There is before this court a motion filed by the accused praying
for the reconsideration of the judgment rendered in this appeal.</p>
<p> The appealed judgment begins as follows: "The defendant is charged
with the crime of theft. Upon arraignment he entered a plea of guilty."
In the brief filed by him, the accused contended that "the record tells
nothing <em>when, where or how</em> the arraignment was made." Now the
appellant, in his motion, goes farther and avers that the above-quoted
statement of the judge "not only is not proven, but is' false." The
motion is not supported by any oath and to verify the sufficiently
serious averment made by the appellant, this court has re-examined the
record of this case and found:</p>
<ol><li> 1. That at the foot of the information filed in the
municipal court, which is the same used in the Court of First Instance,
there appears the printed word "Plea" followed by the words "not
guilty" written in ink, that is, the plea entered by the accused upon
arraignment in the municipal court. The word "guilty" in red pencil
appears written over the words "not guilty." This note or memorandum
must have been made by Judge Sabino Padilla's clerk immediately after
the appellant had been arraigned in the Court of First Instance of
Manila. This court's opinion is corroborated by the fact that on the
cover of the record of this case, the word "Oct." appears written after
the printed words "Date of pleading" and is followed by numerals
"20/36" in red pencil, representing the date of the appealed judgment.
Furthermore:<br>
    <br>
  </li><li> On page 18 of the record,
there is a copy of the letter addressed to the clerk of this court by
J. Recueneo, deputy clerk of the branch presided over by Judge Padilla,
stating: "* * * Said defendant (the herein appellant) is now confined
in jail and <em>pleaded guilty upon being arraigned of the complaint." </em>(Underscoring
ours.) Therefore, the averment to the effect that the above-cited
statement made by the judge in the judgment is false, is entirely
uncalled for.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li> The appellant absolutely
discredits said statement of the judge and is searching the record for
evidence in support thereof, without taking into consideration the fact
that under section 18 of General Orders, No. 58, "The arraignment must
be made by the <em>court or clerk </em>* * *." If the judge may
arraign the accused, it necessarily follows that when said judge states
in the judgment that "upon arraignment he entered the plea of guilty",
he had arraigned the appellant. The judge may state such facts in the
judgment and his statement on said matter requires no evidence in order
to be taken into account as a true fact.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>
The statement of the judge relative to arraignment has so much weight
that in case of discrepancy with the minutes of the clerk of court, the
word of the judge prevails (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Dineros, 18 Phil., 566).</li></ol>
<p> This court considers it very plausible for an attorney for the
defense to show much zeal and spare no effort to save the accused, whom
he represents, from conviction, but everything has its limits. The
attorney cannot disregard the record of the case and ignore the law in
order to make so imprudent an averment as he has done in the present
case. Such behavior provokes in the court a reaction adverse to praise
and applause, deserving at least an admonition.</p>
<p> The motion is denied. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, </em>and <em>Diaz, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
</p>

  CONCURRING</em><br>

<p><strong>LAUREL,</strong> <em>J., </em></p>
<p>I concur in the rejection of the motion for reconsideration <em>and no more</em>. On reading the motion I do not think that a situation has arisen calling for admonition to counsel de oficio in this case.
