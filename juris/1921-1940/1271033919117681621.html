				<H3>DONATO BAÑARES, PETITIONER, VS. TOMAS FLORDELIZA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF SORSOGON, AND JULIAN GAVITO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This petition for the writ of mandamus prays that an order be 
issued by this court to the Honorable Tomas Flordeliza, Judge of the Court of 
First Instance of Sorsogon, commanding him to set aside the order of default 
against the herein petitioner Donato Bañares, defendant in civil case No. 2191 
of the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon, to admit the answer filed by said 
defendant in said case, and to give him his day in court.
<p align="justify">From the instruments of record it appears that the necessary 
facts pertinent to the solution of the present proceeding, are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">In the month of November, 1916, by virtue of a writ of 
execution issued by the justice of the peace of Barcelona, Province of Sorsogon, 
in the suit filed by Eugenio Fortuno against Julian Gavito covering a sum of 
money, a piece of rice, hemp, and coconut land belonging to the defendant was 
levied upon on October 16, 1916. On November 4, 1916, the municipal sheriff of 
Barcelona, in compliance with said order, sold the said land at public auction, 
the highest bidder being the herein petitioner, Donato Bañares. The one-year 
period for redemption having expired, the municipal deputy sheriff, Isaac 
Camposano, executed the proper deed of sale in favor of said purchaser.</p>
<p align="justify">On October 18, 1927, Julian Gavito, whose property had been 
levied upon in said case, filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of 
Sorsogon against Donato Bañares, the purchaser of the land which was the subject 
matter of the execution, praying that said defendant be ordered to permit the 
plaintiff to redeem the land in question, to restore the ownership and 
possession of the same to the latter, and to pay damages at the rate of P100 a 
year, plus the , costs of the action.</p>
<p align="justify">On November 15, 1927, and within the regulation period, the 
defendant filed an answer to the complaint. Because a copy of said answer was 
not furnished the plaintiff, the latter, on December 12, 1927 filed a motion for 
default of said defendant, Donato Bañares.</p>
<p align="justify">On December 17, 1927, the Honorable Tomas Flordeliza, Judge of 
the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon, passing on said motion, issued an order 
declaring the defendant in default and authorizing the plaintiff to present his 
evidence in the absence of the former.</p>
<p align="justify">On February 9, 1928, and before the assignment of a date for 
the hearing of the case on its merits, the plaintiff, Donato Bañares, filed a 
miotion, duly sworn to, for setting aside the order of default, wherein it 
appears that he has a just and valid defense; and attached to said motion as 
integral parts thereof, were copies of documents alleging that the fai}ure to 
furnish the plaintiff with a copy of his answer was due to the fact that he 
believed that the doctrine laid down in the case of Gochangco vs. Dean (47 
Phil., 687), which held that the mere failure of the defendant to furnish the 
plaintiff with a copy of his appearance and answer, cannot, in itself, 
constitute sufficient ground for a declaration of default, was still in 
force.</p>
<p align="justify">The court, passing upon said motion, issued an order denying 
the same, considering the defendant's failure an inexcusable error, there 
existing later jurisprudence in the case of Gonzalez and Mauricio vs. Francisco 
(49 Phil., 747), to the effect that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As far as the record shows, no copies neither of the 
appearance nor of the answer, were served upon the plaintiffs; the documents 
were therefore not filed in accordance with the rules of the court and the 
defendant was in default when the case was tried and the judgment 
rendered."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The only question to decide in the present appeal is whether 
the respondent judge abused his discretion in refusing to set aside the order of 
default and in not permitting the petitioner to take part in the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">As we have seen, the only ground for the order of default was 
the petitioner's failure to furnish the other respondent, Julian Gavito, with a 
copy of his answer. There can be no doubt that such a failure is sufficient for 
a court to declare the defendant in default, and to refuse to set it aside when 
a motion to that effect is presented without a sworn statement of merit and 
evidence to establish them, as has been held in the last cited case. But when 
the motion to set aside the order of default was made without any loss of time 
and before a date was set for the hearing of the case on its merits,and is 
accompanied by a sworn statement of merit and copies of documents which 
constitute <em>prima facie</em> a just and valid defense, such failure is 
insufficient to deprive a defendant of his rights, as in the present case, and 
the refusal to set aside the order of default constitutes an abuse of 
discretion, and especially when such setting aside of the order of default will 
in no way prejudice the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, we are of the opinion, and so hold, that under 
the circumstances of the case the respondent judge committed an abuse of 
discretion in refusing to set aside the order of default here in question.</p>
<p align="justify">In virtue whereof, the remedy sought is hereby granted, and it 
is ordered that the respondent judge, the Honorable Tomas Plordeliza, set aside 
his order of default of December 17,1927, against the herein petitioner, Donato 
Bañares, as defendant in civil case No. 2191 of the Court of First Instance of 
Sorsogon, wherein Julian Gavito, one of the herein respondents, was plaintiff; 
to admit the answer filed by said petitioner, and to permit him to be heard at 
the trial, with the costs against said respondent Julian Gavito. So ordered.</p> <em>Avanceña, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</em> 
and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
