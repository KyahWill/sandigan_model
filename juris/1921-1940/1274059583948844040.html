				<H3>THE MUNICIPALITY OF TARLAC, PROVINCE OF TARLAC, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. TOMAS BESA, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED FABIANA SALAK DE BESA, AND JOSEFA MAGLANOC, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action instituted by the municipality of Tarlac for the 
expropriation of certain parcels of land belonging to the defendants Fabiana 
Salak de Besa et al. as being necessary for the extension of the street known as 
M. H. del Pilar, leading from the town to the railroad station of said 
municipality.</p>
<p>The case was heard in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac in accordance 
with the law. The trial court, following the report submitted by the committee 
which appraised one portion of 480 square meters of Fabiana Salak's land at P3 a 
square meter, and another portion of 2,355 square meters at P2.50 a square 
meter, that is to say, a total area of 2,835 square meters, amounting to a total 
sum of P7,327.50; and Josefa Maglanoe's land of 1,714 square meters at the rate 
of P2.25 a square meter, amounting to P3,856.50 in all, rendered judgment 
sentencing the plaintiff municipality of Tarlac to pay:</p>
<p>To the defendant Fabiana Salak de Besa, the sum of P7,327.50 with 6 per cent 
legal interest from February 8, 1928, until fully paid;</p>
<p>To the other defendant, Josefa Maglanoc, the sum of P3,856.50 with 6 per cent 
legal interest from February 8, 1928, until fully paid; and</p>
<p>To the commissioners, P4 each per session day, plus costs.</p>
<p>The plaintiff took exception to this judgment and asked for the reopening of 
the trial on the ground that the decision was contrary to law and to the 
evidence adduced by both parties. This motion was denied by the trial court, and 
the plaintiff duly excepted to such ruling, perfecting its appeal through the 
proper bill of exceptions.</p>
<p>The appellant assigns three errors of the trial court, and prays that the 
judgment appealed from be so modified as to reduce the prices of P3 and P2.50 a 
square meter given by the court to Fabiana Salak de Besa, and P2.25 a square 
meter to Josefa Maglanoc, to P600 and P500 per hectare, respectively, that is, 
at the rate of P0.06 and P0.05 a square meter, respectively.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that owners of property expropriated for public utility are 
entitled to just compensation according to the market price, taking into account 
the damages, if any, and the benefit to be derived therefrom by the owners. 
(Manila Railway Co. vs. Fabie, 17 Phil, 206; City of Manila vs. Corrales, 32 
Phil., 85; Manila Railroad Co. vs. Velasquez, 32 Phil, 286.)</p>
<p>Appellant's contention that expropriated property must be paid for according 
to the assessed value cannot be maintained, for this court has already ruled 
that while the assessed value of land may foe admitted in evidence, it is of 
little value in a judicial investigation to determine the market value of the 
property. (Tenorio vs. Manila Railroad Co., 22 Phil., 411; Manila Railroad Co. 
vs. Alano, 36 Phil., 500.)</p>
<p>There is nothing absolute about the rule that land declared agricultural for 
purposes of land tax must necessarily be agricultural, notwithstanding the fact 
that it is later used for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes. And 
in the case before us it is a fact agreed upon by the parties that the property 
expropriated was adaptable to residential purposes before the expropriation 
proceedings.</p>
<p>We do not believe the price of P3 a square meter paid by Jose Samson to 
Fabiana Salak for a certain portion of her land can serve as a basis in 
determining the market price of the lands expropriated, owing to the special 
circumstance that Samson had to acquire the land for the erection of an ice 
plant. The price of P3 a square meter is not a just compensation, nor the P0.05 
or P0.06 a square meter as contended by the representative of the municipality 
of Tarlac, whose council, in its resolution Exhibit 5, raised the price of the 
land affected by the extension of the road in question from P0.50 to P1.20 a 
square meter.</p>
<p>The record contains Exhibits F, G, and H, referring to rights of way acquired 
by the plaintiff municipality which paid the amounts of P0.40, P0.70, and P0.90 
a square meter for the construction of Hilario Street leading to the provincial 
road of San Miguel, which is different from the extension of M. H. del Pilar to 
the railroad station. The evidence we deem most pertinent is Exhibit 2 and 
Exhibit 4, showing that the municipality has paid P1.10 a square meter by way of 
damages to the owners of the land through which the extension of M. H. del Pilar 
passes to the railroad station of said municipality. The appellees contend that 
the price paid to Carlos F. de Villa-Abrille, Exhibit 2, and to</p>
<p>Ismael Bautista, Exhibit 4, is only for the use of their respective lands for 
the extension of said M. H. del Pilar; but this distinction is of no practical 
value for the municipality's right of way and the ownership it acquires by means 
of these condemnation proceedings are in effect the same, inasmuch as the right 
of way through the lands of Villa-Abrille and Bautista, and the ownership which 
the municipality acquires of the lands of the defendants for the extension of 
the aforesaid street, equally deprive the owners of said lands of the use 
thereof.</p>
<p>The defendants also contend that they have been damaged by this expropriation 
in that they shall not be able to do any planting on the expropriated land, and 
because the portions bordering on said road will be injured by the crumbling of 
the canals. However this may be, it is certain that the opening of this 
thoroughfare will benefit the abutting owners, as the value of their land will 
increase, being thereby more easily converted into residential, commercial, and 
industrial districts.</p>
<p>After considering all the circumstances of the present case we are of opinion 
that the defendants should be justly compensated by being paid at the rate of P1.10 a square meter for their land. And with this modification, the judgment 
appealed from is affirmed, without special pronouncement of costs. So 
ordered.</p>
