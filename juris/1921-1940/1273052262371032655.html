				G.R. No. 37372, July 26, 1932</h4>
				<H3>RICHARD SHERMAN, PETITIONER, VS. ANTONIO HORRILLENO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE, TWENTY-SIXTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT, ACTING JUDGE IN THE THIRTY-FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT, AND HERMAN SCHUCK, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an application for a writ of mandamus, to be directed to the 
respondent judge, praying that this court shall command him immediately after 
the receipt of such order, to annul all orders dismissing the appeal of 
petitioner and to allow saM appeal. The question arises out of a suit by Herman 
Schuck against petitioner in the justice oi the peace court of the municipal 
district of Talipao, Province of Sulu, in which after trial of the case, 
judgment was rendered in favor of said respondent. Thereafter, and within the 
period of time authorized by law, petitioner filed his notice of appeal and the 
said appeal was filed, registered, and docketed in the Court of First Instance, 
for the Province of Sulu, within the period allowed for making the appeal. 
Respondent, Herman Schuck, filed a motion to dismiss said appeal on the grounds 
that the petitioner had not complied with the "requirements of section 76, of 
the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by Act No. 3615.
<p>The respondent judge held, that the appeal had not been properly perfected 
according to law, and dismissed the appeal. This was a final disposition of the 
legal proceeding then pending in the Court of First Instance of Sulu.(Mejia 
<em>vs</em>. Alimorong, 4 Phil., 572.)</p>
<p>The allegations in the petition that there is no other plain, speedy, and 
adequate remedy in the ordinary courts of law wherein petitioner may enforce his 
rights as required by section 222, Code of Civil Procedure, cannot be admitted. 
(Fajardo <em>vs.</em> Llorente, 6 Phil., 426.) Petition denied, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Villa-Real, Abad 
Santos, Vickers, Imperial,</em> and <em>Butte, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
