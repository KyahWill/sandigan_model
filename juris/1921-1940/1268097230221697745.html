				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Two&nbsp; important&nbsp; questions are&nbsp; here&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; for&nbsp; our decision: The dismissal of the petitioner's election protest, and the inadmissibility of his amended&nbsp; protest.<br><br>The lower court explains&nbsp; its action&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"The protest&nbsp; of&nbsp; June 5,&nbsp; 1931,&nbsp; assails the proclamation and complains of the proceedings of the&nbsp; board of&nbsp; canvassers, and it is hardly necessary to declare that the contestant has adopted the wrong means.&nbsp; The&nbsp; proclamation is nothing more than proof of the election.&nbsp;&nbsp; The courts&nbsp; cannot revise the proclamation or&nbsp; the proceedings by which the board arrived at the result so&nbsp; proclaimed.&nbsp; This is especially so in this case, where the board of canvassers has not been impleaded.&nbsp; The jurisdiction of courts in election contests is over the&nbsp; ballots, not&nbsp; over the election&nbsp; returns, which are merely secondary&nbsp; or tertiary&nbsp; evidence. It is therefore clear that the contestant's original protest did not set out a sufficient ground of protest.<br><br>"The contestant has sought to cure the defect of&nbsp; the original protest by filing another on June 23,1931, attacking not only the proclamation or proof of the election,&nbsp; but the election itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment, however, was filed too&nbsp; late, the period&nbsp; of a fortnight following the proclamation having already expired when it was filed.&nbsp; The doctrine has been laid down repeatedly, that no amendment will be admitted after said period, where the same is so essential and basic as virtually to constitute a new protest.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Valenzuela vs. Carlos and Lopez de Jesus, 42 Phil., 428; Cailles vs. Gomez and Barbaza, 42&nbsp; Phil., 496; Tengco vs. Jocson, 43 Phil., 715; Orencia vs. Araneta Diaz, 47&nbsp; Phil., 830; Gallares vs. Casenas, 48 Phil., 362)."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pages 25 and 26, appellant's brief.)</blockquote>Counsel for the appellant rebuts these conclusions in the various assignments of error.<br><br>The&nbsp; alleged facts in the original protest&nbsp; are as follows:<br><blockquote>"2. That in said general election, according to&nbsp; the results of the voting in each and every one of the 27 precincts in said municipality&nbsp; and according to the inspectors' returns from each of said precincts, the contestant and the contestees,&nbsp; respectively, obtained the following number of votes:<br><blockquote>Votes Gaudencio Aquino, .................................................................1,697 <br>Crispin Calabia .................................................................................. 1,683 <br>Zacarias Sahagun ...............................................................................1,281</blockquote>"3. That according&nbsp; to&nbsp; these results, Gaudencio&nbsp; Aquino obtained 14&nbsp; votes&nbsp; more&nbsp; than Crispin Calabia,&nbsp; the next highest on&nbsp; the list of&nbsp; candidates voted for, and that Gaudencio Aquino should&nbsp; therefore have been proclaimed candidate elect for the office of municipal,&nbsp; president&nbsp; of San Pablo,&nbsp; Laguna, notwithstanding which, the municipal board of canvassers for the municipality of San Pablo, willfully, deliberately,&nbsp; and criminally, knowing they were about to commit a fraud, convened late at&nbsp; night, or&nbsp; about 3 o'clock in the morning of June&nbsp; 4, 1931,&nbsp; reduced&nbsp; the number of votes cast&nbsp; for Gaudencio Aquino from 1,697&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1,675, by subtracting 22 votes therefrom, in order&nbsp; to have a pretext for proclaiming, as they did proclaim,&nbsp; Crispin&nbsp; Calabia, candidate elect to the&nbsp; office of municipal president of San Pablo, by a plurality of 8 votes over Gaudencio Aquino.<br><br>"4. That in order to commit this fraud, the municipal board&nbsp; of canvassers of San Pablo made&nbsp; use of a falsified inspectors'&nbsp; returns, with&nbsp; reference to&nbsp; precinct No. 20 of San Pablo, showing that Gaudencio Aquino only obtained 31 votes for municipal president, when he really obtained 53 votes; and of this&nbsp; each and every member&nbsp; of the municipal board of canvassers was&nbsp; aware before proclaiming Crispin Calabia, for the election&nbsp; inspectors of precinct No. 20 had called the attention of the municipal board of canvassers to the falsified election returns considered by said board, and had showed it the authentic returns, the three tally&nbsp; sheets,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; certificate issued by the inspectors immediately after the&nbsp; count in said precinct, in every one of which it appears that Gaudencio Aquino had&nbsp; obtained 53 votes.<br><br>"5.&nbsp; That in order to perpetrate this fraud, the municipal board of&nbsp; canvassers of&nbsp; San Pablo connived with the municipal treasurer of said municipality, and such&nbsp; falsification is penalized by section&nbsp; 2639 of the Administrative Code as a&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Election Law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pp. 4, 5,&nbsp; and 6, appellant's brief.)</blockquote>The court below has held that it cannot revise the proclamation or the proceedings&nbsp; of the municipal board of canvassers in arriving at the results proclaimed.&nbsp; But the power which the law confers upon the courts in relation to election contests&nbsp; is, not only to revise the count but also to cancel&nbsp; it, declaring which of the contending candidates has, according to the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the case, been&nbsp; legally elected.<br><br>The Election Law (Act No. 2711) before it was amended by Acts Nos. 3030,&nbsp; 3210, and 3387, provided at&nbsp; the close of section 479, then 576:<br><blockquote>"Such court&nbsp; shall have exclusive and&nbsp; final jurisdiction, except as hereinafter provided, and shall forthwith cause the registration lists and&nbsp; all ballots used&nbsp; at such&nbsp; election to be brought before it&nbsp; and&nbsp; examined,&nbsp; and to appoint the necessary officers therefor&nbsp; and to fix their compensation, which shall be payable in the first instance out&nbsp; of the provincial treasury,&nbsp; <i>and&nbsp; to issue its mandamus&nbsp; directed to the board of canvassers to correct its canvass in accordance with the facts as found.</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics ours.)</blockquote>And in the subsequent amendments, in order to simplify the final disposition of election contests and bring about its practical&nbsp; results with&nbsp; as&nbsp; little delay as&nbsp; possible for the benefit of the public interests, it is provided that the court after trying the case shall declare in each instance who has been elected,&nbsp; and without any further canvass the candidate declared elected, according to the final judicial decision, is entitled to assume possession of the office as soon as the clerk of the&nbsp; court has given notice of&nbsp; such judgment to the board of canvassers and to the interested party.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vide Act No. 3030, sec. 44, and&nbsp; Act No. 3210, sec. 25.)<br><br>The object, then, of an election&nbsp; contest is precisely to correct the canvass of&nbsp; which the proclamation is a public manifestation, and certainly the power&nbsp; granted by law to the courts must agree with and be adequate&nbsp; to such an object, being limited before&nbsp; to ordering the board of canvassers to correct the&nbsp; canvass and now&nbsp; is enlarged to the extent of being able to make the canvass&nbsp; by itself, declaring directly which candidate is elected in consequence of which the canvass made by the&nbsp; proper board becomes null and void in order that the&nbsp; candidate&nbsp; so declared elected may, without any&nbsp; further canvass by the board&nbsp; of&nbsp; canvassers, assume possession&nbsp; of the office upon proper notice of the final judgment.<br><br>But the petition in the original protest under consideration is not&nbsp; <i>to&nbsp; revise&nbsp; the proclamation&nbsp; or the manner in which the board of canvassers arrived at the results pro- claimed</i>, but&nbsp; that&nbsp; "after due&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; contestant be declared elected."&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true that&nbsp; the&nbsp; contestant&nbsp; in his aforesaid protest assails the proclamation of the contestee as being&nbsp; false&nbsp; and fraudulent; but this statement is&nbsp; not an allegation of a ground or&nbsp; a prayer for the relief sought, and being mere surplusage&nbsp; which may very well be&nbsp; disregarded&nbsp; without in the least&nbsp; touching the force&nbsp; of&nbsp; the protest, it constitutes&nbsp; a mere expression of the contestant's&nbsp; attitude, who, on&nbsp; the grounds&nbsp; he alleges and for the ends&nbsp; he pursues,&nbsp; here&nbsp; alleges something which was&nbsp; un- necessary, that is, that he impeaches the declaration of his opponent's election made by the. board of canvassers.<br><br>Such a surplus allegation as is here made neither confers nor lessens jurisdiction over the subject matter.<br><br>What is important&nbsp; to consider in the contestant's first motion is whether the alleged facts constitute a sufficient ground for an election protest.<br><br>Our laws do&nbsp; not specify the grounds upon which protests of this kind are to be&nbsp; based; but an illustrious member of this&nbsp; court, Justice Ignacio Villamor, in&nbsp; his work entitled <i>Tratado de Elecciones</i>&nbsp; (A Treatise on Elections), in&nbsp; section 733,&nbsp; page 453,&nbsp; aptly and ably sums them up&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Every protest must be based upon those grounds which, according to law, would quash an election,&nbsp; invalidate it, or change its result.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first class refers to ineligibility of the winning&nbsp; candidate; the second, to the non-compliance of the mandatory provisions of the law, that is, the violation of the proceedings essential to election; and the last, to frauds committed at the polls or&nbsp; anomalies&nbsp; in the count of votes, which affect&nbsp; the election results."</blockquote>And the grounds alleged&nbsp; in the original protest&nbsp; under consideration belong to the third class enumerated&nbsp; in this work by Justice Villamor.<br><br>The North American cases have held that a mistake in the count of votes, whether made innocently or maliciously by the board of canvassers, is a good ground for contesting an election.<br><br>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; A mistake in the count of&nbsp; votes received by a candidate for an office made by the board of canvassers whether innocently or otherwise is also good ground for contesting an&nbsp; election."&nbsp;&nbsp; (20&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; 217,&nbsp; and cases cited therein.)<br><br>The original&nbsp; protest alleges that the municipal board of canvassers made&nbsp; use of a false inspectors' return in&nbsp; a certain&nbsp; precinct, showing by such unlawful means that&nbsp; the contestee, and&nbsp; not the contestant&nbsp; is the candidate&nbsp; elect: We deem such alleged&nbsp; facts to be a sufficient ground for an election protest.<br><br>Hence, we are of opinion that the dismissal of the motion of protest which&nbsp; gave rise&nbsp; to this proceeding&nbsp; was erroneous.<br><br>Passing to the amended protest, we&nbsp; note that it does not allege any fact different from those set forth in the original protest.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the amended&nbsp; protest attacks the proclamation and&nbsp; the&nbsp; election, whereas the original protest only assailed the proclamation,&nbsp; does not alter the protest.&nbsp; We have already&nbsp; held&nbsp; that such an&nbsp; expression is surplusage, and unnecessary in this protest.<br><br>Furthermore,&nbsp; the original protest also impugned the contestee's election, for that was the contestant's aim when he alleged that the election was fraudulent, for&nbsp; the reasons which he gave, and&nbsp; in praying&nbsp; that he,&nbsp; being the real candidate elect,&nbsp; should be declared&nbsp; so by the&nbsp; court.&nbsp; The fact that in the amended protest the production of the ballot&nbsp; box of&nbsp; the&nbsp; precinct and of the&nbsp; recounted&nbsp; ballots in court was requested,&nbsp; does&nbsp; not change the nature or scope of the original protest, nor deprives the court of the jurisdiction it had acquired over this&nbsp; case for in said protest, in the first place, the production of all the documents used in the election&nbsp; was already&nbsp; requested, and this included impliedly the&nbsp; ballots&nbsp; in the&nbsp; ballot box; and in the second place, in said first election protest, the legality of the contestee's proclamation as candidate elect was assailed upon the grounds&nbsp; there stated; we hold that, even though the contestant does not pray for it, the court may order the production of such ballots and ballot box if, in order duly to decide the questions raised&nbsp; in the protest,&nbsp; such production is necessary.&nbsp; The law authorizes such action&nbsp; on the part of the court both&nbsp; <i>motu&nbsp; proprio</i>&nbsp; and at the instance of the interested party, and such&nbsp; a prayer, which is not therefore jurisdictional, inasmuch as it refers&nbsp; to a mere evidence, and the&nbsp; granting&nbsp; of which is, in many cases, discretional with&nbsp; the&nbsp; court,&nbsp; was&nbsp; not necessary&nbsp; to be set forth in the original&nbsp; protest.<br><br>In our&nbsp; opinion the court <i>a quo</i> should have admitted the amended&nbsp; protest.<br><br>Counsel for the appellant contends that&nbsp; the motion of dismissal filed by the contestee, which originated the judgment appealed from, constitutes&nbsp; an implied admission of the facts alleged in the protest.&nbsp; We do not think so.&nbsp; Said motion for dismissal&nbsp; implies no admission, and its purpose is simply to raise before the court the question of jurisdiction over the&nbsp; subject matter, in view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contestee's opinion that the protest does not allege a good jurisdictional ground.<br><br>With reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the contestee having filed&nbsp; a counter-protest, he waived nothing in doing so.<br><br>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and it is ordered that the record be remanded to the court of origin for&nbsp; trial&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; merits, after admitting&nbsp; the amended protest,&nbsp; giving&nbsp; the contestee&nbsp; an opportunity to answer it, and the parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; produce evidence of their respective allegations, and&nbsp; later deciding the&nbsp; case in accordance with the facts proved and the law.<br><br>This judgment&nbsp; is rendered without express pronouncement of costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J.,&nbsp; Johnson, Street,&nbsp; Malcolm,&nbsp; Villa-Real,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><b>CONCURRING</b></center><br>VlLLAMOR, J., : <br><br>I agree with the conclusion of the court in this case.&nbsp; I simply desire to state that the citation of my humble work was&nbsp; not indispensable to such conclusion. Judgment reversed and case remanded with instructions. </div>
