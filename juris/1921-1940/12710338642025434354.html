				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On
August 22, 1923, while Roque Salomon was with some other persons
heaping up corn in the sitio of Sag-ang, municipality of La Castellana,
Province of Occidental Negros, the accused Ramon Vagallon arrived there
apparently to see his corn plantation. Then, according to Roque
Salomon, he was attacked by the accused with a bolo, but according to
Ramon Vagallon, he (Vagallon) was attacked by several persons who were
with Roque Salomon. In this fight Roque Salomon received one wound,
while Ramon Vagallon six.
  <p> The cause of the fight may
reasonably be attributed to the fact that the day previous to that of
the event, Roque Salomon, who, as suitor of the sister of Ramon
Vagallon had been living in the latter's house, was ejected therefrom
because the accused's sister having given birth to a child, Roque
Salomon was not in position to marry her. So that when the accused and
the offended party met on that evening with the resentment originated
by the preceding event, there was sufficient motive on the part of
either party for taking revenge. At any rate, the fight did occur, and
according to the theory of the prosecution, the accused, after
receiving six wounds and with his body stained with blood, went to his
house, which was not very far from the place of the event, and upon
relating to his mother what had happened, the latter gave him a lance
and with it he returned to the scene of the fight, and having met on
the way the girl Natividad Salomon, he threw the lance against her,
inflicting wounds upon her body, which caused her death on the
following day.</p>
  <p> On the other hand, the accused admits having
inflicted the wounds that caused the death of Natividad Salomon, but
that they were inflicted accidentally during the fight, that is, that
having thrown the lance against Roque Salomon, with whom he was
fighting, the latter avoided the blow, and the lance struck the girl
Natividad Salomon on one of her sides, as she was then behind the
combatants.</p>
  <p> There is, therefore, no doubt that the accused
caused the death of the girl Natividad Salomon. While the accused had
no intention to kill her, yet he is responsible for the consequences of
his acts.</p>
  <p> The trial court found the accused guilty of the
crime of homicide, and considering the commission of the crime to have
been attended by the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior
strength, not offset by any mitigating one, sentenced him to seventeen
years, four months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with
the accessories provided by law, to indemnify the family of Natividad
Salomon in the sum of P500 and to pay the costs of the action,
crediting the accused with one-half of the period of imprisonment
suffered by him as detention prisoner.</p>
  <p> Accepting, as we do,
the version given by the accused, as being more reasonable, of the
manner in which Natividad Salomon was wounded, we do not think it right
to take into consideration, as was done by the trial court, the
aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength. So that
eliminating said aggravating circumstance, the penalty provided in
article 404 of the Penal Code must be imposed upon the accused in the
medium degree, that is, fourteen years, eight months and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>,
and as thus modified, the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all
other respects, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns</em>, and <em>Romualdez, JJ</em>., concur. </p>
