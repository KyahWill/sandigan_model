				<H3>EL DORADO OIL WORKS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the 
State of California, with its principal office and place of business in the City 
of San Francisco, and there engaged solely in the manufacture and sale of 
cocoanut oil, and is duly licensed to transact business in the Philippine 
Islands, where it has a resident agent engaged solely in the purchase of 
copra.
<p>The defendant is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting Collector of 
Internal Revenue of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that during the year 1921, the plaintiff purchased 
copra from various merchants residing in the Philippine Islands of the value of 
P1,022,209.93, under the terms and conditions of which purchase the resident 
merchants sold and consigned the copra to plaintiff f. o. b. ship in Manila Bay, 
on all of which a merchant's tax of 1 per cent, under section 1459 of the 
Administrative Code of 1917, was paid by the respective sellers and consignors; 
that the defendant, acting under the pretended authority of section 1459, on 
April 4, 1922, levied and assessed against the plaintiff a merchant's tax of 
P10,222.08 which, with the surcharge of 25 per cent for delinquency, made a 
total tax, with the penalty, of P12,777.64, claiming that amount was due on the 
copra so purchased, which it demanded from plaintiff's resident purchasing agent 
in the Philippine Islands under the threat of a more severe penalty; that the 
tax was paid under protest and is unjust and illegal, for the reasons, first, it 
was not due; second, it is invalid; and third, that the merchandise upon which 
it was demanded was not exported or consigned abroad by the plaintiff. 
Plaintiff's written protest was overruled, and the defendant still refuses the 
return of the money, wherefore, plaintiff prays for judgment for the amount with 
interest.</p>
<p>For answer, the defendant admits all of the allegations of paragraph one of 
the complaint and makes a specific denial of all other matters alleged, and, as 
a special defense, pleads (<i>a</i>) that during the year 1921, plaintiff, 
through its purchasing agent, consigned abroad the merchandise in question; 
(<i>b</i>) that the defendant in his official capacity demanded from plaintiff 
an internal revenue tax of 1 per cent on the amount, plus 25 per cent for delay 
in the payment; (<i>c</i>) that in compliance therewith plaintiff paid the money 
under protest; and (<i>d</i>) that the collection of the tax is authorized by 
law.</p>
<p>The case was tried and submitted on "an agreed statement of facts," as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I. That the plaintiff is a foreign corporation organized and existing under 
and by virtue of the laws of the State of California, United States of America, 
wherein it is engaged solely in the manufacture and sale of cocoanut and other 
oils, with its principal place of business in the City of San Francisco, 
California, and having only a resident purchasing agent in the Philippine 
Islands, at the City of Manila, although duly licensed to transact business in 
said Islands; that the defendant is the duly appointed and acting Collector of 
Internal Revenue for the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>"II. That during the year 1921, the said El Dorado Oil Works of San 
Francisco, California, United States of America, through its resident purchasing 
agent in the Philippine Islands, purchased from various merchants resident m the 
Philippine Islands copra of the value of one million twenty-two thousand two 
hundred and nine pesos and ninety-three centavos (P1,022,209.93) under the terms 
and conditions of which purchases said merchants, resident in the Philippine 
Islands, sold the same to plaintiff, El Dorado Oil Works, of San Francisco, 
California, United States of America, f. o. b. (free on board) ship Manila Bay; 
that said merchants, upon delivering said copra as aforesaid, obtained, signed 
and executed all bills of lading pertaining to said shipments of copra; that 
said bills of lading directed shipment of said copra to plaintiff, at San 
Francisco, California; that upon presenting said bills of lading thus made out 
and signed, as aforesaid, said merchants were paid for said copra by plaintiff's 
resident purchasing agent.</p>
<p>"III. That on all of said copra so purchased the percentage tax of one per 
cent (1%), payable under section 1459 of the Administrative Code of 1917, was 
paid by the respective sellers prior to the date of the demand made upon 
plaintiff's resident purchasing agent by defendant.</p>
<p>"IV. That the defendant, in his capacity, as Collector of Internal Revenue, 
and acting under the alleged authority of section 1459 of the Administrative 
Code of 1917, on the fourth day of April, 1922, levied and assessed against 
plaintiff as tax due on the consignments of the copra set forth in the last 
preceding paragraph the sum of ten thousand two hundred twenty-two pesos and 
eight centavos (P10,222.08), together with a surcharge of twenty-five per cent 
(25%) thereof for delinquency in the further sum of two thousand five hundred 
fifty-five pesos and fifty-five centavos (P2,555.55), making a total tax and 
penalties of twelve thousand seven hundred seventy-seven pesos and sixty-three 
centavos (P12,777.63), and demanded same from the plaintiff's resident 
purchasing agent in the Philippine Islands; that plaintiff is not and never has 
been engaged in the sale, barter or exchange of personal property of any 
character whatsoever in the Philippine Islands, it being engaged solely through 
its said purchasing agent in the purchase of copra in the Philippine Islands 
which is shipped to the head office of plaintiff in the United States cf America 
as aforesaid.</p>
<p>"V. That plaintiff's said resident purchasing agent in the Philippine Islands 
for and on behalf of plaintiff, involuntarily and to prevent the exaction of 
further penalties, on the 11th day of April, 1922, paid under protest to 
defendant the sum of twelve thousand seven hundred seventy-seven pesos and 
sixty-three centavos (P12,777.63).</p>
<p>"VI. That plaintiff's protest was overruled and denied by defendant, who 
refused and still refuses to refund the sum above mentioned."</p></blockquote>
<p>Exhibits B and C, in the form of letters, are attached to and made a part of 
the stipulation.</p>
<p>The lower court rendered judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in the 
complaint, from which the defendant appeals, claiming (1) that the court erred 
in holding that the plaintiff was not subject to the tax under section 1459; (2) 
in allowing interest in favor of the plaintiff; and (3) in rendering the 
judgment.</p>
<p>Under the "agreed statement of facts," the question involved is the 
construction of section 1459 of the Administrative Code of 1917. It will be 
noted that the plaintiff is a foreign corporation organized under the laws of 
the State of California, with its principal office and place of business in the 
City of San Francisco, where it is engaged in the manufacture and sale of 
cocoanut oil and its by-products. Although it is duly licensed to transact 
business in the Philippine Islands, it has a resident purchasing agent only 
here. That under the terms and conditions by which the agent made all of the 
purchases in question, the copra was sold to the plaintiff, a foreign 
corporation, f. o. b. ship, Manila Bay. That the merchants from whom it was 
purchased signed and executed all bills of lading for its shipment, and directed 
the shipment of the copra to the plaintiff at San Francisco, and that upon 
presenting the bills of lading thus prepared and signed, the merchants were 
then, and not before, paid for the copra by the resident purchasing agent. On 
all such copra the percentage tax of 1 per cent, payable under section 1459, was 
paid by the respective owners and sellers prior to the date of the demand which 
was made by the defendant upon the resident purchasing agent for the tax in 
question. Notwithstanding the payment of the tax by the merchants who sold the 
copra, the defendant contends that the plaintiff should pay another sales tax 
upon the same copra because it was purchased here by its agent.</p>
<p>The following are the material provisions of section 1459:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Percentage tax on merchants' sales</i>.â€”All merchants not herein 
specifically exempted shall pay a tax of one per centum on the gross value in 
money of the commodities, goods, wares, and merchandise sold, bartered, 
exchanged, or consigned abroad by them, such tax to be based on the actual 
selling price or value of the things in question at the time they are disposed 
of or consigned, whether consisting of raw material or of manufactured or 
partially manufactured products, and whether of domestic or foreign origin. The 
tax upon things consigned abroad shall be refunded upon satisfactory proof of 
the return thereof to the Philippine Islands unsold. * * *</p>
<p>" 'Merchant,' as here used, means a person engaged in the sale, barter, or 
exchange of personal property of whatever character. Except as specially 
provided, the term includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own 
production and commission merchants having establishments of their own for the 
keeping and disposal of goods of which sales or exchanges are effected, but does 
not include merchandise brokers."</p></blockquote>
<p>At or about the time the instant case was submitted, this Court rendered a 
decision in Murphy <i>vs</i>. Trinidad (44 Phil., 649), in which the writer, 
though standing alone, vigorously dissented.</p>
<p>In paragraph one of the syllabus in that case, it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. INTERNAL REVENUE; MERCHANTS' TAX; EMBROIDERY MATERIAL SENT FROM 
ABROAD.â€”The merchants' tax imposed by section 1459 of the Administrative Code 
must be paid by a person who sends material to the Philippine Islands to be 
embroidered under the supervision of its local agent by whom the finished 
product is returned to the owner. The person so sending material to be 
embroidered and returned is engaged in the business of manufacture in these 
Islands and is a manufacturing merchant within the meaning of the Internal 
Revenue Law."</p></blockquote>
<p>The opinion says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The term 'merchant' is there defined as a person engaged in the sale, 
barter, or exchange of personal property of whatever character, and it is 
declared that tiie term includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own 
production. The American Import Company fulfills every requirement of this 
definition because it is engaged in the manufacture of Philippine embroideries 
and exports the finished product for sale in the United States.</p>
<p>"* * * and there is no reason why a foreign company, buying its material in a 
foreign market, should not be required to carry the weight of the investment, 
when such material is sent to this country to be converted into a finished 
product, the same as a local manufacturer who buys his material here, or in any 
market."</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision in that case is now the law of this Court, but upon the facts 
there is a very important distinction between the two cases. In the instant 
case, there is no claim or pretense that the plaintiff ever shipped any raw 
material to the Philippine Islands to be manufactured into a finished product, 
or that it ever manufactured anything in the Philippine Islands, or that it ever 
sold any of its manufactured products in the Philippine Islands. The very most 
that can be said is that, through its agent, it purchased raw material here in 
the form of copra to be shipped to its plant in San Francisco, there to be 
manufactured into oil and its by-products, and the stipulation expressly recites 
that the shipper paid the sales tax prior to the shipment of the copra as a 
condition precedent and as one of the considerations of the payment of the 
purchase price.</p>
<p>In other words, under the contract of purchase, the copra was to be delivered 
to the plaintiff f. o. b. ship, Manila Bay, with the sales tax paid thereon by 
the seller who made the delivery.</p>
<p>The appellant's brief says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The lower court held that the plaintiff was not subject to the tax on 
consignments abroad, because it was not a merchant according to the definition 
of same given in section 1459 of the Revised Administrative Code. It is true 
that the plaintiff is not and never has been engaged in the sale, barter, or 
exchange of personal property of any character in the Philippine Islands 
(paragraph IV of Agreed Statement of Facts). It should be taken into 
consideration, however, that the plaintiff is a manufacturing corporation, 
licensed to transact business in this country and is engaged in the manufacture 
and sale of cocoanut and other oils in the United States (paragraph I of Agreed 
Statement of Facts). Inasmuch as plaintiff manufactures and sells oil, it comes 
within the definition of a merchant given in section 1459 above mentioned, which 
includes manufacturers who sell articles of their own 
production."</p></blockquote>
<p>The last statement is not tenable. The record shows that the plaintiff never 
did manufacture or sell oil in the Philippine Islands. That it only manufactures 
and sells oil in the United States. It is further contended that the plaintiff 
is the consignor of the copra and, as such, is liable for the payment of the 
tax. That contention is in direct conflict with clause two of the "Agreed 
Statement of Facts," above quoted.</p>
<p>We agree with the Attorney-General that it is the policy of the law to uphold 
rather than defeat revenue laws. But upon the stipulated facts, to require the 
plaintiff to pay a sales tax would violate every rule of statutory construction 
and would require a foreign purchaser of goods to pay as sales tax for the 
privilege of making the purchase, and, in legal effect, would be a tax on 
exports. Upon that question, a case square in point is A. G. Spalding &amp; 
Bros. <i>vs</i>. Edwards, Advance Opinions of the Supreme Court of the United 
States, No. 14, May 15, 1923, page 539; 67 L. ed., 865. It is there held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A sale by a manufacturer to a broker to fill an order from a foreign 
merchant is a step in the export, where the title passes when the property is 
delivered to the carrier, so that, under the terms of the Federal Constitution, 
it is not subject to tax, where the broker sends the manufacturer what is termed 
an export order, with directions to deliver the goods on board ship, marked for 
the foreign merchant, although the invoice is sent to the broker to enable him 
to secure a license and clearance at the customhouse, and the manufacturer 
secures a receipt from the carrier, which is sent to the broker, and by him 
exchanged for an export bill of lading in his own name."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the instant case, the record is conclusive that the plaintiff never "sold, 
bartered, exchanged or consigned abroad" any copra within the meaning of section 
1459 of the Administrative Code.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court includes both costs and interest in favor of 
the plaintiff. This was error. The judgment of the lower court is modified so as 
to eliminate both costs and interest, and in all other respects is affirmed, 
without costs in this court. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Johnson, Street,
