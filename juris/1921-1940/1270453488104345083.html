				<H3>ISIDRO BAMBALAN Y PRADO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. GERMAN MARAMBA AND GENOVEVA MUERONG, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The defendants admit in their amended answer those paragraphs 
of the complaint wherein it is alleged that Isidro Bambalan y Calcotura was the 
owner, with Torrens title, of the land here in question and that the plaintiff 
is the sole and universal heir of the said deceased Isidro Bambalan y Calcotura, 
especially as regards the said land. This being so, the fundamental question to 
be resolved in this case is whether or not the plaintiff sold the land in 
question to the defendants.
<p align="justify">The defendants affirm they did and as proof of such transfer 
present document Exhibit 1, dated July 17, 1922. The plaintiff asserts that 
while it is true that he signed said document, yet, he did so by intimidation 
made upon his mother Paula Prado by the defendant Genoveva Muerong, who 
threatened the former with imprisonment. While the evidence on this particular 
point does not decisively support the plaintiff's allegation, this document, 
however, is vitiated to the extent of being void as regards the said plaintiff, 
for the reason that the latter, at the time he signed it, was a minor, which is 
clearly shown by the record and it does not appear that it was his real 
intention to sell the land in question.</p>
<p align="justify">What is deduced from the record is, that his mother Paula Prado 
and the latter's second husband Vicente Lagera, having received a certain sum of 
money by way of a loan from Genoveva Muerong in 1915 which, according to Exhibit 
3, was P200 and according to the testimony of Paula Prado, was P150, and 
Genoveva Muerong having learned later that the land within which was included 
that described in said Exhibit 3, had a Torrens title issued in favor of the 
plaintiff's father, of which the latter is the only heir and caused the 
plaintiff to sign a conveyance of the land.</p>
<p align="justify">At any rate, even supposing that the document in question, 
Exhibit 1, embodies all of the requisites prescribed by law for its efficacy, 
yet, it does not, according to the provisions of section 50 of Act No. 496, bind 
the land and would only be a valid contract between the parties and as evidence 
of authority to the register of deeds to make the proper registration, inasmuch 
as it is the registration that gives validity to the transfer. Therefore, the 
defendants, by virtue of the document Exhibit 1 alone, did not acquire any right 
to the property sold and much less, if it is taken into consideration that, 
according to the evidence in the record, the vendor Isidro Bambalan y Prado, the 
herein plakitiff, was a minor. </p>
<p align="justify">As regards this minority, the doctrine laid down in the case of 
Mercado and Mercado vs. Espiritu (37 Phil., 215), wherein the minor was held to 
be estopped from contesting the contract executed by him pretending to be of 
age, is not applicable herein. In the case now before us the plaintiff did not 
pretend to be of age; his minority was well known to the purchaser, the 
defendant, who was the one who purchased the plaintiff's first cedula to be used 
in the acknowledgment of the document.</p>
<p align="justify">In regard to the amount of money that the defendants allege to 
have given the plaintiff and her son in 1922 as the price of the land, the 
preponderance of evidence shows that no amount was given by the defendants to 
the alleged vendors in said year, but that the sum of P663.40, which appears in 
the document Exhibit 1, is arrived at, approximately, by taking the P150 
received by Paula Prado and her husband in 1915 and adding thereto interest at 
the rate of 50 per cent per annum, then agreed upon, or P75 a year for seven 
years up to July 31, 1922, the date of Exhibit 1.</p>
<p align="justify">The damages claimed by the plaintiff have not been sufficiently 
proven, because the witness Paula Prado was the only one who testified thereto, 
whose testimony was contradicted by that of the defendant Genoveva Muerong who, 
moreover, asserts that she possesses about half of the land in question. There 
are, therefore, not sufficient data in the record to award the damages claimed 
by the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the dispositive part of the decision 
appealed from is hereby affirmed, without any express finding as to the costs in 
this instance. So ordered.</p> <em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns,</em> and 
<em>Villa-Real, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
