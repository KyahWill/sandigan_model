				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In cadastral case No.&nbsp; 17&nbsp; of&nbsp; San Manuel,&nbsp; Pangasinan, a large number of lots neccesarily&nbsp; cane&nbsp; under observation.&nbsp; Among others, sixteen lots,&nbsp; in&nbsp; whole or&nbsp; in&nbsp; part, were adjudged to the estate of Marcelo Quebral and Gonzalo Gozon. It is now for the appellate Court to determine&nbsp; if&nbsp; title to these lots should be adjudged to the appellees&nbsp; or&nbsp; to the various claimants as appellants.&nbsp; The&nbsp; lots in question have the numbers 40595, 40593, 40599, 40600,&nbsp; 40602,&nbsp; 40603, 40606, 40607, 40610, 40611, 40612, 40613,&nbsp; 40614,&nbsp; 40615,&nbsp; 40717, and 40722 of the,San Manuel cadastre.<br><br>Proceeding by a process of elimination,&nbsp; an examination of the till of exceptions will disclose that, as to Lots Nos. 40595, 40598, and 40600,&nbsp; no&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; appears to have been taken.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; the adjudication made toy&nbsp; the trial court us to these lots has become final.<br><br>With, reference to lot no, 40612, an examination of the&nbsp; bill of exceptions will disclose that an exception and motion for new trial was filed as to this lot, Tout that when the motion for a new trial was overruled, the exception was limited "en cuanto a los lotes Nos.", "but not including 40612.&nbsp; Hence, the adjudication made by the trial court as to this lot has likewise "become final.<br><br>With reference to lots Nos.&nbsp; 40607 and 40611, although there is evidence in the record which, is indicative of the fact that these lots may 'belong to one Cirilo Jornadal,&nbsp; yet it is conceded that nobody appeared at the trial to claim them.&nbsp; The judgment, therefore,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trial court as to these lots must be respected.<br><br>Of the ten lots which are, therefore,&nbsp; properly before the Court on appeal, our examination of the record leads us to conclude that the appellants have not made out a case regarding lots Nos.&nbsp; 40599,&nbsp; 40615 (portions A, B, C, and northern), 40717, and 40722.&nbsp; The&nbsp; documents pertaining to these four lots do not appear to identify the land. There is accordingly no justification&nbsp; for disturbing the findings of the&nbsp; trial court as to&nbsp; these lots.<br><br>We have left lots Nos . 40602,&nbsp; 40603, 40606,&nbsp; 40610, 40613, and 40614,&nbsp; Northern portion.&nbsp; Our&nbsp; view is that the appellants have&nbsp; sufficiently demonstrated titles to these lots.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have been in adverse possession for&nbsp; long periods of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have paid the land&nbsp; taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; In turn, it is not shown that they&nbsp; were tenants of the appellees,&nbsp; and even if the titles of the&nbsp; appellees extended to these lots, which is not at all certain,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; lost whatever&nbsp; titles they may have had to&nbsp; the lots by abandonment and lack of interest. It is our opinion that the trial court erred in adjudicating these lots to the estate of Marcelo Quebral and Gonzalo&nbsp; Goson.<br><br>In accordance with the foregoing, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed in so far as it relates&nbsp; to&nbsp; lots Nos.&nbsp; 40599,&nbsp; 40612,, 40615, 40717, 40722, 40595, 40598,&nbsp; 40600, 40607, and 40611, and will be reversed in so far&nbsp; as it refers to lots Nos. 40602, 40603, 40606, 40610, 40613, and 40614, Northern portion, and these last named lots will&nbsp; toe adjudicated to the respective claimants and appellants.&nbsp; Without special pronouncement as to costs in this instance, it will be so ordered.<br><br>Ten days from the publication of this decision, judgment will Toe entered, and five days thereafter, the record will&nbsp; be&nbsp; remanded to the court below.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Street, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
