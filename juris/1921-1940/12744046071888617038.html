				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case relates to the election for the office of municipal president of 
Jalajala, Province of Rizal. Manuel H. Roxas, the contestee, appealed from the 
decision rendered by the Court of First Instance of that province, the 
dispositive part of which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, it is held that at the general elections of June 2,1931 the 
contestant Gregorio J. Borja obtained one hundred and seven (107) lawful votes 
as against the contestee Manuel H. Roxas who only obtained ninety-two (92), both 
of them being candidates for the office of municipal president of Jalajala, 
Rizal; * * * and everything, with costs and incidental expenses in favor of the 
contestants herein and against the herein contestees, Manuel H. Roxas and 
Alejandro Felix.</p>
<p>"Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the municipal council of Jalajala, 
Rizal, in order that it may, as municipal board of canvassers, correct its 
election returns of the general elections held on June 2, 1931, in accordance 
with this decision, and proclaim those persons elected who are mentioned in the 
dispositive part hereof. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>At the general elections held on June 2, 1931, the contestant Gregorio J. 
Borja and the contestee-appellant Manuel H. Roxas were rival candidates for the 
office of municipal president of Jalajala, Province of Rizal. The former 
belonged to the Democrata Party while the latter was affiliated with the 
Nacionalista-Consolidado Party and both of them had been chosen by their 
respective groups. On June 3d of the same year, after all the legal votes cast 
in the only two precincts within the municipality had been counted, the 
municipal council of Jalajala, acting as the municipal board of canvassers, 
declared through resolution No. 25, series of 1931, that the appellee Borja had 
obtained 107 votes and the appellant Roxas 130, proclaiming the latter municipal 
president elect.</p>
<p>The appellee contested the appellant's election alleging, among other 
grounds, that 32 votes had been counted for him which were included in 56 
illegal votes cast by persons who had been declared not entitled to vote or take 
part in the election. With regard to this point, both parties admit and the 
court .held that through proceedings taken prior to June 2,1931, fifty-six 
electors had been excluded from the voters' list; but although due notice 
thereof was served on the election inspectors, a majority of them allowed 
thirty-two of those excluded electors to take part, and in fact, they did vote 
on the day of the election. Based on this fact which was admitted by both 
parties, the court deducted the 32 illegal votes from the total number obtained 
by the appellant Roxas, thereby resulting a plurality of 15 votes in favor of 
the appellee Borja.<br><br>The whole question is whether the court acted 
correctly in excluding the 32 votes illegally cast, from the appellant's votes, 
and whether such action is supported by any competent and convincing evidence. 
The evidence considered by the court, and upon which its finding is based 
entirely, is<br>circumstantial, because as a matter of fact, neither party 
adduced direct evidence. Said evidence is as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>" (1) In the southern part of this Province of Rizal, there is a large estate 
known as Jalajala, and within said estate is the municipality of Jalajala.</p>
<p>"(2) The estate belongs to the Borja family, from Pateros, Rizal, and one of 
the coowners is the contestant Gregorio J. Borja.</p>
<p>"(3) When application was filed for the registration of the title to the 
estate, not a few of the occupants presented an opposition, and many of them 
left the place going else where when the rights of the applicants were 
recognized by law and the judgments to that effect were executed.</p>
<p>"(4) During the period preceding the election, and with a view to the last 
general election, the partisans of contestant Borja obtained from this court 
decisions prohibiting some fifty-six electors from noting, who had been 
opponents in the registration proceedings of the estate.</p>
<p>"(5) Copies of these judgments were furnished the election inspectors in the 
two precincts of said municipality of Jalajala, some days before June 2, 1931, 
when the last general" election took place. </p>
<p>"(6) The majority of those inspectors were Nacionalista partisans, although 
by inclination or sentiment, fictitious or real, they are Communists, for these, 
among other, reasons: (a) That the then municipal president—who has, perhaps (or 
without perhaps), had a hand in their appointment—officially announced his 
candidacy for the governorship of this province in representation of the 
Communist Party; and (6) that the contestee Manuel H. Roxas was announced by the 
Communist paper Titis (Exhibit G), as candidate for representative of the second 
district of this Province of Rizal, .although, after all was said and done, he 
decided to be the Nacionalista candidate for the presidency of that 
municipality, and was officially announced<br>as such.</p>
<p>"(7) On the day of the election, thirty-two (32) out of those fifty-six 
electors with judgments against them, succeeded in voting in those two 
precincts, over the objection of the minority inspector who belongs to the 
Democrata Party, upon the specious ground that their names were already in the 
voters' lists. (Exhibits D, D-1, and E.)</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"As may be seen, had there been no manifest disobedience to the orders of 
this court, there would have been no reason for the protest of the petitioners 
herein with regard to the result of the election; but as thirty-two (32) people 
voted at the election without being entitled to do so, their votes must be 
deducted from the number obtained by the respondents herein, for it can hardly 
be conceived, in the opinion of the court, that those electors voted for the 
contestants and their partisans."</p></blockquote>
<p>It follows, therefore, that in finding that the 32 illegal votes were cast 
for the appellant, and in excluding them from the total number obtained by him, 
the court relied exclusively upon these facts established by purely 
circumstantial evidence: (<em>a</em>) That in the municipality of Jalajala there 
was a large estate belonging to the appellee and others; (<em>b</em>) that when 
these applied for the Torrens title to said estate, a number of persons opposed 
the registration; (<em>c</em>) that the fifty-six electors excluded were among 
those opponents; (<em>d</em>) that those fifty-six electors had been excluded at 
the instance of the appellee's partisans; (<em>e</em>) that the majority of the 
election inspectors were Nacionalistas, though of Communistic inclinations, and 
only one was a Democrata; (<em>f</em>) that the appellant was a candidate of the 
Nacionalista party but allowed himself to be announced by the Communist paper 
Titis as a candidate for representative of the second district of the Province 
of Rizal; and (<em>g</em>) that the thirty-two voters who voted illegally did so 
over the protest and objection of the Democrata inspector.</p>
<p>After carefully considering this aspect of the case, we are of the opinion 
that such circumstantial evidence is insufficient to lead us to the reasonably 
convincing conclusion that the aforesaid thirty-two illegal voters voted for the 
contestee-appellant. The necessary and sufficient circumstantial evidence in 
this case must be such that it should not lead to any other reasonably 
convincing conclusion than that such votes were cast for the appellant. The 
circumstance that those thirty-two excluded voters were among the opponents in 
the registration proceeding filed by the appellee; that they were so excluded 
from the voters' list at the instance of the appellee's partisans, and that the 
majority of the election inspectors were Nacionalistas with Communistic 
tendencies, does not constitute sufficient ground for reasonably, and without 
prejudice, believing that they all voted for the appellant, who was himself a 
candidate for the Nacionalista-Consolidado Party. To believe otherwise would be 
to admit that the voter is guided by selfish and partisan feelings, and that in 
casting his vote he follows neither his reason nor his own convictions.</p>
<p>The rule uniformly established in cases of this sort is that the party 
alleging that a certain number of illegal votes have been cast in favor of a 
candidate must adduce the best evidence to prove it, and clearly the best 
evidence, here would have consisted in the identification of the illegal ballots 
and the testimony of the voters who prepared them, which the contestant-appellee 
did not do in this case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * where the ballots cast by the illegal voters can be identified they 
should of course be rejected. Ordinarily, however, it is impossible to identify 
the ballots except through extrinsic evidence, and so the question must be 
solved by determining who the illegal voters were and then ascertaining how they 
voted. In this proceeding it is clear that the voter is in the best position to 
know for whom he voted, but circumstantial evidence is also competent to prove 
that fact; and where the facts and circumstances from which the finding is made 
are clearly established, and the inference is the only one which can fairly and 
reasonably be deduced therefrom, the court should not hesitate to act on 
circumstantial evidence and therefrom find the ultimate fact. * * * " (9 R. C. 
L., sec. 141, pp. 1149-1150.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is suggested in the appellee's brief that the burden of proving in whose 
favor the &amp;2 illegal votes were cast rested upon the appellant, as 
contestee, and that having failed to adduce competent evidence upon this point, 
he must suffer the consequence of such omission, by having the 32 votes deducted 
from him. We cannot approve this proposition, because in our opinion, it is not 
the true and best doctrine. Although this rule was followed in one case, we are 
convinced that the weight of authority holds that he who alleges that illegal 
votes have been cast must prove his allegation, and show, furthermore, that 
those votes were cast for his<br>opponent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon the theory that the illegal voter can be called as a witness and 
compelled to disclose for whom he voted (which is beyond doubt the true theory), 
it would be easy in such a case as the one stated to call the illegal voters and 
require them to testify to the fact. It still remains, however, a question 
whether they shall be called at the instance of the contestant upon the theory 
that the burden of proof is upon him to make out his case, or at the instance of 
the respondent upon the theory that because he is advantaged by the general 
result he must show that all illegal votes were cast for his opponent or suffer 
them to be deducted from his own vote. The court adopted the latter theory, but 
we think the safer rule would be for the contestant to show not only that a 
certain number of illegal votes were polled, but also to show, if he can, that 
they were cast for his opponent. It is not intended by this to assert that the 
rule above quoted from Duffey's case is positively erroneous, but only to 
intimate a doubt, and to express the opinion that the ordinary principle which 
requires the party holding the affirmative to prove the facts, and all the 
facts, necessary to make out his case, is the better rule, and that it will in 
all cases be safer to follow it. * * *" (McCrary on Elections, 4th edition, pp. 
367-368.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as it has been shown that 32 illegal votes were cast for the office 
of municipal president and that the evidence does not show for which of the two 
candidates they were cast, the election for that office is quashed because the 
number of illegal votes is sufficient to affect and alter the final result. In 
this connection we have not lost sight of the theory, upheld by some courts, 
that in such cases the illegal votes may be divided proportionately among the 
candidates; but we have arrived at the firm conviction that such a practice is 
not the best rule, nor is it supported by the weight of authority. When, for 
some reason or other, it cannot be determined for whom the illegal votes have 
been cast, and the number of such votes alters the result of an election, the 
same must be quashed with respect to the disputed office.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * An election cannot be allowed by law to depend on an uncertainty. The 
majority must be susceptible of proof. Accordingly the general .rule has been 
established that the reception of illegal votes at an election does not affect 
its validity unless it is shown that their reception affected the result; but 
that where so many persons vote in violation of the law that the result is 
placed in doubt if the illegal votes are excluded, the court should annul the 
election. * * *" (9 R. C. L., sec. 140, p. 1148 and cases therein cited.)</p>
<p>"While it is well settled that where enough illegal votes are cast at an 
election to change the result or leave it in doubt the election is void, yet it 
is equally well settled that the result of an election will not be disturbed 
because of illegal votes received unless the aggregate of such votes would 
change the result. * * *" (20 C. J., sec. 224, p. 182 and cases therein 
cited.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant's contention, contained m his first assignment of error, that 
the 32 illegal votes should not be deducted because the orders of exclusion 
issued by the court arrived two or three days before the election, but after the 
last day fixed by law for the revision of the voters list, is unfounded. Section 
437 of the Revised Administrative Code, which treats of the exclusion of names 
from the voters' list does not fix any period within which the court must issue 
the order and give notice to the inspectors; it does provide that the 
application for exclusion must be decided without delay, and that the decision 
should be communicated to the parties interested. Section 438 provides that upon 
receipt of a petition for inclusion or exclusion, the date and hour of its 
filing must be noted, and that the courts taking cognizance thereof must decide 
it within ten days thereafter. In default of allegation and proof that the order 
or orders of exclusion were issued, and notice thereof given, with unnecessary 
delay and outside the ten days fixed, it must be presumed that they were 
promulgated in accordance with law, and that notice thereof was given the 
inspectors within the legal period and as soon as the application or 
applications for exclusion and the evidence submitted by the parties had been 
duly considered by the court. Whereas, the law contains no positive provision 
declaring the orders of exclusion so issued illegal, and whereas it appears that 
they were received by the inspectors in time, several days before the election, 
it is held that such orders issued for the purpose of excluding the thirty-two 
voters in question, were valid, that the inspectors were in duty bound to 
correct the lists in conformity therewith, and that they should not have 
permitted them to vote.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and it is held that 
neither of the contending candidates has been legally elected to the office of 
municipal president of Jala-jala, Province of Rizal, and that the election for 
such office is quashed. In accordance with the provisions of section 483 of the 
Election Law, let a certified copy of this judgment be sent to the chief of the 
Executive Bureau and to the provincial board of Rizal.</p>
<p>One half of the costs and legal expenses of the first instance ands, those of 
this appeal shall be defrayed by appellant and appellee in equal parts. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Malcolm, Romualdez,</em> and <em>Villa-Real,

<div align="center"><br><br><br><em>DISSENTING 
<p></p></em></div>
<p><strong>STREET, VILLAMOR, and OSTRAND, JJ.</strong></p>
<p>Accepting the facts set out in the majority opinion, and especially the 
circumstantial evidence described on pages 3 and 4 thereof, and concurring as we 
do in the rules laid down for deducting illegal votes, we have little to say in 
support of our dissent so far as the appreciation of such circumstantial 
evidence is concerned.</p>
<p>In the present case the majority hold that the election of the municipal 
president.of Jalajala is illegal, because thirty two voters who were challenged 
and disqualified by the court from voting, were nevertheless permitted to cast 
their votes for the office of municipal president in the election held in the 
municipality of Jalajala, Rizal, on June 2, 1931, it being noted that the 
court's order disqualifying said voters was received by the election inspectors 
two days before the election. </p>
<p>According to the judgment appealed from, Borja obtained 107 votes in said 
election, and Roxas 124. The court, finding that the thirty-two disqualified 
voters had voted for Roxas, deducted them from him, leaving only ninety two 
votes for him. Hence this appeal.</p>
<p>That votes illegally cast in an election must be deducted is a question 
already decided in this jurisdiction. We are all agreed that in order to make 
such deduction evidence, either direct or circumstantial, must be presented to 
show which of the candidates received those votes. The difficulty arises when an 
attempt is made to ascertain in favor of which of the two contending candidates 
such votes were cast. The majority of the court maintain that the circumstantial 
evidence of record is insufficient to show in favor of which candidate those 
votes were cast.</p>
<p>The judge who took cognizance of the protest found, in view of the 
circumstantial evidence, that such votes were cast for the appellant, Roxas. 
With all due respect to the majority, we believe it is unreasonable to assume 
that the 32 votes challenged before the court by the appellee or his partisans, 
and disqualified by said court from voting, voted for said appellee. If, at the 
instance of the appellee, the court decided the petitions for exclusion against 
said voters, disqualifying them from casting their ballot in Jalajala during the 
past election, what reason is there for assuming that in voting, as they 
actually did, they would vote for the very person who challenged them, that is, 
the appellee? If the election inspectors of the minority to which the appellee 
belongs, objected to the admission of said voters at the polls, and 
notwithstanding that objection they were permitted to vote by the election 
inspectors of the majority, to which the appellant belongs, what motive can 
there be for assuming, that should such electors cast their votes, as they did, 
they would do so for the appellee Borja ?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the record shows that the thirty-two voters are followers or 
partisans of the appellant, and notoriously opposed to the owners of the 
Jalajala estate, whence they were expelled when registration proceedings were 
instituted, so that they even joined the so-called Communist group, one member 
of which set fire to the house on the Jalajala estate. How is it possible to 
believe or to imagine that such voters cast their votes for the appellee,</p>
<p>Gregorio J. Borja, who is one of the joint owners of that estate?</p>
<p>It is possible for a voter, for one reason or another, to abstain from voting 
in an election for a certain candidate belonging to his party; but, ordinarily, 
and in general, the electoral masses vote for the candidates of their party, or 
of the political affiliation or group to which they themselves belong. We think 
this is elementary in elections, and in judging of the conduct of men under 
certain circumstances, we believe the best resolution is that based upon the 
general rule and not the exception.</p>
<p>A careful consideration of all the circumstances we have mentioned, assuming 
that the thirty-two voters all voted at the election in question, at which only 
two candidates received votes for the office of municipal president, leads us to 
the inevitable conclusion that said electors voted illegally in favor of the 
appellant Manuel H. Roxas, and we are convinced that the court a quo did right 
in deducting the 32 disputed votes from him.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that the intervention of the thirty-two voters in 
the election here in question, was made possible by the disobedience of the 
election inspectors of th appellant's party to the order of the court directing 
the exclusion of said electors from the voters' list, and it is obvious that the 
innocent voters should not be made to suffer for a punishable act committed by 
the inspectors, by depriving them of the exercise of popular sovereignty 
appertaining to them, called suffrage.</p>
<p>We believe it would be interesting to review our jurisprudence and see in. 
what cases the court was obliged to annul an election in a precinct or 
municipality. In Manalo vs. Sevilla (24 Phil., 609 [decided in 1913] )f the 
election was annulled in the precinct of Jalajala, Rizal, in view of the 
following irregularities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) The registry lists were improperly prepared and signed;</p>
<p>"(2) not enough voting booths were prepared and furnished; there should be a 
booth for every 50 voters arid one for a fractional part thereof;</p>
<p>"(3) the ballot boxes were not presented to the public for inspection prior 
to the opening of the polls as required by law;</p>
<p>"(4) no person, aside from the election officials, was permitted inside the 
polling place except the person engaged in casting his ballot;</p>
<p>"(5) voters were not permitted freely to approach and enter the polling place 
or witness the balloting as required by law;</p>
<p>"(6) voters and the public generally were prohibited from approaching the 
polling place or entering the same;</p>
<p>"(7) voters desiring to vote were not permitted to approach or enter the 
polling place except in alphabetical order, and then only singly and as called 
by the policemen guarding the entrance;</p>
<p>"(8) the entrance to the polling place was guarded by officers of the law 
under instructions from the election officials to permit no one to enter except 
those designated by such officials;</p>
<p>"(9) the election was carried on as follows: The chairman of the board of 
inspectors called the name of a voter; the name was taken up by the policemen 
guarding the door and repeated to the body of electors which was kept waiting 
thirty meters from the polling place; the voter whose name was called, if 
present, thereupon stepped forward and was permitted to enter the polling place 
and vote; after he retired another name was called and the process 
repeated."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Gardiner <em>vs.</em> Romulo (26 Phil., 521 [decided in 1914]), the 
election wag declared null -and void in five precincts of the municipality of 
Camiling, Tarlac, on account of numerous frauds and irregularities, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) Irregularities in the selection of polling stations and the construction 
of the voting booths;</p>
<p>"(2) the disappearance of blank ballots after delivery thereof to the 
municipal treasurer, and the subsequent markings of the remainder by the various 
election boards;</p>
<p>"(3) frauds practiced by the inspectors in the preparation of the ballots of 
illiterate voters;</p>
<p>"(4) other irregularities and frauds in connection with the preparation and 
counting of the ballots;</p>
<p>"(5) intimidation and threats employed by Romulo and his partisans on the day 
of the election."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Lino Luna <em>vs.</em> Rodriguez (39 Phil., 208 [decided in 1918]), the 
court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has been announced in many decisions that the rules and regulations, for 
the conduct of elections, are mandatory before the election, but when it is 
sought to enforce them after the elections, they are held to be directory only, 
if that is possible, especially where, if they are held to be mandatory, 
innocent voters will be deprived of their votes without any fault on their part. 
The various and numerous provisions of the Election Law were adopted to assist 
the voters in their participation in the affairs of the government <em>and not 
to defeat</em> that object. When the voters have honestly cast their ballots, 
the same should not be nullified simply because the officers appointed under the 
law to direct the election and guard the purity of the ballot have not done 
their duty. The law provides a remedy, by criminal action, against them. They 
should be prosecuted criminally, and the will of the honest voter, as expressed 
through his ballot, should be protected and upheld."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Garchitorena <em>vs.</em> Crescini and Imperial (39 Phil., 258 [decided 
also in 1918]), the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Courts, of course, should be slow in nullifying and setting aside the 
election in particular municipalities or precincts. They should not nullify the 
vote until it is shown that the irregularities and frauds are so numerous as to 
show an unmistakable intention or design to defraud, and which do, in fact, 
defeat the true expression of the opinion and wishes of the voters of said 
municipality or precinct. * * * The rule is so well established that authorities 
need no longer be cited in its support that whenever the irregularities and 
frauds are sufficient to defeat the will of the people of the particular 
municipality or precincts the entire vote should be rejected and those who are 
guilty of such frauds and irregularities should be punished to the very limit of 
the law."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Valenzuela <em>vs.</em> Carlos and Lopez de Jesus (42 Phil., 428 [decided 
in 1921]), it was held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It must now be regarded as settled doctrine of this court that voters shall 
not be deprived of their votes by the mere failure of the election officers to 
comply with the formal prerequisites of voting, as for instance, with the 
requirements that an oath shall be administered to illiterate persons desiring 
assistance in the preparation of their ballots and that they shall be assisted 
by two inspector". In order to justify the rejection of such a vote it must 
appear that the irregularity, or irregularities, complained of were part of a 
fraudulent scheme to frustrate the free expression of the desires of the 
electorate."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Cailles <em>vs.</em> Gomez and Barbaza (42 Phil., 496 [decided also in 
1921]), the election in the second precinct of Bay, Laguna, was annulled because 
of the following irregularities, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) The secrecy of the vote was violated; the booths were hot installed in 
conformity with law, the inspectors entered the booths to electioneer and see 
what the voters were writing;</p>
<p>"(2) the will of many voters was defrauded, as they were not allowed to cast 
their votes freely, but were given ballots already prepared by the inspectors or 
leaders;</p>
<p>"(3) where coercion was practiced upon many other voters by the election 
inspectors by snatching, away from them their ballots and tearing them into 
pieces after reading them;</p>
<p>"(4) the illiterate voters were not required to take the prescribed oath of 
their incapacity;</p>
<p>"(5) the registry lists and the minutes of the election were not properly 
kept; and, lastly,</p>
<p>"(6) after the boxes were locked, the municipal secretary opened them and 
tampered with the ballots and mixed them."</p></blockquote>
<p>In Mandac <em>vs.</em> Samonte (49 Phil., 284 [decided in 1926]), the 
election was annulled in two precincts of Currimao, Ilocos Norte. The court 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We have carefully examined the 173 ballots found in the ballot boxes in the 
two precincts of Currimao and are persuaded that these ballots were altered 
after the election in such a way that, due to the erasures and rewriting found 
in many of the ballots of the protestant as well as in those of the protestee, 
it is really difficult, as the trial court held, to ascertain the true result of 
the election in that municipality with respect to the office of provincial 
governor."</p></blockquote>
<p>And recently in Demeterio vs. Lopez (50 Phil., 45, [decided in 1927]), it was 
held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Elections should never be held void unless they are clearly illegal; it is 
the duty of the court to sustain an election authorized by law if it has been so 
conducted as to give a free and fair expression of the popular will, and the 
actual result thereof is clearly ascertained. It has been held that gross 
irregularities not amounting to fraud do not vitiate an election. (20 C. J., 
181, sec. 222.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>And once more, citing 20 Corpus Juris, pages 179-181 it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * But the power to throw out an entire division is one which ought to be 
exercised with the greatest care and only under circumstances which demonstrate 
beyond all, reasonable doubt either that the disregard of the law has been so 
fundamental or so persistent and continuous that it is impossible to distinguish 
what votes are lawful and what are unlawful, or to arrive at any certain result 
whatever, or that the great body of the voters have been prevented by violence, 
intimidation, and threats from exercising their franchise."</p></blockquote>
<p>Comparing the cases cited with the contest under consideration, we see at a 
glance that there are no such irregularities, frauds, or violations-of the law 
here which produced the nullity of the election in a precinct or municipality; 
and, it will be seen further, that there is no difficulty in deducting the 32 
illegal votes in question and determining, with reasonable certainty, the result 
of the election, according to the evidence of record.</p>
<p>And without the necessity of repeating the same principles laid down by this 
Supreme Court in the cases cited recommending that extreme caution be used in 
the exercise of the power to annul an election authorized by law, we believe 
that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
