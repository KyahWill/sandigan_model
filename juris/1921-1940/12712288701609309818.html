				<H3>FAUSTA LANESTOSA AND BERNABE LAMES, PETITIONERS, VS. FRANCISCO SANTAMARIA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ILOILO, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a mandamus proceeding instituted by Fausta Lanestosa 
and Bernabe Lames to have this court issue an order directed to the Honorable 
Francisco Santamaria, Judge of First Instance of Iloilo, commanding him to admit 
the appeal taken by them from his judgment finding them guilty of resistance to 
authority and sentencing them to one year and eight months, and four years 
imprisonment, respectively.<p align="justify">The pertinent and necessary facts for the solution of this 
proceeding appear in the respondent judge's answer and are as follows: </p>
<p align="justify">On July 7, 1928, the herein petitioners, defendants in criminal 
case No. 8142 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo for the crime of 
resistance to authority, were informed of the judgment rendered against them by 
Judge Antonio M. Opisso, who presided over branch III of the said Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo. </p>
<p align="justify">On July 16, 1928, the warden of the provincial jail of Iloilo 
endorsed and forwarded to the Court of First Instance of the same province a 
written petition, signed by the petitioners and two other prisoners, wherein 
they voluntarily waived their right to appeal and prayed to be sent to Bilibid 
Prison at the earliest opportunity with the other prisoners, that is, on the 
21st of the said month. </p>
<p align="justify">The lower court ordered the petitioners to appear before it, 
and after having personally heard them, issued the following order: </p>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The accused, named Fausta Lanestosa and Bernabe Lames, 
convicted in this case, having appeared and stated to the court through the 
interpreter Mr. Garcia, that it is true that in their statement dated the 16th 
instant they waived their right to appeal and desired to be transferred to 
Bilibid Prison in Manila next Saturday, the 21st instant; </p>
<p align="justify">"The court does hereby hold the defendants above named to have 
withdrawn their appeal and waived their right thereto, and orders their 
immediate commitment to Bilibid Prison in Manila.<br><br>"It is so ordered.<br><br>"Iloilo, July 17, 1928. <br></p><p style="text-align: right;">"F. SANTAMARIA<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Judge</span>" </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On July 18, 1928, the same petitioners filed the following 
motion: </p>
<p align="center">"MOTION </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Come now the undersigned accused and pray the court to 
reconsider its order of the 17th instant and admit the appeal to be taken by the 
undersigned on the following grounds: </p>
<p align="justify">"That the undersigned signed tfre waiver of their right to 
appeal from the judgment in the above entitled case filed with this court, 
inasmuch as ever since the judgment of the present case was rendered, Mariano 
Lames, husband of Fausta Lanestosa and father of Bernabe Lames, did not put up 
the bond required by this court for the appeal to be taken by the undersigned; 
and because of this, they were desperate on account of the slight interest, or 
inability of said Mariano Lames to obtain the bond. </p>
<p align="justify">"That later on the undersigned, remembering the members of the 
family, especially Fausta Lanestosa who has at present a baby girl ten months 
old, and who is ill, according to information from her husband Mariano Lames, 
realized the gravity of the penalty imposed upon them, and are distressed at the 
thought of being separated from their families for so many years, if they are to 
be sent to Manila to suffer the imprisonment in the above entitled case without 
giving a bond or appealing therefrom. </p>
<p align="justify">"That it is very painful for a mother, like the undersigned 
Fausta Lanestosa, to leave a baby girl ten months old, if she is not allowed to 
withdraw the waiver of appeal in the present case, and the appeal to be taken, 
is not admitted due solely to her despair and, stated, she did not until later 
realize its fatal consequences in leaving for many years the dearest beings on 
earth. </p>
<p align="justify">"That this court has jurisdiction to reconsider the order dated 
17th instant, and to admit the appeal to be taken in the present case, inasmuch 
as the period fixed by the law has not yet expired; and the accused are hopeful 
of being saved from the sentence imposed, or at least to have it reduced when 
the case comes up before the Supreme Court, because thus they believe in the 
facts presented during the hearing of the present cases and from the dictates of 
their conscience that they are innocent of the accusation brought against them. 
</p>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore the undersigned pray the court to reconsider its 
order dated the 17th instant, considering the waiver of their right to appeal 
from the judgment as withdrawn, and admitting the appeal to be presented by the 
undersigned, within the period fixed by the law.<br> <br>"Iloilo, July 18, 1928.<br><br>"Respectfully submitted.<br> <br></p><div style="text-align: right;">"BERNABE LAMES <br></div><p align="justify">"FAUSTA D. LAMES<br> <br>"FAUSTA LANESTOSA"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The motion was called for hearing on July 21, 1928, and the 
respondent judge, having heard the petitioners, entered the following order: 
</p>
<p align="center">"ORDER </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"After hearing the motion presented on the 18th instant and 
signed by the defendants in this case, and having heard the said defendants, who 
failed to give a satisfactory explanation to the court as to why, in appearing 
before the court on the 17th of this month, they confirmed everything appearing 
in their petition filed on the 16th instant, their confirmation having been made 
in open court on the 17th instant, and the same having been the reason for 
issuance of the order of said date of July 17th, declaring the judgment rendered 
in this order final, the accused having waived their right of appeal, and in 
which order the commitment of the accused to Bilibid Prison in Manila was 
ordered, as the accused themselves had petitioned the court, and who orally 
prayed for their commitment to Manila today which is the day on which the boat 
leaves Iloilo for Manila. </p>
<p align="justify">"The court having issued the order dated the 17th instant 
stating that the accused in this case in their personal appearance in court and 
expressly waived their right to appeal, the court holds that it lacks 
jurisdiction to admit the appeal taken by the accused in their motion presented 
the 18th day of this month. </p>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the court denies the motion.<br><br>"It is so ordered.<br><br>"Iloilo, Iloilo, P. I., July 21, 1928.<br><br></p><div style="text-align: right;">"F. SANTAMARIA<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Judge of the 
Twenty-third Judicial</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">District, Branch I</span>" </div></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case of Macali vs. Revilla and Ocampo (48 Phil., 751), 
this court laid down the following doctrine: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE; PLEA OF GUILTY; WAIVER OF APPEAL; MANDAMUS.—While the court may legally render judgment convicting a defendant 
when the latter pleads guilty, and commit him to prison before the lapse of the 
fifteen days' period for perfecting an appeal, if he waives his right thereto, 
yet if the case is of a grave crime, such as homicide, it is the duty of the 
court to ascertain first if the accused has understood the nature and 
consequences of his plea of guilty and of his waiver of the appeal, and when it 
appears from the record that the accused was not well aware of the extent and 
meaning of his waiver, it is the duty of the court to admit the appeal that he 
may file within the period fixed by the law." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In that case, the petitioner was accused of the crime of murder 
and at his attorney's suggestion pleaded guilty; immediately thereafter he was 
sentenced, and through ignorance stated that he waived his right to appeal, and 
surrendered himself to the proper authorities, who thereupon proceeded to commit 
him to Bilibid Prison pursuant to the proper order issued. </p>
<p align="justify">In the present case, nine days after having been informed of 
the judgment against them, the herein petitioners voluntarily and in writing 
waived their right to appeal and prayed to be sent to Bilibid Prison at the 
earliest opportunity. The court wished to hear them personally before adjudging 
their petition, and it was only after having heard them that the order was 
issued admitting their waiver of their right to appeal and ordering their 
immediate commitment to Bilibid Prison in Manila. </p>
<p align="justify">The petitioners, therefore, had all the time they needed to 
ponder and consult upon the waiver they wished to make of their right to appeal 
before presenting it; and in voluntarily asking to be sent to Bilibid Prison at 
the earliest opportunity they were perfectly aware of the scope and meaning of 
such a'waiver. </p>
<p align="justify">The petitioners being willing to comply with the judgment 
imposed upon them, when the respondent judge granted their petition and ordered 
their immediate commitment to Bilibid Prison, the execution of said judgment 
began and said judge ceased to have jurisdiction over the same. </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Gregorio vs. Director of Prisons (43 Phil., 
650), this court laid down the following doctrine: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"2. ID.; ID.; CRIMINAL LAW.—A sentence in a criminal case in 
this jurisdiction may become final in two ways: First, by the lapse of fifteen 
days after the same is rendered and pronounced, and second, by compliance with 
the terms of the sentence. </p>
<p align="justify">"3. ID.; ID.; ID.; EXECUTION OF SENTENCE; DOUBLE JEOPARDY.—As a general rule, where the defendant has executed or entered upon 
the execution of a valid sentence, the court cannot, even during the fifteen-day 
period, set it aside and render a new sentence. To do so would be to put him in 
jeopardy twice."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, we are of the opinion and so hold, that the 
waiver of the right to appeal made by a defendant nine days after having been 
informed of a judgment of conviction, accompanied by a voluntary petition to be 
immediately committed to Bilibid Prison and the order of the lower court 
admitting said waiver and ordering their immediate commitment to Bilibid Prison, 
amount to a voluntary compliance with said judgment, and bring the trial judge's 
jurisdiction over the same to an end, "and this court cannot order said judge to 
reinstate the defendant's right to appeal. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the petition is denied, without special 
pronouncement as to costs. So ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</span>
