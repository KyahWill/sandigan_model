				<H3>ALBERTO REYES, PROTESTANT AND APPELLANT, VS. LUPO BITENG, PROTESTEE AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The protestant, Alberto Reyes, appeals from the decision of the Court of 
First Instance of Ilocos Sur declaring the protestee, Lupo Biteng, 
governor-elect of the said province, with costs and incidental expenses against 
the protestant.
<p>In the general elections held on June 2, 1931, the protestant, the protestee 
and Alejandro Itchon were candidates for provincial governor of Ilocos Sur. 
After a recount of all the votes appearing in the election returns, the 
provincial board of Ilocos Sur, acting as provincial board of canvassers, 
certified that the appellant, Alberto Reyes, had received 11,670 votes, the 
appellee, Lupo Biteng, 11,775 votes and Alejandro Itchon, 2 votes, and 
proclaimed the appellee duly-elected provincial governor.</p>
<p>On June 18, 1931, the appellant filed his protest against the appellee's 
election on the ground that the latter's plurality of 105 votes was due to the 
commission of frauds and irregularities in many precincts; that the election 
held in the joint precinct of Concepcion and Sigay was illegal and should be 
annulled, and prayed that the ballot-boxes involved .be opened and the votes 
therein recounted, after which he be declared the duly elected provincial 
governor.</p>
<p>On July 9, 1931, within the reglenientary' period, the appellee filed his 
answer in which he alleged various special defenses and interposed a 
counter-protest. In his defense, he declared that the election held in 
Concepeion and Sigay was orderly and valid and therefore should not be annulled, 
and that if the irregularities and frauds alleged by the appellant were 
committed, they only served t6 increase the number of votes illegally cast for 
the latter. In his counter- protest, he alleged that due to frauds and 
irregularities committed in many precincts, which deprived him of many valid 
votes, the appellant succeeded in obtaining the number of votes which he 
did.</p>
<p>Upon petition of the attorneys for both parties, the court appointed election 
commissioners who proceeded to recount the votes. After their reports had been 
submitted and evidence presented to substantiate them, the court found thatthe 
appellant had received 11,662 votes and the appellee, 11,778, or a plurality of 
116 votes in favor of the latter, who was proclaimed duly elected provincial 
governor.</p>
<p>Pending the appeal, the protestee died and his attorneys filed a motion for 
dismissal, which the attorneys for the appellant opposed. Following1 the 
doctrine established in the case of De Los Angeles <em>vs.</em> Rodriguez (46 
Phil., 595), in accordance with the provision of paragraph 3, of section 479 of 
the Election Law, the court dismissed the said motion on February 26, 1932.</p>
<p>We shall follow the same method adopted by the attorneys in their respective 
memorandums for a better understanding of this decision. The appellant assigns 
the following errors in the decision appealed from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I. The trial court incurred four errors in computation in counting the 
protestant-appellant's votes in precincts No. 2 of Santa Lucia, No. 3 of Santo 
Domingo, No. 5 of Tagudin and No. 4 of Candon.</p>
<p>"II. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in not considering as the appellant's 
votes 100 ballots in which he was clearly voted for by the names, nicknames and 
initials of names by which he is commonly known, as stated in his certificate of 
candidacy.</p>
<p>"III. The lower court erred in not counting 28 ballots, which are clearly 
valid votes, for the appellant by the rule of <em>idem sonans.</em></p>
<p>"IV. The lower court erred in holding that eight (8) ballots of the appellant 
were marked and rejecting them as such.</p>
<p>"V. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in rejecting the appellant's 
ballots-'Reyesâ€”100, 161, 171, 335, 343, 731, 1,105, 1,116, 1,195, 1,490 and 
1,896,' which contained no defect that might legally invalidate them.</p>
<p>"VI. The court <em>a quo </em>erred in not annulling the election held in 
precinct No. 6 of Santa Cruz, in spiteof documentary and oral evidence which 
clearly proved that grave irregularities and frauds were committed therein.</p>
<p>"VII. The presiding judge erred in not annulling the election held in the 
joint precinct of Concepcion and Sigay on the ground that the registration of 
voters took place on the day assigned exclusively for the correction of the list 
of voters and not during the two days assigned1 by law for that purpose, and on 
the further ground that persons not having the necessary qualifications to vote 
were registered therein. </p>
<p>"VIII. The lower court erred in adjudicating to instead of discounting from 
the appellee, Lupo Biteng, the 81 ballots marked 'Biteng-904' to 'Biteng-984', 
divided into nine groups, each of which was written by the same hand.</p>
<p>"IX. The presiding judge erred in not declaring that the election held in the 
municipal district of Suyo failed, or at least, in not deducting 51 of the 61 
ballots, divided into 15 groups each of which had been written by the same hand 
and filled out for illiterate voters who had not previously taken the necessary 
oath required by law.</p>
<p>"X. The trial court erred in permitting the voters, recorded with educational 
qualifications in the list of voters of Suyo who had been summoned at the 
request of the appellant and kidnapped by the appellee, to abstain from writing 
at the trial, precisely to prove that they were in fact illiterate and, 
therefore, could not have voted without somebody's help.</p>
<p>"XI. The court <em>a quo</em> committed an error in computation when it 
counted the protestee-appellee's votes in precincts Nos. 1 and 3 of Santa 
Lucia.</p>
<p>"XII. The trial court erred in admitting and considering as valid votes for 
the appellee, Lupo Biteng, 214 ballots wherein the names or words written in the 
space for provincial governor did not correspond to his name or initials or were 
among the names, initials or words appearing in his certificate of 
candidacy.</p>
<p>"XIII. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in admitting and counting 76 marked and 
countersigned ballots as valid votes for the protestee, Lupo Biteng.</p>
<p>"XIV. The trial court erred in not declaring the protestant, Alberto Reyes, 
duly elected provincial governor of Ilocos Sur, with costs and incidental 
expenses against the protestee-appellee, Lupo Biteng and his 
bondsmen."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first assignment of error, it is contended that the court committed an 
error in computation in counting the votes obtained by the appellant in 
precincts No. 2 of Santa Lucia, No. 3 of Santo Domingo, No. 5 of Tagudin and No. 
4 of Candon. It is alleged that the appellant was deprived of 2 votes in the 
first precinct, 1 in the second, 34 in the third and 5 in the fourth. The 
attorneys for the appellee admit in their brief the involuntary errors of 
computation in the precincts of Santa Lucia and Candon. We are of the opinion 
that the error assigned with respect to precinct No. 5 of Tagudin is also well 
founded inasmuch as the court noted on the reverse ,side of its order dated 
January 20, 1932, that through oversight, the 34 votes claimed by Reyes in said 
precinct had not been credited him. We believe that the appellant's contention 
regarding precinct No. 3 of Santo Domingo is unfounded because ballot 
"Reyes-157" claimed by him had been credited him in the decision wherein the 
conclusions of the trial court mentioned by the appellant refer to precinct No. 
1, not No. 3 of Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>The appellant is, therefore, credited with 41 additional votes under the 
first assignment of error.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>In the second assignment of error, the appellant claims 100 ballots rejected 
by the court on. the ground that the names voted for governor therein either are 
illegible or belong to persons other than the appellant. After examining these 
ballots one by one, we found that only ballots "Reyes-85" of precinct No. 1 of 
Santo Domingo and "Reyes-1094" of precinct No. 4 of Sinait are valid. In the 
rest, the names are either so badly written as to be illegible or, if legible, 
not the appellant's. He insists, however, that the ballots bearing the names "B. 
Reyes", "V. Reyes", "R. Reyes", "Alberto", "Berto", "Loberto" and "Cayong" 
should be considered valid and credited to him because he stated in his 
certificate of candidacy that in Ilocos Sur he is also known as Ruperto, 
Lamberto, Loberto, Edilberto, Norberto, Eriberto, Filisberto and Roberto and 
nicknamed Cayong and Berto.</p>
<p>We believe that the appellant's contention on this point is unfounded. 
Although this court had held in various decisions that the names and nicknames 
appearing in a candidate's certificate of candidacy may be taken into 
consideration in interpreting the voters' will or intention, in no case has it 
held that a candidate can claim ballots clearly written in the name of different 
persons, because this practice would convert the certificate of candidacy into a 
sort of net or artifice with which to obtain invalid or scattered votes or those 
cast for other persons. In the present case, the appellant's intention to 
appropriate votes not intended for him can be clearly inferred from the fact 
that he assumed other persons' Christian names. Section 404 of the Election Law 
clearly provides that the certificate of candidacy shall contain the candidate's 
signature, that, is, his real name and surname, while section 452 requires voter 
to write clearly the name and surname of the candidate he is voting for. In view 
of such simple and specific legal provisions, we cannot comprehend how a 
candidate would enlarge upon his certificate of candidacy in such a way as to 
convert it into an elaborate instrument to improperly increase the number of his 
votes. </p>
<p>With respect to the trial court's reasons for rejecting the other ballots 
bearing the names, B. Reyes, V. Reyes, R. Reyes, Alberto, Berto, Loberto and 
Cayong, it is not amiss to repeat what has already been said in former decisions 
regarding ballots written in the same manner. For the purposes of this decision, 
suffice it to say that in the cases of Mendoza <em>vs</em>. Mendiola (53 Phil., 
267); Abiera <em>vs</em>. Abiera (54 Phil., 793); Lazatin <em>vs</em>. Dayrit 
(56 Phil., 831); Dizon <em>vs</em>. Cailles (56 Phil., 695); Mendiola 
<em>vs</em>. Mendoza (56 Phil., 833) ; Baligod <em>vs</em>. Angoluan (56 Phil., 
835) ; and Sinogba <em>vs.</em> Reganit (p. 955, post), it was held that ballots 
bearing the initials of Christian names other than that of the candidate, are 
invalid even when the surname is correctly written. In the cases of Valenzuela 
vs. Carlos and Lopez de Jesus (42 Phil., 428); Cailles <em>vs</em>. Gomez and 
Barbaza (42 Phil., 496) ; Yalung <em>vs.</em> Atienza (52 Phil., 781); and Icay 
vs. Diapo (G. R. No. 30671, promulgated May 11, 1929, not reported), it was also 
held that ballots in which names alone or their derivatives are written must not 
be credited to any candidate. The same rule was laid down in the cases of 
Pontillas <em>vs.</em> Jurado (56 Phil., 829); Medina <em>vs.</em> Noble (56 
Phil., 833) ; Moral<em> vs</em>. Morales (56 Phil., 833); and Bayona 
<em>vs.</em> Siaotong (56 Phil., 831). In the case of Alegre <em>vs</em>. Perey 
(G. R. No. 31017, promulgated March 26, 1929, not reported) it was decided that 
ballots in which nicknames alone appear are not to be counted.</p>
<p>It is true that in the case of Mandac <em>vs</em>. Samonte (54 Phil., 706), 
it was held that certain ballots bearing the name or nickname alone of a 
candidate were valid, but such conclusion was arrived at because it was proven 
in that particular case that there was no other candidate for that office except 
that person known by that name and nickname. The same decision cannot be invoked 
in favor of the appellant in the present case because it has been proven that he 
was not the only candidate in Ilocos Sur in said election with the surname of 
"Reyes". Juan Reyes was a candidate for councilor in the municipality of San 
Vicente; Gregorio Reyes, for vice-president in Narvacan; Socorro Reyes, for 
councillor in Vigan; Teodoro D. Reyes, for vice-president in Santa Maria; A. 
Reyes, for councilor in Candon; Antonio Reyes, for president in the capital of 
Vigan; and Pedro Singson Reyes for representative. Although in the case of 
Mandac <em>vs</em>. Samonte it was held that the ballots bearing only the name 
or nickname were admitted because in that case there was only one candidate for 
the same office with the said name and nickname, this court has not adopted this 
rule in the other cases wherein the same question was raised. It will be seen 
from an examination of the decisions in the cases cited above that the rule 
uniformly followed by this court is that votes cast in which the name or 
nickname alone appears are not valid and should not be counted.</p>
<p>The appellant is entitled to only two votes under this assignment of 
error.</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>In the third assignment of error, the appellant claims 25 ballots rejected by 
the court either because they are illegible or the names voted for governor 
therein do not correspond to the appellant's.</p>
<p>After a careful examination of the ballots in question this court reached the 
conclusion that the appellant should only be credited with the following three 
ballots: "Reyes 42â€”Alvirto rallers", in precinct No. 3 of Santa Lucia, 
"Reyes-142-A: A. Reyes", in precinct No. 3 of Santo Domingo, and "Reyes-411: a. 
ries", in precinct No. 5 of Narvacan. These three ballots are valid and 
admissible by the rule of<em> idem sonans</em>. The names voted for governor in 
the remaining ballots are either illegible or do not correspond to that of the 
appellant.</p>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p>In his fourth assignment of error, the appellant claims that 8 ballots 
rejected by the court as marked, are good and valid.</p>
<p>We have examined all these ballots, with the exception of "Reyes-73", in 
precinct No. 1 of Santo Domingo, which could not be found in any of the 
ballot-boxes, and we are convinced that only two are valid: "Reyes-392: Alberto 
Yeryes", in precinct No. 3 of Narvacan, and "Reyes-894: alberto Reyes", in 
precinct No. 5 of Candon, not precinct No. 6, as erroneously stated on page 27 
of the appellant's brief. The remaining ballots are evidently inadmissible, 
being marked.</p>
<p>Under his fifth assignment of error, the appellant claims 11 ballots rejected 
by the court, either because they bear two names voted for governor, or, the 
appellant's name was written below the line and outside the space assigned for 
governor, or the appellant was voted for member of the provincial board.</p>
<p>From an examination of the ballots, except "Reyes-100" and "Reyes-1195", 
which could not be found in any of the ballot-boxes, it appears that only 
"Reyes-1105" is valid, on the ground that the voter's intention to vote for the 
appellant for governor is clear. He was compelled to write the appellant's name 
below the line assigned for governor because, not being able to write it 
correctly at first, he was forced to erase it twice. The remaining ballots 
cannot be credited to the appellant. The court justly rejected ballots, 
"Reyes-335" and "Reyes-1490" because the former is fraudulent containing lines 
and spaces for senator and representative for which no election was held in 
precinct No. 4 of Tagudin, and because in the latter the voter did not vote for 
the appellant but for Antonio Reyes, candidate for president of the municipality 
of Vigan. This is evident from the fact that the voter added the word 
"president" after the initial and surname "A. Reyes".</p>
<p>Under this assignment of error, the appellant has gained only one vote.</p>
<p align="center">VI</p>
<p>In the sixth assignment of error, the appellant seeks to annul the election 
held in precinct No. 6 of the municipality of Santa Cruz on the following 
grounds: (1) That no inspector was appointed to represent the democrata party in 
that precinct; (2) that the deceased appellee, with some of his leaders, 
remained in the polling place during the whole election, entered the booths 
where the electors prepared their ballots and induced them to vote for him; (3) 
that many voters who qualified by reason of education and knew how to read and 
write had been unduly assisted by persons who had not previously taken the 
necessary oath required by law; (4) that the voters' list and certain ballots 
had been falsified in order to allow absent and sick persons to vote, as in the 
cases of Bartolome Fabro and Severo Habon who were in Hawaii, Canuto Oville who 
was in Baler, Tayabas, Eusebio Ramirez who was in La Union, and Florentino 
Lasmarias who died a few days before the election after having been ill for many 
years; and (5) that 16 voters who qualified claiming to be property owners, and 
10 who qualified claiming to have held the office of councillor during the 
Spanish regime were permitted to vote with the help of other persons without 
previously taking the required oath that they did not know how to read or 
write.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the grounds alleged above are insufficient to 
annul the election held in the said precinct. It appears that the municipal 
council appointed Pio Salvio to represent the democrata party, although the 
party did not propose the appointment of any person to epresent it on the board 
of election inspectors. The said inspector Was proposed by the democrata party 
to substitute for inspector Hermogenes Gomintong, so that the party was in 
reality represented in that precinct.</p>
<p>With regard to the other frauds and irregularities alleged to have been 
committed in precinct No. 6 of Santa Cruz or Sevilla, the lower court, after 
carefully analyzing the evidence presented, declared that certain irregularities 
had reall" been committed. It excluded the illegal ballots, but arrived at the 
conclusion that the extent and nature of such irregularities did not justify the 
annulment of the entire election held in said precinct. Its findings are as 
follows:</p>
<p align="center">"PRECINCT NO. 6 (SEVILLA)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This precinct was located in and assigned to the voters of the barrio of 
Sevilla. The protestee was a native and resident thereof. There was no partisan 
strife for the, office of governor in that place. The election inspectors 
previously appointed by the municipal council of Santa Cruz were dismissed 
because of charges for violation of the Election Law filed against them by the 
provincial fiscal. But the truth of the matter is that Hermogenes Gomintong, who 
was an inspector of the democrata party and chairman of the board of election 
inspectors, is a first cousin of the protestee, Biteng, the nacionalista 
candidate for governor. His successor was proposed by no other than the 
representative of the democrata party to act as a substitute in another 
precinct. No proceeding for the appointment of any other democrata inspector for 
the precinct in question was ever instituted in any court of justice.</p>
<p>"There is absolutely no doubt but that a great majority of the voters in this 
precinct were partisans of the protestee but, for the same reason that they 
practically had absolute control of the situation, some of them took so much 
liberty that it gave rise, in a certain way, to the violation of the secrecy of 
the ballot. As proof of this, two different persons appear to have written each 
of, the ballots, Exhibits E to E-34, with the exception of ballots, E-8. E-10, 
E-12, E- 16, E-18, E-19, E-26, E-29, E-30, E-31, E-32, E-33 and E-34. The total 
number of ballots, which are hereby rejected for having been written by two 
different persons, is twenty-two.</p>
<p>"In justice to the protestee, Biteng, it should be stated that his name was 
written by the first hand or legitimate voter on 14 of the 22 ballots. It is 
names of candidates to other offices below the space for governor which had been 
written by the second hand. It is, therefore, evident that the electors 
voluntarily voted for Biteng and that the 14 valid votes in his favor must be 
rejected as simply through a mere technicality of the law.</p>
<p>"The protestant contends that each group of the following ballots were 
written by one hand. The court finds that ballots, F to F-25 (25) were written 
by one hand; G to G-22 except G-18 and G-22 by another hand; H to H-6 (7) by 
another; I to 1-4 except 1-4 by another; J to J-3 by another; K to K-2 "by 
another; L to L-2 except L-l by another; LL to LL-2 by another; and Q and Q-l by 
another; R and R-l by another; S and S-l by another; M to M-2 by another; N to 
N-2 by another; ft to ft-2 by another hand. Ballots, O and 0-1 and P and P-l 
were not written by another hand. The total number of ballots written by 16 
hands is 89.</p>
<p>"By deducting from these 89 ballots the 16 ballots prepared by the helpers 
for themselves, it results that 73 ballots had been prepared by these for other 
persons. According to the list 33 illiterates voted in the last elections.</p>
<p>"None of the other ballots is defective. A total of 63 ballots, consisting of 
41 written by helpers for literate and absent voters and the 22 written by two 
hands, should be deducted from the 212 ballots cast for Biteng in this 
precinct.</p>
<p>"The evidence presented does not confirm the other irregularities pointed out 
by the protestant. Witnesses presented by him are not deserving of credit, 
having made contradictory statements. It should be remembered that these 
witnesses testified after the representatives of the protestant had revised the 
ballots. There was no protest against the procedure followed by the inspectors 
of this precinct. Lieut. Babista of the. Constabulary and Assistant Fiscal 
Alagar who had supervision over the activities in this precinct had not found 
any anomaly.</p>
<p>"In the opinion of this court, the irregularities committed in this precinct 
do not justify a judgment of nullity against all the votes cast therein. The 
illegal ballots can be separated from the valid ones.</p>
<p>"Reyes has ten undisputed ballots."</p></blockquote>
<p>We have reviewed the evidence presented and are convinced that the 
conclusions reached by the lower court are correct and that there is nothing to 
warrant the annulment of the election held in the precinct in question, 
principally, for the reason that the irregularities committed did not affect the 
entire election and the votes illegally cast have been rejected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Courts, of course, should be slow in nullifying and setting aside the 
election in particular municipalities or precincts, and they should not nullify 
the vote until, it is shown that the irregularities and frauds are so numerous 
as to show an unmistakable intention or design to defraud, and which does 
actually and in fact defeat the true expression of the opinion of the voters of 
said precinct or municipality * * *." (Garchitorena vs. Crescini and Imperial, 
39 Phil., 258, 261.)</p>
<p>"All of the alleged irregularities in the preparation of the ballots of 
voters with educational qualifications, besides not having been proven, are not 
sufficient to annul the election in the precincts in which they were committed, 
in asmuch as it does not appear that they have made the result of the election 
in said precincts doubtful, because the trial court could not identify the 
illegal ballots and deduct them from the votes of the candidate to whom they 
belonged. 'Elections should never be held void unless they are clearly illegal; 
it is the duty of the court to sustain an election authorized by law if it has 
been so conducted as to give a free and fair expression of the popular will, and 
the actual result thereof is clearly ascertained. It has even been held that 
gross irregularities not amounting to fraud do not vitiate an election. * * *' 
(20 C. J., 181, par. 222.)" (Demeterio <em>vs.</em> Lopez, 50 Phil., 45, 
59.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">VII</p>
<p>In the seventh assignment of error, the appellant seeks the annulment of the 
election held in the joint precinct of Concepcion and Sigay on the ground that 
the election inspectors did not make the lists during the two days fixed by law 
for that purpose, but on the day fixed for its correction. Because of this 
irregularity, many voters without any qualification whatsoever who succeeded in 
having their names inscribed in the official list could not be stricken 
therefrom.</p>
<p>April 11th and 18th were the days fixed by law for the registration of voters 
and May 23d for the correction there of, in accordance with whatever orders the 
competent courts might have issued in that respect. The inspectors, however, 
inscribed 28 voters on April 17, 112 on the 21st and 306 on May 23, the day 
fixed for the correction of the lists, making the total number of illegally 
inscribed voters 446. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the number of 
voters inscribed on the list and those appearing in the records prepared by the 
inspectors.</p>
<p>We have carefully reviewed the evidence presented on this point and we have 
unhesitatingly arrived at the conclusion that the irregularities committed were 
so grave as to really constitute fraud, thus vitiating the result of the 
election. There is not the least shadow of a doubt that the election officers 
completely ignored the law by registering voters outside the days fixed bylaw 
and that their acts resulted in the registration of and voting by unqualified 
voters, whose right could not be challenged due to the material lack of time. It 
being impossible to segregate the legal, from the illegal votes and because the 
frauds and irregularities committed had affected the entire election to such an 
extent that it is impossible to ascertain the true will of the voters authorized 
to exercise the right of suffrage, we believe we are justified in holding, as we 
hereby hold, that the entire election held in the joint precinct of Concepcion 
and Sigay is null and void.</p>
<p align="center">VIII</p>
<p>In the eighth assignment of error, the appellant questions the validity of 81 
ballots, "Biteng-904" to "Biteng 984" adjudicated to the protestee-appellee. The 
annulment of the election held in the joint precinct of Concepcion and Sigay 
makes it necessary to examine the disputed ballots, or decide any question 
involved. The only thing to be done, and which will be done when the votes 
received by each candidate are computed, is to deduct from the appellee's votes 
the plurality he obtained in said precinct.</p>
<p align="center">IX</p>
<p>In his ninth assignment of error, the appellant contends that the election 
held in the precinct of Suyo should be annulled or, at least, that 51 of the 61 
ballots, divided into 15 groups, should be deducted from the appellee in view of 
the fact that each group had been written by the same hand.</p>
<p>The grounds stated for the annulment of the election held in this precinct 
are the alleged falsification of the list of voters' and the irregularities 
committed in helping the voters prepare their ballots. We agree with the 
findings of the trial court that no fraud was committed and its conclusion that 
no vote should be deducted from the appellee because the 38 votes appearing to 
have been written by a few persons correspond to the 38 illiterate voters 
registered in the list. The court also concludes that the evidence presented 
does not prove the appellant's allegations that absent persons succeeded in 
voting during the election.</p>
<p>The assignment of error is, therefore, unfounded.</p>
<p align="center">X </p>
<p>In the tenth assignment of error, the appellant contends that the trial court 
erred in permitting the voters, who were registered by reason of educational 
qualifications in the precinct of Suyo, summoned by him, to abstain from writing 
during the trial to prove his contention that they were illiterate.</p>
<p>The action of the trial court tended to sustain the timely objection made by 
the attorneys for the appellee. It is evident that appellant, in calling these 
persons to the witness stand was for no other purpose than to prove that they 
violated the provisions of paragraph 1 of section 2645 in connection with 
paragraph 2 of section 427 of the Electioh Law, by making affidavits to the 
effect that they had educational qualifications knowing full well that they were 
illiterate. It is unnecessary to indulge in lengthy discussions to show that the 
trial court had not erred as alleged, inasmuch as it was only protecting the 
constitutional rights of the said voters in not permitting them to incriminate 
themselves. Of course, the appellant could prove that they were illiterate and 
that they violated the provisions of the law by voluntarily affirming in their 
oath that they were literate, but it is clear that he could not utilize their 
testimony when they signified their intention not to testify.</p>
<p>This assignment of error cannot be sustained.</p>
<p align="center">XI</p>
<p>In his eleventh assignment of error, the appellant contends that the trial 
court erred in adjudicating to the appellee 4 additional votes in precinct No. 1 
and 2 more in precinct No. 3 of Santa Lucia.</p>
<p>The appellant bases this assignment of error on the figures appearing in the 
commissioners' report with respect to these two precincts, but we find no error 
in the figures contained in the decision of the trial court by whose conclusions 
it is our duty to abide, and not those of the commissioners. Page 6 of the trial 
court's decision, speaking of the votes received by the contending parties in 
precinct No. 1 of Santa Lucia, mentions the existence of an agreement supposed 
to have been entered into by both parties to the effect that they abided by said 
part of the decision specifying the number of votes obtained by them. Having 
been the subject matter of a stipulation between the parties, the figures of the 
court referring to that precinct, at least, cannot be erroneous.</p>
<p>This assignment of error is hereby denied.</p>
<p align="center">XII</p>
<p>In his twelfth assignment of error, the appellant alleges that the court 
erred in holding as valid votes of the appellee 214 ballots in which the names 
or initials voted for provincial governor therein do not correspond to those of 
the appellee.</p>
<p>We have examined said ballots one by one and found that they are all valid 
with the exception of the following which should be rejected for the reasons 
mentioned: "Biteng-5: Lupo V", because the initial of the surname is not. that 
of appellee; "Biteng-6: Lupo V", for the same reason; "Biteng-28: Lupo V", for 
the same reason; "Biteng-82: Ropa Velin", because it was not cast in the 
appellee's name; "Biteng-85: (Lupo Ayotan) Biteng", for being a ballot marked 
with the word "Ayotan"; "Biteng-86" (not 66 as mentioned in the appellant's 
brief), because the name of the candidate voted for governor is illegible; 
"Biteng-87: Lopo . . .", because the surname is illegible; "Biteng-216", because 
the name "L. Biteng" is written in the space assigned for members of the 
provincial board; "Biteng-322", because the word "Luro" alone is legible; 
"Biteng-383: betin", because it is not even the appellee's surname; "Biteng-436: 
Beding", for the same reason; "Biteng-497: lopo", for not being the appellee's 
name; "Biteng-605: lupo Bilizno", because the surname is not the appellee's; 
"Biteng-659", because the name of the candidate voted for governor is illegible; 
"Biteng-665: Otng", because the surname does not belong to the appellee; 
<!--Biteng-668: . . . Veleng", because it is illegible and is not the 
appellee's surname; "Biteng-702", because the name voted for governor is 
illegible; "Biteng-715: V. Toco veten", because it does not refer to the 
appellee; "Biteng-718", because the name voted for governor is illegible; 
"Biteng-725: Lupoe Bubeno", because it does not refer to the appellee; 
"Biteng-726", because the name voted for is illegible; "Biteng-801: Vitign . . 
.", because it does not refer to the appellee; "Biteng-803", because the name 
voted for governor is illegible; "Biteng-809: Bitong", because it is not the 
appellee's surname; "Biteng-831: lugbiti", because it was not cast for the 
appellee; "Biteng-852: lupo . . .", because the surname is illegible; 
"Biteng-854: lopo V", because it is not the initial of the appellee's surname; 
"Biteng-878", because the name voted for governor is illegible; "Biteng-1119: 
Lopeling", because it is not the appellee's name; "Biteng-1268: Ropo Viteng", 
because it is not the appellee's name and the surname is erroneously written, 
and furthermore, because this ballot may be considered marked inasmuch as some 
of the names appearing in the ballot are written with an indelible pencil while 
others are written in blue ink; and "Biteng 1282", because the voter wrote the 
names of his candidates at the back of the ballot leaving the spaces for 
governor and other offices blank.</p-->
</p><p>Of the 32 illegal ballots mentioned in the preceding paragraph, only 30 
should be deducted from the appellee because ballots, "Biteng-659" and 
"Biteng-878", have already been rejected and deducted from the appellee by the 
trial court.</p>
<p align="center">XIII</p>
<p>In his thirteenth assignment of error, the appellant conterids that the trial 
court unduly adjudicated 87 marked and countersigned ballots to the appellee. 
</p>
<p>From an examination of the ballots in question, we have found that, only the 
following are marked and should, therefore, be rejected: "Biteng-20: Biting 
Abogado", marked with the word, <em>abogado</em>; "Biteng-225", because the 
space for governor is left blank and the voter wrote the names of his candidates 
in the reverse order; "Biteng-348", because the space for governor is left blank 
and the Voter wrote the names of his candidates in the reverse order; 
"Biteng-351", because the appellee's name appears in the space for members of 
the provincial board; "Biteng-720", because the ballot is marked with the sign 
of equal under the name of the candidate for senator, and with a hyphen under 
the name of the candidate for municipal president; and "Biteng-1099", because it 
is marked by writing the name of the appellee in english or slanting letters 
while those of the other candidates are written in vertical letters. </p>
<p>There are in all 6 marked or countersigned ballots but only 4 should be 
deducted from the appellee because the ballots, "Biteng-225" and "Biteng-348" 
have already been rejected by the trial court and deducted from the 
appellee.</p>
<p>Ballots, "Biteng-586-587-588-711-773-774-820-860-1088-1233 and 1284 could not 
be found in any of the ballot boxes and for this reason we accept the conclusion 
of the trial court that they are valid.</p>
<p align="center">XIV</p>
<p>This last assignment of error in which the appellant makes a resume of the 
votes the candidates for governor ought to have received, needs no further 
discussion being a mere corollary of the preceding ones. </p>
<p>We shall now proceed to the examination of the special defenses and 
counter-protest interposed by the appellee. In the decision appealed from, he 
assigns seven errors embodied in what he calls, in his brief, arguments XV to 
XXI, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"XV. The lower court erred in counting 33 ballots in which the name Roberto 
or Lamberto Reyes appears as the one voted for the office of the provincial 
governor, as valid votes in favor of the protestant and appellant, Alberto 
Reyes.</p>
<p>"XVI. The lower court erred in counting 49 ballots in which appear the name 
of Norberto Reyes as the person voted for the office of provincial governor, as 
valid votes in favor of the protestant and appellant, Alberto Reyes.</p>
<p>"XVII. The lower court erred in counting 75 ballots as valid votes in favor 
of the protestant and appellant when they should have been rejected because they 
are marked.</p>
<p>"XVIII. The lower court erred in counting 441 ballots as valid votes in favor 
of the protestant and appellant, which ballots should not be counted because 
they are either illegible or clearly not for said protestant and appellant.</p>
<p>"XIX. The lower court erred in not rejecting 146 ballots divided into 16 
groups, each written by one hand, and in counting the same as valid votes in 
favor of the protestant and appellant.</p>
<p>"XX. The lower court erred in computing the votes of the protestant and 
appellant in precincts Nos. 1 and 3 of Santa Lucia and in precinct No. 2 of 
Tagudin.</p>
<p>"XXI. The lower court erred in rejecting 15 ballots, and in not counting them 
as valid votes in favor of the protestee. and appellee."</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">XV</p>
<p>In this assignment of error, the appellee questions the validity of 33 
ballots bearing the name Roberto or Lamberto Reyes for governor, counted by the 
trial court as valid votes cast in favor of the appellant.</p>
<p>We have carefully examined all the ballots and found that the names voted for 
the office of governor therein are written Ruperto Reyes, Lamberto Reyes, 
Roberto Reyes or Loberto Reyes. Following the rule laid down in the case of 
Lucero vs. De Guzman (45 Phil., 852), said ballots should not be counted as 
validly cast in favor of the appellant because the Christian names do not 
correspond to his name. In the case cited above, it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In examining the ballots cast for the contestee it becomes apparent that 
confusion existed in the minds of many voters as regards the Christian name of 
the candidate. For instance, it appears that the contestee has a brother named 
Bernabe Guzman, and more than twenty ballots scattered through various precincts 
were found to have the name of Bernabe Guzman written in the place where 
provincial governor should be voted for. Numerous other ballots were found 
bearing such names as Juan Guzman, Gregorio Guzman, Anastasio Guzman, Alejandro 
Guzman, Genaro de Guzman, Pedro Guzman, Mariano Guzman and the like. None of 
these ballots can, in our opinion, be lawfully counted for the contestee, and 
the trial court was in error in admitting them as lawful votes for 
him."</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the ballot "Reyes-830", should be counted for the appellant because 
it appears that the vote for governor was cast in the name of Alberto Reyes.</p>
<p>From the foregoing, it is concluded that 32 votes should be deducted from the 
appellant under this assignment of error.</p>
<p align="center">XVI</p>
<p>In this assignment of error, the appellee alleges that the court unduly 
counted for the appellant 49 ballots wherein the electors voted for Norberto 
Reyes for governor.</p>
<p>After an examination of the ballots, we find that all of them, with the 
exception of "Reyes-851", should be rejected because they were cast for Norberto 
Reyes which is not the appellant's name. Ballot, "Reyes-851" is valid because 
the name, Alberto Reyes, appears to have been voted for therein.</p>
<p>Therefore, under this assignment of error, 48 votes should be deducted from 
the appellant.</p>
<p align="center">XVII</p>
<p>In this assignment of error, the appellee also questions 75 ballots 
adjudicated to the appellant. He contends that they should have been rejected by 
the trial court for being marked. </p>
<p>The only ballots found by us to be marked and should be rejected are the 
following: "Reyes-376", of precinct No. 2 of Narvacan, marked with the word 
"Pilato"; "Reyes 501" of the precinct of Banayoyo, marked with the word "Bunska" 
written on the line for senator; "Reyes-526" of precinct No. 1 of Burgos, in 
which the names of the candidates were written in pencil and then written over 
in blue ink; and "Reyes-877" of precinct No. 3 of Candon bears the voter's 
thumbmark.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the lower court should be accepted with respect to ballot, 
"Reyes-431", which could not be found in any of the ballot-boxes. The rest of 
the ballots are valid and were rightfully counted in favor of the appellant.</p>
<p>Therefore, four votes should be deducted from the appellant.</p>
<p align="center">XVIII</p>
<p>In this assignment of error, the appellee contends that 441 ballots should be 
deducted from the appellant because the names voted for governor therein either 
are illegible or clearly belong to persons other than the appellant.</p>
<p>We have examined the ballots one by one and found them all to be good and 
valid with the exception of the following which should be rejected: "Reyes-36" 
of precinct No. 3 of Santa Lucia bearing the name, Riis Robirto; "Reyes-108", of 
precinct No. 2 of Santo Domingo, in the name of B. Riys; "Reyes-120", of 
precinct No. 2 of Santo Domingo wherein Antonio Purisima and Alberto Reyes are 
voted for governor; "Reyes-132" of precinct No. 3 of Santo Domingo, in which the 
name voted for governor is illegible; "Reyes-20", of precinct No. 3 of Tagudin, 
in which A. Reyes and L. Clarin appear to have been voted for governor; 
Reyes-508", of the precinct of Banayoyo in the name of Verto Rese; "Reyes-544", 
of precinct No. 2 of Burgos, wherein M. Gaerlan is voted for governor and A. 
Riyis, for member of the provincial board; "Reyes-1651", of precinct No. 3 of 
Santa, in the name of Berto ReB; "Reyes-1665", of precinct No. 4 of Santa, in 
the name of a B. Reyes; "Reyes-666", of precinct No. 1 of Santiago, in the name 
of Birto Rires; "Reyes-741", of precinct No. 3 of Santiago, wherein Mariano 
Gaerlan appears to have been voted for governor and A. Riyis, for member of the 
provincial board; "Reyes- 755", of precinct No. 2 of Santa Maria, in the name of 
Nureto Riz; "Reyes-829", of precinct No. 1 of Candon, in the name of Nurveto 
Yres; "Reyes-866", of precinct No. 3 of Candon, in the name of Reyes Berto; 
"Reyes-886", of precinct No. 4 of Candon, in the name of Berto R; "Reyes-909", 
of precinct No. 6 of Candon, in the name of Bertoris; "Reyes-912", of precinct 
No. 6 of Candon, in the name of Norbirto Vicsis; "Reyes-917", of precinct No. 7 
of Candon, in the name of berto risi; "Reyes-1069", of precinct No. 3 of Sinait, 
in the name of uobito Raisi; and "Reyes-1632", of precinct No. 7 of Vigan, in 
the name of birti riyes Rieyes.</p>
<p>Under this assignment of error, 20 votes should, therefore, be deducted from 
the appellant.</p>
<p align="center">XIX</p>
<p>In his nineteenth assignment of error, the appellee contends that the trial 
court should have deducted from the appellant 146 ballots divided into 16 groups 
each of which had been written by only one hand.</p>
<p>After an examination of the ballots in question, we have arrived at the 
conclusion that the alleged error is unfounded. The contention of the appellee 
is not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>
<p align="center">XX</p>
<p>In his twentieth assignment of error, the appellee maintains that the trial 
court erred in computing the votes received by the appellant in precincts Nos. 1 
and 3 of Santa Lucia and precinct No. 2 of Tagudin.</p>
<p>It appears that the alleged error of computation has actually been committed 
in the pertinent part of the decision. The appellant was adjudicated 2 
additional votes in precinct No. 1 of Santa Lucia, 1 in precinct No. 3 of the 
same municipality, and 2 in precinct No. 2 of Tagudin, or an excess of 5 votes 
in all.</p>
<p align="center">XXI</p>
<p>In his last assignment of error, the appellee contends that the trial court 
erred in not adjudicating to him 15 ballots from different precincts.</p>
<p>From an examination of the ballots in question, we find that only ballot, 
"Biteng-396", of precinct No. 1 of Burgos is valid and should be credited to 
him. The decision of the trial court should be accepted with respect to ballots, 
"Biteng-659", "Biteng-661", and Biteng-878", which could not be found in any of 
the ballot-boxes. The rest of the questioned ballots have justly been rejected 
by the trial court on the grounds stated in its decision.</p>
<p>Summarizing all that has been said in the preceding paragraphs, it follows 
that the litigants received the following number of votes, to wit:</p>

<p>It may be seen therefrom that the appellee leads the appellant by a plurality

<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed and the appellee, 
the late Lupo Biteng, is declared duly elected provincial governor of Ilocos 
Sur, with costs and other incidental expenses against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>AvanceÃ±a, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Villa-Real, Abad

<p align="center">RULING ON THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>
<p align="right"><em>September 22, 1932</em></p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The attorneys for the appellant have filed a motion for reconsideration of 
the decision rendered in this case, on the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I. One hundred and three (103) votes bearing the name, 'Rufo Biteng or 
similar, but different from the name of the protestee-appellee, 'Lupo Biteng', 
should be rejected and deducted, because the Christian name voted for therein is 
'Rufo', which is different from 'Lupo', the Christian name of the protested, in 
the same manner and for the same reason that eighty (80) votes written with the 
name of 'Norberto Reyes', 'Lamberto Reyes', 'Loberto Reyes', and 'Roberto Reyes' 
were rejected and deducted from the protestant-appellant inasmuch as this court 
considered such names distinct and different from 'Alberto Reyes', the name of 
the protestant-appellant.</p>
<p>"II. One hundred and sixty-eight (168) votes should be deducted from the 
protestee-appellee, Lupo Biteng, either because some of the corresponding 
ballots are marked, or in others his surname is accompanied by an initial of a 
Christian name which is not his, or in others the appellee's Christian name is 
accompanied by an initial of a surname, different from that of his correct 
surname, or in others still the names voted for governor do not refer to him 
and, finally, because in others the name voted for governor is illegible.</p>
<p>"III. Forty (40) ballots in precinct No. 3 of Tagudin, which had been written 
by a few hands without the necessary oath, should also be deducted from the 
appellee.</p>
<p>"IV. Ten (10) ballots, 'Biteng-586-587-588-773-774-820-860-1088-1233 and 
1284', which were stated in the decision as missing, may be found in the 
ballot-boxes.</p>
<p>"V. Eleven (11) votes consisting of ballots, 
Biteng-11-204-206-455-498-734-850-881-1240-1257-1288 and 1290',should be 
deducted from the appellee in accordance with the rule established by this court 
in its decision in the case at bar.</p>
<p>"VI. One (1) vote in precinct No. 4 of Tagudin should be deducted from the 
appellee because of error in computation. </p>
<p>"VII. One (1) vote, 'Biteng-396', also marked 'Reyes-538', should be deducted 
from the appellee.</p>
<p>"VIII. Three (3) of the four ballots rejected by this Honorable Court in 
connection with the appellee's XVII assignment of error should remain 
adjudicated to the appellant.</p>
<p>"IX. Two (2) more votes should be given to the appellant in precinct No. 1 of 
Santo Domingo, due to an error in computation."</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p>The question raised in the first proposition is entirely new. The 103 votes 
which the appellant seeks to be deducted from the appellee on the ground that 
the name voted for governor therein was written "Rufo Biteng", were not the 
subject matter of any assignment of error in the printed brief submitted by him. 
Consequently, the first question arising therefrom is whether the appellant has 
the right to discuss the said 103 votes by means of a motion for 
reconsideration. According to the rules of this court, it is evident that he 
does not have such right. Section 19 of said rules requires the appellant to 
specify, by means of assignments of error all the questions he desires to submit 
and discuss in the case, while section 20 provides that "no error not affecting 
the jurisdiction over the subject matter will be considered unless stated in the 
assignment of errors and relied upon in the brief." These rules have been 
uniformly followed in the determination of cases, otherwise decisions would 
never become final and there would be no way of putting an end to 
litigations.</p>
<p>But another reason unfavorable to the proposition under consideration is the 
fact that the 2 ballots mentioned on Â¦pages 5 and 6 of the motion for 
reconsideration as a basis justifying the proposition, have not been rejected on 
the ground stated by the appellant. The ballots referred to are "Biteng-1268: 
Ropo Viteng", (not 1263 as erroneously stated in the motion for reconsideration) 
and "Biteng-82: Ropa Velin". As may be seen from pages 25 and 26 of the decision 
rendered by this court, the first was rejected because "it is not the appellee's 
name and the surname is erroneously written, and furthermore, because this 
ballot may be considered marked inasmuch as some of the names appearing therein 
are written with an indelible pencil while others are written in blue ink", and 
the second, "because it was not cast in the appellee's name." From the 
foregoing, it may be inferred that the two ballots were not rejected because the 
candidate's name was written "Rufo" as the appellant asserts.</p>
<p>It is suggested that this court enunciated a new doctrine in rejecting the 
ballots of the appellant containing Christian names of other persons with his 
surname, as: Lamberto Reyes, Edilberto Reyes, Roberto Reyes, Ruperto Reyes, etc. 
and that this circumstance is responsible for the appellant's failure to specify 
said 103 ballots in a separate assignment of error. We should say, however, that 
at least in this jurisdiction, such rule is neither new nor unknown. In the case 
of Mendoza vs. Mendiola (53 Phil., 267), the same doctrine had already been laid 
down when we said, in considering some questioned ballots: "But the ballots 
marked Exhibit A-125, Exhibit I and Exhibit K, cannot, in our opinion, be 
adjudicated to the appellant. Although by the rule of idem sonans, the name 
'Midosa' in Exhibit A-125 (not 'Midora' because in the same ballot the s's in 
'Sotto' repeated and in 'Espinosa' have the same shape as the 's' in 'Midosa'), 
and 'Mendsa' in Exhibit I may, by the rule of idem sonans, be taken, to mean 
'Mendoza' as much as in Exhibit K, where this surname is plainly written; but 
the initials D, V and D placed before these surnames in the three aforementioned 
ballots, respectively, prevent them from being counted in favor of the 
appellant. The record contains nothing to prove that the initials D, V and D 
stand for the name 'Godofredo'. Nor is it so stated in Godofredo Mendoza's 
certificate of candidacy. Therefore, the ballots marked as Exhibit A-125, 
Exhibit I and Exhibit K, cannot and must not be adjudicated to the appellant." 
And in deciding ballots written with the initials and surname of the candidate 
in the case of Dizon vs. Cailles (G. R. No. 36928),1 this court afforded a 
clearer explanation of the foregoing rule when it said: "Notwithstanding the 
rule laid down in various decisions of this court, to the effect that a ballot 
is valid when the candidate is voted for by his surname and the initial of his 
given name, we believe that such a rule must be strictly applied so that the 
initial must be identically the same as the initial of the Christian name of the 
candidate voted for."</p>
<p>By carefully examining the two decisions referred to in the preceding 
paragraphs, it will be observed that the rule had already, been laid down 
therein to the effect that ballots bearing the initials of the Christian names 
and the complete surnames of the candidates, must be well written in order to be 
accepted. The reason taken into account in the cases cited above was that the 
use of erroneous initials of Christian names makes it practically impossible to 
identify the candidate or candidates voted for and to interpret the intention of 
the voters. Now then, if ballots written in such a manner should not be counted, 
with greater reason, ballots bearing Christian names entirely different from 
that of the candidate should be rejected, even when his surname is correctly 
written. Therefore, what this court said in its decision regarding the ballots 
referred to as a basis of the first proposition in the motion for 
reconsideration, cannot be invoked as a newly established doctrine.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>In his second proposition, the appellant questions 168 ballots and seeks 
their deduction from the votes received by the appellee. The reasons alleged by 
him are as follows: that some of them are marked; that in others, the appellee's 
surname is accompanied by an initial of a Christian name that is not his; that 
in others, the appellee's Christian name is accompanied by an initial of a 
surname different from his; that in others, still, the vote cast for governor 
was not intended for him; and that in the rest, the names of the persons voted 
for are illegible.</p>
<p>Upon consideration of the ballots impugned on the above grounds, we found 
that some of them had already been discussed and decided under the XII 
assignment of error in the appellant's brief, while the others had not been the 
subject matter of any assignment of error and are questioned for the first time 
in the motion for reconsideration.</p>
<p>To the first group belong the ballots marked: 
"Biteng-2-17_47_61-63-64-72-80-83-91-96-99-210-215-220-222-269-326-328-342-372-375-380-391-395-443-485-502-504-578-585-591-593-600-603-607-618-656-657-666-670-703-714-717-724-772H77&amp;-788-792-79a-800-842-868-875-1200-1201-1205-1216-1219-1220-1222-1223-1225-1229-1267-1270", 
and. the rest, to the second group.</p>
<p>With regard to the first group, we do not believe it proper for the appellant 
to again discuss them in his motion for reconsideration even on different 
grounds from those first alleged in his brief. This unjustifiable and 
intolerable practice would only tend to prolong election protests unnecessarily. 
With regard to the second group, we again repeat what we have already said 
concerning the first proposition ; that they cannot be the subject matter of a 
motion for reconsideration inasmuch as they had not been specified in any 
assignment of error as required by the rules of this court. In an election 
protest like the case at bar where hundreds of ballots had been questioned, it 
is not to be expected that the court, of its own accord, seek new grounds to 
impugn each ballot in addition to those assigned in the briefs. This duty 
devolves upon the parties or their attorneys who should see to it that they are 
specified in the assignments of error.</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>In his third proposition, the appellant questions 40 votes which, in his 
opinion, should also be deducted from the appellee. The ballots representing 
them were, likewise, not impugned in any assignment of error in the brief. The 
trial court, after weighing the evidence presented adjudicated these votes to 
the appellee and we find no justifiable motive to change its conclusions.</p>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p>In his fourth proposition, the appellant insists that the ten ballots 
mentioned in our decision as missing from the ballot-boxes be deducted from the 
appellee. He reasons that said ballots are in the ballot-boxes but they belong 
to precincts other than those mentioned in his brief. In other words, he admits 
that he committed a mistake in identifying them in his brief. We are of the 
opinion that this contention is untenable. Admitting, as he does, that he had 
committed a mistake, then our assertion in the decision that the questioned 
ballots could not be found in the ballot-boxeg, is true. , There is no reason 
why the court should now examine entirely different ballots on which the adverse 
party has had no chance to express his views for the reasons that they were not 
specified in any assignment of error.</p>
<p align="center">V</p>
<p>Among the eleven ballots discussed in the fifth proposition, we find that the 
ballots, "Biteng-455", "Biteng-498" and "Biteng-850" had already been considered 
and decided by this court under the XII assignment of error in the appellant's 
brief; There is no reason sufficient to justify a second decision on the matter 
even if the grounds alleged were different. With regard to the remaining 8 
ballots, suffice it to say that they are discussed for the first time in the 
motion for reconsideration and were not the subject matter of any assignment of 
error.</p>
<p align="center">VI</p>
<p>The sixth proposition is likewise held to be untenable. This is the first 
time the appellant noticed the alleged error in the computation of votes in 
precinct No. 4 of Tagudin. He could very well have included it in his first 
assignment of error wherein he questioned and claimed 42 ballots from different 
precincts by invoking the same error in computation.</p>
<p align="center">VII</p>
<p>The seventh proposition appears to be more unjustifiable still. It had 
already been decided by this court that the questioned ballot, "Biteng-396", is 
valid. The vote for governor was cast for "1 Birtieng". The initial is "1" and 
not "A" as claimed, and the surname is idem sonans of "Biteng".</p>
<p align="center">VIII</p>
<p>The appellant, in the eighth proposition of his1 motion, again claims 
ballots, "Reyes-376", "Reyes-501" and "Reyes-877" which had been rejected in our 
decision for being marked. We are of the opinion that the explanations offered 
therefor are unsatisfactory. The truth is that said ballots are marked as 
described in the decision and their rejection is sanctioned by law.</p>
<p align="center">IX</p>
<p>In his ninth or last proposition, the appellant claims two more votes which, 
he alleges, the trial court failed to adjudicate to him through an error in 
computation. That his claim cannot be sustained becomes at once apparent when it 
is considered that the appellant should have included it in his first assignment 
of error wherein he discussed questions of a similar nature. Furthermore, it 
appears from the motion for reconsideration that the appellant raises said 
question for the first time and that the attention of the court had never been 
called to it through presentation of the corresponding motion. We are of the 
opinion that the conclusions of the lower court in this particular cannot now be 
altered through a motion for reconsideration, there being no sufficient grounds 
to warrant such action.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, the motion is hereby denied. So 
ordered.</p>
