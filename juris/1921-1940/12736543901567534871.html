				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>It appears from the record that during the period from September, 1918,, to 
February, 1919, the plaintiff corporation applied for and obtained the following 
policies of insurance against loss by fire in its mercantile establishment in 
Manila:</p>
<p><em>(a)</em> Two policies with the China Fire Insurance &amp; Co., Ltd., one 
dated September 16, 1918, for the sum of P12,000 and the other dated March 21, 
1919, for P15,000; <em>(b)</em> one with the Yangtsze Fire Association, Ltd., 
dated February 3, 1919, for the sum of P10,000; and (c) one with the State 
Assurance Co., Ltd., dated February 3, 1919, for P15,000.</p>
<p>The firm of Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., was the agent in the Philippines 
for all of the insurance companies mentioned and the policies were obtained 
through that firm.</p>
<p>On March 25, 1919, while the policies were still in force, a fire occurred in 
the plaintiff's place of business as a result of which the insured property was 
more or less damaged and partly destroyed. Claim was made upon the agent, 
Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., for damages but no agreement as to the amount of 
the loss could be reached and on April 7, 1919, Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., 
acting in its capacity as agent for the insurance companies, rejected the claim 
of the plaintiff. Thereafter and on June 14, 1919, the plaintiff instituted an 
action upon the various insurance policies above mentioned against Warner, 
Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., in its capacity as agent for the insurance companies. 
Judgment was rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff and against 
Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd,, as agent and the case was appealed to this 
court, where it was given the number R. G. 16492, and where the decision of the 
lower court was reversed and the complaint dismissed on the ground that the 
agent of the insurance companies was not the real party in interest and that the 
action should have been brought against the insurance companies. The decision 
was promulgated on March 9, 1922, and may be found in 43 Phil., 155.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Thereafter, and on September 30, 1922, the plaintiff instituted the present 
action against the defendant insurance companies based upon the same facts and 
cause of action alleged in its complaint against Warner, Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., 
in case R. G. No. 16492. The defendants interposed a general denial and set up 
several special defenses to the effect:</p>
<p><em>"(a)</em> That plaintiff had failed and refused to render to defendants a 
claim in writing specifying the articles and items of property damaged or 
destroyed and of the alleged amount of the loss or damage sustained; 
<em>(b)</em> that the plaintiff had made a grossly fraudulent claim of alleged 
damage sustained in direct violation of the stipulations in the policies of 
insurance; and <em>(c)</em> that plaintiff had not instituted action or suit 
against these defendants within the time required by the aforesaid policies of 
insurance held by plaintiff, viz: within three months after its claim of loss 
had been finally rejected, viz: April 7, 1919."</p>
<p>The court below sustained the special defense last mentioned and gave 
judgment for the defendants dismissing the complaint, with the costs, whereupon 
this appeal was taken by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The assignments of error raise only one question, namely, whether the court 
below erred in holding that the action was barred by not having been brought 
within the time prescribed by the policies of insurance. In this connection the 
appellant argues that inasmuch as arbitration was made a condition precedent to 
the bringing of an action on the insurance policies, and no arbitration having 
been had, the three months limitation provided for in the policies has not as 
yet commenced. Neither the policies nor the evidence referred to in paragraph 
VIII of the stipulation of facts are before us and as the pleadings, stipulation 
of the parties and decision of the trial court contain no specific reference to 
the arbitration clause, we are not in position to discuss this point. We have 
only the finding of the trial court that the action was not brought within the 
period of limitation provided for in the policies.</p>
<p>But the appellant maintains that assuming that the contractual limitation 
began to run on April 7, 1919, the date on which the appellant's claim for 
damages was rejected, it is still entitled to the benefit of the provisions of 
section 49 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which reads as follows: </p>
<p>"If, in an action commenced, or attempted to be commenced, in due time, a 
judgment for the plaintiff be reversed, or if the plaintiff fail otherwise than 
upon the merits, and the time limited for the commencement of such action has, 
at the date of such reversal or failure, expired, the plaintiff, or, if he die 
and the cause of action survive, his representatives may commence a new action 
within one year after such date, and this provision shall apply to any claim 
asserted in any pleading by a defendant."</p>
<p>The appellant's argument is that in the first action brought "the plaintiff 
failed otherwise than upon the merits" and that the present action having been 
brought within a year from the dismissal of the first, it has been brought in 
time.</p>
<p>An overwhelming weight of authority is against the appellant's contention. 
The leading case on the subject is that of Riddlesbarger <em>vs.</em> Hartford 
Fire Ins. Co. (7 Wall., 386), in which the plaintiff had insured, his house in 
Kansas City, Mo., for Â£10,000 with defendant company on June 1, 1861. The house 
was destroyed by fire in March, 1862; in June, 1862, plaintiff brought suit 
against defendant in the Court of Common Pleas, Jackson County, Mo.; and 
defendant insurance company appeared and answered to the merits. When the cause 
was carried over to the June term, 1864, plaintiff dismissed his action, but 
within one year of such dismissal instituted a second action against defendant 
in the Court of Common Pleas, County of St. Louis, Mo., from whence the cause 
was transferred to the Circuit Court of the United States. The policy sued on 
contained a condition that suit must be brought within twelve months after the 
loss had occurred, which condition defendant company pleaded in bar of the 
second action; to this plaintiff pleaded the statute of Missouri which provided 
that if, in any action commenced within the period mentioned (Period of 
Limitations) the plaintiff shall "suffer a nonsuit," he may commence a new 
action within one year afterwards; defendant demurred to this replication. The 
Supreme Court of the United States said: </p>
<p>"The Statute of Missouri, which allows a party who 'suffers a nonsuit' in an 
action to bring a new action for the same cause within one year afterwards, does 
not affect the rights of the parties in this case. In the first place, the 
statute only applies to cases of involuntary nonsuit, not to cases where the 
plaintiff of his own motion dismisses the action. It was only intended to cover 
cases of accidental miscarriage, as from defects in the proofs, or in the 
parties or pleadings, and like particulars. In the second place, the rights of 
the parties flow from the contract. That relieves them from the general 
limitations of the statute, and as a consequence, from its exceptions also.</p>
<p>"The action mentioned, which must be commenced within the twelve months, is 
the one which is prosecuted to judgment. The failure of a previous action from 
any cause cannot alter the case. The contract declares that an action shall not 
be sustained, unless such action, not some previous action, shall be commenced 
within the period designated. It makes no provision for any exception in the 
event of the failure of an action commenced, and the court cannot insert one 
without changing the contract.</p>
<p>"The questions presented in this case, though new to this court, are not new 
to the country. The validity of the limitation stipulated in conditions similar 
to the one in the case at bar, has been elaborately considered in the highest 
courts of several of the States, and has been sustained in all of them, except 
in the Supreme Court of Indiana, Eagle Ins. Co. <em>vs.</em> Lafayette Ins. Co., 
9 Ind., 443, which followed an adverse decision of Mr. Justice McLean, in the 
Circuit Court for the district of that State. French <em>vs.</em> Lafayette Ins. 
Co., 5 McLean, 461. Its validity has also been sustained by Mr. Justice Nelson, 
in the Circuit Court for the district of Connecticut. Gray <em>vs.</em> Hartford 
Ins. Co., 1 Blatchf., 280.</p>
<p>" We have no doubt of its validity. The commencement, therefore, of the 
present action within the period designated, was a condition essential to the 
plaintiff's recovery; and this condition was not affected by the fact that the 
action, which was dismissed, had been commenced within that period."</p>
<p>The rule laid down in the Riddlesbarger case has been followed by practically 
all courts in the United States. (Leigh Ellis &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Davis, 260

<p>The opposite view as taken in the case of Omaha Fire Insurance Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Drennan (56 Neb., 623) and Miller <em>vs.</em> State Ins. Co. of 
Des Moines (54 Neb., 121). There is also an early Indiana case, Eagle Ins. Co. 
vs- Lafayette Ins. Co. (9 Ind., 443), which supports the same view, but which 
was overruled by the later cases of Insurance Co. of North America <em>vs.</em> 
Brim (111 Ind., 281) and Caywood <em>vs.</em> Supreme Lodge (171 Ind., 410).</p>
<p>We have also found two early Ohio cases which tend to sustain the appellant's 
contention. In the first of these cases, that of Madison Ins. Co. <em>vs.</em> 
Fellowes ([1856], 1 Disney, 217), the Supreme Court of Cincinnati held that 
where a fire policy contains a condition that "all claims under this policy are 
barred unless prosecuted within one year from the date of the loss," that 
condition is performed if within a year a suit is brought in good faith for the 
purpose of enforcing the claim, and if the assured for good cause abandons that 
suit and promptly brings another, although after the year has elapsed, he is not 
barred of his right to recover. The second case, Bates <em>vs.</em> Sandusky, 
etc., Ry. Co. (12 Ohio St. Rep., 620), was decided in 1861 and applied the rule 
followed in Madison Ins. Co., <em>vs.</em> Fellowes, supra, to a claim against a 
common carrier. Both cases are earlier than the case of Riddlesbarger 
<em>vs.</em> Hartford Fire Ins. Co., supra, and both differ from the present 
case in that both the first and second actions were brought against the same 
defendants. Ohio seems now to have adopted the doctrine laid down in the 
Riddlesbarger case (Appel <em>vs.</em> Cooper Ins. Co., <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p>Many of the cases above cited relate only to the general proposition that 
reasonable contractual limitations of actions will prevail over statutory 
limitations and do not specifically deal with exceptions to the statutory 
limitations such as the one found in section 49 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
But it seems obvious that if a contractual limitation prevails over the 
statutory limitation it must also prevail over the exceptions to the statutory 
limitations; the contract necessarily supersedes the statute and the limitation 
is in all its phases governed entirely by the former. </p>
<p>It has been so held in the Riddlesbarger case and in a very large number of 
other cases. In the case of McEIroy <em>vs.</em> Continental Insurance Co. of 
New York (48 Kan., 200), the plaintiff, after dismissing his first action 
brought within the time specified in the insurance policy, instituted a second 
action within the time allowed by section 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 
Kansas, which is almost identical with our section 49 and which reads as 
follows:</p>
<p>"* * * 'If any action be commenced within due time, and a judgment thereon 
for the plaintiff be reversed, or if the plaintiff fail in such action otherwise 
than upon the merits, and the time limited for the same shall have expired, the 
plaintiff, or, if he die and the cause of action survive, his representatives, 
may commence a new action within one year after the reversal or failure,' * * 
*"</p>
<p>The demurrer of defendant insurance company to plaintiff's second complaint 
was sustained. In holding that the above quoted Code provision had no 
application whatsoever to the facts in that case, the court said:</p>
<p>"* * * While it is admitted that parties to a contract may, by express 
agreement, fix a limitation of time within which any action for its breach Shall 
be commenced, even if the time fixed is less than that allowed by statute, and 
that in such cases of agreement the statutory limitations do not apply, yet it 
is insisted that the exceptions to the statutory limitations do apply in such 
cases. This seems to us to be an unreasonable contention, and not supported by 
any authority to which our attention has been called. The case of Riddlesbarger 
<em>vs.</em> Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 7 Wall, 386, says 'that the rights of 
the parties flow from the contract. That relieves them from the general 
limitations of the statute, and, as a consequence, from its exceptions also.' In 
the case of Wilkinson <em>vs.</em> Fire Insurance Co., 72 N. Y., 499, the policy 
sued upon contained a provision that no suit for the recovery of any loss 
thereunder shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery, unless it shall 
be commenced within 12 months after the loss occurs, any statute of limitation 
to the contrary. The action was commenced more than two years after the loss 
occurred. To avoid the limitation contained in the policy, the plaintiff alleged 
that the insurance company had been enjoined by a court of competent 
jurisdiction from paying, and a third party, who claimed to own the policy, from 
receiving the amount of the loss. Section 105 of the Code of New York contains a 
provision saving the rights of parties stayed by injunction. The court says: It 
is to be observed that this claim is not justified by the terms of the contract. 
The provision fixing the time within which an action must be brought is 
distinct, definite and unqualified. The contract contains no saving of the right 
of action after the expiration of a year from the.JoaS for any cause whatever, 
and unless the bringing of the action within the time limited by the contract 
was waived by the defendant, or was excused and made impossible by the act of 
God or of the law, the remedy of the plaintiff has been lost.' The court further 
says, in commenting upon saving the rights stayed by an injunction: This 
provision does not aid the plaintiff. The exception has no application where a 
limitation is prescribed by the contract of the parties, but only applies to 
cases governed by the limitations in the general law:' citing the case in 7 
Wall., and others. The last case is affirmed in Arthur <em>vs.</em> Homestead 
Insurance Co., 78 N. Y., 462, the facts being similar to the one we are now 
considering. In the case of Wilson <em>vs.</em> Aetna Insurance Co., 27 Vt., 99, 
the policy contained the one-year limitation. The loss occurred on the 6th day 
of May, 1849. On the 1st day of September, 1849, the plaintiff commenced an 
action on the policy to recover the loss. On the second Tuesday of March, 1851, 
the plaintiff was obliged, without fault on his part, to submit to a nonsuit. On 
the 20th of August he commenced this suit. The court says: 'A stipulation in a 
policy of insurance that no action shall be sustainable unless commenced within 
twelve months after the loss, is binding, and bars a suit commenced after that 
time, even though a prior suit was commenced within twelve months, and failed 
without fault on the part of the plaintiff.' Redfield, C. J., commenting on such 
a stipulation, remarks: 'This stipulation is too explicit to allow of any escape 
from its import by construction. It is not that an action shall be commenced 
within twelve months, but that no recovery shall be had unless such action is 
commenced within twelve months after the loss. Such action can only signify the 
action in which recovery is sought. That must be this action, and all actions in 
which a recovery is claimed, and there is no provision for any exception on 
account of the failure of any such action. And without such a provision in the 
contract the court cannot import one without subjecting the contract to virtual 
disregard at the mere will or caprice of the parties. No court of law could 
relieve the party from the performance of a condition of this nature, unless it 
be on proof of the fraud of the other party. If the party could have ary relief 
in such case, which is questionableâtoo questionable to be hopefulâit would not 
be here.' To the same effect is the case of Brown <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co., 7 
R. I., 301. The court says: 'The statute of limitations has no application in 
any of its provisions to the clause in question, and, indeed, the only argument 
against the clause is, that it sets up for the contract a different law of 
limitation from that which the law imposes. We have held that the contracting 
parties have a right to do this in reference to a policy of fire insurance, and 
we know of no right that we have, from a consideration of general equity, to 
import into their contract qualifying terms which they have not seen fit to 
adopt.' It seems to us that if it be conceded, as it has been by many courts of 
last resort, including the Supreme Court of the United States, that the parties 
to an insurance contract can stipulate as to the time within which an action 
shall be brought to recover a loss, independent of the limitations prescribed by 
the statute, then that stipulation alone must govern; because it is both 
unreasonable and illogical to say that the general limitations, that are almost 
universal in their operation upon all causes of action, cannot control the 
conventional limitation fixed in the policy, but that the exceptions to the 
general limitations prescribed by the statute, that are contingent, incidental, 
and entirely dependent upon the general limitations, do apply to and control the 
stipulation of the parties. We are of opinion that the trial court ruled rightly 
in sustaining the demurrer to the petition, and recommend that the judgment be 
affirmed."</p>
<p>In the case of Harrison <em>vs.</em> Hartford Fire Ins. Co. (102 Iowa, 112), 
after plaintiff's first case had been dismissed as premature and a second suit 
was brought within the time fixed in the saving clauses of section 2851, Iowa 
Code, but after the time specified in the insurance policy, the court said:</p>
<p>"The policy in suit contained this among other provisions: 'No suit or action 
on this policy, for the recovery of any claim, shall be sustainable in any court 
of law or equity until after full compliance by the insured with all the 
foregoing requirements, nor unless commenced within twelve months next after.the 
fire.' Defendant claims that this provision is a bar to plaintiff's action. It 
will be noticed that this action was commenced 2 years, 9 months, and 21 days 
after the fire, and more than 2 years and six months after the 90 days in which 
plaintiff must have given notice and proofs of loss. Such a stipulation as that 
contained in this policy is valid in every state in the Union save Indiana. See 
Carter <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co., 12 Iowa, 287; Vore <em>vs.</em> Insurance 
Co., 76 Iowa, 548, 41 N. W. Rep., 309; Moore <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co., 72 
Iowa, 414, 34 N. W. Rep., 183; Housinkveld <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co., 95 Iowa, 
504, 64 N. W. Rep., 594; Riddlesbarger <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co., 7 Wall., 391; 
Insurance Co. <em>vs.</em> Whitehill, 25 111., 382; and cases cited in 2 Wood, 
Insurance, sec. 460. There is no claim that this condition has been waived; 
hence plaintiff's action is barred unless there be something in his claim that 
section 2537 of the Code applies. That section is found in chapter 2 of title 17 
of the Code of 1873, relating to limitation of actions, and is as follows: 'If 
after the commencement of an action the plaintiff fail therein for any cause 
except negligence in its prosecution, and a new suit be brought within six 
months thereafter, the second suit shall for the purpose herein contemplated be 
a continuation of the first.' Statutes similar to this exist in many of the 
states, and the question has frequently arisen whether such a statute is 
applicable to a contract limitation such as the one in the policy in suit. The 
general tenor of the authorities is to the effect that it is not, for the reason 
that the rights of the parties arise out of contract which relieves them from 
the general limitations of the statute, and as a consequence from its exceptions 
also. See Riddlesbarger <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co., supra; Arthur <em>vs.</em> 
Insurance Co., 78 N. Y., 462; Association <em>vs.</em> Norris (Pa. sup.) 8 Atl. 
Rep., 638; McElroy <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co. (Kan. sup.) 29 Pac. Rep., 478; 
Mclntyre <em>vs.</em> Insurance Co. (Mich.) 17 N. W. Rep., 781; Insurance Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Hooking (Pa. sup.) 18 Atl. Rep., 614; Wilson <em>vs.</em> Insurance 
Co., 27 Vt., 99; May, Insurance, sec. 483."</p>
<p>For the reasons stated and upon the authorities cited, we are constrained to 
hold that the failure of the plaintiff to sue the defendant insurance companies 
within the time limited in the insurance policies is fatal to his action and 
that the question is in nowise affected by section 49 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure. To so hold may bear harshly on the plaintiff in this particular case, 
but in matters of insurance law the importance of securing uniformity in 
judicial interpretation is such that we feel bound to follow the rule adopted by 
practically every court in the land. It may be observed that the question as to 
the reasonableness of a three months contractual limitation is not raised in the 
present case.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs. So 
ordered.</p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, AvanceÃ±a, Villamor,</em> and
