				<H3>MATEO DISTOR, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. GREGORIO DORADO AND ROSALIA ARROYO, AS ADMINISTRATORS OF THE ESTATE OF ANGEL DISTOR, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The plaintiff prays that he be declared owner of the four parcels of land 
described in his complaint and that the defendants be sentenced to return them 
to the plaintiff, or to pay him the sum of P31,800 as damages, plus P3,300 every 
year he fails to receive the product thereof, and P7,950 as attorney's fee.</p>
<p>In support of his claim he alleges:</p>
<p>"That on or about March 4, 1917, the plaintiff mortgaged said parcels of land 
to the deceased Angel Distor for 638 <em>cavans</em> and 15 <em>gantas</em> of 
palay, it having been stipulated that he could redeem them at any time from the 
aforesaid date, but must make the redemption within six years from March 4, 
1917, the date of the document, otherwise the plaintiff shall become bound to 
pay double the amount for which the property was given as security, that is to 
say, 1,217 <em>cavans</em> and 5 <em>gantas</em>, one-half of this amount being 
interest for the six years within which he failed to redeem. Another condition 
of said mortgage is that the plaintiff should remain in the possession and 
enjoyment of said four parcels in order that he might pay the mortgage debt with 
their products; but the aforesaid Angel Distor, taking advantage of plaintiff's 
ignorance of the Spanish language, drew or caused to be drawn a deed of mortgage 
in Spanish, wherein he stated, or caused to be stated, that he should have the 
usufruct of the aforesaid parcels of land for six years, at least, from March 4, 
1917, and that during those six years the plaintiff could not redeem them, both 
of which conditions are contrary to the true agreement had between the 
parties—the plaintiff and the deceased.</p>
<p>"That said deceased, Angel Distor, succeeded in causing the plaintiff to sign 
said document of mortgage because he made the latter believe that he could 
redeem the four parcels of land at any time and that said plaintiff Would remain 
in the possession and enjoyment thereof in accordance with what was really 
stipulated between them; for had he known at or prior to signing said document 
that he could not redeem them within six years from the aforesaid date and that 
the said deceased should have the usufruct thereof during the time they were not 
redeemed, said plaintiff would not have affixed his signature to said document 
"That said deed of mortgage is in the hands and possession of the defendant 
administrators and is a part of the evidence of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>"That the 630 <em>cavans</em> and 15 <em>gantas</em> of palay for which said 
four parcels of land were mortgaged were and are the aggregate of the principal, 
which is one-half, and the interest, which is the other half, of said quantity 
of palay.</p>
<p>"That the aforesaid deceased, Angel Distor, by virtue of said deed of 
mortgage, unlawfully and without justifiable motive, took possession of the 
aforesaid parcels of land in or about the middle of March, 1917, and continued 
in the possession and enjoyment thereof until his death, having disposed of and 
appropriated all their products during said period of time notwithstanding the 
several demands made upon him by the plaintiff to let him redeem the aforesaid 
four parcels and to return said products to him."</p>
<p>At the trial Exhibit A was presented as evidence, which literally is as 
follows:</p>
<p align="center">"REAL PROPERTY MORTGAGE</p>
<p>"I, Mateo Distor, married, of age, and resident of the municipality of 
Panitan, Province of Capiz, P. I., do hereby declare that in consideration of 
the quantity of six hundred thirty-eight <em>cavans</em> and fifteen gantas 
(638.15) of palay delivered to me by Mr. Angel Distor, proprietor, of age, and 
resident of the municipality of Panitan, Capiz, P. I., I hereby transfer by way 
of mortgage to said Angel Distor four parcels of irrigated land, having a 
capacity for the sowing of nine <em>cavans</em> approximately of palay, situated 
in the sitio of Maroag, barrio of Bangaan, municipality of Panitan, Capiz, P. 
I., described as follows: First parcel.— Irrigated land bound on the north by 
property of Ricardo Derecho; on the south by properties of Felipe Dizon and 
Mariano de Ocampo; on the east by property of Angel Distor, and on the west by 
properties of Salvador Dimaisip, Pedro Demafelis and Bias Amusing. Second 
parcel.— Irrigated land bound on the north by property of Roberto Derecho; on 
the south by property of Narcisa Distor, on the east and the west by a dry land 
of the vendor Mateo Distor. Third parcel.—Irrigated land bound on the north by 
lands of the vendor Mateo Distor; on the south by property of Angel Distor; on 
the east by property of Higidia Desales, and on the west by a dry land of Mateo 
Distor. fourth parcel.—Irrigated land bound on the north by a dry land of the 
heirs of Gregorio Diaz; on the south by a dry land of Fermin Descalzo; on the 
east by properties of Arcadio Devilles and Alejandro Altuveros, and on the west 
by property of Fermin Descalzo.</p>
<p>"Provided that if I deliver, or cause to be delivered, to said Mr. Angel 
Distor the quantity of 638 <em>cavans</em> and 15 gantas of palay after the term 
of six years from this date without interest, this mortgage shall become void 
and of no effect, otherwise it will remain in full force and effect until I can 
deliver said quantity of palay, my right of action, or that of my heirs and 
successors in interest, never to prescribe, and in the meantime I deliver to him 
the aforesaid lands in order that he may enjoy, and dispose of, them as though 
he were the owner thereof, by transferring or donating the same to another with 
the same conditions herein stipulated.</p>
<p>"In testimony whereof we executed this document in duplicate, one copy for 
the purchaser and the other for the seller, and we, the seller as well as the 
purchaser, hereunto set our hands at Panitan this fourth day of March, nineteen 
hundred and seventeen.</p>

<p>The trial court rendered judgment, absolving the defendants from the 
complaint with the costs against the plaintiff on the ground that the latter had 
not established by a preponderance of evidence the allegations contained in the 
complaint.</p>
<p>Now the appellant prays for a reversal of the judgment appealed from, 
assigning thirteen errors in his typewritten brief. The appellant contends that 
the contract Exhibit A, which he termed a mortgage in his complaint, is a 
contract of antichresis denned and sanctioned by article 1881 of the Civil 
Code.</p>
<p>In view of the phraseology used in said exhibit, we are inclined to hold that 
said exhibit expresses a contract of antichresis, as contended by the appellant, 
for the debtor delivered his lands to the creditor in order that the latter 
might enjoy their fruits, without obligation on the part of the former to pay 
interest upon his debt. But according to the exhibit itself, the debtor, that is 
the plaintiff, cannot redeem the property given in antichresis until after six 
years from March 4,1917.</p>
<p>There is no use entering upon a detailed discussion of the errors assigned by 
the appellant, for the reason that, after examining the evidence introduced in 
this case, we have reached the conclusion that the plaintiff has not 
successfully proven the allegations of the complaint as to the machinations 
imputed to the creditor in the drawing of Exhibit A, nor as to the damages and 
attorney's fee claimed by him.</p>
<p>The contract Exhibit A being valid, is binding between the contracting 
parties and their heirs.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, affirmed with the costs against the 
appellant; it being understood that to avoid unnecessary litigations, and it 
appearing from Exhibit A that, upon the date of the return of the record to the 
court of origin, the six years stipulated by the contracting parties shall have 
elapsed, and in view of the statement contained in the last page of appellees' 
brief that they have no objection to it, the appellant may recover from the 
defendants the lands claimed by him upon delivering the 638 <em>cavans</em> and 
15 gantas of palay or paying their value, as determined by the court below, 
should the parties not come to an agreement. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avancena, Ostrand,</em> and <em>Romualdez, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
