				<H3>INSOLVENCY OF THE LEYTE ASPHALT & MINERAL OIL CO., LTD., INSOLVENT DEBTOR. THE LEYTE ASPHALT & MINERAL OIL CO., LTD., APPELLEE, VS. BLOCK, JOHNSTON & GREENBAUM, CREDITORS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 28, 1928, the attorneys who are now appellants, 
filed a motion in the Court of First Instance of Cebu praying for the dismissal 
of these insolvency proceedings, with costs against the attorney who instituted 
them, or against his client for contempt of the court having jurisdiction over 
the receivership, and for contempt of said court of Cebu for not having informed 
the latter of the existence of such case in which the receivership had been 
decreed, and that the order of January 23, 1928 be vacated. 
<p align="justify">Said order of January 23, 1923 was issued by the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu ordering the suspension of payments to the applicant, the Leyte 
Asphalt and Mineral Oil Co., Ltd., and enjoining the latter from transferring 
its property or any part thereof to any person, firm of corporation; and setting 
the 16th of February of 1928, at 10 a. m. at the office of the clerk of the 
Court of First Instance of Cebu as the time and place for the election of the 
proper assignee, and summoning the applicant's creditors to such election. </p>
<p align="justify">Objection was made to said petition of the appellant attorneys 
by the Leyte Asphalt and Mineral Oil Co., Ltd., through its attorney. And after 
hearing the motion the Court of First Instance of Cebu denied it by an order of 
March 5, 1928. </p>
<p align="justify">The attorneys appealing from said adverse order assign the 
following errors as committed by the lower court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. In holding itself with jurisdiction to proceed with this 
insolvency proceeding and in not dismissing it. </p>
<p align="justify">"2. In not holding that the insolvent corporation is precluded 
from invoking the provisions of the Insolvency Law, Act No. 1956. </p>
<p align="justify">"3. In holding that section 52 of the Insolvency Law does not 
prohibit the discharge of an insolvent corporation of the type of the applicant 
herein, and in declaring such provisions to apply only to banking corporations 
and those as to which there are special provisions of law for their liquidation 
in case of insolvency. </p>
<p align="justify">"4. In holding that said court, in taking cognizance of the 
insolvency case is of a higher jurisdiction than any other court. </p>
<p align="justify">"5. In denying the motion of January 28, 1928, by its orders of 
March 5, 1928, and March 24, 1928." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The fundamental question raised here is whether Judge Jose de 
la Rama, presiding over Branch II, had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the 
insolvency of the Leyte Asphalt and Mineral Oil Co., Ltd., under the Insolvency 
Law, Act No. 1956, there being pending before Judge Guillerzno Pablo presiding 
over Branch III, a certain receivership proceeding, under section 176 of Act No. 
190, to which the said Leyte Asphalt and Mineral Oil Co., Ltd., had agreed. </p>
<p align="justify">Act No. 190 or the Law of Civil Procedure is general in 
character, while the Insolvency Law, Act No. 1956 is a special law and the rule 
is that on a specific matter the special law shall prevail over the general law, 
which shall be resorted to only to supply deficiencies in the former. (Art. 16, 
Civil Code.) </p>
<p align="justify">Section 176 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not so conclusive 
and complete with respect to insolvency cases, as the provisions of the 
Insolvency Law, whose proceedings are final as to the disposition of the 
credits, which does not take place in receivership proceedings. Consequently, 
the court below did not err in assuming jurisdiction of the present proceeding 
and in not dismissing it.</p>
<p align="justify">With respect to the acts of the Board of Directors of the Leyte 
Asphalt and Mineral Oil Co., Ltd., since this corporation is subject to the 
receivership proceeding, we do not think them illegal because the appointment of 
a receiver does not dissolve the corporation, nor bar the exercise of its 
corporate rights. (Teal Motor Co. and Teal vs. Court of First Instance of 
Manila, 51 Phil., 549.) </p>
<p align="justify">The estoppel invoked by the appellants under section 333, 
paragraph 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be held applicable to the 
appellee corporation in this case. No absolute inconsistency or irreconcilable 
conflict exists between the consent given by said corporation to the appointment 
of a receiver and the application to have itself declared insolvent. </p>
<p align="justify">The fact that under section 52 of the Insolvency Law the 
appellee corporation cannot obtain its discharge, is not a bar to this 
insolvency proceeding pursuing its course for the reasons stated. The error, if 
error it be, of the trial court in holding that the prohibition contained in 
section 52 of this Insolvency Law against discharging a corporation is 
applicable only to banking corporations and those as to which there are special 
provisions for their liquidation in case of insolvency, is not prejudicial to 
the appellants in our opinion. </p>
<p align="justify">Whether a receivership proceeding is speedier and more 
economical than an insolvency proceeding is a point which we deem does not 
affect the fundamental solution of the question raised in this case. 
Furthermore, we find the insolvency proceeding in the present case more definite 
and hence more beneficial and.hereby uphold it.</p>
<p align="justify">The order appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs of 
this instance against the appellants. So ordered. </p>
