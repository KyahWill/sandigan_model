				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action&nbsp; was brought by the plaintiff, Philippine National Bank, against Severo Alejano and his wife, Eusebia Piansay, and F. M. Yap Tico &amp; Co., Ltd.<br><br>The facts relevant to the questions submitted by this appeal are the following:<br><br>On March 16, 1922, the defendant Severo Alejano mortgaged the property described in the complaint to the plaintiff bank, to secure the payment of a debt of P300,000 which he&nbsp; owed the plaintiff.&nbsp; Payment of this debt was to be made, according to the agreement, by installments, to&nbsp; wit: P30,000 on the 30th of&nbsp; May, 1923; P30,000 on the&nbsp; 30th of May, 1924; P30,000 on the 30th&nbsp; of May,&nbsp; 1925; P30,000 on&nbsp; the 30th of May, 1926; and P180,000 on&nbsp; the 30th of May, 1927.&nbsp; Severo Alejano paid the sum of P60,000, due on&nbsp; May 30, 1923, and on May 30, 1924.&nbsp; But&nbsp; he failed to pay the P30,000 due upon the third installment, which became payable&nbsp; on May 30,&nbsp; 1925, as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the remaining installments.&nbsp; The plaintiff bank, from the month of November, 1926, until January, 1927, had received from&nbsp; Alejano&nbsp; 2,868.40&nbsp; piculs of sugar valued at P31,189.58,&nbsp; harvested on the mortgaged property&nbsp; during that period of time.<br><br>On the&nbsp; 18th of said month of March, 1922,&nbsp; that is, two days after the mortgage referred to had been executed in favor of the plaintiff bank, Severo Alejano executed, in accordance with the Chattel Mortgage Law, a first mortgage on the crops of said property, for the seasons of 1922- 23 to 1926-27, of the plantation already&nbsp; mortgaged to the bank.<br><br>The present action was instituted by the plaintiff bank against the defendant Severo Alejano for the&nbsp; recovery of the balance of the unpaid credit, with interest, and for the foreclosure of the&nbsp; mortgage in case of non-payment.<br><br>The defendant F. M. Yap Tico &amp; Co., Ltd., filed a counterclaim against the plaintiff for the recovery of the amount of P31,189.58, as the value of the sugar produced during the season of 1926-27, taken possession of by the plaintiff.<br><br>The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant Severo Alejano and&nbsp; his wife Eusebia Piansay to pay the plaintiff, with other&nbsp; pronouncements, the amount&nbsp; still owed to it,&nbsp; and ordering that in case of failure to make this&nbsp; payment within the period of 90 days, the mortgaged property described in the complaint should be sold at public auction.<br><br>With reference to the counterclaim filed by the defendant F. M. Yap Tico&nbsp; &amp; Co., Ltd., the court sentenced the plaintiff&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; National Bank&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay it&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P31,189.58, minus T712.21, being the expenses of the commission, loading, unloading, and freight of the sugar worth the amount&nbsp; claimed in the&nbsp; counterclaim.<br><br>The plaintiff&nbsp; appealed from this&nbsp; judgment.<br><br>The only question involved in this appeal is whether the plaintiff bank is entitled to the sugar produced during the 1926-27 season&nbsp; on the property mortgaged&nbsp; to&nbsp; it,&nbsp; with a preferential right over Yap Tico &amp;&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; Since&nbsp; said property&nbsp; was&nbsp; mortgaged to&nbsp; the plaintiff on March 16, 1922, and&nbsp; it was only on the&nbsp; 18th&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; month that the crops on said property for the seasons of 1922-23 to 1926-27 were mortgaged to F. M.&nbsp; Yap Tico &amp; Co., Ltd., the question is reduced to whether or not the&nbsp; crop on said property&nbsp; for the season of&nbsp; 1926-27 is included in&nbsp; the mortgage on the same in favor of the bank.&nbsp; If so, the mortgage on the property to the&nbsp; bank being prior&nbsp; to the mortgage on the crops thereof in favor of&nbsp; F.&nbsp; M.&nbsp; Yap Tico &amp; Co., Ltd., it is&nbsp; clear that the bank has a preferential right to the sugar over the latter.<br><br>Article 1877 of the Civil Code provides that a mortgage includes the fruits&nbsp; not collected when the obligation falls due.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this the fruits on&nbsp; the property mortgaged to the bank at the time the obligation&nbsp; fell due were included in the mortgage. Since the defendant Severo&nbsp; Alejano was&nbsp; in arrears from the 30th of May, 1924, the obligation,&nbsp; in fact,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; the contract, was due,&nbsp; and therefore the&nbsp; fruits on the plantation on&nbsp; that&nbsp; date were from that time subject to the mortgage&nbsp; until the payment of the obligation (Hijos de I. de la Rama&nbsp; vs. Betia, 54 Phil.. 149&nbsp; and 991; Afable vs. Belando, p.&nbsp; 64, ante.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The mortgage on the crops of the property in favor of F,&nbsp; M. Yap Tico&nbsp; &amp; Co., Ltd., being subsequent to the mortgage on the property to the bank, cannot prevail over the Iatter's right.<br><br>This conclusion&nbsp; renders it unnecessary to&nbsp; consider Hie remainder&nbsp; of the questions raised on this appeal.<br><br>For the&nbsp; foregoing, the judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is reversed, and the plaintiff is hereby absolved from the counterclaim filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; F. M. Yap Tico&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Ltd., without special pronouncement of costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Ostrand,</i> and <i>Johns, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
