(<i>a</i>) There shall be levied,, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources by every corporation, joint-stock company, partnership, joint account (cuenta en participacion), association or insurance company, organized in the Philippine Islands, no matter how created or organized, but not including" duly registered general copartnerships (companies colectivas), a tax of three per centum upon such income; and a like tax shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources within the Philippine Islands by every corporation, joint-stock company, partnership, joint account (cuenta en participacion), association, or insurance company organized, authorized, or existing under the laws of any foreign country, including interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations of residents, corporate or otherwise; <i>Provided, however</i>, That nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting the taxation of the income derived from dividends or net profits on which the normal tax has been paid.<p></p><p>"The gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition by a corporation, joint-stock company, partnership, joint account (cuenta en participacion), association, or insurance company, or property, real, personal, or mixed, shall be ascertained in accordance with subsections (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of section two of Act Numbered Two thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, as amended by Act Numbered Twenty-nine hundred and twenty-six.</p><p>"The foregoing tax rate shall apply to the net income received by every taxable corporation, joint-stock company, partnership, joint account (cuenta en participacion), association, or insurance company in the calendar year nineteen hundred and twenty and in each year thereafter."</p></blockquote><p></p><p>There is no doubt that if the plaintiffs merely formed a community of property the latter is exempt from the payment of income tax under the law. But according to the stipulated facts the plaintiffs organized a partnership of a civil nature because each of them put up money to buy a sweepstakes ticket for the sole purpose of dividing equally the prize which they may win, as they did in fact in the amount of <strike>P</strike>50,000 (article 1665, Civil Code). The partnership was not only formed, but upon the organization thereof and the winning of the prize, Jose Gatchalian personally appeared in the office of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, in his capacity as co-partner, as such collected the prize, the office issued the check for <strike>P</strike>50,000 in favor of Jose Gatchalian and company, and the said partner, in the same capacity, collected the said check. All these circumstances repel the idea that the plaintiffs organized and formed a community of property only.</p><p>Having organized and constituted a partnership of a civil nature, the said entity is the one bound to pay the income tax which the defendant collected under the aforesaid section 10 (<i>a</i>) of Act No. 2833, as amended by section 2 of Act No. 3761. There is no merit in plaintiffs' contention that the tax should be prorated among them and paid individually, resulting in their exemption from the tax.</p><p>In view of the foregoing, the appealed decision is affirmed, with the costs of this instance to the plaintiffs-appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><i>Avanceña, C. J., Villa-Real, Diaz, Laurel, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Moran, JJ., </i>concur.</p></div>
