				<BR><STRONG>RECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On October 12, 1933, the plaintiff filed before the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros a complaint praying, upon the allegations&nbsp; contained therein,&nbsp; that an&nbsp; injunction be issued,&nbsp; restraining the defendant from entering or&nbsp; passing through&nbsp; the properties of the plaintiff, specially through the "mill site" of plaintiff's sugar central.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff is the owner of&nbsp; a site in which is located its sugar central, with its factory building and residence for&nbsp; its&nbsp; employees and laborers, known as the "mill site.*'&nbsp; It also owns the adjoining sugar&nbsp; plantation known as Hacienda "Begofia."&nbsp;&nbsp; Across its properties the plaintiff constructed a&nbsp; road connecting the "mill site" with the provincial highway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this road plaintiff allowed and still allows vehicles to pass&nbsp; upon payment of a toll charge&nbsp; of P0.15&nbsp; for&nbsp; each truck or automobile.&nbsp; Pedestrians are allowed&nbsp; free passage through it.<br><br>Immediately adjoining the above-mentioned&nbsp; "mill site" of the plaintiff is the hacienda of Luciano Aguirre, known as Hacienda "Sangay," where the defendant has&nbsp; a billiard hall and a <i>tub</i>a saloon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like other&nbsp; people in and&nbsp; about the place, defendant used to pass through the said road of the plaintiff, because it was his&nbsp; only&nbsp; means&nbsp; of access&nbsp; to the Hacienda "Sangay" where he&nbsp; runs his billiard hall&nbsp; and tuba saloon.&nbsp; Later on,&nbsp; by order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff, every time that the defendant passed driving his automobile with a cargo of tuba plaintiff's gatekeeper would stop him and prevent him from passing through said road.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant in such cases merely deviated&nbsp; from said road and continued on his way to&nbsp; the Hacienda "Sangay" across the fields of Hacienda "Begona," likewise belonging to the plaintiff.<br><br>The alleged conveyance of&nbsp; <i>tuba</i> to plaintiff's&nbsp; "mill site" or the sale thereof within its property has not been established&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence adduced in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp; This the plaintiff admits in its&nbsp; brief (p.&nbsp; 15).&nbsp; Neither is there any evidence to&nbsp; show that&nbsp; the defendant actually&nbsp; created disturbance in&nbsp; plaintiff's properties,&nbsp; including its&nbsp; "mill site."<br><br>Other pertinent facts will be stated in appropriate places in this decision.<br><br>A. First of all it may be stated that in the case&nbsp; at bar the injunction applied for, constitutes,&nbsp; unlike the auxiliary and subordinate remedy that&nbsp; it ordinarily is, the principal remedy itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The relief should&nbsp; only be granted, therefore, after it has been established not only that the right sought to be protected exists,&nbsp; but also that the acts&nbsp; against which the injunction is to&nbsp; be directed&nbsp; are violative of said right.<br><br>"SEC. 164. <i>Circumstances under which a preliminary injunction may be granted.</i>&nbsp; A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; manner&nbsp; herein-after provided, to the satisfaction of the judge granting it:<br><blockquote><ol><li>That the plaintiff is entitled to the&nbsp; relief demanded and such relief,&nbsp; or any part&nbsp; thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the acts complained of either for a limited period or perpetually;<br></li><li>That the commission or continuance of some act complained of during&nbsp; the litigation would&nbsp; probably work injustice to the plaintiff;<br></li><li>That the defendant is doing, or threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to&nbsp; be done, some act probably in violation of the plaintiff's rights, respecting the subject of the action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Code of Civil Procedure.)</li></ol>"In&nbsp; order that, at the final trial of a case, an injunction may issue perpetually prohibiting the repetition or continuation of an act complained&nbsp; of,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; indispensable&nbsp; that it shall have been proven at trial that he who seeks such a remedy is entitled&nbsp; to ask for&nbsp; it;&nbsp; if he&nbsp; is not, his request must be denied."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Tumacder vs. Nueva, 16 Phil., 513.)<br><br>"The extraordinary remedy of injunction&nbsp; will&nbsp; not be granted to prevent or remove a&nbsp; nuisance unless&nbsp; there is a strong case of pressing necessity, and not because of a trifling discomfort."&nbsp; (De Ayala vs. Barretto, 33 Phil., 538.)<br><br>"The existence of a right&nbsp; violated is a prerequisite to the granting of an&nbsp; injunction.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; A permanent injunction should not be awarded except in a clear case and to prevent irreparable injury." (32 C. J., 34-36.)<br><br>"A court of chancery will not entertain a bill to enforce a mere valueless&nbsp; abstract right, and the court will, on its own motion, raise the point for its own protection."&nbsp; (Dunnom vs. Thomsen, 58 111.&nbsp; App., 390.)</blockquote>None of these&nbsp; requisites is&nbsp; present in the instant&nbsp; case. There&nbsp; has been a failure to establish either the existence of a clear and positive right of the plaintiff specially calling for judicial protection through an extraordinary writ of the kind applied for,&nbsp; or that&nbsp; the defendant has&nbsp; committed or attempts to commit any act&nbsp; which has endangered or tends to endanger the existence of said right, or has injured or threatens to injure the same.<br><br>In obtaining <i>ex-parte</i>&nbsp; a preliminary injunction in the lower court, the plaintiff made under oath in its complaint the following allegations, which&nbsp; later&nbsp; turned&nbsp; out to&nbsp; be untrue, or, at least, beyond the capacity of plaintiff to prove:<br><blockquote>''3. That on sundry occasions heretofore, the defendant used to go to the said 'mill site' of the plaintiff, passing over the&nbsp; latter's private roads, and there caused trouble among the peaceful people of the place.<br><br>"4. That the&nbsp; plaintiff, through&nbsp; its representatives, has prohibited the defendant from entering its private property, but this notwithstanding, the defendant&nbsp; still persists in repeating his incursions into the said private roads and 'mill site' of the plaintiff, disturbing public order and molesting plaintiff's employees and their families.</blockquote>The court, in its order granting the&nbsp; preliminary injunction, said:<br><blockquote>"Considering the said complaint and the sworn statement of its correctness&nbsp; filed by&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; attorneys<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> and&nbsp; it appearing satisfactorily that the issuance of a preliminary injunction is&nbsp; in order because of the sufficiency&nbsp; of the grounds alleged, upon the filing of a bond, it is hereby, etc. "</blockquote>After obtaining the preliminary injunction, the plaintiff amended its complaint by eliminating therefrom those very allegations upon which the court granted the temporary remedy,&nbsp; namely, the&nbsp; acts&nbsp; imputed&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendant "of causing trouble among the peaceful people of plaintiff's 'mill site and&nbsp; of&nbsp; disturbing public order&nbsp; and molesting plaintiff's employees and their families within the private roads and the 'mill site' of the&nbsp; plaintiff."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff doubtless&nbsp; overlooked the fact that the allegation it availed of to obtain&nbsp; a preliminary injunction was necessary to secure one of a permanent character.&nbsp; In its new complaint, its only grievance is that the defendant insists in passing through its property to take <i>tuba</i> to the Hacienda "Sangay" (which does&nbsp; not&nbsp; belong to the&nbsp; plaintiff but to Luciano Aguirre, and&nbsp; where the defendant has established a legitimate business).&nbsp; The amended complaint no longer alleges<br><br>It develops, however, that neither the original complaint nor the one amended states how and why the&nbsp; mere passage of the&nbsp; defendant over plaintiff's estate to convey <i>tuba</i> to the Hacienda "Sangay" has caused damages to plaintiff's property rights, requiring the unusual intervention and prohibition&nbsp; thereof by the courts through injunctive relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff failed not only to make any allegation&nbsp; to&nbsp; this effect,&nbsp; but also to state that the road on its&nbsp; property where the defendant&nbsp; used to pass on his way to the Hacienda "Sangay" was&nbsp; open to the public in&nbsp; general, and that the plaintiff, exercising without any permit a power exclusively lodged in the state by reason of its sovereign capacity, required the payment of passage fees for the use of said road.<br><br>Now, there being no contention here that the defendant, in passing over plaintiff's estate to take <i>tuba</i> to&nbsp; the Hacienda "Sangay," occasioned&nbsp; damages to such estate, or&nbsp; that he sold tuba within&nbsp; the confines&nbsp; thereof, what could&nbsp; have been the basis of plaintiff's right for which the special protection of the court is invoked,&nbsp; and of the illegal&nbsp; act&nbsp; laid at defendant's&nbsp; door?&nbsp; Defendant's passage&nbsp; over plaintiff's property&nbsp; does&nbsp; not, of itself, constitute&nbsp; an&nbsp; unlawful act inasmuch as the plaintiff, of its own&nbsp; accord, opened the same to the public conditioned only upon the payment of transit fees by motor vehicles.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; does&nbsp; the mere transportation&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span> over plaintiff's estate&nbsp; amount to a violation of the latter's property rights,&nbsp; unless the goods' destination be at any point within the confines thereof, or unless&nbsp; the said goods be sold in transit to the laborers&nbsp; and employees of the plaintiff, which, as plaintiff itself admits in its&nbsp; brief (p. 15), has&nbsp; not been shown.<br><br>The&nbsp; deduction from plaintiff's&nbsp; evidence is,&nbsp; that the real damage which it seeks&nbsp; to avoid does not consist in defendant's taking <i>tuba</i> with him while traversing the former's property, as there is no causal relation between the act and any resultant damage, but in the fact that <i>tuba</i> is disposed of at&nbsp; the Hacienda "Sangay" to which plaintiff's laborers have access.&nbsp;&nbsp; What should, therefore, be enjoined, if it were legally possible, is&nbsp; defendant's sale&nbsp; of tuba at the Hacienda&nbsp; "Sangay," and&nbsp; not its conveyance&nbsp; across plaintiff's estate.&nbsp; But if,&nbsp; as plaintiff concedes&nbsp; (brief, p. 16), the former cannot be&nbsp; legally enjoined, least of all can the latter be restrained as long as the public in general is free to go about the said property and it has not been shown that the defendant, in passing through&nbsp; it, has occasioned damage thereto or has committed any act infringing plaintiff's property&nbsp; rights or has&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to pay the required road toll.<br><br>Defendant's&nbsp; sale of <i>tuba</i> at the Hacienda "Sangay" is nothing more than the exercise of a legitimate business, and no real damage to third persons can arise from it as a natural and logical consequence.&nbsp; The bare possibility that plaintiff's laborers, due to the contiguity of the Hacienda "Sangay" to&nbsp; its property, might come to defendant's store to imbibe <i>tuba</i> to drunkenness, does not warrant the conclusion that&nbsp; the defendant, in thus running the business, impinges upon plaintiff's property rights and should thereby be judicially enjoined.&nbsp; The damage which plaintiff seeks to enjoin&nbsp; by this action does not consist, as has been demonstrated, in defendant's maintaining a tuba store&nbsp; at the Hacienda "Sangay," or in defendant's crossing its property while taking <i>tuba</i> to the&nbsp; Hacienda "Sangay," but in its laborers finding their way to the said hacienda in&nbsp; order to buy <i>tuba</i>&nbsp; and become drunk.&nbsp; In other words, the act sought to be restrained as injurious or prejudicial to plaintiff's interests, is that committed, not by the&nbsp; defendant, but by plaintiff's own laborers.&nbsp; Rightly and logically, the injunction should be&nbsp; directed against&nbsp; said laborers&nbsp; to the end that&nbsp; they should abstain from going to the Hacienda "Sangay" in order to buy&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span> and become drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it would seem unusual for the plaintiff to do this, it should at least exercise stricter vigilance and impose rigorous discipline on its laborers by, for instance, punishing drunkenness&nbsp; with expulsion.&nbsp; Plaintiff's&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; lies in its own hands and should not be looked&nbsp; for&nbsp; in the courts at the sacrifice of other interests no less sacred and&nbsp; legitimate than the plaintiff's.<br><br>Where&nbsp; one has a&nbsp; right to do a&nbsp; thing equity&nbsp; has no power to restrain him from doing it.&nbsp; (Dammann vs. Hydraulic Clutch&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; 187&nbsp; Pac,&nbsp; 1069.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Acts&nbsp; under the authority of the law&nbsp; will not be&nbsp; enjoined&nbsp; (Bonaparte vs. Camden, etc. Railroad Co., 3 Fed. Cas.&nbsp; No. 1617, Baldw., 205).&nbsp; Lawful&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; rights&nbsp; incidentally injuring others may not be enjoined&nbsp; by injunction.&nbsp; (14 R. C. L., 369.)&nbsp; "It is&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; an established principle that one may not be enjoined from doing lawful acts to protect and enforce his rights of property or&nbsp; of person,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *." (14 R. C. L., pp. 365, 366.)<br><br>It is said that the plaintiff seeks to enjoin the&nbsp; defendant, not from selling <i>tuba</i> at his store in the Hacienda "Sangay," but from passing through its property to introduce tuba to said hacienda (plaintiff's brief, p.&nbsp; 16).&nbsp; The&nbsp; legal rule, however, is that what the law does not authorize&nbsp; to be done directly, cannot be done indirectly.&nbsp; If the&nbsp; plaintiff cannot judicially enjoin the defendant from selling tuba&nbsp; at the Hacienda "Sangay," neither can it obtain said injunction to prevent him from passing over its property to transport tuba to that place as long as the defendant is ready to pay the transit fees required by the plaintiff&nbsp; and does not sell the said goods&nbsp; inside the said property.<br><br>Suppose that the defendant, instead of being a tuba vendor, is a&nbsp; social propagandist whose preachings, while not subversive of the established legal order, are not acceptable to some capitalistic organizations, say the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; Suppose that the defendant, armed with the corresponding official permit, should desire to go to the Hacienda "Sangay" through plaintiffs estate for the&nbsp; purpose of explaining to the laborers the advantage of the&nbsp; latter organizing themselves into unions, or joining existing ones,&nbsp; to better defend their interests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff learns in time of the&nbsp; plan and determines to frustrate it in the belief that it would be prejudicial to its interests for the laborers to be "unionized,"&nbsp; while&nbsp; it is for its&nbsp; good that the laborers be&nbsp; contracted under the so-called "open shop" system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unable to stop the holding of the meeting because the same is not to take place&nbsp; on its property, may the plaintiff secure an injunction from the courts to prevent the defendant to pass through the&nbsp; said&nbsp; property in order to reach the place of the meeting, by alleging that the&nbsp; defendant entertains theories of social reform which might poison the minds of the laborers at the expense of the plaintiff's interests?&nbsp;&nbsp; May the latter, under&nbsp; the&nbsp; same hypothesis, maintain that defendant's act in passing through its property, which is&nbsp; open to public use, constitute trespass or usurpation restrainable by&nbsp; injunction?&nbsp; If the answer to these questions is,&nbsp; as it must&nbsp; be, in the negative, the present case is not susceptible of&nbsp; a&nbsp; different solution.&nbsp; The only difference between the two cases is that in the one supposed the dreaded damage to plaintiff's interests is of more moment and of more lasting effect than that in the case at bar.<br><br>When a private road has been thrown open&nbsp; to public use, no&nbsp; action for trespass is maintainable against any person who desires to make use thereof; consequently, an injunction suit likewise does not lie.<br><br>"Private roads, except where laid out under constitutional provisions authorizing the condemnation of private property for a private use, are public&nbsp; roads in the sense that they are open to all who see fit to use them, and it is immaterial that the road is subject to gates and bars, or that it is merely a <i>cul de sac</i>.&nbsp; Being thus considered as a public road,&nbsp; it necessarily follows that&nbsp; <i>the&nbsp; owner of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land through which the road is laid out cannot maintain an action of trespass against any person using it;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * " (50 C. J., pp. 397, 398.)<br><br>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Where it is clear that the complainant does not have the right that he claims, he&nbsp; is not entitled to an injunction, either temporary or perpetual, to prevent a violation of such&nbsp; supposed right.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; An injunction will not issue to protect a right not in esse and which may never arise or to restrain an act which does not give rise to a cause of action,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."&nbsp;&nbsp; (32 C. J., pp. 34, 35.)<br><br>B. "In its brief, plaintiff states:<br><blockquote>"In transporting the tuba which he sells in his saloon in Hacienda 'Sangay' the defendant used to pass thru the private road of&nbsp; the plaintiff which connects its sugar central with the provincial road.&nbsp; On this&nbsp; private road the plaintiff has put up a gate&nbsp; under the&nbsp; charge of a keeper, and every time&nbsp; that the defendant passed with a cargo of <i>tuba</i> the gatekeeper would stop him and remind him that tuba&nbsp; was not permitted entry into the private properties of the company, but instead of heeding this prohibition the defendant would simply deviate from the&nbsp; road and continue on his way to hacienda 'Sangay'&nbsp; by way of the fields of Hacienda 'Begona,' which is also the private property of the plaintiff."</blockquote>It is deducible from the above statement that, whenever the gatekeeper of the plaintiff prevented the defendant from passing thru its so-called "private road,"&nbsp; on his way from the provincial road to the Hacienda "Sangay," the&nbsp; defendant deviated from said road and carried the tuba across the lands of the Hacienda "Begona" leading to the Hacienda "Sangay."&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence discloses that this passageway across the Hacienda "Begona" is the same one frequented by carabaos (s. t., 32,36). Plaintiff intends not only to prohibit the defendant from using the road in question, but also from crossing the lands of the Hacienda "Begona," also belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; where carabaos are allowed to roam.&nbsp;&nbsp; An&nbsp; act&nbsp; so shocking&nbsp; to the conscience, one is reminded, could only have been perpetrated during the feudal period when human rights were unmercifully sacrificed to property rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an injunction should lie&nbsp; in the instant case, it should be in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, to enjoin the latter from obstructing the former to pass over the road in question to convey tuba to the Hacienda "Sangay."&nbsp;&nbsp; It is indeed strange that it is the plaintiff and not the defendant that should have applied for the remedy.<br><br>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; An injunction will not be granted when&nbsp; good conscience does not require it, where it will operate oppressively&nbsp; or contrary to justice,&nbsp; where&nbsp; it is not reasonable and equitable under the circumstances of the case, or where it will tend to promote, rather than to prevent, fraud and injustice.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (32 C. J., p. 33.)&nbsp; "*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; a court of equity may interfere&nbsp; by injunction to restrain a party from&nbsp; enforcing&nbsp; a legal right against all equity&nbsp; and&nbsp; conscience.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (14 R. C. L., pp. 365, 366, par.&nbsp; 66.) "*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The comparative convenience or inconvenience of the parties from&nbsp; granting&nbsp; or withholding the injunction sought should be considered, and none should be granted if it would operate oppressively or inequitably, or contrary to the real justice of the case.&nbsp; This doctrine is well established.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (14 R. C. L., pp. 357, 358, par. 60.)<br><br>"The power of the courts to issue injunctions&nbsp; should be exercised with great caution and only where the reason and necessity therefor are clearly&nbsp; established; and while this rule has been applied more&nbsp; frequently in the case of preliminary and mandatory&nbsp; injunctions, it applies to injunctions&nbsp; of all classes, and to restraining orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *" (32 C. J., pp. 33, 34.)<br><br>"The writ of injunction will not be awarded in doubtful or&nbsp; new&nbsp; cases not coming&nbsp; within well-established principles of equity."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bonaparte vs. Camden, etc. Railroad Co., 3 Fed. Cas. No.&nbsp; 1617;&nbsp; Hardesty vs. Taft, 87&nbsp; Am.&nbsp; Dec, 584.)<br><br>C. Plaintiffs action is frivolous and baseless.<br><br>Plaintiff&nbsp; states&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sixth&nbsp; paragraph of its amended complaint:<br><blockquote>"6. That, in addition, the plaintiff, in the exercise of its property&nbsp; rights, does not want to allow the entry of the defendant in any part of its estate above mentioned in order to avert any friction or ill-feeling against him."</blockquote>The plaintiff, in&nbsp; petitioning the courts for an injunction to avert&nbsp; "friction or&nbsp; ill-feeling" against the&nbsp; defendant, invoking&nbsp; its sacred property rights, attempts to in-trust to them a mission at&nbsp; once beyond those conferred upon them by the Constitution and the laws, and Unbecoming of their dignity and decorum.<br><br>D. Plaintiff has not established the existence, real or probable, of the&nbsp; alleged damage against which&nbsp; the&nbsp; injunction is invoked.<br><br>As has been seen, the allegations of&nbsp; the&nbsp; amended complaint do&nbsp; not justify the granting of an injunction.&nbsp; The said allegations only state, as the&nbsp; basis of plaintiff's action, that the&nbsp; defendant insists in&nbsp; passing or "making incursions" on plaintiff's property to take tuba to the Hacienda "Sangay," and that the plaintiff&nbsp; wants to avoid "friction and ill-feeling against him." Such allegations do not imply the existence, or probable existence, of any real damage to plaintiff's rights which should be enjoined, and&nbsp; do not, therefore, constitute a legal cause of action.&nbsp; On the other hand, what the plaintiff attempted to establish by its evidence differs from the allegations of its amended complaint. What said evidence really discloses is not, that the plaintiff had forbidden the defendant to convey tuba to the Hacienda "Sangay" through&nbsp; plaintiff's estate, but to introduce&nbsp; tuba into&nbsp; the central or&nbsp; to place tuba on its lands, or, according to Exhibit&nbsp; A, to&nbsp; trespass&nbsp; illegally&nbsp; on plaintiff's estate. The&nbsp; testimony of the gatekeeper Santiago Plagata and the accountant Ankerson is as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="13%"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td width="87%"><p>Why did you detain him?—A. Because the Central forbids the bringing of tuba to the Central.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td>Why does the Central prohibit the entry of <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span>— A. The Central prohibits the entry of tuba there because the laborers, generally, buy <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span>, drink it and become drunk, and are unable to work, and sometimes they fight because they are drunk." (S. t., p. 5.)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td>Why did you kick them?—A. Because the North Negros Sugar Co. prohibits the placing of <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span> on those lands." (S. t, pp. 38, 39.) </td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Exhibit A, the alleged&nbsp; letter addressed by the plaintiff to the defendant,&nbsp; recites:<br><blockquote>"Mr.&nbsp; SERAFIN HIDALGO,&nbsp; <i>Driver&nbsp; of&nbsp; Auto,&nbsp; License&nbsp; No. 1085-1935</i>.<br><br>"Present.<br><br>"Sir: Effective this date,&nbsp; you&nbsp; are hereby forbidden to trespass upon any of. the Company's properties under penalties of law prescribed for trespass.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 200px;">"NORTH NEGROS SUGAR CO., INC.<br></div><div style="margin-left: 200px;">"BY: (SGD.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Y. E. GREENFIELD<br></div><div style="margin-left: 360px;">"<i>Manager</i>"</div></blockquote>It will be noted&nbsp; that according to this letter, the defendant was enjoined by the plaintiff from passing thru its properties, whether he&nbsp; carried <i>tuba</i> or not.<br><br>Plaintiff's admission in its brief&nbsp; (p. 15) that it has not been established&nbsp; that the defendant has&nbsp; brought <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span> to the "mill site,"&nbsp; or&nbsp; has&nbsp; sold it within&nbsp; its property, is fatal to the present action charging the defendant&nbsp; with said acts.<br><br>E. The well-known principle of equity&nbsp; that&nbsp; "he&nbsp; who comes&nbsp; to equity&nbsp; must&nbsp; come with&nbsp; clean hands"&nbsp; bars the granting of the remedy applied for by the plaintiff.<br><br>It has been&nbsp; already stated that&nbsp; the plaintiff,&nbsp; to obtain a preliminary injunction&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case, alleged&nbsp; under oath in its original complaint facts which it knew to be false, or, at least, improbable, because it did not only eliminate them from the amended complaint which it filed after the issuance&nbsp; of the preliminary&nbsp; injunction,&nbsp; but it&nbsp; failed to substantiate them at the trial.&nbsp; We refer to the&nbsp; following allegations:&nbsp; "that the defendant&nbsp; used to go to the&nbsp; 'mill site' of the plaintiff passing through plaintiff's private roads and there cause trouble among the peaceful people of the place," and&nbsp; "that notwithstanding the prohibition of the plaintiff,&nbsp; the defendant insists&nbsp; in&nbsp; repeating his incursions into the said private&nbsp; roads and 'mill site' of the plaintiff, disturbing public order and molesting* plaintiff's employees and their families."<br><br>If said allegations were true, it is&nbsp; evident that plaintiff was entitled to a preliminary injunction at the commencement of the&nbsp; trial, and to a permanent injunction after the decision was rendered. But such is not the case, as the subsequent theory of the plaintiff, announced in its. amended complaint, is not that the defendant "made incursions&nbsp; into the 'mill site' and private roads of the plaintiff, causing trouble, disturbing&nbsp; public order, and molesting plaintiff's&nbsp; employees and&nbsp; their families," but only that the defendant, to take <i>tuba</i> to the Hacienda "Sangay," belonging to Luciano Aguirre,&nbsp; insisted in passing through plaintiff's estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; all this it follows that the plaintiff in order to obtain a preliminary injunction, trifled with the good faith of the lower&nbsp; court by knowingly making untrue allegations on matters important and essential to its cause of action. Consequently, it did not come to court with clean hands.<br><br>"<i>Coming&nbsp; into Equity with&nbsp; Clean&nbsp; Hands</i>.—The&nbsp; maxim that he who&nbsp; comes into equity must come with clean hands is, of course, applicable in suits to obtain relief by&nbsp; injunction.&nbsp; Injunction&nbsp; will be denied even though complainant shows that he has a right and would otherwise be entitled to the remedy&nbsp; in case it&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that he himself acted&nbsp; dishonestly, fraudulently or illegally in respect to the matter in which redress is sought, or where he has encouraged, invited or contributed to the injury sought to be enjoined.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the general principle that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands applies only to plaintiffs conduct in&nbsp; relation to the very matter in litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The want of equity that will bar a right to equitable relief for coming into court with unclean hands must be so directly connected with the matter in litigation that it has affected the equitable relations of the parties arising out of the transaction in question."&nbsp;&nbsp; (32 G. J., pp. 67, 68.)<br><br>At this point, attention should be directed to other facts of the case indicative of the&nbsp; censurable attitude which the plaintiff has taken in connection therewith.&nbsp; On one occasion, the defendant drove his automobile along the road in question, accompanied by Antonio Dequina, headed for the Hacienda "Sangay." As they had <i>tuba</i> with them, on reaching the gate they were halted by the gatekeeper.&nbsp; The defendant and his companion got off the car and unloaded the tuba in order to follow the passageway across the lands of the Hacienda "Begona," through which plaintiff's carabaos passed, until they could reach "Sangay"&nbsp; Thereupon, one Ankerson, accountant and auditor of the plaintiff, arrived and no sooner had be laid eyes on the tuba containers than he indignantly kicked them and uttered a blasphemy to both, spilling the contents thereof.&nbsp; The defendant protested and asked Ankerson to indemnify him for the value of the <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span> which had been wasted, to which Ankerson replied that he would make good what should be paid, and he then and there wrote and handed over a note to the defendant for presentation to plaintiff's cashier.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant presented the note, but this claim was not paid, and instead he was prosecuted for trespass in the justice of the peace court of Manapla under article 281&nbsp; of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code. So absurd and malicious was the charge that the court, in&nbsp; acquitting&nbsp; the defendant, entered the following&nbsp; order (Exhibit 3):<br><blockquote>"A peaceful citizen who passes through a&nbsp; private road open&nbsp; to the public does not commit the crime of trespass. Although the&nbsp; prohibition to&nbsp; the accused to be in a private property should be manifest, if the latter is not fenced or uninhabited, the mere fact that the accused is found on the place in question, for a lawful&nbsp; purpose, does not constitute the crime of trespass defined and&nbsp; punished under article 281 of the Revised Penal Code."</blockquote>The plaintiff did not stop at this; it filed the present action for injunction which, as has been seen, is nothing more than the culmination of a series of affronts which the plaintiff has&nbsp; perpetrated,&nbsp; privately ariti&nbsp; through&nbsp; the courts, against the defendant.<br><br>F. The exercise of discretion by&nbsp; trial&nbsp; courts in matters injunctive&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; interfered with&nbsp; by&nbsp; appellate courts except in cases of manifest abuse. "*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; The court&nbsp; which is to exercise the discretion is the trial court and&nbsp; not the appellate court.&nbsp; The action of the court may be reviewed on appeal or error in case of a clear abuse of discretion, but not otherwise, and ordinarily&nbsp; mandamus will not lie&nbsp; to control&nbsp; such discretion." (32 C. J., sec. 11, p. 33.)<br><br>True, the rule has particular application to preliminary injunctions, but the rule should not be otherwise&nbsp; with respect to permanent injunctions&nbsp; especially where, as in this case, the trial court,&nbsp; after granting the preliminary injunction,&nbsp; set the same aside in&nbsp; its final decision on a&nbsp; careful review of the evidence.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>It is undisputed that the road in question was constructed by the plaintiff on its own land, and that it&nbsp; connects the central or the "mill site" with&nbsp; the provincial road.&nbsp; We have also the admission that the plaintiff made this road accessible to the general public, regardless of class or group of persons or entities.&nbsp; Its use has been extended to employees and&nbsp; laborers of the&nbsp; plaintiff; and&nbsp; so also to all those who have a mind to pass through&nbsp; it, except that, in cases of motor vehicles, a passage fee of P0.15 each should be paid.&nbsp; There is no contention here that&nbsp; the defendant had refused to pay said tolls whenever he wanted&nbsp; to&nbsp; drive his car along the road in question.<br><br>We, therefore, have the case of an easement of way voluntarily constituted in&nbsp; favor of a community.&nbsp; Civil Code, articles 531 and 594 read:<br><br><blockquote>"ART. 531.

The owner of an&nbsp; estate may burden it with such easements as he may deem&nbsp; fit, and in such manner and form&nbsp; as he may consider desirable,&nbsp; provided he does not violate the law or public order."</blockquote>There is nothing in the constitution of this easement&nbsp; in violation of law or public&nbsp; order,&nbsp; except&nbsp; perhaps that the right to open&nbsp; roads and charge passage fees therefor&nbsp; is the State's by right of sovereignty&nbsp; and may not be&nbsp; taken over by a private individual without the requisite permit. This,&nbsp; however, would affect the right of the plaintiff&nbsp; to charge tolls, but not that of the defendant or of&nbsp; any other person to make use of the easement.<br><br>As&nbsp; may be&nbsp; seen from the language&nbsp; of article 594,&nbsp; in cases of voluntary easements, the&nbsp; owner is&nbsp; given ample liberty to establish them: "as he may deem fit, and in such manner and form&nbsp; as&nbsp; he may consider desirable."&nbsp; The plaintiff "considered it desirable" to open this road to the public in&nbsp; general,&nbsp; without imposing any condition save the payment of a&nbsp; fifteen-centavo toll by motor vehicles, and it may not now go back on this and deny the existence&nbsp; of an easement.&nbsp; Voluntary easements under article 594 are not contractual in nature; they constitute the act of the owner.&nbsp; If he&nbsp; exacts any condition, like the payment of a certain indemnity for the use of the easement, any person who&nbsp; is willing to pay&nbsp; it may make use of the&nbsp; easement. If the contention be made that a&nbsp; contract is necessary it may be stated&nbsp; that a contract exists from the time all those who desire to make use of the easement are disposed to pay the required indemnity.<br><br>The plaintiff contends that the easement of way is intermittent in nature and can only be acquired by virtue of a title under article 539.&nbsp; The defendant, however, does not lay claim to it by prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title in this case consists&nbsp; in the fact that the plaintiff has offered the use of this road to the general public upon payment of a certain sum as passage fee in the case of motor vehicles.<br><br>The cases of Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila vs. Roxas (22 Phil., 450),&nbsp; and Cuaycong vs. Benedicto&nbsp; (37 Phil., 781), are not controlling, as there the attempt was to establish that the right to an&nbsp; easement of way had been acquired by prescription.&nbsp; Here defendant's contention is, that while the road in question remains open to the public, he has&nbsp; a right to its use&nbsp; upon paying the&nbsp; passage fees required by the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed the latter&nbsp; may close it at its pleasure, as no period has been fixed when the easement was&nbsp; voluntarily constituted,&nbsp; but while&nbsp; the road is thrown open, the plaintiff may not capriciously exclude the defendant from its use.<br><br>Furthermore, plaintiff's evidence&nbsp; discloses the existence of a forcible right of way&nbsp; in favor of the owner and occupants&nbsp; of the Hacienda "Sangay"&nbsp; under the Civil Code, article 564, because, according to said evidence, those living in the Hacienda "Sangay" have no access to the provincial road except thru the road in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Santiago Plagata, principal witness of the plaintiff, testified thus:<br><blockquote>"Emerging from the provincial road, the defendant has necessarily to pass&nbsp; through this private road where&nbsp; the gate of which I am the keeper is situated, and then he gets to the Central."&nbsp; (S. t., p. 6.)<br><br><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="13%"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td width="87%">To go to the Hacienda 'Sangay,' is there any need to cross the 'mill site' of the Central?—A.

Only continuous and apparent servitudes, like the servitude of light and view, may&nbsp; be acquired by&nbsp; prescription (art. 537, Civil&nbsp; Code).&nbsp; Even assuming, however, that a servitude of way&nbsp; may be acquired by prescription in view of the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; present Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure, nevertheless,&nbsp; it can not be held that prescription exists in the present case.&nbsp; The free passage over the private way rests on mere tolerance on the part of the plaintiff, and it is a settled principle of law in this jurisdiction that acts merely&nbsp; tolerated can not give rise to prescription (Cortes vs. Yu-Tibo, 2 Phil., 24, 27; Ayala de Roxas vs. Maglonso, 8 Phil., 745; Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila vs. Roxas, 22 Phil., 450, 452, 453; Municipality of&nbsp; Nueva Caceres&nbsp; vs. Director of Lands and Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Caceres, 24 Phil., 485; Cuaycong vs. Benedicto, <i>supra</i>).<br><br>In what does the title of the plaintiff consist?&nbsp;&nbsp; By title as a mode of acquiring servitude, the Civil Code&nbsp; refers to the&nbsp; "juridical act"&nbsp; which&nbsp; gives birth to the&nbsp; servitude. "Son, pues, <i>titulos</i> constitutivos de&nbsp; los servidumbres <i>cualquiera que sea su clase</i>, la ley, la donation, el contrato y el testamento"&nbsp; (4 Manresa, Civil Code, 2d&nbsp; ed., pp. 594, 595). Title by law is lacking.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is neither will nor donation, for the making of a donation&nbsp; and the execution of a will require special formalities.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is elementary that the plaintiff, being an artificial person, has no capacity to execute a will.&nbsp; In my opinion, there is no title&nbsp; by contract.&nbsp; The act of&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; in opening the private way here&nbsp; involved did not constitute an offer to the public to use said way. There being no offer, there could be no acceptance; henre,&nbsp; no contract.<br><br>The plaintiff did not encumber his tenement with a servitude of way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Property is always presumed free from any and all&nbsp; encumbrances.&nbsp; The act of the plaintiff, performed wholly upon&nbsp; its own exclusive property,&nbsp; should not be construed to constitute the creation of a servitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Servitus in faciendo consistere nequit</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; "For a man&nbsp; should not use that which belongs to him as if it were a service only, but as his own property" (Law 13, title 31, third partida, quoted with approval in Cartes vs.&nbsp; Yu-Tibo, 2 Phil., 24, 27).<br><br>II. <i>The mere opening of&nbsp; the private way in question to the public did not necessarily clothe it with a public interest such as to compel the owner thereof to&nbsp; allow everybody to pass thereon.&nbsp; Even on the hypothesis that such private way is affected with a public interest, still, it is good law that the owner&nbsp; thereof may make reasonable&nbsp; restrictions and limitations on the use thereof by the general public.</i><br><br>Public regulation of&nbsp; private property under the police power is often justified&nbsp; on the ground that the&nbsp; property so regulated is affected with a public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase "affected with a public&nbsp; interest" was brought&nbsp; into prominence by the discussion in Lord Hale's treatise <i>De Portibus</i> Marts (1 Hargrave's Law Tracts, 78)&nbsp; of more&nbsp; than two centuries ago&nbsp; where the classic statement was made that when private&nbsp; property&nbsp; "is affected with a public interest, it ceases to be <i>juris privati</i> only."<br><br>Chief Justice&nbsp; Taft, speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States in&nbsp; Wolff Packing Co. vs. Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations (262 U. S., 522;&nbsp; 67 Law. ed., 1103,1108), enumerated as follows the businesses and occupations which may be said to be clothed with a public interest:<br><blockquote>"(1)&nbsp; Those which are carried on under the authority of a public grant of privileges which either expressly&nbsp; or impliedly imposes the affirmative duty of rendering a public service demanded by any member&nbsp; of the public.&nbsp; Such are the railroads, other common carriers and public utilities.<br><br>"(2)&nbsp; Certain&nbsp; occupations, regarded as exceptional, the public interest attaching to which, recognized from earliest times, has survived the period of arbitrary laws by Parliament or colonial legislatures for regulating all&nbsp; trades and&nbsp; callings.&nbsp; Such are those of the keepers of inns, cabs, and&nbsp; gristmills.&nbsp; (State&nbsp; vs. Edwards, 86 Me., 102; 25 L. R. A., 504; 41 Am. St. Rep., 528; 29 AtL, 947; Terminal Taxi-cab Co. vs. Kutz, 241 U. S., 252, 254; 60 Law. ed., 984, 986; P. U. R. 1916D,, 972;&nbsp; 36 Sup. Ct. Rep.,&nbsp; 583; Ann.

(Vol. 3, 2d ed., pp. 1758, 1759.&nbsp; See also German Alliance Ins. Co. vs. Lewis, 233 U. S., 389; 34 Sup. Ct., 612 ; 58 Law. ed., 1011; L.&nbsp; R. A.&nbsp; [1915C], 1189.)<br><br>To my mind,&nbsp; the road in question may not be likened unto a turnpike or toll road in the legal sense of the term. The right to construct and maintain a toll or turnpike road and to collect&nbsp; tolls&nbsp; exists&nbsp; only by virtue of an express&nbsp; grant from the legislature.&nbsp; (Powell vs. Sammons and Dotes, 31 Ala., 552; Blood vs. Woods, 30 P., 129;&nbsp; % Cal., 78; Volcano Canon Road Co. vs. Placer County, 26 P., 513; 88 Cal;, 634; Truckee, and Tahoe Turnpike&nbsp; Road Co. vs. Campbell, 44 Cal., 89; Virginia Canon&nbsp; Toll-Road Co. vs. People, 45 P., 398; 22 Colo., 429; 37 L.

R. 952.)&nbsp; So that if there has been&nbsp; no state grant, there can be no toll or turnpike road.&nbsp; In the case before us,&nbsp; the private&nbsp; way&nbsp; has been established and is being maintained by the plaintiff, a private entity,&nbsp; for its own accommodation and not&nbsp; by virtue of a grant from the state.<br><br>But&nbsp; even if we were&nbsp; to assume&nbsp; that the private way of the plaintiff here&nbsp; is property clothed with a public interest, the only inference&nbsp; would&nbsp; be that&nbsp; it is&nbsp; subject to governmental or public&nbsp; regulation and control&nbsp; or, as some courts put it, to the regulatory power of the state, exercised for the common&nbsp; good&nbsp; (Fisher vs.&nbsp; Yangco&nbsp; Steamship Co.,&nbsp; 31 Phil., 1; De&nbsp; Villata vs. Stanley, 32 Phil.,&nbsp; 541;&nbsp; 51 C. J., p. 9) by the legislature (State vs. Holm,&nbsp; 138 Minn.,&nbsp; 281; 164 N. W., 989),&nbsp; either directly or through administrative bodies endowed with power to that end (Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. vs. North&nbsp; Carolina Corp. Comm., 206 U.&nbsp; S.,&nbsp; 1; 27 S.

E., 619).<br><br>The philosophy inseparable from the logic of the adjudicated cases is based on the overwhelming power of regulation&nbsp; possessed&nbsp; by the state&nbsp; in&nbsp; the public interest.&nbsp; A finding, therefore, that the private way in question is property affected with a "public interest" leads to a recognition of the public power or regulation and no more.&nbsp; The fact, for instance, that the plaintiff has opened a way to the public and charges a fee or toll on motor vehicles for hire may lead the legislature or the administrative authorities to intervene&nbsp; and regulate and, if necessary,&nbsp; to determine the reasonableness of the fee charged under its&nbsp; rate-fixing authority.<br><br>Even as regards public&nbsp; utilities, courts have held&nbsp; with unerring uniformity that the utility itself may prescribe rules and regulations for the due and&nbsp; proper conduct of its business, and&nbsp; the protection of itself against fraud, injury or undue risk and liability, the only limitations being that said rules shall be lawful and reasonable.&nbsp; The utility may enforce&nbsp; compliance with its rules by those dealing with it and may&nbsp; refuse or discontinue service to one who does not conform to its rules.&nbsp; (See Thurston vs. Union Pacific R.

R. 2&nbsp; Q. B. Div.,&nbsp; 136; 46 L. J. Mag. Cas. N. S., 108; 25 Week. Rep.,&nbsp; 415; 13 Cox, C. C, 378; 35 L. T. N. S., 774) may be refused admission.<br><br>In the case at bar,&nbsp; it is not seriously contended that the plaintiff, by&nbsp; opening the road in question, has become a public utility.&nbsp; In this jurisdiction, the term "public utility"&nbsp; has&nbsp; a technical meaning and refers to the enterprises mentioned&nbsp; in section 13 of Act No. 3108, as amended&nbsp; by Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4033.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; admitted in the foregoing&nbsp; opinion. The difficulty arises&nbsp; because&nbsp; "public utility" is confused with&nbsp; "public interest."<br><br>III. <i>The foregoing opinion, by denying the right of the owner of the private way&nbsp; to impose what I consider is a reasonable limitation upon the use of Us property, undermines the right of ownership and its incidents.</i><br><br>Briefly stated, the case is this: Plaintiff is the owner of a sugar&nbsp; central and&nbsp; the premises on which it is located in Manapla, Occidental Negros.&nbsp; Realizing the necessity of constructing a private way through its&nbsp; property for&nbsp; its own convenience and the convenience of persons who may have dealings with it, it did open one to connect its property with the provincial road.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way is&nbsp; about a kilometer in length and terminates at the mill site of the hacienda. It was built at&nbsp; the expense of the&nbsp; owner, without any contribution from anyone.&nbsp; It is repaired, maintained and kept at the expense of the same owner.&nbsp; It is guarded&nbsp; by a gate keeper employed and paid by the owner itself.&nbsp; It was opened not&nbsp; at the behest&nbsp; of any&nbsp; public demand&nbsp; or necessity but primarily for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sole convenience&nbsp; of&nbsp; the owner.&nbsp; The defendant, Serafin Hidalgo, is the keeper&nbsp; of a <i>tienda</i> situated in a contiguous hacienda&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to Luciano Aguirre.&nbsp; The <i>tienda</i> is located&nbsp; almost on the borderline of&nbsp; the hacienda of the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; Hidalgo in this store sells&nbsp; and otherwise dispenses <i>tuba</i> which intoxicates the laborers of the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; incapacitates&nbsp; them for work and breaks their morale.&nbsp; The damage&nbsp; to&nbsp; the plaintiff is positive and real.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; not mere "bare&nbsp; possibility"&nbsp; as stated&nbsp; in the foregoing&nbsp; opinion.&nbsp; Upon these facts, the foregoing opinion&nbsp; holds&nbsp; that the defendant&nbsp; can not&nbsp; be prohibited&nbsp; by the plaintiff from using the&nbsp; latter's private way.&nbsp; I hold otherwise.&nbsp; I believe that the plaintiff may prohibit&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant from using its private property. Stated otherwise, the use by Hidalgo of the private way of the plaintiff may be conditioned&nbsp; upon his not&nbsp; carrying <i>tuba</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff may not,&nbsp; to&nbsp; be sure, prevent the sale&nbsp; of tuba outside&nbsp; the&nbsp; limits of its property.&nbsp; This is not pretended in this case.&nbsp; But because plaintiff may not prohibit dispensation by the defendant of the intoxicating beverage outside of&nbsp; its property, does it follow&nbsp; that it is in duty bound&nbsp; to offer facility to the defendant&nbsp; for the sale&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">tuba</span> and the consequent intoxication&nbsp; of its laborers?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it under any obligation,&nbsp; moral or&nbsp; legal, to&nbsp; do this?&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, can plaintiff be compelled to contribute, directly or indirectly, to the infliction upon itself of&nbsp; an&nbsp; admittedly real and positive damage and provide the means for its own destruction?&nbsp; To ask these questions is to answer them.&nbsp; That you may, for instance, hang a man because you&nbsp; have the physical or legal power to do&nbsp; so is conceivable, but that you may not only hang him but also compel&nbsp; him to hang himself is only possible among barbarians. Such a result is not possible even under the "Declaration of Bights of the Laboring and Exploited People by the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and&nbsp; Peasants' Deputies."&nbsp; Let me observe that social and&nbsp; economic equilibrium should be maintained by striking the proper balance.&nbsp; One extreme is as vicious and dangerous as the other.&nbsp; There is as much danger of destruction from the devastating winds blowing from the Caucasus and the Ural mountains as from the infectious and hallowed breath originating from the castles of the staggering feudal lords of Europe.&nbsp; Social storm&nbsp; is produced one way or the other.<br><br>The inviolability of&nbsp; private property dates as far back as the days long past when primitive society employed force to protect&nbsp; its collective ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the change&nbsp; of the proprietary tenure from collectivism to individualism, consequent upon the growth of the Roman concept of&nbsp; property,&nbsp; private force was substituted by state authority&nbsp; as the sanctioning power&nbsp; of&nbsp; ownership.&nbsp; Later evolution&nbsp; of civil society manifested the&nbsp; growth of state power.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Philippines&nbsp; finds&nbsp; herself&nbsp; engulfed in the vortex of this modern trend of&nbsp; greater state control of private property. Our Constitution, for instance, expressly authorizes&nbsp; the National Assembly to determne by law the size of private agricultural land&nbsp; which individuals,&nbsp; corporations and associations&nbsp; may acquire and&nbsp; hold, subject only to&nbsp; rights existing prior to the&nbsp; enactment of&nbsp; such&nbsp; law&nbsp; (Art. XII, sec. 3).&nbsp; It also provides that the State, upon&nbsp; payment of just compensation, may transfer to public&nbsp; ownership utilities&nbsp; and other private enterprises to be operated by&nbsp; the Government (Art, XII, sec.&nbsp; 1). And it permits the National Assembly to authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation&nbsp; of lands to be subdivided into small lots&nbsp; and conveyed at cost to individuals&nbsp; (Art. XII, sec. 4).&nbsp; This latter provision constitutes an extension of the power of eminent domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; The settled&nbsp; principle is that private&nbsp; property shall be taken only for public&nbsp; use (Visayan Refining Co. vs. Camus and Paredes, 40&nbsp; Phil., 550;&nbsp; People&nbsp; ex rel. Detroit&nbsp; &amp; H.&nbsp; R. Co. vs. Salem, 20 Mich., 452; 4 Am. Rep., 500).&nbsp; A provision to this&nbsp; effect is found in the Bill of Rights of our Constitution&nbsp; (Art. Ill, sec. 1, par. 2.&nbsp; See also&nbsp; Ordinance&nbsp; appended to&nbsp; the Constitution, sec.&nbsp; 1, par. 12; Civil Code, art. 349;&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure, sec 241; Adm. Code, sec. 2245.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar provisions are to be found in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and in the constitutions of the great majority of the states of the Union. Some state constitutions even go to the extent&nbsp; of expressly prohibiting the taking of property for private use (Alabama [1901], I,&nbsp; 23; Arizona [1912],&nbsp; II, 17;&nbsp; Colorado&nbsp; [1876], II, 14, 15; Georgia [1877] I, iii,&nbsp; par. I;&nbsp; Missouri&nbsp; [1875], II, 20: Washington [1889], I, 16; Wyoming [1889],&nbsp; I, 32, 33).&nbsp; But whilst&nbsp; innovations have&nbsp; been&nbsp; introduced to enlarge the control by the public power of&nbsp; private property, the Filipino philosophy of&nbsp; the inviolability&nbsp; of property right has tarried&nbsp; unaltered behind the thin veneer of our Constitution.&nbsp; By providing in the Bill of Rights&nbsp; that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law, that&nbsp; private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation, that the people shall be secure in their possessions against unreasonable searches and seizures, that no law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be&nbsp; passed, the Filipino people, for&nbsp; their own protection, stamped upon the right of private ownership an inviolability—a deep and&nbsp; sacred&nbsp; impress—which&nbsp; can not be easily wiped out or frittered away until it is no&nbsp; more. The&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of private right,&nbsp; it seems to&nbsp; me,&nbsp; is a reflection of our inherent temperament as a people, and albeit fundamental principles must be construed in the&nbsp; light of changing conditions and&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; the&nbsp; fabric with which&nbsp; our social and&nbsp; political&nbsp; organizations have&nbsp; been wrought or woven into a lasting whole, has remained unaltered.&nbsp;&nbsp; And not even the principle of social justice, vital and salutary as it is,&nbsp; can be invoked to annihilate property rights.<br><br>Restrictions&nbsp; upon the paramount property right lodged in the private individual arise only from the superior right of the state, the legal&nbsp; rights of third persons and the general duties resting upon the owner&nbsp; as a law-abiding citizen. In&nbsp; the language of Chief Justice&nbsp; Shaw in Commonwealth vs.&nbsp; Alger (7 Cush.&nbsp; [Mass.], 53), "We think it as a settled principle, growing out of the nature of well ordered civil society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under the implied liability that his&nbsp; use of it may be so regulated, that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an&nbsp; equal&nbsp; right to the enjoyment of their property,&nbsp; nor injurious to the rights of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; All property in this commonwealth, as well that in the interior as that bordering on tide-waters, is derived directly or indirectly from the government, and held subject to those general&nbsp; regulations, which are necessary to the common good and general welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rights of property, like all other social and conventional rights, are subject to such reasonable limitations in their enjoyment, as shall prevent them from being injurious, and&nbsp; to such reasonable restraints and regulations established by law, as the legislature, under the gov- erning and controlling power vested in them by the Constitution, may&nbsp; think necessary and expedient."&nbsp;&nbsp; (See also Mugler&nbsp; vs. Kansas, 123 U. S., 623; 8 Sup. Ct., 273; 31 Law. ed., 205.)<br><br>IV. <i>From what has been said, it does not,&nbsp; however, follow that plaintiff is entitled to the equitable remedy of injunction.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; first&nbsp; place</i>, the&nbsp; plaintiff styled&nbsp; the relief it&nbsp; is seeking&nbsp; as&nbsp; an "Accion&nbsp; Negatoria" which, under the old Spanish procedural law and under the Roman law, consisted&nbsp;&nbsp; in the right&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; landowner&nbsp; to defend the free dominion of his tenement.&nbsp; This action which had specific application to&nbsp; servitudes has, however, been repealed by tfaie Code of Civil Procedure now in force.&nbsp; The right of the plaintiff should, consequently, be tested by the rules governing the issuance of the new remedy of injunction.&nbsp; The circumstances under which, in accordance&nbsp; with the former procedural law, the <i>action negatoria</i> could properly&nbsp; issue, would not necessarily justify the issuance of an injunction, as defined&nbsp; and provided&nbsp; in the new Code (as to the other Spanish&nbsp; <i>interdietos de adquirir, de&nbsp; retener and&nbsp; de recobrar or de despojo, see</i> Devesa vs. Arbes, 13 Phil., 273,&nbsp; 279; Liongson vs. Martinez,&nbsp; 36 Phil.,&nbsp; 948, 952).&nbsp; In the second&nbsp; place,&nbsp;&nbsp; injunction,&nbsp; being an equitable remedy, the granting thereof is dependent upon the sound discretion of the court (32 C. J., pp. 29-33; 14 R. C. L., pp. 307,&nbsp; 308).&nbsp; It is only in clear&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of abuse of discretion on the part of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; judge that review on appeal should be made&nbsp; (32 C. J., p. 33).&nbsp; "There is no power the exercise of which&nbsp; is more delicate, which requires greater caution, deliberation,&nbsp; and sound discretion, or more&nbsp; dangerous in&nbsp; a doubtful case, than the issuing an injunction; it is the strong arm of equity, that never ought to be extended unless to cases&nbsp; of great injury, where courts of law cannot afford an adequate or commensurate remedy in damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right must be clear, the injury impending or threatened, so as to be averted&nbsp; only by the protecting preventive process of injunction."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bonaparte vs. Camden, etc., R.&nbsp; Co., 3 Fed. Cas. No.&nbsp; 1617; Baldw., 205, 217.) <i>In the third place</i>, the remedy sought here is not against the transportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>tuba</i> by the defendant&nbsp; through the premises of the plaintiff, but the entire exclusion therefrom of the defendant regardless of whether he carries tuba or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>In the fourth place</i>, the revocation of the judgment of the court&nbsp; below would exclude the defendant alone from the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of the&nbsp; private way while the general public will be permitted to do so.&nbsp; The defendant would be excluded not only from the use&nbsp; of the private&nbsp; premises of the plaintiff,&nbsp; but&nbsp; also from the way left open to the public, regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; whether he is carrying tuba or not.&nbsp; The result being clearly unjust, the extraordinary legal remedy of injunction should not be granted.&nbsp; (Truly vs. Wanzer, 5 How., 141; 12&nbsp; Law. ed., 88; Irwin vs. Dixion, 9 How., 11; 13 Law. ed., 25;&nbsp; Sands vs. Marburg, 36 Ga., 534; 91 Am.&nbsp; Dec,&nbsp; 781; Beidenkopf vs. Des Moines Life Ins.

P.1 Ankerson, auditor of the plaintiff company, in overturning the receptacles (<i>balading</i>)&nbsp; of <i>tuba</i>, which the&nbsp; defendant attempted to carry through the premises of the plaintiff company,&nbsp; in defiance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter's repeated prohibition. Righteous indignation at the misconduct of an employee of the plaintiff company and&nbsp; the damage caused the&nbsp; defendant, however, should not carry us beyond the merits of the present&nbsp; controversy.&nbsp; The protection of the property rights of the plaintiff is one thing and&nbsp; the condemnation of the acts of&nbsp; vandalism of an&nbsp; employee of the plaintiff another thing.<br><br>AVANCEÑA, C. J.:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I concur with the opinion of Justice Laurel. Diaz, J.;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I concur with the opinion of Justice Laurel. <br></div><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br>VILLA-REAL, J.:<br><br>I concur with the opinion of Justice Laurel in so far as he dissents from the opinion of Justice Recto, but I dissent from it in so far as he concurs with said opinion.<br><br>In concurring with the opinion of Justice Recto, Justice Laurel says: "<i>In the fourth place</i>, the revocation of the judgment of the court below would exclude the defendant alone from the use of the private way while the&nbsp; general public will be&nbsp; permitted to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so.&nbsp; The defendant would be excluded not only from the use of the private premises of the plaintiff, but also from the way left open to the public, regardless of whether he is carrying <i>tuba</i> or not.&nbsp; The result being clearly unjust, the extraordinary legal&nbsp; remedy of injunction should not be granted."&nbsp; The facts&nbsp; in this case show that said defendant&nbsp; was warned several times not to pass on said road when carrying tuba to the adjoining "Hacienda&nbsp; Sangay" where he sells it to the plaintiffs workmen who become intoxicated and unfit for work.&nbsp; The repeated warnings were disregarded by the defendant, until one day the auditor of the said plaintiff became so disgusted that he could not refrain from stopping his&nbsp; car and compelling him to unload the <i>tuba</i>. If the North&nbsp; Negros Sugar Co., Inc., as the owner of the private road in question, has a right to regulate its use by imposing&nbsp; reasonable restrictions and&nbsp; limitations,&nbsp; to&nbsp; prohibit its&nbsp; use by the defendant who has repeatedly disregarded the warning of its auditor, thus becoming a&nbsp; <i>persona non grata</i>, is certainly not unjust.&nbsp; To force the owner of&nbsp; a private road to allow the use of said road by&nbsp; a person who has incurred his displeasure, if not his hatred, just because he allows other persons to pass through it,&nbsp; cannot under&nbsp; whatever consideration, be just.&nbsp; In order to avoid taking the law into its own hands in&nbsp; excluding the defendant who has become an undesirable person to it, the plaintiff, as a law abiding corporation, has come to the&nbsp; courts to seek help in the enforcement&nbsp; of its property rights.&nbsp; The opinion of Justice Laurel, concurred in by the Chief Justice and Justice Diaz, while&nbsp; recognizing the right of said plaintiff to regulate the use of its private road by imposing upon&nbsp; the users reasonable restrictions and limitations,&nbsp; refuses it&nbsp; the remedy it seeks&nbsp; to help&nbsp; it in&nbsp; preventing an&nbsp; undesirable person to use its private road, leaving to it no alternative except either to&nbsp; take the law&nbsp; into&nbsp; its&nbsp; own hands or to close the road to&nbsp; everybody with the exception of those who deal with it in its business.<br><br>I am, therefore, of the opinion that the writ of injunction, as an auxiliary remedy, should be granted,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the judgment of the court below&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; revoked. <br><br>IMPERIAL, J.:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I concur in the foregoing dissenting&nbsp; opinion of Justice Villa-Real.</div></div>
