				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS.  BRUNO OCBINA  Y DE  LOS SANTOS  (<I>ALIAS</I> BRUNO  OCVINA)  AND MANUEL  PAMERO,  DEFENDANTS. BRUNO OCBINA Y DE LOS SANTOS  (<I>ALIAS</I> BRUNO OCVINA) , APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant was prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Manila for the crime of theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon his plea of guilty, he was sentenced to suffer&nbsp; four months and one&nbsp; day of <i>arresto&nbsp; mayor</i>, and an additional penalty of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> for habitual&nbsp; delinquency. In support of this appeal counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> for the appellant contends that the lower court erred (1)&nbsp; in not advising the&nbsp; appellant of his right to have counsel; and (2) in sentencing him to suffer the penalty above indicated<br><br>1. In&nbsp; United&nbsp; States vs. Escalante&nbsp; (36 Phil., 743), this court held that the failure of the record to disclose affirmatively that the trial judge advised the accused of his right to have counsel is not sufficient ground&nbsp; to&nbsp; reverse a judgment of conviction.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason for this doctrine, is that the trial court must be presumed to have complied with the procedure prescribed by law for the hearing and trial of cases; and that such a presumption can only be overcome by an affirmative showing to&nbsp; the contrary.&nbsp; (U. S. vs. Labial and Abuso, 27 Phil., 82; People vs. Del&nbsp; Rosario, G. R. No. 44239, promulgated January 8, 1936&nbsp; [62 Phil., 975].)&nbsp; In the instant case, there is no affirmative showing that the appellant&nbsp; was not advised of his right&nbsp; to have counsel. We, therefore, find no merit in the first error assigned by counsel for the appellant. <br><br>2. Although the point is&nbsp; not discussed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; brief of counsel for the appellant, the second assignment&nbsp; of error is sufficiently broad to raise the question of whether the additional penalty of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> for habitual delinquency was properly imposed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; only allegation in the information concerning this matter is the following:<blockquote>"That the accused&nbsp; Bruno&nbsp; Ocbina y De los Santos (<i>alias</i> Bruno Ocvina) is an habitual delinquent, he having already been convicted three (3)&nbsp; times&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crime of theft, by virtue of final judgments of a competent court, the date of his last conviction being December 13, 1935."</blockquote>In the recent case of People vs. Venus (G. R. No. 45141, p. 435, ante),&nbsp; this court&nbsp; held&nbsp; that an&nbsp; allegation of&nbsp; this nature in an&nbsp; information was too general and therefore insufficient to sustain a conviction&nbsp; for habitual delinquency upon a plea of guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that the additional penalty of six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i> imposed on the appellant must be eliminated from the judgment below.<br><br>Modified as above indicated the judgment is affirmed with costs <i>de oficio</i>&nbsp; in this instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
