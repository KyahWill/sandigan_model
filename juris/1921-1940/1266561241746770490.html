				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Plaintiff
lost his case in the lower court which interpreted his contract with
defendant, and which constitutes the basis of his action, contrary to
his contentions. In order to determine finally the real meaning of said
contract or the interpretation that should be given to its terms, he
appealed to this court from the judgment against him.
  <p> The
facts are as follows: Appellant entered the service of appellee as
mechanic, first, to assist the mechanic of the appellee, Enrique
Litonjua, in the latter's work as such; and, thereafter, to take the
place to be left by Litonjua who resigned in March, 1933. Under their
original verbal contract, appellee was to pay appellant a monthly
salary of P118 and give him, in addition, a monthly bonus of P30 which
was to be allowed to accumulate and thereafter delivered to him at the
end of the months of June and December of each year in lump sums so
long as he continued in the service of appellee. On March 10, 1933,
appellee confirmed the contract in writing in the following terms:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="right">"<em>March 10, 1933</em></p>

    <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
    <p>"This
confirms the conversation you had with the writer and our Mr. Salet of
today whereby your remuneration will be increased to P118 a month
effective March 1st with a monthly accumulated bonus of P30 per month,
payable June 30th and December 31st, provided you are in the employ of
the Company within that period. In addition to the above you will be
known as 'Chief Service Radio Mechanic' and in charge of all other
servicemen for radios, combination machines, phonographs and photophone
equipment. In other words, you will hold the identical position
formerly held by Mr. Enrique Litonjua who resigned this week.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Appellant
was dismissed from the service of appellee on November 20, 1933 because
it was discovered that he had been violating the regulations of the
company to its prejudice. It was, therefore, clear that before December
31, 1933, he was no longer in the employ of appellee.</p>
  <p>
Appellant contends that he is entitled to the payment of the bonuses
corresponding to the months of July, August, September, October, and to
the first twenty days of November, 1933 under the very terms of the
aforesaid contract. The pertinent portion of the contract in question
is of the following tenor:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"* * * your
remuneration will be increased to P118 a month effective March 1st with
a monthly accumulated bonus of P30 per month, payable June 30th and
December 31st, provided you are in the employ of the Company within
that period."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> It is a well-settled rule
that when the terms of a contract are clear and do not leave room for
doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties, it is not
necessary to interpret the same, and the literal meaning of its clauses
should be followed. The contract in question is sufficiently clear. It
does not entitle appellant to the payment of any bonus inasmuch as at
the time when, according to the agreement, he should be paid what would
have corresponded to him had he continued to hold his position until
then, December 31, 1933, he was no longer in the employ of the
appellee. Appellant's contention, therefore, is devoid of merit. A
bonus is a gift of the principal to his agent or employee in order that
the latter may be encouraged to serve him faithfully and diligently.</p>
  <p>
Appellant not having conducted himself in this manner, it is obvious
that he is not entitled to the whole or even a part of his claim.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <em>Avance√±a, C. J., Villa-Real, Imperial</em>, and <em>Laurel, JJ</em>., concur. </p>
