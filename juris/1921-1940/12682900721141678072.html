<p>all of the total value of one hundred ninety-three pesos (P193), to
the damage and prejudice of the above-named owners, in the total sum of
one hundred ninety-three pesos (P193), Philippine currency,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "That, at the time of the commission of said
offense, the said accused was a habitual delinquent, he having been
previously convicted twice (2) of the crime of theft by virtue of final
judgments rendered by competent courts, his last date of conviction
being on September 2, 1930, and date of release therefor, on May 4,
1933."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The lower court found the defendant guilty, and in accordance with
article 299 of the Revised Penal Code sentenced him to two years,
eleven months, and eleven days of <em>prision correccional,</em> to
return to Pacita Yap the pair of earrings and to Ramon Ho and Catalino
Ho the two coats, or the stolen goods not recovered, and to suffer an
additional penalty for being a habitual delinquent, in accordance with
rule 5 of article 62 of the Revised Penal Code, of seven years, four
months, and one day of <em>prision mayor,</em> and to pay the costs.</p>
<p> The appellant now alleges that the lower court erred:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "1. In finding the appellant responsible for the
alleged loss of a 'par de pendientes' said to belong to Pacita Yap, and
for the alleged loss of two coats said to belong to Ramon Ho and
Catalino Ho, and for requiring the appellant to return the properties
above mentioned to their alleged owners.</p>
  <p> "2. In failing to
find and consider, with respect to the charge of habitual delinquency
in this case, the existence of one mitigating circumstance, that of
voluntary confession of former conviction; and in imposing upon the
appellant an additional penalty of seven (7) years, four months, and
one (1) day of <em>prision mayor, </em>instead of only six (6) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor, </em>for appellant's being a habitual delinquent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> All the stolen articles were found in the possession of the
appellant and recovered, except the pair of earrings and two coats
mentioned in the first assignment of error. The evidence shows that
when the accused jumped out of the window Ramon Ho cried "thief,
thief!"; that Pascual Gatdula pursued and captured the defendant and
brought him back to the house of the complaining witnesses within five
or six minutes after the robbery was perpetrated. The articles now in
question were not found on the person of the defendant, nor does it
appear that the defendant had dropped them or thrown them away, and
under these circumstances we are constrained to think that the evidence
is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that said articles
were taken by the defendant, and the decision of the lower court is
accordingly modified with respect thereto.</p>
<p> In the second assignment of error it is contended that as to the
habitual delinquency the defendant was entitled to one mitigating
circumstance because he voluntarily confessed his former convictions.
There is clearly no merit in this contention. The seventh mitigating
circumstance mentioned in article 13 of the Revised Penal Code is that
the offender had voluntarily surrendered himself to a person in
authority or his agents, or that he had voluntarily confessed his guilt
before the court prior to the presentation of the evidence for the
prosecution.</p>
<p> In the case at bar the defendant did not plead guilty or confess
his guilt prior to the presentation of the evidence for the
prosecution, but after the fiscal had presented his evidence as to the
crime in question, the defendant admitted that he had been twice
convicted as alleged in the information. Furthermore, we have held in
the case of People <em>vs.</em> Tanyaquin (57 Phil, 426), that in
imposing the penalty for habitual delinquency the trial judge is not
bound by the usual rules respecting the mitigating and aggravating
circumstances prescribed by the Code as to the principal penalty.</p>
<p> The defendant is a recidivist because of his prior convictions, and
this fact must be taken into consideration in fixing the principal
penalty as well as for the purpose of proving habitual delinquency.
(People <em>vs.</em> Melendrez, 59 Phil., 154.)</p>
<p> The defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, because he is a habitual delinquent.</p>
<p> The appellant is therefore sentenced to suffer a principal penalty of three years, six months, and eleven days of <em>prision correccional,</em> and an additional penalty of seven years, four months, and one day of <em>prision mayor</em>.</p>
<p> With the modifications herein above stated, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.</p>
<p> <em>Street, Abad Santos, Hull,</em> and <em>Diaz, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
