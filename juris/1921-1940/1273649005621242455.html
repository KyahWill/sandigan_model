				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Marshall-Wells Company, an Oregon corporation, sued Henry W. Elser &amp; Co., 
Inc., a domestic corporation, in the Court of First Instance of Manila, for the 
unpaid balance on a bill of goods amounting to P2,660.74, sold by plaintiff to 
defendant and for which plaintiff holds accepted drafts. Defendant demurred to 
the complaint on the statutory ground that the plaintiff has not legal capacity 
to sue. In the demurrer, counsel stated that "The said complaint does not show 
that the plaintiff has complied with the laws of the Philippine Islands in that 
which is required of foreign corporations desiring to do business in the 
Philippine Islands, neither does it show that it was authorized to do business 
in the Philippine Islands." The demurrer was sustained by the trial judge. 
Inasmuch as the plaintiff could not allege compliance with the statute, the 
order was allowed to become final and an appeal was perfected.</p>
<p>To begin with the law as a fit setting for the issue. The Corporation Law 
(Act No. 1459) contains six sections relating particularly to foreign 
corporations. Section 68, as amended by Act No. 2900, provides that no foreign 
corporation "shall be permitted to transact business in the Philippine Islands 
until after it shall have obtained a license for that purpose from the Chief of 
the Mercantile Register of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry," upon order 
either of the Secretary of Finance or the Secretary of Commerce and 
Communications. No order for a license shall be issued except upon a statement 
under oath of the managing agent of the corporation, showing to the satisfaction 
of the proper Secretary that the corporation is solvent and in sound financial 
condition, and setting forth the resources and liabilities of the corporation. 
Said statement shall contain the following: (1) The name of the corporation; (2) 
the purpose for which it was organized; (3) the location of its principal or 
home office; (4) the capital stock of the corporation and the amount thereof 
actually subscribed and paid into the treasury; (5) the net assets of the 
corporation over and above all debts, liabilities, obli- gations, and claims 
outstanding against it; and (6) the name of an agent residing in the Philippine 
Islands authorized by the corporation to accept service of summons and process 
in all legal proceedings against the corporation and of all notices affecting 
the corporation. Further evidence of the solvency and fair dealing of the 
corporation may be required. Upon filing in the Mercantile Register of the 
Bureau of Commerce and Industry the said statement, a certified copy of its 
charter, and the order of the Secretary for the issuance of a license, the Chief 
of the Mercantile Register "shall issue to the foreign corporation as directed 
in the order a license to do business in the Philippine Islands," and for the 
issuance of the license shall collect a fee fixed in accordance with the 
schedule established in section 8 of the Law.</p>
<p>Passing section 69 of the Corporation Law for the moment, section 70, as 
amended, covers the cases of foreign corporations "transacting business in the 
Islands at the time of the passage" of the Act. Section 71 authorizes the 
Secretary of Finance or the Secretary of Commerce and Communications, as the 
case may be, by and with the approval of the Governor-General, "to revoke the 
license to transact business in the Philippine Islands" of any foreign 
corporation. Section 72 concerns summons and legal process. Section 73 makes a 
foreign corporation bound by all the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to 
domestic corporations of the same class, with certain exceptions.</p>
<p>Returning now to section 69 of the Corporation Law, its literal terminology 
is as follows:</p>
<p>"No foreign corporation or corporation formed, organized, or existing under 
any laws other than those of the Philippine Islands shall be permitted to 
transact business in the Philippine Islands or maintain by itself or assignee 
any suit for the recovery of any debt, claim, or demand whatever, unless it 
shall have the license prescribed in the section immediately preceding. Any 
officer, director, or agent of the corporation or any person transacting 
business for any foreign corporation not having the license prescribed shall be 
punished by imprisonment for not less than six months nor more than two years or 
by a fine of not less than two hundred pesos nor more than one thousand pesos, 
or by both such imprisonment and fine, in the discretion of the court."</p>
<p>Is the obtaining of the license prescribed in section 68, as amended, of the 
Corporation Law a condition precedent to the maintaining of any kind of action 
in the courts of the Philippine Islands by a foreign corporation? The issue is 
framed to correspond with defendant's theory of the case on appeal, although 
possibly somewhat at variance with its stand in the lower court.</p>
<p>So far as we are informed, this is a question of first impression. The case 
of Dampfschieffs Rhederei Union <em>vs.</em> Compania Trasatlantica ([1907], 8 
Phil., 766), relating to the provisions of the Code of Commerce, only held that 
a foreign corporation which has not established itself in the Philippines, nor 
engaged in business in the Philippines, could, without filing its articles of 
incorporation in the mercantile registry, maintain an action against another for 
damages. The case of Spreckels <em>vs.</em> Ward ([1909], 12 Phil., 414), while 
making reference to a point similar to the one before us, was merely authority 
for the holding, that the provisions of section 69 of the Corporation Law 
denying to unregistered foreign corporations the right to maintain suits for the 
recovery of any debt, claim, or demand, do not impose on all plaintiff-litigants 
the burden of establishing by affirmative proof that they are not unregistered 
foreign corporations; that fact will not be presumed without some evidence 
tending to establish its existence. But the question is not alone new, but of 
prime importance, to the consideration of which we have given mature 
thought.</p>
<p>Corporations have no legal status beyond the bounds of the sovereignty by 
which they are created. A state may restrict the right of a foreign corporation 
to engage in business within its limits, and to sue in its courts. But by virtue 
of state comity, a corporation created by the laws of one state is usually 
allowed to transact business in other states and to sue in the courts of the 
forum. (Paul <em>vs.</em> Virginia [1869], 8 Wall., 168; Sioux Remedy Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Cope and Cope [1914], 235 U. S., 197; Cyclone Mining Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Baker Light &amp; Power Co. [1908], 165 Fed., 996.)</p>
<p>But here we have present for resolution no question of constitutional law. 
Article 4 of the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
Constitution are not invoked. The issue i3 not complicated with matters 
affecting interstate commerce under the American Constitution. Nor are we 
concerned with a question of private international law. It all simmers down to 
an issue of statutory construction.</p>
<p>Defendant isolates a portion of one sentence of section 69 of the Corporation 
Law and asks the court to give it a literal meaning. Counsel would have the law 
read thus: "No foreign corporation shall be permitted to maintain by itself or 
assignee any suit for the recovery of any debt, claim, or demand whatever, 
unless it shall have the license prescribed in section 68 of the law." 
Plaintiff, on the contrary, desires for the court to consider the particular 
point under discussion with reference to all the law, and thereafter to give the 
law a common sense interpretation.</p>
<p>The object of the statute was to subject the foreign corporation doing 
business in the Philippines to the jurisdiction of its courts. The object of the 
statute was not to prevent the foreign corporation from performing single acts, 
but to prevent it from, acquiring a domicile for the purpose of business without 
taking the steps necessary to render it amenable to suit in the local courts. 
The implication of the law is that it was never the purpose of ths Legislature 
to exclude a foreign corporation which happens to obtain an isolated order for 
business from the Philippines, from securing redress in the Philippine courts, 
and thus, in effect, to permit persons to avoid their contracts made with such 
foreign corporations. The effect of the statute preventing foreign corporations 
from doing business and from bringing actions in the local courts, except on 
compliance with elaborate requirements, must not be unduly extended or 
improperly applied. It should not be construed to extend beyond the plain 
meaning of its terms, considered in connection with its object, and in 
connection with the spirit of the entire law. (State <em>vs.</em> American Book 
Co. [1904], 69 Kan., 1; American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Co. <em>vs.</em> 
Superior Court of City &amp; County of San Francisco and Hebbard [1908], 153 
Cal., 533; 5 Thompson on Corporations, 2d ed., chap. 184.)</p>
<p>Confronted with the option of giving to the Corporation Law a harsh 
interpretation, which would disastrously embarrass trade, or of giving to the 
law a reasonable interpretation, which would markedly help in the development of 
trade; confronted with the option of barring from the courts foreign litigants 
with good causes of action or of assuming jurisdiction of their cases; 
confronted with the option of construing the law to mean that any corporation in 
the United States, which might want to sell to a person in the Philippines must 
send some representative to the Islands before the sale, and go through the 
complicated formulae provided by the Corporation Law with regard to the 
obtaining of the license, before the sale was made, in order to avoid being 
swindled by Philippine citizens, or of construing the law to mean that no 
foreign corporation doing business in the Philippines can maintain any suit 
until it shall possess the necessary license,— confronted with these options, 
can anyone doubt what our decision will be? The law simply means that no foreign 
corporation shall be permitted "to transact business in the Philippine Islands," 
as this phrase is known in corporation law, unless it shall have the license 
required by law, and, until it complies with the law, shall not be permitted to 
maintain any suit in the local courts. A contrary holding would bring the law to 
the verge of unconstitutionality, a result which should be and can be easily 
avoided. (Sioux Remedy Co. <em>vs.</em> Cope and Cope, <em>supra</em>; Perkins, 
Philippine Business Law, p. 264.)</p>
<p>The noncompliance of a foreign corporation with the statute may be pleaded as 
an affirmative defense. Thereafter, it must appear from the evidence, first, 
that the plaintiff is a foreign corporation, second, that it is doing business 
in the Philippines, and third, that it has not obtained the proper license as 
provided by the statute. (Standard Stock Food Co. <em>vs.</em> Jasper [1907], 76 
Kan., 926; Spreckels <em>vs.</em> Ward, supra.)</p>
<p>The order appealed from shall be set aside and the record shall be returned 
to the court of origin for further proceedings. Without special finding as to 
costs in this instance, it is so ordered.</p>
