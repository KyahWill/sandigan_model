				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The judgment appealed from convicts the appellant of the crime of homicide with&nbsp; the extenuating circumstance of passion and obfuscation,&nbsp; and sentences&nbsp; him&nbsp; to twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion&nbsp; temporal</i>, the accessories of the law, to indemnify&nbsp; the heirs of the deceased in the sum of&nbsp; P1,000, and the costs.<br><br>Between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon&nbsp; of August 14, 1930, a basketball game was&nbsp; in progress in the army gymnasium on General Luna Street of&nbsp; this City of Manila. Among those present at the game were: The appellant, Potenciano Montalbo; the deceased, Jose Paras; and a companion&nbsp; of the latter, Conrado Lorenzo,—all&nbsp; students.&nbsp; The deceased stood with one&nbsp; arm leaning against one of the goal posts with Conrado Lorenzo&nbsp; to his right.&nbsp; The appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; behind him.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the deceased's&nbsp; right arm, which was against the post obstructed the appellant's view, so that he could not see the game well, he called the former's attention to it, but the deceased said he had to lean his arm against the post in order to keep his&nbsp; balance.&nbsp; After a few moments, the appellant caught the deceased's&nbsp; right sleeve and jerked it strongly&nbsp; downwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deceased turned&nbsp; towards the appellant who stepped back two paces, saying, "What do you&nbsp; want?"<br><br>According to the Government evidence,&nbsp; when Conrado Lorenzo saw this, he stepped in pushing&nbsp; the deceased away with his right hand and holding the appellant off with his left.&nbsp; In spite&nbsp; of this, the&nbsp; appellant approached&nbsp; the deceased and&nbsp; hit him in the chest; and&nbsp; it was then that Lorenzo saw the appellant had a penknife in his hand, and that the deceased was&nbsp; wounded and he gradually fell until a bystander held him up.<br><br>According to the evidence of the defense, when the deceased turned towards the appellant, and the latter took two steps backward, he followed him up and struck him with his fists.&nbsp; One of the witnesses corroborated this, saying that fist blows&nbsp; were&nbsp; indeed exchanged&nbsp; by&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the trial court found&nbsp; that the deceased had attacked the defendant with his&nbsp; fists.&nbsp; This&nbsp; finding must have been based upon the evidence of the defense, for that of the prosecution makes no&nbsp; mention of the circumstance.&nbsp; The trial court, however, further held that there&nbsp; was not sufficient proof that the&nbsp; attack took place&nbsp; before&nbsp; the appellant had used his knife.&nbsp; We do not&nbsp; find this borne out by the evidence for the defense, which the court took into consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as for the evidence of the prosecution, it does not admit of this conclusion,&nbsp; for it shows that upon the deceased being wounded in the chest he began to sink little by little, and being in such&nbsp; a state,&nbsp; he could not have attacked the appellant.<br><br>Notwithstanding all this, we hold that the defendant did not act&nbsp; in self-defense, the elements of which were not all present in this case.&nbsp; Though the deceased struck him with his fists, the appellant was not justified in mortally wounding his assailant with the penknife.&nbsp; This was not a reasonably necessary means&nbsp; of&nbsp; repelling the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.S. vs. De Castro, 2 Phil, 67; Decision&nbsp; of the Supreme Court of Spain of November 28, 1885;&nbsp; 35 <i>Jurisprudencia Criminal</i>, 858-861.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; the appellant provoked the attack by&nbsp; jerking&nbsp; down the deceased's coat-sleeve, taking two steps backward,&nbsp; and&nbsp; challenging&nbsp; him&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; words, "What do you want?"<br><br>The&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; justly&nbsp; took account&nbsp; of the&nbsp; mitigating circumstance of passion and obfuscation.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find the judgment appealed from to be borne out by the evidence and in accordance&nbsp; with the law, and&nbsp; it is hereby affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez, Villa-Real</i>, and <i>Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
