				G.R. No. 22125, December 22, 1924</h4>
				<H3>AFIFE ABDO CHEYBAN GORAYEB, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. NADJIB TANNUS HASHIM, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an action by a wife against her husband for a separate maintenance 
allowance. The complaint alleges, in substance, that the plaintiff is legally 
married to the defendant; that the defendant refuses to receive her in his house 
and to support her; and that she has no property of her own and no means of 
support. She therefore prays that the defendant be ordered to pay her the sum of 
P1,000 a month for her maintenance.</p>
<p>The defendant in his amended answer denies generally the allegations of the 
complaint and sets up as special defenses that the plaintiff, without his 
consent, abandoned him in April, 1914, and that she has since committed adultery 
with her cousin.</p>
<p>The trial court found that the parties have been legally married; that the 
marriage has not been dissolved; and that the defendant is legally bound to 
support the plaintiff; and therefore ordered the defendant to pay her a 
permanent maintenance allowance of P500 a month. From this judgment the 
defendant appeals to this court.</p>
<p>The special defenses set up in the defendant's answer have not been 
sufficiently established and the evidence leaves no doubt as to the facts that 
the parties are legally married and that the plaintiff is entitled to a 
maintenance allowance. With reference to the amount of the maintenance allowance 
awarded by the court below, it may be observed that inasmuch as in respect to 
modifications, a judgment rendered in a suit for separate maintenance is not 
regarded as final and may be modified at any time for sufficient reasons upon 
application to the court having original jurisdiction, the appellate courts 
will, as a rule, not interfere with the findings and conclusions of the lower 
courts in regard to such allowances. Upon the evidence before us, we cannot say 
that in this case the allowance is so excessive as to call for our 
interference.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, with the costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Villamor, Johns</em>, and <em>Romualdez, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
