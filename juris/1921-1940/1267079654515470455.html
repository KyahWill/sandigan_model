				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of Cavite by the filing&nbsp; of a complaint&nbsp; by the&nbsp; appellants against the&nbsp; appellee for the&nbsp; recovery of a sum of money. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the appellee borrowed from the appellant Leocadia Salomon the sum of P800 and one hundred cavans of palay as&nbsp; evidenced by a certain document which&nbsp; was annexed to the&nbsp; complaint, marked as Exhibit&nbsp; A, and made a part thereof. It was further alleged that&nbsp; although said document Exhibit A was entitled <i>Escritura de Hipoteca</i>, it constituted&nbsp; a mere contract&nbsp; of loan as the same was not recorded on account of certain&nbsp; defects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellee demurred to&nbsp; the complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction&nbsp; over the subject&nbsp; of the action.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court below sustained the demurrer&nbsp; and dismissed the complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; From the order thus entered this&nbsp; appeal was taken.<br><br>In sustaining the demurrer, the court held that a contract of mortgage, even if unrecorded, is valid and binding as between the parties&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; and that registration is&nbsp; only necessary for the validity of the mortgage as against third parties.&nbsp; The court further held that as the property involved in the contract Exhibit A is located in the Province of Zambales, the Court of First Instance of Cavite had no jurisdiction in the premises.<br><br>In disposing of this appeal, it is not necessary for us to pass on&nbsp; the question of whether the document Exhibit A has&nbsp; created a valid mortgage between the parties thereto. Even granting, without deciding, that it did&nbsp; create such a valid mortgage, the mortgagee, that is the appellant Leocadia Salomon, was not precluded from maintaining a personal action for the&nbsp; recovery of the debt covered by the mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hijos de I. de la&nbsp; Rama vs. Sajo, 45 Phil., 703.)<br><br>The&nbsp; order appealed from is reversed, and&nbsp; the case&nbsp; will be remanded to the court below for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C.&nbsp; J., Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
