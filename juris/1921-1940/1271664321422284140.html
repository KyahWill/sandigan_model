				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to procure a reversal or modification of a 
judgment of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, 
finding the appellant, Fortunato Cañete, guilty of the offense of murder and 
sentencing him to undergo the penalty of <i>cadena perpetua</i>, with the 
accessories prescribed in article 54 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs 
of the person slain in the amount of P500, and to pay the costs.
<p>It appears in evidence that on January 15, 1922, the deceased, Narciso de la 
Cruz, was playing a game called <i>hantak</i>, with certain individuals on the 
<i>hacienda</i> of Cubay, in the municipality of San Carlos, in the Province of 
Occidental Negros. Among those present at the time was the accused, Fortunato 
Cañete, who offered to wager 3 centavos against a like amount of Narciso de la 
Cruz, but the latter refused the wager, saying that he and the accused were 
friends. Fortunato took this as an affront and assaulted Narciso with a knife, 
inflicting upon him a deep and lengthy gash on the thigh. In order to escape 
from this attack Narciso fled, but he was pursued by the accused. After running 
a short distance, Narciso fell face downwards on the ground, and before he could 
arise to continue his flight Fortunato seized him by the neck with one hand and 
with the other gave him a fatal thrust in the back with the knife. After 
inflicting this wound, the accused desisted from the attack while Narciso arose 
and again started to run. However, after going a distance of about 80 meters, he 
fell to the earth and died almost immediately. These facts are indubitably 
proved by the testimony of various persons who were present at the time the deed 
was committed, and the force of their testimony is not arrested by the weak and 
incredible story of the accused in which he pretends that the deceased, with 
others, was the aggressor. The trial judge therefore was not in error in finding 
the accused to be the responsible and guilty party.</p>
<p>The record, however, presents one question of law which merits attentive 
reflection. This is the question whether, upon the facts above stated, the 
commission of the offense was characterized by <i>alevosia</i> in the sense 
necessary to constitute murder, or whether the crime was only that of simple 
homicide.</p>
<p>Upon this point we are constrained to adopt the conclusion reached by the 
Attorney-General and to hold that the qualifying circumstance of <i>alevosia</i> 
was not present. The accused, therefore, should have been found guilty of simple 
homicide; and, instead of being sentenced to <i>cadena perpetua</i>, he should 
have been required to undergo imprisonment for fourteen years, eight months and 
one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>.</p>
<p>In this connection it should be noted that the original assault was begun by 
a direct frontal attack and there was momentary struggle between the accused and 
the deceased before the first knife wound was inflicted on the thigh of the 
deceased; and it was at this point that the deceased turned to flee. Moreover, 
pursuit by the accused followed immediately, after the deceased started to run, 
and the assault was practically continuous from the beginning to the end. The 
fall of the deceased in the course of his flight must be considered to have been 
in the nature of a mere accident which did not materially change the conditions 
of the struggle. In every fight it is to be presumed that each contending party 
will take advantage of any purely accidental development that may give him an 
advantage over his opponent in the course of the contest. It follows that 
<i>alevosia</i> cannot be predicated of this homicide from the mere fact that 
the accused overtook and slew the deceased while the latter was endeavoring to 
rise from the ground.</p>
<p>In its main features the case now before us is identical with one noted by 
Viada to the following effect: Between the accused and the person slain a fight 
had taken place, provoked by the former, in which the contestants exchanged some 
ugly words and the accused received a shove from the deceased which caused him 
to strike against a wall. As the two attempted to engage again, some friends 
seized the accused, who nevertheless escaped from the persons who were holding 
him and ran after the deceased, who was then fleeing. In the course of his 
flight the deceased tripped and fell to the ground; whereupon the accused at 
once precipitated himself on his fallen antagonist and, holding him with one 
hand, struck him with the other with a jackknife, producing a wound which caused 
death. In the court of the Audiencia of Almeria the accused was declared to be 
guilty of murder, but this judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court. (Viada, 2 
Supp., 298, reporting decision of Dec. 26, 1891.) In the course of this decision 
the court observed that although the trouble had begun in a barber shop and the 
homicide occurred on the outside, nevertheless the contest should be viewed as a 
single series of acts without any appreciable break in the continuity of action. 
The homicide was accordingly declared not to be qualified by 
<i>alevosia</i>.</p>
<p>As suggested in this and a similar decision of February 10, 1892, before 
<i>alevosia</i> can be found to be present in a homicide it must clearly appear 
that the method of assault adopted by the aggressor was deliberately chosen with 
a special view to the accomplishment of the act without risk to the assailant 
from any defense that the party assailed may make. (Viada, 2 Supp., 3d ed., p. 
76, reporting decision of Feb. 10, 1892.) This cannot be said of such a 
situation as that now before us, where the slayer acted instantaneously upon the 
advantage which resulted from the accidental fall of the person slain.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly true that <i>alevosia</i> may be exhibited in the final 
consummation of a homicide where said factor has not been present in the 
inception of the difficulty. For instance, it is the uniform doctrine of this 
court that if a person is first seized and bound, with a view to rendering him 
incapable of defense, and he is then slain either by the person who reduced him 
to this helpless state or by another, the crime is murder (U. S. <i>vs</i>. 
Elicanal, 35 Phil., 209, 218, and cases there cited). In a case of that kind it 
is obvious that the binding of the victim of the aggression introduces a 
material change in the conditions of the homicide; and in slaying a person so 
circumstanced, the author of the crime obviously avails himself of a form or 
means directly tending to insure the execution of the deed without risk to 
himself from any defense on the part of the person slain.</p>
<p>In United States <i>vs</i>. Baluyot (40 Phil., 385), the majority of the 
members of this court held that <i>alevosia</i> was present in a homicide 
committed under the following circumstances: The accused, according to the 
majority, suddenly and without provocation attacked the deceased by firing a 
pistol upon him, when the deceased was unarmed. Upon this the deceased attempted 
to get away and took refuge in a closet, closing the door after him and calling 
aloud for help. The accused then tried to force open the door but did not 
succeed, owing to the resistance of the deceased from within. However, judging 
the position of the head of the deceased from the cries emitted, the accused 
fired his pistol in the direction thus indicated. The bullet passed through the 
panel of the door and, entering the head of the deceased, produced death.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar case is noted by Viada from the decisions of the supreme 
court of Spain as follows: It appeared that an altercation had taken place 
between the accused and certain persons in a house from which the accused was 
thereupon ejected and the door shut after him. The accused from without then 
fired his revolver through a crack in the door, causing the death of one of the 
persons within. It was held that the offense was qualified by <i>alevosia</i> 
and that the act was constitutive of murder, the court observing that the 
accused availed himself of the door in order that he might accomplish the deed 
through it without risk to himself and against which no means of defense 
whatever were available. (1 Viada, 4th ed., p. 260.)</p>
<p>The present case differs from the cases above cited and their congeners in 
the circumstance that here the assault, evidently of a homicidal character from 
the beginning, but not treacherous in its inception, was continuous; and no 
factor intervened to alter the fundamental conditions of the crime. The 
circumstance that the deceased had fallen to the ground gave to the accused, it 
is true, the opportunity, of which he promptly availed himself, to come up with 
the deceased and to dispatch him at once. But the act of so doing cannot be 
interpreted as evincing a design to employ a method indicative of 
<i>alevosia</i>. The contrary is true in the case where the victim is bound 
before being slain or is driven to take refuge behind the closed door of a 
closet.</p>
<p>The doctrine applicable to the present case appears to have been correctly 
stated in United States <i>vs</i>. Balagtas and Jaime (19 Phil., 164), where the 
deceased was first knocked down and rendered senseless, after which—and while 
still unconscious and powerless to make resistance—he was dragged to a pond, 
into which he was thrown and left exposed, face downwards. The court held that 
the various acts in the accomplishment of the homicide followed each other in 
such rapid succession that they all constituted a single transaction, and that 
the crime was not qualified by <i>alevosia</i>. Said the court: "One continuous 
attack, such as the one which resulted in the death of the deceased Flores, 
cannot be broken up into two or more parts and made to constitute separate, 
distinct, and independent attacks so that treachery may be injected therein and 
considered as a qualifying or aggravating circumstance."</p>
<p>From what has been said it results that the judgment appealed from must be 
modified; and instead of being adjudged guilty of the crime of murder with the 
penalties incident thereto, the appellant must be sentenced for the crime of 
simple homicide, with the corresponding accessories, and without aggravating or 
mitigating circumstance. That is to say, he will be required to undergo 
imprisonment for fourteen years, eight months and one day, <i>reclusion 
temporal</i>, with the accessories prescribed in article 59 of the Penal Code. 
As thus modified, the judgment will be affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor,</i> and <i>Romualdez,
