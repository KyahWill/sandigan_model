				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On  September  12,  1923,  Segundo  Diez applied to the Court of First  Instance of  Occidental  Negros for letters of administration of the estate of the  deceased  Florencia Diez  alleging that he is a brother of  the said  Florencia Diez, who died  on August 21, 1921 in the municipality of Cadiz, Province of Occidental Negros, in  which municipality she resided at  the  time of  her death; that the deceased at the  time of her death was a widow and left no will;  that the deceased left realty consisting  in a share of one-third of lots Nos.  465  and 490 of Cadiz cadastral case No.  25,  more specifically  described  in  the  certificates of the office of the  register of deeds of that province; that the deceased left seven children, as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="48%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td valign="top" width="25%"><div align="left">Years old </div></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Tomas Serra y Diez ................................................... 21</div>    </td> <td width="27%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Mercedes Serra y Diez ................................................18</div>      </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Trinidad Serra y Diez ...................................................16</div>      </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Jose Serra y Diez.........................................................14</div>      </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Marcelino Serra y Diez ...............................................17</div>      </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Adriano Serra y Diez .................................................. 10</div>      </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="justify">Felix Serra y Diez ..........................................................7</div> </td> <td> <br></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>That the deceased Florencia  Diez's  share  in the above-mentioned lots  is assessed at P22,970. On  September 15,  1923, the court  granted the application, ordering the appointment of Segundo Diez as administrator,  upon his filing a bond in the sum of P5,000. The said  bond was  filed, and  on May 7,  1924 Segundo Diez was appointed administrator.  On October 7,  1924, he presented an inventory of  the property  under his administration.<br><br>From  then on the administration  functioned  until July 31,  1926,  when  Tomas Serra for  himself and as  guardian of his six minor brothers  and sisters, the children of the deceased Florencia Diez, put in a special appearance, contesting that court's authority  to take cognizance of this intestate estate, on the ground that the deceased Florencia Diez  resided in the municipality of  San Joaquin, Province of Iloilo, at the time of her death, as evidenced by the death certificate,  Exhibit A.<br><br>The North Negros Sugar Co., Inc., filed an intervention in this case, as creditor of the intestate  estate for  a mortgage  loan  granted to the administrator, with the  authorization  of  the court,  maintaining the  validity of these proceedings, and  asking for  the dismissal of the  special appearance of Tomas Serra et al.<br><br>The court denied the petition of the special appearance. Tomas Serra et al. appealed from this  decision and their counsel In  this instance  assigns the  following  errors  as committed by  the court below: (<i>a</i>)  In finding itself competent and  with jurisdiction to take cognizance of  and act in this proceeding for the settlement of the intestate estate of the deceased Florencia Diez; (<i>b</i>)  in not holding that the proceedings had herein are absolutely void <i>ab initio</i>  because no  evidence has been heard or introduced anent the facts alleged  in  the application, and  particularly anent those concerning  its own jurisdiction to take  cognizance  of this case; (<i>c</i>)  in finding that the  question set up by the herein petitioners  as to  the court's  jurisdiction is  untimely and lacks the legal requisites for  that purpose;  (<i>d</i>)  in  holding that the herein appellants are now estopped from questioning the regularity and validity of its proceedings. in this intestacy;  (<i>e</i>)  in  permitting  the North Negros Sugar Co., Inc., to intervene in the matter of  the questioning of the court's jurisdiction.<br><br>The legal questions raised by this appeal relate to  the jurisdiction  of the  court that granted  the  letters  of  administration of the  estate of the deceased Florencia Diez, and to the  challenge of such jurisdiction.  Section  600 of the Code of Civil Procedure  provides:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 600. Where resident's estate settled.—If an inhabitant  of the Philippine  Islands  dies,  whether  a  citizen or alien, his will shall be proved, or letters of administration granted, and his estate settled, in the Court of First Instance in  the  province in  which he resided at the time of his death."</blockquote><br>According to the allegations of the application for letters of administration, the  deceased Florencia  Diez lived  at Cadiz, Occidental Negros at the time of her  death; it is therefore  clear that the court <i>a quo</i> had  jurisdiction  to grant the letters of administration applied  for.<br><br>In order to render valid a grant of letters of administration the view is generally accepted that certain jurisdictional facts must exist.  These facts are that the  person on whose estate the letters are being granted is in fact dead, and that at the time of death  he was  a resident  of the county wherein letters are being granted, or if not a resident that he left assets in such county.  It has  been said that the fact of  the death of the intestate and of his residence within the county are foundation facts  upon which all the subsequent proceedings in the administration of the estate rest, and that if the intestate was not an inhabitant of the state  at the time of his death, and left no assets in the state,  and none came into it afterwards, no jurisdiction is conferred on the court to grant letters of  administration in any  county.  A probate court has  jurisdiction to grant administration of the estate of  a  person  who at the time  of  his decease was an inhabitant or resident in the county,  without proof  that  he left  an estate to be administered within the county.   (11 R. C.  L., par.  81.)<br><br>Section 603 of  the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the jurisdiction assumed by  a Court of First Instance for the settlement of an estate,  so  far as  it depends  on the place of residence of a person, or of the location  of his estate, shall not be contested in a suit or proceeding,  except in an appeal from that court, in the original  case, or when the lack of jurisdiction appears in the record.  In the present case the lack of jurisdiction did not  appear  in the record at the time when the court <i>a quo</i> that appointed the  administrator  found itself competent, and no  appeal was taken from the  order decreeing said appointment.<br><br>This administration has functioned for two years,  and the  appellants after  that period  have appeared in  this case, too late to avail themselves of the benefits offered by section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and  it would seem that the  only remedy left to them is to ask for the reopening of the proceedings in the  lower court that assumed jurisdiction.<br><br>Without further need to discuss the other points raised by the appellants,  the decision appealed  from should be, as it is hereby, affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.   So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña,  C. J., Street, Malcolm,  Ostrand, Johns, </span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ</span>., concur.</div>
