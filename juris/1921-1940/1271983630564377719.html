				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appears from the record that until June 13, 1923, Alejandro 
and Roberto Sañgil and one Jose Flores were the owners of a rice mill, the 
latter having invested P4,500 in the mill and each of the others having 
contributed P10,500. On the date mentioned, Alejandro Sañgil executed a deed of 
donation, absolute and irrevocable, of his share in the rice mill in favor of 
the plaintiff. Subsequent thereto, but on the same day, Alejandro and the 
plaintiff were married. The marriage did not prove a success, and in January, 
1925, the spouses separated. Roberto Sañgil was then the manager of the rice 
mill, and the plaintiff made demand upon him for her share of the profits of the 
business, but Roberto refused to comply with her demand, and the plaintiff 
thereupon brought the present action for the dissolution of the partnership and 
for an accounting of its profits from June 13, 1923. At the same time she 
brought another action against Alejandro Sañgil for a maintenance allowance, and 
by an order issued on March 30, 1925, Alejandro was ordered to pay her P30 a 
month for her maintenance <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span>. On August 20, 1925, the defendant Sixto 
Joaquin brought an action against Alejandro Sañgil on a promissory note for 
P15,000, and six days later Alejandro filed an answer, which in effect amounted 
to a confession of judgment, and consequently the Court of First Instance 
rendered such judgment upon the pleadings. Execution was thereupon levied pn the 
property of Alejandro Sañgil as well as on the share of the herein plaintiff in 
the rice mill, and at the execution sale the property levied upon was bid in by 
Joaquin. 
<p align="justify">Upon trial of the present case the court below rendered 
judgment in favor of the plaintiff and held that by virtue of the donation made 
on June 13, 1923, she was the absolute and exclusive owner of the share in the 
rice mill mentioned in the donation and that she was entitled to the dividends 
and profits of said share from the date of the filing of the complaint; that the 
said share was paraphernal property of the plaintiff; and that the sale of the 
aforesaid share, under the execution levied in the action brought by Sixto 
Joaquin, was null and void. It was therefore ordered that the defendant Roberto 
Sañgil, as manager of the rice mill, should within the period of fifteen days 
after the decision became final, present the accounts of the profits and losses 
resulting from the operation of the rice mill subsequent to January 31, 1925, in 
which account the dividends and profits delivered to Alejandro Sañgil and Sixto 
Joaquin from said date should be specified for the purpose of determining the 
sums due the plaintiff. The court further ordered Alejandro Sañgil to pay the 
costs of the action. From this judgment all of the defendants appealed.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellants' principal contention is that the donation 
above-mentioned was made during the marriage of the spouses and that it 
therefore is null and void under article 1334 of the Civil Code. The deed of 
donation has not been forwarded to this court, and, in determining the question, 
we must therefore rely on the findings of the court below upon that point. In 
its decision the court says: </p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>"As a question of fact, the court finds that a preponderance of 
the evidence shows that the deed of donation was executed moments before the 
celebration of the civil marriage on June 13, 1923. In said document, Alejandro 
Sañgil states that he is a <span style="font-style: italic;">widower</span>, and it also appears therein that Paulina 
Garcia is unmarried and 22 years of age; that Alejandro Sañgil was a shareholder 
in the rice mill in question to the extent of P10,500; and that Paulina Garcia, 
having agreed to accept Alejandro Sañgil as husband, that is to say, by reason 
of the union agreed upon, the said Alejandro Sañgil made <span style="font-style: italic;">donation absolute</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">irrevocable</span> to his <span style="font-style: italic;">future</span> wife of all the rights, shares, interest, and utility 
in the rice mill in question."</blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">Upon the facts so found, it is clear that the donation was 
executed before the marriage and that therefore article 1334 of the Civil Code 
is not applicable to the case. As a donation by reason of marriage, it is 
governed by the provisions of articles 1327-1333 of said Code. Article 1393 
cited by the appellant has, as far as we can see, no bearing upon the question; 
that article relates to conjugal property and does not prohibit donations by 
reason of marriage. The other contentions of the appellants deserve no 
discussion. </p>
<p align="justify">The appealed judgment is affirmed with the costs against the 
appellants jointly and severally. So ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
