Leas, through Attorney Francisco A. Delgado, wrote the plaintiff the letter, Exhibit 2, advising him that the contract above referred to was rescinded, it appearing that the parts of the machinery, which the plaintiff asserted in said contract were on the way, were not at the time and it was only several days later that they were shipped for Manila. In this letter the parts received were placed at the plaintiff's disposal upon the repayment of the sums advanced by the defendant to Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co.</p><p>On the 14th of October, 1919, the plaintiff commenced this action in which, basing himself on the contract Exhibit B and on the facts set forth in his complaint, he prayed that the defendant be sentenced to pay him the sum of P30,546.03 with interest thereon, which sum was the difference between the P100,000, the consideration of the contract, Exhibit B, and the price of the aforesaid machinery which had been paid by the defendant, plus the incidental expenses, as stipulated in the said contract.</p><p>The defendant answered, denying generally and specifically the allegations of the complaint and setting up a special defense and a counterclaim. In his special defense, he alleges that he had accepted and signed the contract Exhibit B on the assertion therein contained that of the machinery, which was the subject matter of the said contract, a part was already in Manila, and the other part on the way, and also on the promises, assertions, and contemporary and previous acts of the plaintiff to the same effect, by means of which the latter succeeded in inducing the defendant to make and sign the aforesaid contract; that the parts of the machinery which, on the date of the contract, were said to be <i>on the way</i>, were not in fact in, and did not arrive at, Manila but long thereafter; that if he signed the contract, it was because he was desirous of having the machinery, and the defendant assured him that it would be delivered to him, immediately or within a short time; that otherwise he would not have signed the contract; that he prepared in a shed the necessary compartments to install the machinery on or before the 1st day of January, 1919; that on April 25, 1919, he advised the plaintiff that he regarded the contract as rescinded; that he had complied with his part of the contract, having paid Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co. the sum of P69,453.97; that he suffered damages in the sum of P120,000.</p><p>In his counterclaim, the defendant alleges that the giving of a bond in favor of plaintiff being one of the conditions of the contract, he (the defendant) gave such bond, having paid the Philippine Guaranty Co. a premium of P400 for the quarter beginning with November 16, 1918,</p><p>The defendant prays in his answer that he be absolved from the complaint, the aforesaid contract declared rescinded, and the plaintiff compelled to receive the machinery in question, to pay the defendant P69,453.97, and be sentenced to pay P120,000 as damages.</p><p>Trial having been held, the lower court sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiff P30,546.03, with legal interest thereon from October 16, 1919, and the costs, and absolved the plaintiff from the set-off and the counterclaim.</p><p>From this judgment the defendant has appealed to this court, making the following assignments of error:</p><ol> <li>The trial court erred in not holding that time was an essential element of the contract Exhibit B.<br><br>  </li> <li>The trial court erred in giving judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and<br><br> </li>  <li>The trial court erred in dismissing the counterclaim of the defendant.</li></ol><p>The defendant, testifying as witness, said that he had asked the plaintiff and his broker, Mr. Blanc, whether at that time the machinery had already left the factory, and that they answered yes. True, the plaintiff denies in his testimony having made such a statement, but Mr. Blanc does not deny it, and it is a fact that in the contract in question was inserted the following:</p><blockquote> <p>"Second. That a part of the aforesaid machinery is at this time on the way, the other part being already in this city of Manila, the price of which has not as yet been paid by Mr. Soler to Messrs. Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co."</p></blockquote><p>It appears sufficiently established in the record that if the plaintiff gave his consent to this contract, it was because he expected that said machinery would arrive within a short time,—the time reasonably necessary for such machinery to reach Manila from America,—as the plaintiff asserted in the document itself that said machinery was then on the way. The act of the defendant in insisting that this guaranty as to the arrival of the machinery be stated in the contract, his repeated complaints and protests when he afterwards made payments as the parts arrived, and his of April 25, 1919, leave no room for doubt that the arrival of said machinery within a reasonably short time was one of the determining elements of his consent. These acts of the defendant disclose the fact that he intended the arrival of the machinery to be an essential element of the contract (art. 1282, Civil Code), We hold that in the case at bar the arrival of the machinery within a reasonable time was an essential element of the contract, such time to be determined by taking into account the fact that it was then on the way to Manila.</p><p>The defendant had no reason to doubt the veracity of the plaintiff's assertion that said machinery was then on the way. The plaintiff himself testified that he had showed the letters, copies of which are Exhibits X, Y, and Z, in the last of which Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co. stated that according to the information received, the expellers had already been sent out by the manufacturers.</p><p>The fact that the plaintiff had no control of the prompt transportation of the said machinery to Manila, does not relieve the plaintiff from making good the guaranty inserted in the contract that said machinery was already on the way to Manila. The plaintiff elected to bind himself in that way, although he knew, as he ought to have known that, had his rights not been transferred to the defendant, he could not have charged Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co. so much, who in the contract Exhibit A did not guarantee the delivery nor the amount of the price. The plaintiff having bound himself in favor of the defendant for more than what Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co. had bound themselves for in his favor, we entertain no doubt that he acted in good faith, encouraged by the information of Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co. (although the most that the latter asserted, also upon information, was that the expellers,—only the expellers,—had been sent out by the factory), but it was he, not Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co., who contracted the obligation, and, therefore, he is the only one to be responsible for the obligation arising from the contract. He who contracts and assumes an obligation is presumed to know the circumstances under which said obligation can be complied with (Ferrer vs. Ignacio, 39 Phil., 446).</p><p>It cannot be said that such a statement of the plaintiff that the machinery was on the way is not one of the conditions of the contract Exhibit B. It is true that it is only in the third paragraph of the said contract that the terms and conditions thereof are set out in detail, but such terms and conditions were stipulated upon the understanding that the machinery is that described in the first paragraph of the contract and that a part thereof was already in Manila and the other part on the way.</p><p>True, the plaintiff did not specify the date or time of the arrival of said mechanical devices; but he did assert that they were on the way on the date of the contract, that is, the 16th of November, 1918, which is tantamount to saying that they would arrive early in January, 1919, under normal conditions, taking into account that the expellers, which were shipped on December 12, 1918, arrived at Manila on February 13, 1919. But it did not happen as asserted, the last parts of the machinery, to wit, the grinding mills not having arrived at Manila until the 23d of August, 1919, they not having been shipped until as late as the 21st of February of that year.</p><p>Clause (<i>c</i>) of the third paragraph of the contract Exhibit B discharged the plaintiff from all the obligations contracted by him under the agreement Exhibit A made with Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co., relative to the payment of the price of the machinery; but he was not thereby released from the obligation assumed by him under the contract Exhibit B as to the arrival of the machinery, which obligation cannot be that referred to in clause (<i>c</i>) of the third paragraph of Exhibit B, for he has no such an obligation under the said contract Exhibit A, but Messrs. Anderson &amp; Co.</p><p>We find that the plaintiff has failed to carry out his obligation incurred under the second paragraph of the contract Exhibit B, and has, therefore, no right to compel the defendant to comply with his obligation to pay the plaintiff the sum claimed in the complaint (art. 1124, Civil Code).</p><p>With regard to the counterclaim set up by the defendant, it appears from the record that he sold the aforesaid machinery to a third person, the Philippine Refining Co. In cases like this, the rescission of the contract does not lie (art. 1295, Civil Code).</p><p>As to the damages claimed by the defendant, we find that the evidence adduced on this point is insuiRcient to fix the true amount thereof.</p><p>The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the defendant absolyed from the complaint, and the plaintiff from the counterclaim and other claims of the defendant without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p><p><i>Araullo, C. J., Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</i> and <i>Johns, JJ.,</i> concur. </p></div>
