				<H3>LUZON  BROKERAGE CO., INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. JUAN  POSADAS, JR., AS COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present appeal was  taken  by the plaintiff, the Luzon Brokerage Co., Inc., from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila which affirmed the  decision of the Collector  of Internal  Revenue on the internal-revenue tax imposed on certain playing cards, upholding the action taken by him under the provisions of  Act No. 3246, and dismissed the complaint,  with the costs.<br><br>In support of its appeal the appellant assigns the follow- ing alleged  errors as committed by the trial court in its decision, to wit: (1) The lower courj; erred in finding that the internal-revenue tax levied and collected in the present case was lawfully levied and collected upon the playing cards in question; (2)  in finding that the  date of the withdrawal  of said  playing cards from the  customhouse determined  the rate  of internal-revenue  tax  to  be paid thereon; (3) in failing to find that the internal-revenue tax rate applicable to  the  imported playing cards  in  question was the one in force on November 20, 1925, the date of the arrival of the importing vessel; (4)  in dismissing the plaintiff's complaint; (5) in overruling  plaintiff's motion for a new trial.<br><br>Section 1251 of the Revised Administrative Code of 1917 reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 1251.  When duties accrue on imported merchandise.—Unless  otherwise specially provided by  law,  duties shall accrue upon  imported merchandise upon the arrival of the importing vessel within the jurisdictional waters of the Philippine Islands  with intent to unlade."<br></blockquote><br>And section 1248 of the  same Code states the following:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 1248.  <i>When importation by sea begins and ends.</i>— Importation by sea begins when the importing vessel enters the jurisdictional  waters of the Philippine Islands  with intention to unlade therein, and is not completed until the duties due upon the merchandise have been paid or secured to be paid at a port of  entry and the legal permit for withdrawal shall have been granted, or, in case said merchandise is free of duty, until it has legally left the jurisdiction of the customs."</blockquote><br>The  pertinent part  of  section 1478  of the  same  Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 1478. <i>Articles subject to specific tax</i>.—Specific internal-revenue taxes apply to things manufactured or produced in the Philippine Islands for domestic  sale or consumption and to things imported  from the United States or foreign countries, but  not  to  any thing  produced  or manufactured here which shall be  removed for exportation and is actually exported without returning to the Islands, whether so exported in its original  state or as an ingredient or part of any  manufactured article or product.<br><br>"In case of importations the internal-revenue  tax  shall be in addition to the customs duties, if any."<br><br><center>* * * * * * *<br></center></blockquote>And section 1480 of the same Code says:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 1480. <i>Payment of specific tax on imported  articles</i>.—Internal-revenue taxes on imported articles shall  be paid by the owner or importer to the customs officers, conformably with regulations of the Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue and before the release of such articles  from the custom-house."<br></blockquote><br>In the decision written by Mr. Justice Johnson in the case of Asiatic Petroleum Company vs. Rafferty (38 Phil., 475), the following is stated:<br><br><blockquote>"*   *   *  The theory of the law, with reference to the internal-revenue tax upon such  merchandise, seems to  be that the tax is not due and payable  until  it is about to be put into the commerce or trade  of the country.  The condition of the market at a particular time, or the situation in business generally, might cause the producer to withhold his merchandise and  not allow it to be removed from the place of production for months, or  even  years; could he, under  the  above quoted provision  of the  law, be required to pay the internal-revenue taxes until he saw fit to place his product upon the  market?  While the law permits the producer of taxable merchandise to  delay the payment of the internal-revenue tax until 'immediately before removal of the  same from the  place of production,' <i>the duly authorized and promulgated regulation of  the defendant himself</i> permits the importer of taxable merchandise to deposit the same in a  bonded  warehouse and to delay the payment of internal-evenue tax until the same is about to be removed therefrom.   *  *   *"</blockquote><br>Consequently, merchandise  imported to  these  Islands from foreign countries  is subject to two taxes, namely: Customs and internal revenue.  In accordance with section 1251 of the Administrative Code above quoted, duties shall accrue  upon the arrival  of the importing vessel within the jurisdictional waters of the Philippine Islands with intent to unlade; and,  in accordance with section 1248 of the same Code, also quoted above, the importation of said merchandise is not completed until the duty to which it is subject has been paid,  or, until it' has legally left the jurisdiction of the  customhouse in case it is exempt from the payment of duties.  According to section 1480  of  the  same Code, above  cited,  internal-revenue  taxes  on imported  articles must be satisfied  before the release of such articles from the customhouse.<br><br>Now then; from what time is the importer or owner of the imported merchandise obliged to pay the internal-revenue tax?   When the  importation is  completed  by the payment of  the customs duties? or, when  the importer or owner  withdraws it from the customhouse and places it on the market?<br><br>According to  the doctrine above cited, imported merchandise is not subject to the payment of internal-revenue tax except just  before it is withdrawn from the customhouse for the purpose of placing it on the market, being on the same footing with merchandise manufactured or produced in the  country for its  sale and consumption therein, which is not subject to the payment of internal-revenue tax, except just before  its  transfer from the place of production, in accordance with section 1479 of the Administrative Code, which  reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec.  1479. Payment of specific tax  on domestic products.—Specific taxes on  domestic products  shall be paid by the manufacturer,  producer,  owner,  or person  having possession of the  same; and except as otherwise especially allow such taxes shall be paid immediately before removal from the place of production."</blockquote><br>The time, then, that the imported merchandise becomes subject to the payment of the internal-revenue tax, depends upon the will of the importer or owner of said merchandise; because, while he has not decided to withdraw it from the customhouse and place it on the market, and has not requested permission to do so, he is not bound to pay said tax.<br><br>According to the stipulation of facts and the admissions made during the trial, the boxes of paying cards arrives in the port of Manila on November 20, 1925, at 8 o'clock in the morning, but were not declared for payment of the internal-revenue tax until December 1st of the same year, neither was the amount of the estimated tax deposited, nor was permission requested to withdraw said boxes from the customhouse, except on December 2, 1925.<br><br>The law in force for the payment of internal-revenue taxes on imported merchandise at the time of the arrival of the playing cards in question, was section 7, Act No. 2835, amending section 1498 of the Administrative Code, and the payment of the internal-revenue tax on said imported merchandise was made, was Act No. 3246, which became effective December 1, 1925.<br><br>If th importer or owner of the imported merchandise may select the time in which he should pay the amount of the internal-revenue tax on the same from the time it arrives in the port of Manila until it is withdrawn from the customhouse, and the herein plaintiff-appellant not having taken advantage of the favorable provisions of section 1498 of the Revised Administrative Code as amended y section 7 of Act No. 2835, and not having paid the internal-revenue tax while said section was in force, but only after the new law, Act No. 3246, went into effect, it cannot now make claim for the recovery of the internal-revenue tax paid under the law in force at the time payment was made.<br><br>Briefly, then, the time for the payment of the internal-revenue tax in merchandise, from the date of arrival in port until just before it is withdrawn fro mthe customhouse, depending upon the will of the importer or owner, the law in force at the time the payment is made must prevail; because, voluntary human acts are governed by the laws in force at the time they are done, unless there is a a legal provision to the contrary.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we find no error in the judgment appealed from and the same is affirmed in all its parts, with the costs against the appellant.  So  ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ, </span>concur.</div>
