				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original proceeding instituted in this court to obtain a writ  of prohibition directed to the probate court of the City  of Manila prohibiting, during the pendency of petitioner's  appeal, its  carrying out, or taking any steps whatever to enforce certain orders requiring the petitioner, as administrator of  the estate of the late T. H.  Pardo de Tavera, to pay his widow the  sum of P5,000.  The material facts out of which this controversy arises, as set forth in petitioner's  complaint and defendant's answer, are these:<br><br>As stated, Juan Sumulong is the administrator of the estate of T. H. Pardo de Tavera.   During the course of the administration, the administrator has sanctioned the paying  out  from  time  to time of various  sums for the support  of  the widow and the children  of the  deceased. Eventually,  on August 31, 1927, the widow, Dona Concepcion Cembrano, asked the court to order the administrator to pay her the amount of P5,000.  Against the opposition of the administrator, the court on September  14, 1927, conformed to the motion of the  widow.   The administrator asked for a reconsideration without obtaining a favorable ruling.   Thereupon,  the administrator filed a statement in writing appealing  to the Supreme Court from the adverse order.  The court fixed the  appeal  bond at P500  on October 10, 1927, and four days later the bond was presented for approval.<br><br>We come  now to the more directly controlling facts.  A chronological  statement will best  disclose them.  On October 14th the record on appeal was  filed by the petitioner. On  October 17th  the appeal bond was approved  by the court.   On the same day the widow again  petitioned the court to secure her allowance of P5,000.   On October 24th the record  on appeal was approved by  the  court.  On the same day the court ordered the administrator to turn over to the widow  the P5,000.  Following this came the usual motion for reconsideration  presented  by the  petitioner and its denial by the court, but with a proviso directing the administrator to comply with the order relating to the payment of  the P5,000.  The administrator twice unsuccessfully prayed  for a  suspension of the order pending appeal.  Finally, on November  12th the judge peremptorily commanded the administrator  to pay the widow the sum of P5,000 before 11 a. m. on  November 15th,  with the admonition that on failure to obey, the administrator would  be ordered arrested  by the  court.<br><br>The  last  order and related orders of the  trial court have been suspended  by  a  temporary injunction issued by  a member of this court.  The respondents  have answered admitting most  of the allegations  made in the complaint. It is our understanding that there is no  dispute between the parties relative to any pertinent fact.<br><br>The  subject of inquiry  is the extent of power  in the court proceeded  against.  The question arises here if the probate court had  jurisdiction to  issue its orders  or whether it had  lost jurisdiction by the perfecting of the appeal.<br><br>In connection  with the legal question, it will be recalled that the appeal  bond was approved on October 17, 1927, or a week  before the record on appeal was approved and the order  of the court directed to  the administrator was promulgated.  Petitioner  argues from this fact  that the bond for appeal determines the date when jurisdiction in the lower court ceases and that consequently the court was thereafter without jurisdiction.  It  is true  that in the case of Calderon vs. McMicking  ([1908], 10 Phil., 650)  it was held in effect that  when  notice of appeal in special proceedings has been given and the bond filed and approved no order of the court allowing the bill is necessary.  But that ruling  was made before  the adoption of  Rule 16  of the Courts  of  First Instance  having  to do with  appeals in special proceedings and  before  the principles in Buenaventura and Del Rosario vs. Ramos  ([1921], 42 Phil., 490) were announced.   It is now necessary for the trial court both to approve the appeal bond and the record on appeal.<br><br>With this subsidiary point out of the way, we  advert to  the  controlling  facts,  which  are that the appeal bond was approved  on October 17th;  that the record  on  appeal was approved  on October 24th;  and that on the same day the court ordered the administrator to pay the widow the P5,000, and thereafter attempted  to enforce compliance with the order.<br><br>In Part II,  Special  Proceedings, of the Code of Civil Procedure is found  Chapter XLII styled "Appeals, in Special Proceedings."   It is probable that section 783 in that chapter governs  the appeal taken by the administrator from the order of the Court of First  Instance directing him to pay the widow P5,000.  The cited  section states that the appeal shall be effected in the manner provided in the two preceding sections.   These sections  (781 and 782) in turn, require the filing with the Court of First Instance of an application  for an  appeal and the execution  and filing  of a bond.  The nature  of the bond is as provided in section 780 and is conditioned that the person appealing "will prosecute the appeal to  effect and pay the intervening damages and costs  occasioned by such appeal."  No other principle can be derived from  the  law than that on the perfecting of an appeal in special proceedings, the trial court loses its jurisdiction.  There may be exceptions to this  rule, but the instant case does not disclose one of them.<br><br>Jurisdiction  over the subject matter of an action  or the parties  thereto, though it has once  confessedly  attached, may subsequently terminate, and when  this happens, the court is as destitute of jurisdiction as if jurisdiction either of the  subject  matter or of the person had never existed. That is an obvious  rule.  The jurisdiction of  a court may be terminated by the perfecting of an appeal to some other court,  accompanied by an  undertaking  sufficient to stay proceedings until the appellate court has exercised its jurisdiction.  All further proceedings dependent upon, or in the way of the enforcement of, the order or judgment whose effect  has  been thus  terminated  by the  appeal are unauthorized and  will be prohibited.  (22  R.  C.  L., pp. 19 et seq.; III Am. St. Rep., pp. 946 et seq.)<br><br>It is rarely  that we find an authority almost  exactly identical with the case before us, but that happens in this instance.   We desire to refer to Ruggles vs. Superior Court ([1894], 103  Cal.,  125).  With  the later dissent of the Chief Justice,  Mr. Justice Van Fleet, speaking for the Supreme Court of California, rendered the following decision: <br><br><blockquote>"Application for  prohibition.  Petitioner is the administrator of the  estate of  one  Henry  Welch,  deceased, in course of  administration  in  the  department of said respondent superior court presided over by  said Hon. J. V. Coffey, judge  thereof.  On February 16,  1894,  an order was made and  entered in said estate, directing  petitioner, as  such administrator,  to pay  to  the widow  of  said deceased seven  thousand  three hundred and seventy-five dollars, as accrued and  unpaid family  allowance.   From this order  the  administrator,  on February 20,  1894, perfected an  appeal to this  court.  Thereafter,  the  widow moved this court to dismiss said appeal, which motion was subsequently, on the fifth day of  March,  denied, and the appeal is still pending and undetermined.  Subsequent to the denial  of  said  motion, the respondent judge,  on the seventh day of March, at the instance of the widow, caused a citation to be issued and served upon petitioner, requiring said petitioner to show  cause before the respondent superior court, on the eighth day of March, 1894, why he should not be  punished  for  contempt in  failing and refusing to obey  the order of February 16th, requiring  him to pay said family allowance.  On the last-mentioned date, petitioner, in obedience to the citation, appeared before said court,  and in response thereto brought properly  to the attention of the court the  said appeal and the order of this court denying  the  motion to dismiss the  same,  and then objected that neither the superior  court nor  the judge thereof had any power or jurisdiction to proceed with or hear said matter of contempt, or to enforce said order for the payment of family allowance, by reason of the pendency of the appeal.  But notwithstanding  the showing so made by petitioner, and disregarding his objections, said superior court and  the  judge thereof, respondents, threatened to proceed in said matter,  and to punish petitioner for his refusal to obey said order; whereupon this application for prohibition was made.<br><br>"The sole question arising is as to  whether the superior court is acting in excess of its jurisdiction  in the premises. Under the facts stated we are constrained to hold that it is. The appeal from the order in question operated as a <i>supersedeas</i>, and stayed all further proceedings in the court below in the particular  matter involved in the  order appealed from.  By the appeal the order or decree is set at large, and the subject matter removed from  the jurisdiction of the lower court, until the appeal has been determined, and the matter remitted back from the appellate court.  In the case of <i>Pennie vs. Superior Court</i>, 89 Cal., 31,  the lower court made an order for family allowance, from which an appeal was taken.  Pending the  appeal the  lower court made an order directing the administrator to pay the money allowed by the previous order.  The latter order was annulled by this court on certiorari,  upon the ground  that the appeal had removed the  subject matter  of  the order  from the jurisdiction of the superior court, and it  had not  authority to further proceed with its enforcement pending the appeal. And in the recent  case  of <i> Ex parte Oxford</i>,  102  Cal., 656 (opinion filed in Department  Two of this court June 8, 1894), the  same question  arose: An administratrix of  an estate  in  probate had  been ordered to  pay  a certain claim against the estate.  She appealed  from the order,  but, notwithstanding  her appeal, the  lower court 240017-17 proceeded against her as for a contempt in refusing obedience to its order, and punished her by imprisonment until she should comply with the order.  This court discharged her on <i>habeas corpus</i>, holding that 'the petitioner, having appealed and  stayed all proceedings upon the order which she is charged with violating,  cannot, pending her appeal, be punished for a failure to obey it.<br><br>"It is  urged here by the respondents, however, as it was on the motion to dismiss  the  appeal, that the appeal attempted  to be taken by petitioner herein is ineffectual to stay the hand of the  lower  court, because no appeal lies from an order such as the one under consideration.  But that question does not arise in this proceeding.  An appeal from the order has been taken  to this court, and this court has refused to dismiss  it;  this determination is as effectual for the purposes of this proceeding as if determined for all purposes.  Its effect is that this court is thus  far entertaining the appeal, and while it does so the respondents are not at liberty to proceed in the matter.  Whether the order in question shall be ultimately held appealable is a question  that  will properly arise  in the matter in which the appeal is pending,  but, for the reason stated, it is not involved  here.<br><br>"The proceedings  complained of being in excess of the jurisdiction of respondents, a peremptory writ should issue as prayed.<br><br>"It is so ordered.<br><br><i>"De Haven,  J., Garoutte, J., Harrison, J., McFarland, J., Beatty, C.J.</i>, and <i>Fitzgerald,  J.,</i> concurred.<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Rehearing denied."</span><br style="font-style: italic;"></blockquote><br>The only real difference between the California case and the Philippine case  is that the probate court  of  Manila attempted to enforce its judgment on the same day that the record on appeal was  approved.  We have no means of knowing  which act was  done  first.  We must, therefore, assume that the two acts  were as nearly simultaneously performed as is physically possible.  But we do not think this consideration  is disastrous  to  the petitioner's contention.   The approval of an  appeal bond and of a record on appeal would be inconsistent with the rendition of an order which would make the appeal nugatory.  A  compliance by the administrator with the order would render the appeal futile  and illusory.  The two orders were entirely antagonistic one with  the other.   The  only  reasonable deduction must be that with the  confirmation of the appeal bond and of the appeal, jurisdiction in the court  below ceased. It is our opinion that the  probate court of Manila was without jurisdiction to order the administrator to pay the widow of the late Doctor Tavera the sum of P5,000, following the approval of the appeal bond and the record  on appeal, when the appeal was taken precisely to  secure a reversal of the order relating to the payment  of the P5,000. Agreeable  to the foregoing, the  preliminary injunction heretofore issued shall be  made permanent  and  the writ shall  issue as prayed, without costs.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña,  C,  J.,  Johnson, Street, Villamor,  Ostrand, Johns, Romnaldez, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
