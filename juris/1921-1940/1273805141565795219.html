<p>The controversy between the parties arises out of a conflict between two 
mining claims, plaintiff claiming as successor in interest under a location made 
by V. L. Tipton, June 22, 1921, known as the <em>Prince</em> claim upon ground 
alleged to have been located by the defendant, February 28, 1921, known as the 
<em>Pig Fraction</em> claim. The <em>Prince</em> claim overlaps the <em>Pig 
Fraction</em> claim on the northwesterly side and the <em>Pig Fraction</em> 
claim overlaps the <em>Prince</em> on the southeasterly side, and practically 
all of the workings of the two claims are in the area in conflict.</p>
<p>August 15, 1922, the defendant filed his application for a patent, notice of 
which was published as legally required. October 4, 1922, plaintiff filed his 
adverse, claiming that the boundaries of defendant's claim were insufficiently 
marked, and that his location line and discovery were within the boundaries of 
the <em>Waterfall</em> claim, and that the <em>Pig Fraction</em> claim contains 
an extension of the same vein or lode which runs through the Crest claim held by 
the defendant. It appears that the original <em>Pig</em> claim was located on 
February 1, 1913, and that a half interest therein was conveyed to the 
defendant. The assessment work was not done for the year 1920, and a relocation 
of the claim was made in the name of the defendant.</p>
<p>Upon the issues a large amount of evidence was taken and the lower court 
found in favor of the plaintiff, from which the defendant appeals, contending 
that the court erred in finding that the location line, corners and discovery by 
the <em>Pig Fraction</em> claim were insufficiently marked, and that the 
declaration is insufficient, in finding that the relocation of the <em>Pig</em> 
claim was null and void, and that the location of the <em>Prince</em> claim is 
valid, in finding that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of so much of the 
<em>Pig</em> or <em>Pig Fraction</em> claim as conflicts with the 
<em>Prince</em> claim, and that the defendant has no title, right or interest in 
any portion of the <em>Pig</em> claim, which is in conflict with the 
<em>Prince</em> claim, in rendering judgment for the plaintiff and in denying 
defendant's motion for a new trial.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The question here involved is largely one of the credibility of witnesses. 
The lower court who saw and heard them testify, in a well written opinion, found 
for the plaintiff upon all of the issues. In doing so, it made a careful and 
detailed analysis of the evidence and all of the material facts. Among other 
things, his Honor, Judge Harvey, said: "The evidence shows without question that 
the <em>Prince</em> claim was located by V. L. Tipton on June 22, 1921; that 
Tipton and Reynolds carefully complied with the law in locating the 
<em>Prince</em> claim; that Tipton transferred said claim to Icard, who did the 
necessary work thereon to the amount of about P3,000. In fact, counsel for 
defendant says in his brief: It is interesting to note the elaborate precautions 
taken in locating the <em>Prince</em> claim (Reynolds, transcript 105 and 
106)â€”precautions that Reynolds seldom before had found necessary (Reynolds, 
transcript 132). This, of course, is the obvious situation: a locator with a 
claim carelessly monumented, and a jumper with one which meticulously follows 
the letter of the law.'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The court has already expressed the opinion that neither Whitmarsh nor Noble 
was legally entitled to relocate the <em>Pig</em> claim on February 28,1921, 
because there was not then any real abandonment or forfeiture of the claim as 
between the original locator (Whitmarsh) and the Government, and for that reason 
the relocation was void; but, assuming that Noble may have been legally entitled 
to relocate said claim, after failure to complete the assessment work thereon 
for 1920, the question to be decided is whether or not the relocation made by 
Gatchalian in the name of defendant was valid and effective as against plaintiff 
and his predecessor in interest, V. L. Tipton.</p>
<p>"Section 23, as amended, of the Act of Congress approved July 1, 1902, known 
as the Philippine Bill, provides in detail the manner of establishing and 
marking the location line of a mineral claim in the Philippine Islands, and 
these provisions are couched in plain words which mining men are accustomed to 
use. Said section provides, in part, as follows:</p>
<p>" 'SEC 23. That a mineral claim shall be marked by two posts, placed as 
nearly as possible on the line of the ledge or vein, and the posts shall be 
numbered one and two, and the distance between posts numbered one and two shall 
not exceed three hundred meters, the line between posts numbered one and two to 
be known as the location lines; and upon posts numbered one and two shall be 
written the name given to the mineral claim, the name of the locator, and the 
date of the location. Upon post numbered one there shall be written, in addition 
to the foregoing, "Initial post," the approximate compass bearing of post 
numbered two, and a statement of the number of meters lying to the right and to 
the left of the line from post numbered one to post numbered two, thus "Initial 
post. Direction of post numbered two * * * meters of this claim lie on the right 
and * * * meters on the left of the line from number one to number two post * * 
*." ' " After making some reference to section 24 and other portions of 23 of 
the Act of Congress, the trial court says:</p>
<p>"Furthermore, section 8 of Act No. 624 of the Philippine Commission, an Act 
prescribing mining regulations for the Philippines, provides that, in addition 
to the requirements of sections 23 and 24 of said Act of Congress approved July 
1, 1902, in regard to placing posts numbered one and two on the line of 
location, and marking the line between them, each locator of a mineral claim 
shall establish each of the four corners of the claim by marking a standing tree 
or rock in place, or by setting in the ground, where practicable, a post or 
stone, and that each corner shall be distinctly marked to indicate that it is 
the northeast, southeast, southwest or other corner, as the case may be, of the 
claim in question; and that the posts or stones used to mark such corners shall 
be of the dimensions required by these regulations for posts and stones marking 
corners or angles of a placer claim; and section 9 of said Act, in relation to 
marking placer claims, provides that when a post is used it must be at least 
five inches in diameter or four inches on each side by four feet six inches in 
length, and, where practicable, set one foot in the ground and surrounded by a 
mound of earth or stone four feet in diameter by two feet in height.</p>
<p>"There is no proof that these provisions of law for setting posts were 
complied with in relocating the <em>Pig</em> claim. In fact, the evidence 
adduced shows that they were not complied with as to the posts set under the 
supervision of Mr. Whitmarsh, and, as to three of the corner posts, there is no 
satisfactory proof that they were ever set at all; Mr. Whitmarsh did not know 
whether they were set, or how they were set, if at all, and Gatchalian, although 
available, was not called as a witness in the trial of this 
case."</p></blockquote>
<p>We agree with counsel for the appellant that the law does not require a 
technical compliance with all of such provisions to make a valid location of a 
mining claim.</p>
<p>But it is very apparent that it does require a substantial compliance, and it 
was for such reason that the old law was amended in that particular. In any 
event, it would require that a stranger going upon the ground would find visible 
evidence of the discovery shaft and the center end posts and the four corners, 
showing the boundaries of the claim. In other words, there should be open, 
visible evidence of the fact that the ground had been located as mineral and of 
the boundaries of the location. This would be especially true as to all of the 
corner posts and the location line and the name of the mineral claim and the 
locator and the date of the location. Upon that vital question, as to the 
defendant's location, there is a failure of proof. It is conceded that the 
plaintiff's location complied with all legal formalities.</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Street, Malcolm, Avancena, Villamor, Ostrand</em>, and<em> Romualdez, 
JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Johnson, J.,</em> took no part in the consideration of 
this case.</p>
