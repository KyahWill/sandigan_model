				<H3>ARTURO V. ESCALANTE, PETITIONER, VS. PAULINO SANTOS, DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present habeas corpus proceeding was instituted by Arturo V. Escalante, 
who is in Bilibid Prison. On November 14, 1928, he was convicted of estafa and 
sentenced to two years, eleven months, and eleven days of <em>presidio 
correccional,</em> to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P4,836.53, with 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. This 
penalty is the minimum of the maximum degree of the penalty provided in article 
634, paragraph No. 3, of the Penal Code then in force, that is, <em>presidio 
correctional</em> in the minimum and medium degrees, i. e., six months and one 
day to four years and two months of <em>presidio correccional,</em> because the 
amount abstracted exceeds 6,250 pesetas.
<p><em>Estafa</em> in that amount (P4,836.53) not exceeding P6,000 is punished 
in the Revised Penal Code, in force since the first of this year (article 315, 
paragraph 3), with a penalty ranging from arresto mayor in the maximum degree to 
prision correccional in the minimum degree, i. e., four months and one day to 
two years and four months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, recommending that the petition be granted and the 
petitioner set at liberty, submits the following computations:</p>
<p>"4. If the minimum of the maximum degree were to be imposed under the new 
Penal Code (it being the grade imposed in the original decision of the Supreme 
Court), the computation of the total term which petitioner has to serve is as 
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This total term does not include allowances for good conduct.</p>
<p>"5. Petitioner entered Bilibid on January 17, 1929, and hence has already 
served more than three years of imprisonment, which is more than the total term 
above computed.</p>
<p>"6. If, on the other hand, the maximum of the maximum were to be imposed 
under the new Penal Code (section 315, paragraph 3), the petitioner would still 
be entitled to his discharge because of allowances for good conduct which he can 
invoke in his favor, in accordance with the records of the Bureau of Prisons. 
The computation of the penalty will then be as follows:</p>

<p>"So that petitioner should have been released at all events on November 16, 
1931.</p>
<p>"7. In both cases, therefore, petitioner, having already served more than 
three years, is entitled to be now discharged under the provisions of article 22 
of the new Penal Code." (Pages 1, 2 and 3, Answer of the Attorney General, 
Rollo.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Article 22 of the Revised-Penal Code, to which the Attorney-General refers, 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 22. Retroactive effect of penal laws.—Penal laws, shall have a 
retroactive effect in so far as they favor the person guilty of a felony, who is 
not a habitual criminal, as this term is defined in rule 5 of article 62 of this 
Code, although at ^the time of the publication of such laws a final sentence has 
been pronounced and the convict is serving the same." With reference to the 
application of prior laws, the Code provides the following:</p>
<p>"Art. 366. Application of laws enacted prior to this Code.—Without prejudice 
to the provisions contained in article 22 of this Code, felonies and 
misdemeanors, committed prior to the date of effectiveness of this Code shall be 
punished in accordance with the Code or Acts in force at the time of their 
commission."</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as the law in this case is more favorable to the accused, and the 
latter has not been shown to be an habitual criminal, article 315, paragraph 3, 
of the Revised Penal Code now in force must be applied to the estafa of which 
the petitioner was convicted; and inasmuch as he has already served that 
penalty, he must be set at liberty immediately.</p>
<p>Some light is thrown on the intention of the new law with reference to its 
being retroactive when favorable to the accused, by the interpretation of its 
provisions by the chairman and a member of the committee created to draft the 
present Revised Penal Code. Judge Anacleto Diaz, the chairman of the committee, 
says the following in a communication addressed to Justice George A. Malcolm of 
this court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was present when the proposed bill referred to was discussed in the Joint 
Committee as I had been assigned to assist it in any way possible. I was also 
present when the bill as amended by the Joint Committee was finally submitted 
and approved by the two Houses, and I can positively say that the two articles 
were accepted and passed without any discussion whatsoever. In view of this, I 
believe that the two articles referred to must be construed, taking into 
consideration not only their literal meaning but the purpose in view of the 
law-making body that first approved art. 22 (art. 23, P. C. of Spain) as 
understood by the courts and the authorities called upon to construe the 
same.</p>
<p>"There seems to be no doubt that the purpose of art. 366 is to give the 
benefit of the retroactivity of a penal law as expressly and unmistakably stated 
in art. 22 to any person that may be found under the circumstances therein 
provided."</p></blockquote>
<p>Representative Quintin Paredes, member of the committee in charge of drafting 
the new Code, and also of the Committee for the Revision of Codes of the Eighth 
Legislature, expresses himself as follows upon the point in a communication 
likewise addressed to Justice Malcolm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In reply to your letter of the 26th instant, just received yesterday, I wish 
to inform you that I believe the members of the House Committee on Revision of 
Codes which introduced and recommended the bill that was later enacted as the 
'Revised Penal Code' intended to give said code retro-active effect in so far as 
it favors a person guilty of a felony, although at the time of its enactment a 
final sentence has already been pronounced and the convict is serving the same, 
provided that he is not an habitual criminal. To emphasize this intention, 
section 366 providing that 'felonies and misdemeanors committed prior to the 
date of this code shall be punished in accordance with the codes or acts in 
force at the time of their commission' was preceded by the saving clause 
'without prejudice to the provisions contained in article 22 of this Code/ which 
to my mind means that while felonies and misdemeanors committed prior to the 
date of effectiveness of the Revised Penal Code shall be punished in accordance 
with the Code or Acts in force at the time of their commission, the same should 
not be the case if such Code or Acts are unfavorable to the guilty party, for 
the general principle on the retroactivity of favorable penal laws, recognized 
in article 22, should then apply."</p></blockquote>
<p>And lest it be doubted that article 22 of the Revised Penal Code applies to 
said Code, Representative Quintin Paredes adds the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The use of the words 'penal laws' in general, instead of 'this Revised Penal 
Code and any other penal laws' in article 22, may give room for a doubt as to 
whether said article meant to include in the phrase 'penal laws' the same 
Revised Penal Code that was establishing the provision. But this doubt, I think, 
should not be entertained inasmuch as the Revised Penal Code is itself a penal 
law and the phrase 'penal laws' is broad enough to include all laws that are 
penal in character."</p></blockquote>
<p>As we have just held in the case of Laceste vs. Santos (page 472, 
<em>ante</em>), it is evident that the principle that penal laws are retroactive 
so far as they favor the accused, is sanctioned by the present as well as the 
former Penal Code.</p>
<p>The petition for habeas corpus being justified, it is hereby granted, and let 
the petitioner be at once set at liberty, with costs de oficio. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, 
Villla-Real,</em> and <em>Imperial, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
