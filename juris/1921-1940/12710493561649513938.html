				<H3>LORETO IGUILDEZ, AS ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF ABRAHAM WEILL, DECEASED, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. LEVY HERMANOS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The plaintiff as administratrix of the estate of Abraham Weill 
claims the sum of P155,437 from the defendant, alleging that Abraham Weill was 
chief and one of the partners of <em>La Estrella del Norte</em>, a firm 
established in this city; that after Abraham Weill's death, <em>La Estrella del 
Norte</em> was incorporated under the name of <em>Levy Hermanos, Inc.</em>, the 
new firm thus organized having been subrogated to all the assets and liabilities 
of the former partnership; and that the late Abraham Weill, upon his death left 
the amount of one hundred fifty-five thousand four hundred thirtyseven pesos 
(P155,437), deposited with the defendant <em>Levy Hermanos</em>.
<p align="justify">After denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant 
sets up as a defense: (1) That <em>La Estrella del Norte</em> was a foreign 
partnership organized under the laws of the French Republic, and the late 
Abraham Weill never had been a member of said partnership during the time when 
the same was engaged in business in these Islands; (2) that the balance in favor 
of Abraham Weill when the defendant was organized as a domestic corporation, and 
of which he took charge, had been fully paid by the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the allegations of the complaint and the answer and 
of the evidence adduced at the hearing, the trial court rendered judgment 
absolving the defendant from the complaint, with costs against the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff appealed from this judgment through the proper 
bill of exceptions, and now alleges that the trial court erred: (1) In accepting 
as good and true, the entries appearing in Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7a, and 8 
of the complaint; (2) in admitting the said Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7a, and 8; 
(3) in holding that it has been proved that the Kilayco property in Exhibit A 
belonged to <em>Levy Hermanos</em> and not to the deceased Abraham Weill; (4) in 
finding that the sum claimed by the plaintiff has already been fully paid by the 
defendant; (5) in absolving the defendant from the complaint and in ordering the 
plaintiff to pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">For the proper understanding of the first and second errors 
assigned by the appellant's counsel, it must be understood that Exhibits 1, 2, 
and 3 are the books of account of the commercial firm <em>Levy Hermanos</em>; 
that Exhibit 4 is the ledger of <em>Levy Hermanos Inc.</em>, opened on February 
1, 1922; that Exhibit 6 is a copy of the entries in Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, duly 
certified by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo; that Exhibit 7 
is one of the books of account of <em>Levy Hermanos</em> which was saved from 
the fire; that Exhibit 7-A is an exact copy of the entry contained in Exhibit 7 
regarding the participation of Abraham Weill on June 10, 1914, in favor of 
Fernando Levy and Alfred Schwab.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant's contention that said exhibits were wrongly 
admitted by the lower court, is untenable. Not only does it not appear in the 
bill of exceptions that said commercial books were not kept in accordance with 
the Code of Commerce, but it appears that the trial court, after examining them, 
found that said books had been kept in conformity with the provision of the 
aforesaid code, aside from the fact of having been admitted at the hearing by 
counsel for the appellant. In the case of Tan Machan vs. Gan Aya de la Trinidad 
(3 Phil., 684), it was held that: "Where the introduction in evidence of books 
of account is objected to upon the ground that they are not kept in conformity 
with the requirements of the Code of Commerce, the bill of exceptions must show 
that such was the fact in order to make the exception available in the appellate 
court." In Garrido vs. Asencio (10 Phil., 691), it was held that: "Books of 
account, although not kept in accordance with the provisions of the Code of 
Commerce, if not objected to, are admissable in evidence, and, in any event, 
they may be admitted under section 338 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as a 
memorandum to refresh the memory of the witness. (Tan Machan vs. Gan Aya de la 
Trinidad, 3 Phil., 684.)" In Cang Yui vs. Gardner and Tan Singco (34 Phil., 
376), the same rule was sustained and it was said that, at any rate, the account 
books, even if they have not been kept in accordance with the provisions of the 
Code of Commerce, may be admitted as evidence under section 338 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure.</p>
<p align="justify">With regard to the correctness of the entries appearing in the 
exhibits in question, it appears that the entries were regularly made in the 
ordinary course of the defendant's business in such a manner that even the 
interest on Abraham Weill's deposit is shown, and his share corresponding for 
each year as manager of <em>Levy Hermanos</em> is credited to his account.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, Alfred Schwab, a witness for the plaintiff, 
identified Exhibit I, and the trial judge having personally examined the 
defendant's original account books Exhibits 1, 2, 3 and 4, declares in his 
decision that said books were kept in conformity with the provisions of the Code 
of Commerce, not having discovered any indication of falsity in the entries.</p>
<p align="justify">Corpus Juris, vol. 22, pp. 867 and 868, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<em>Proof of Correctness of Accounts</em>.—In order to render 
books of account admissible, there must be a showing that the party kept clear 
and correct accounts, which showing must, it is generally held, be by the 
testimony of third persons who have dealt with him. It has been held further 
that the witness must be able to identify the books and to testify to 
settlements made from the books and based upon an examination of the items 
contained therein.</p>
<p align="justify">"<em>Form and Regularity of Accounts</em>—<em>In 
General</em>.—The entries must appear to have been made in the regular course of 
business and under such circumstances as to import trustworthiness, and the book 
must be in such shape that it may be presumed to be the register of the daily 
business transactions of the party offering it."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">With regard to Exhibit 8 suffice it to say that, being a public 
document there is nothing to stand in the way of its admission as evidence. In 
this exhibit the late Abraham Weill states, among other things, that the sole 
owner of the mercantile establishment, <em>La Estrella del Norte</em>, doing 
business under the name of <em>Levy Hermanos</em> is Mr. Rafael Levy, whose 
general attorney-in-fact was the declarant. Such statement completely destroys 
plaintiff's allegation that the late Abraham Weill was the chief and one of the 
partners of <em>La Estrella del Norte</em>.</p>
<p align="justify">Anent the ownership of the Kilayco property, which appears in 
plaintiff's Exhibit A and defendant's Exhibit 1, it is true that in this exhibit 
there is an entry in the current account of Abraham Weill, "expenses and account 
house Kilayco of P18,914.54;" but Mr. Schwab, a witness for the plaintiff, 
testified that this entry was erroneously made and that it was corrected by 
another entry of P19,000 to the credit of his account instead and this testimony 
was corroborated by the bookkeeper Fernando Ramirez. At all events it cannot be 
reasonably inferred from the fact that the entry of P18,914.54 was debited to 
Mr. Weill's account, that the Kilayco house was his property, and less so 
because in plaintiff's Exhibit B, which is the contract of sale of the same 
house by <em>Levy Hermanos, Inc.</em>, in favor of the spouses Francisco Lizares 
and Guillerma Alunan, it appears that said property is registered in the office 
of the registrar of deeds of the Province of Iloilo under certificate of title 
No. 3270. We presume that this certificate of title belongs to <em>Levy 
Hermanos, Inc.</em>, because otherwise the deed of sale, Exhibit B, could not 
have been registered, as it was, in volume 14, folio 129 of the book of transfer 
certificates as certificate No. 3367.</p>
<p align="justify">As has been said, the plaintiff claims the sum of P155,437 from 
the defendant, alleging that this sum was left by Mr. Abraham Weill at his death 
on deposit with the defendant. This aspect of the case was greatly simplified by 
the following agreement entered into by the parties: (1) That according to the 
ledger of 1914, it appears from page 68 of April 1, 1914 that there was a 
balance of P69,794.21 in favor of Abraham Weill; this sum was in Abraham Weill's 
current account with <em>Levy Hermanos</em> but not with the defendant <em>Levy 
Hermanos, Inc.</em>; and (2) that defendant <em>Levy Hermanos, Inc.</em>, admits 
that on January 31, 1922 there was a balance in favor of Abraham Weill of 
P9,490.87 and that when <em>Levy Hermanos, Inc.</em> was organized on February 
1, 1922, it took over this balance and so it is shown in its books.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the facts agreed upon by both parties, and as 
counsel for the appellant admits in its brief, the vouchers (?) Exhibits 5-A to 
5-S presented by the defendant firm, of the withdrawal of funds made by the 
deceased and his heirs, which covered the balance of P9,490.87 of which the 
defendant took charge on February 1, 1922, and it appearing, on the other hand, 
from Exhibit 6, that is, the current account of Abraham Weill with <em>Levy 
Hermanos</em>, that the sum of P69,794.21 which the former had in his favor on 
Aprilf 1, 1914 was reduced to P9,490.87 on January 31, 1922 by various drafts 
sent to Abraham Weill and for other reasons described in detail in said Exhibit 
6, it results that the sum claimed by the plaintiff has already been fully paid 
by the defendant, as was held by the trial court. It is true that the vouchers 
of the account shown in Exhibit 6 have not been presented at the trial; but this 
omission has been explained to the satisfaction of the court, for such omission 
was due to the loss of the vouchers by fire in Iloilo, which damaged the 
establishment of <em>La Estrella del Norte</em>. Furthermore, the defendant, 
according to the agreement of the parties, took charge of only the balance of 
P9,490.87 in favor of Mr. Weill, which existed when <em>Levy Hermanos, 
Inc.</em>, was organised on February 1, 1922, when Mr. Weill died. And it is 
unnecessary to add that <em>Levy Hermanos, Inc.</em>, a domestic partnership 
composed of various members is different from the firm <em>Levy Hermanos</em>, 
whose sole owner was Rafael Levy.</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from, being in accordance with law, must 
be, as it is hereby, affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p> <em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Ostrand, Johns,</em> and 
<em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
