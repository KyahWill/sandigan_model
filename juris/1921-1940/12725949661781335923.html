				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is now before the court upon a motion to dismiss the appeal. The 
order appealed from recites all the material facts and reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"This matter is before the court upon a motion dated October 6, 1920, filed 
by Pastor, Encarnacion, Paz, and Manuel, all surnamed Sause, as heirs of Julio 
Sause, praying that in conformity with the provisions of section 72 of Act No. 
496, the administrator of the intestate estate of Clara Amarmas be ordered to 
exhibit the duplicate of certificate of title No. 681 of lot 1298 of this 
cadastral record issued in the name of Clara Amarmas. It is alleged in the 
motion that during the lifetime of Clara Amarmas she sold ten hectares of this 
lot 1298 to Julio Sause, also deceased, with right of repurchase, and that the 
period of redemption having elapsed without the repurchase having been made, the 
heirs of the purchaser Julio Sause, deceased, wish to have such sale with right 
of repurchase noted on the said certificate of title, but the administrator of 
the deceased Clara Amarmas refuses to present the same.</p>
<p>"This motion was opposed by Mateo Payva, administrator of the estate of Clara 
Amarmas, deceased, on the ground that the heirs of the said deceased Julio Sause 
had presented to the committee on claims their claim for the debt of the 
deceased Clara Amarmas, which debt, it is alleged, was evidenced by a document 
in the form of a sale with right of repurchase, and on account of which the 
administrator has already paid the sum of P315; and that by the mere fact of the 
heirs of the said Julio Sause, deceased, having presented their claim, they have 
waived their right and elected to be included among the ordinary creditors and 
to participate in the general assets of the inheritance. In support thereof he 
cites the doctrine laid down in the case of Osorio <i>vs</i>. San Agustin (11 
Off. Gaz., November 5, 1913, p. 1862).</p>
<p>"The said motion was overruled by the court on November 1, 1920, on the 
ground that the heirs of Julio Sause have by waiver already lost the right 
claimed by them.</p>
<p>"The heirs of Julio Sause on December 11, 1920, petitioned the court that 
under the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure they be 
relieved from the effects of the order entered by this court on November 1, 
1920, and given an opportunity to present evidence showing that the claim before 
said committee in the proceeding for the settlement of the testate estate of 
Clara Amarmas had to do with another transaction and not with the contract of 
sale with right of repurchase, copy of which is attached to their motion of 
October 6, 1920.</p>
<p>"And after the filing of various pleadings of the administrator opposing this 
motion, of a reply of the heirs of Julio Sause, and answer of the administrator 
to said reply, the court on January 24, 1921, entered an order, setting aside 
the order dated November 1, 1920, in accordance with the provisions of section 
113 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and providing that the motion of the heirs 
of Julio Sause dated October 6, 1920, be set for hearing to give them an 
opportunity to prove the facts alleged in the said motion; and the matter having 
been set down for hearing in pursuance to this order on March 30, 1922, for the 
introduction of evidence, the following facts were established:</p>
<p>"That on July 8, 1916, Clara Amarmas executed a document of which Exhibit AA 
is a certified copy, whereby she sold with right of repurchase to Julio Sause, 
now deceased, his heirs and successors in interest, a parcel of land containing 
10 hectares, which forms a part of lot 1298 and is described in the said 
document, it having been stipulated that the redemption of the said land was to 
be made within 3 years from the said date, that is, July 8, 1919, by repaying 
the sum of P200, which was the purchase price, plus the expenses of the 
contract; that the heirs of Julio Sause presented to the committee on claims in 
the proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the deceased Clara Amarmas a 
claim for the sum of P200, based on this same deed of sale with right of 
repurchase; that no amount was paid from the estate of Clara Amarmas for the 
repurchase of the land mentioned in the deed, nor does it appear that any action 
was ever brought to effect such repurchase.</p>
<p>"The contention of the administrator now is that the heirs of Julio Sause 
having presented to the committee on claims a claim for the sum of P200 based on 
this deed of sale with right of repurchase, which sum of P200 is mentioned 
therein as the purchase price, such an act implies a waiver on the part of the 
said heirs of Julio Sause of their right under the sale with right of 
repurchase, and that thereby they became mere ordinary creditors of the estate 
of Clara Amarmas in the sum of P200. In support thereof the doctrine laid down 
in the case of Osorio <i>vs</i>. San Agustin, <i>supra</i>, is cited.</p>
<p>"In deciding this question, it should be noted in the first place that there 
is not, in the opinion of the court, any similarity between the present case and 
that cited by the administrator of the estate. In that case, the correct title 
of which is Osorio <i>vs</i>. Hernandez (11 Off. Gaz., November 5, 1913, p. 
1862) there was involved a mortgage debt which was first presented by the 
mortgage creditor to the committee on claims as such creditor and having failed 
to obtain payment of his credit, he later brought an ordinary action for the 
foreclosure of the mortgage. The Supreme Court held that having first presented 
his claim to the committee on claims, he has waived his right as a mortgage 
creditor, thus converting his credit into an ordinary one; whereas in the 
present case it is alleged that the claim was presented by one of the heirs of 
Julio Sause, deceased, so as to render the sale with right of repurchase made by 
the deceased Clara Amarmas in favor of Julio Sause, also deceased, more 
effective.</p>
<p>"It is proven that the period of redemption stipulated by and between the 
deceased Clara Amarmas, as seller, and the deceased Julio Sause, as purchaser, 
expired on July 8, 1919, approximately 15 months before the filing by the heirs 
of Julio Sause of the motion under consideration.</p>
<p>"And by virtue of the conclusive provision of the law, and of the precise 
terms of the deed of sale executed by the seller to the effect that 'if said 
period elapses without the right of redemption being exercised, this sale will 
become absolute and irrevocable' (verbatim), the expiration of the said period 
without the seller having exercised the right of redemption which she had 
reserved to herself operated the consolidation of the ownership of the buyer, 
Julio Sause, and, therefore, of his heirs over the property sold. And this 
property being the subject of a Torrens title, the movants are justified in 
asking for the relief prayed for in their motion, the provisions of section 72 
of Act No. 496 invoked by them.</p>
<p>"For the foregoing the motion is granted and it is ordered that the 
administrator of the estate of the deceased Clara Amarmas surrender the 
certificate of title of lot 1298 issued in favor of the deceased Clara Amarmas 
to the Registrar of Deeds of this Province of Occidental Negros for the purposes 
applied for in the motion in question.</p>
<p>"So ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>The administrator of the estate of Clara Amarmas filed a motion for a new 
trial, the motion was denied, and exception to ruling of the court noted, 
whereupon the appellant presented his hill of exceptions. Thereafter, the 
appellees filed a motion setting forth that the order in question was not 
appealable and asking that the appeal be denied and the bill of exceptions 
disapproved. This motion was denied by the court below, to which ruling the 
appellees excepted.</p>
<p>The appellees now renew in this court their motion for the dismissal of the 
appeal and maintain that the order appealed from having been issued upon a 
motion presented under section 72 of the Land Registration Act, it is not 
subject to appeal. The section referred to reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In every case where an attachment or other lien or adverse claim of any 
description is registered, and the duplicate certificate is not presented at the 
time of registration to the register of deeds, he shall within twenty-four hours 
thereafter send notice by mail to the registered owner, stating that such paper 
has been registered, and requesting him to send or produce the duplicate 
certificate in order that a memorandum of the attachment or other lien or 
adverse claim shall be made thereon. If the owner neglects or refuses to comply 
within a reasonable time, the register of deeds shall suggest the fact to the 
court, and the court, after notice, shall enter an order to the owner to produce 
his certificate at a time and place to be named therein, and may enforce the 
order by suitable process."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is some merit in the appellee's contention that orders requiring the 
holder of a duplicate certificate to surrender the same for the annotation of an 
attachment or other lien or adverse claim under the section quoted is not 
appealable, and if the order here in question were merely a routine order of 
that character, we might well agree with him. But the order in this instance 
goes much farther; it resolves important questions as to the respective rights 
of the parties, questions not definitely adjudicated previously to its issuance, 
and requires the surrender of the certificate of title for an operation which 
will carry with it, as a necessary consequence, the eventual cancellation of the 
surrendered certificate and the issuance of a new one in favor of a different 
owner. That an appeal may be taken to this court from such an order admits of no 
doubt.</p>
<p>The motion is therefore denied.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Street, Malcolm, 
Avanceña, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
