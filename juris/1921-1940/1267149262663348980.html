				<H3>CHUA GO, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On August 29, 1933, the board of special
inquiry of the Bureau of Customs, after conducting an investigation for
the purpose of determining whether or not the petitioner had the right
to remain in this country, recommended his deportation, having
discovered that he had succeeded in landing at this port, upon his
arrival from China on October 28, 1932, through false statements
relative to his filiation.
<p> The respondent, to whom the recommendation of the board of special
inquiry was submitted, after considering the evidence upon which said
board based its conclusions, and acting in conformity with the
aforesaid recommendation, ordered the arrest and deportation of the
petitioner.</p>
<p> To prevent his deportation, the petitioner appealed to the lower
court, demanding his release through habeas corpus proceedings. The
said court, after considering the evidence upon which the board of
special inquiry of the Bureau of Customs and the respondent based their
conclusions, held that the petitioner was really entitled to the remedy
sought by him and that the investigation conducted by the board in
question was held in "an irregular manner unjust to the petitioner" and
forthwith ordered his immediate release. The respondent appealed from
the above judgment and order of the trial court contending that said
court erred in ordering him to immediately release said petitioner.</p>
<p> The alleged irregularity in the investigation conducted against the
petitioner by the board of special inquiry, to which the trial court
refers, consists in the fact that when the petitioner's testimony was
taken, he was not assisted by counsel nor informed of the nature of the
investigation conducted against him, and that the testimony of Proceso
Estacio, husband of Gregoria Maria, the alleged mother of said
petitioner, was taken behind his back.</p>
<p> The evidence of record, which is the same as that considered by the
board of special inquiry of the Bureau of Customs, shows that when the
petitioner was summoned to appear before said board, he was clearly
informed of the purpose of the investigation then to be conducted and
was told that it was to require him to show cause, if any, why he
should not be deported to his country. The questions asked and warnings
given him for that purpose, and his answers thereto, are as follows:</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr valign="top">
    <td width="5%"><div align="center">"Q.</div></td>
    <td width="42%">You
are then hereby informed that you were arrested because you secured
landing into this country through false and fraudulent representations
and grant you this hearing in order to show cause, if any there be, why
you should not be deported from this country. Do you understand it now?</td>
    <td width="5%"><div align="center">—</div></td>
    <td width="5%"><div align="center">A. </div></td>
    <td width="43%">That is not true because I came here as a son of P. I. citizen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr valign="top">
    <td><div align="center">"Q.</div></td>
    <td>You
were given a landing certificate by error or omission. We are now going
to cancel this certificate and send you back to China. But before doing
so, we want to give you a chance to show that you are really a son of a
Filipina and are entitled to such certificate?</td>
    <td><div align="center">—</div></td>
    <td><div align="center">A.</div></td>
    <td>I
do not think that the Customhouse will make any mistake in granting me
that certificate. I have already answered those questions and there is
no use for me to answer any more."</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p> The foregoing shows that the petitioner-appellee's first contention
is unfounded. After he had been so notified and informed of the purpose
of the investigation, there is no doubt that it was incumbent upon him
to show cause, if any, why he should not be deported from the Islands.
The general rule established by Act No. 702 is that every Chinese
immigrant desiring to enter and reside in the Philippine Islands,
should prove that he is entitled to that privilege. The reason for this
is that the burden of proof rests upon the one who alleges a right.
Such was the situation in which the petitioner placed himself after he
had been informed that, unless he proved his right to remain in this
country, he would be deported to China. The petitioner, instead of
presenting evidence to show and convince the customs authorities that
he was entitled to remain in this country, preferred to remain silent,
confining his answer to the questions asked him by the board to the
statement that he had already declared everything at the former
investigation and that he did not want to say anything more. The
following questions which were asked him and the answers he gave
thereto, give an idea how the petitioner behaved during the
investigation:</p>

<p> The answers given by the petitioner tend to show that, because he
had already been investigated once upon his arrival in the Philippines
on October 28, 1932, and that as a result of said investigation a
certificate of residence had been issued to him, he cannot now be
deported, thereby implying that his certificate is in itself conclusive
evidence of his right to remain in this country. The question thus
raised by the petitioner-appellee is not new because it has already
been decided adversely by this court in the cases of Ong Liengco <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs (58 Phil., 554), and Villava <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs (58 Phil., 962) not to mention that of De Leon <em>vs.</em>
Collector of Customs (58 Phil., 579). Therefore, the fact that a
certificate of residence was issued to the petitioner in 1932, is not a
bar to his subsequent deportation to the place whence he came, if later
it is established that he is not an immigrant entitled to remain in the
Philippines, or that he succeeded in gaining admission to this country
through fraudulent means. (You Fook Hing <em>vs.</em> U. S., 214 Fed., 77; <em>Ex parte </em>Mac Fock, 207 Fed., 696; Lum Bing Wey <em>vs.</em> U. S. 201 Fed., 379; Pearson <em>vs.</em> Williams, 136 Fed., 734, 735; 202 U. S., 281.)</p>
<p> The contention that the petitioner-appellee was not informed of his
right to be assisted by counsel, and that Proceso Estacio's testimony
was taken behind his back, thus depriving him of the opportunity of
being confronted by and of cross-examining said witness, is of no
consequence, on the ground that such rights are recognized only in
criminal proceedings (sees. 17 and 15 of General Orders, No. 58); and
furthermore, it is a doctrine already established by this court that
deportation proceedings do not constitute a criminal action (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Yap Kin Co, 22 Phil., 340; U. S. <em>vs.</em> De-los Santos, 33 Phil., 397; Molden <em>vs.</em>
Collector of Customs, 34 Phil., 493). From the foregoing it follows
that there was no irregularity in the procedure followed by the board
of special inquiry of the Bureau of Customs in taking the
petitioner-appellee's testimony without assistance of counsel and that
of Proceso Estacio behind the petitioner's back especially when it is
taken into consideration that he made it understood at the second
investigation that he was not willing to say anything more than what he
had already stated at the first investigation. In view of the foregoing
and of the fact that, according to Proceso Estacio's testimony, his
wife Gregoria Maria, whom the petitioner claims to be his mother, never
had any Chinese son, and of the further fact that said woman's
testimony at the former investigation was false because she had never
lived at 553 P. Herrera Street, as she testified, nor has she a Chinese
husband nor is she the petitioner's mother, all of which show the
falsity of the statements made by the petitioner's witnesses during the
aforesaid former investigation, this court is convinced that neither
the board of special inquiry of the Bureau of Customs, nor the
Collector of Customs acted arbitrarily, the former in recommending, and
the latter in ordering the petitioner's deportation.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed, with the costs
against the petitioner, and it is hereby ordered that said petitioner
again be placed in the custody of the respondent. So ordered.<br>
    <br>
<em>Steeet, Villa-Real, Abas Santos, </em> and <em>Butte, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
