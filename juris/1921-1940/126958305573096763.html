				<H3>ESTATE OF THE DECEASED ISIDRA ABQUILAN.  ATANASIO ABQUILAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, <I>VS.</I> FELICIANA ABQUILAN, OPPONENT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to reverse an order of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Occidental Negros, refusing to&nbsp; legalize an instrument&nbsp; (Exhibit A) purporting to be the last will and testament of Isidra Abquilan, deceased.&nbsp; It appears that the deceased left no forced heirs, and her only heirs, in case of intestacy,&nbsp; are her brother, Atanasio Abquilan, the proponent of the will, and Feliciana Abquilan, a sister, who is the opponent.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; hearing the cause the&nbsp; trial court found that the document&nbsp; propounded&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; will of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; is apocryphal, that the purported&nbsp; signatures of the deceased to the supposed will are forgeries, and&nbsp; that the instrument in question was not executed by the deceased.&nbsp; He therefore denied probate, and the proponent appealed.<br><br>We have carefully examined&nbsp; the evidence, and upon repeated perusal of the appealed&nbsp; decision, we&nbsp; find that the conclusions of fact stated therein are&nbsp; so completely in harmony with&nbsp; our&nbsp; own view&nbsp; of the case,&nbsp; that&nbsp; no new exposition of the facts is necessary.&nbsp; A&nbsp; clear preponderance of the evidence shows that on November 6, 1924, the date when the will purports&nbsp; to have been executed, the supposed testatrix was&nbsp; not&nbsp; in a condition such as to&nbsp; enable her to have participated in the act, she being in fact&nbsp; at that time&nbsp; suffering&nbsp; from paralysis due to cerebral hemorrhage in&nbsp; such degree&nbsp; as&nbsp; completely&nbsp; to&nbsp; discapacitate her for intelligent participation in the act of making a&nbsp; will.&nbsp;&nbsp; A careful comparison of the name of the testatrix as signed in two places to the Exhibit A, with many of her authentic signatures leads to the conclusion that the signatures to the supposed will&nbsp; were made by some other&nbsp; person.&nbsp; Furthermore, the combined testimony of Juan Serato and Alejandro Genito completely demonstrate&nbsp; in our opinion that no will at all was&nbsp; made on November 6, the date attributed to the questioned document, and that, instead, an attempt was made on&nbsp; the&nbsp; night of&nbsp; that day to fabricate another will, which failed of completion because of the refusal of Alejandro Genito to be a party to the making&nbsp; of a will in which the testatrix took no part.&nbsp; The instrument before us was undoubtedly fabricated later, probably on November 7,&nbsp; at a time when the condition of the deceased was such as&nbsp; to make rational participation on her part in the act of making a will impossible.<br><br>The judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; will be affirmed, and&nbsp; it is so&nbsp; ordered, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C.J., Johnson, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur.<br></div>
