				<H3>ESTATE OF THE DECEASED PAULINO DIANCIN. TEOPISTA DOLAR, PROPONENT AND APPELLANT, VS. FIDEL DIANCIN ET AL., OPPOSITORS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justIFY"><p>The will of the deceased Paulino Diancin was denied probate in the Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo on the sole ground that the thumbmarks appearing 
thereon were not the thumbmarks of the testator. Disregarding the other errors 
assigned by the proponent of the will, we would direct attention to the third 
error which challenges squarely the correctness of this finding.</p>
<p>The will in question is alleged to have been executed by Paulino Diancin at 
Dumangas, Iloilo, on November 13, 1927. A thumbmark appears at the end of the 
will and on the left hand margin of each of its pages in the following manner: 
"Paulino Diancin, Su Signo, Por Pedro Diamante.' The witnesses to the will were 
the same Pedro Diamajite, Inocentes Deocampo, and Juan Dominado. The will is 
detailed in nature, and disposes of an estate amounting approximately to 
P50,000.</p>
<p>For comparative purposes, Exhibit 8, a document of sale containing an 
admittedly genuine thumbmark of Paulino Diancin, was presented. Photographs of 
the thumbmarks on the will and of the thumbmark. on Exhibit 8 were also offered 
in evidence. One, Carlos J. Jaena, attempted to qualify as an "expert," and 
thereafter gave as his opinion that the thumbmjarks had not been made by the 
same person. One, Jose G. Villanueva, likewise attempted to qualify as an 
"expert" and gave as his opinion that the thumbmarks were authentic. The 
petition of the proponent of the will to permit the will to be sent to Manila to 
be examined by an expert was denied. On one fact only were the opposing 
witnesses agreed, and this was that the ink used to make the thumbmarks on the 
will was of the ordinary type which blurred the characteristics of the marks, 
whereas the thumbmark on Exhibit 8 was formed clearly by the use of the special 
ink required for this purpose. The trial judge expressed his personal view as 
being that great differences existed between the questioned marks and the 
genuine mark.</p>
<p>The requirement of the statute that the will shall be "signed" is satisfied 
not only by the customary written signature but also by the testator's or 
testatrix' thumbmark. Expert testimony as to the identity of thumbmarks or 
fingerprints is of course admissible. The method of identification of 
fingerprints is a science requiring close study. Where thumb impressions are 
blurred and many of the characteristic! marks far from clear, thus rendering it 
difficult to trace the features enumerated by experts as showing the identity or 
lack of identity of the impressions, the court is justified in refusing to 
accept the opinions of alleged experts and in substituting its own opinion that 
a distinct similarity in some respects between the admittedly genuine thumbmark 
and the questioned thumbmarks, is evident. This we do here. (Emperor <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Abdul 
Hamid [1905], 32 Indian L. Rep., 759, cited in 3 Chamberlayne on the Modern Law 
of Evidence, sec. 2561, note 3.)</p>
<p>There is another means of approach to the question and an obvious one. The 
three instrumental witnesses united in testifying concerning the circumstances 
surrounding the execution of the will. It was stated that in addition to the 
testator and themselves, one other person, Diosdado Dominado, was present. This 
latter individual was called as a witness by the oppositors to the will to 
identify Exhibit 8. He was later placed on the witness stand by the proponent on 
rebuttal, and thereupon declared positively that he was the one who prepared the 
will for the signature of Paulino Diancin; that the thumbmarks appearing on the 
will were those of Paulino Diancin, and that he saw Paulino Diancin make these 
impressions. The testimony of a witness called by both parties is worthy of 
credit.</p>
<p>We reach the very definite conclusion that the document presented for probate 
as the last will of the deceased Paulino Diancin was, in truth, his will, and 
that the thumbmarks appearing thereon were the thumbmarks of the testator. 
Accordingly, error is found, which means that the judgment appealed from must 
be, as it is hereby, reversed, and the will ordered admitted to probate, without 
special finding as to costs in this instance.</p>
