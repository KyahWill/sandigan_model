				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Victorias Milling Co., Inc., operating a Sugar Central within the 
jurisdiction of the municipality of Victorias, Province of Occidental Negros, 
organized a premium contest for the most efficient production of sugar among 
those of its affiliated planters who desired to take part therein for the 
milling season of 1926-1927, and strict rules for conducting the contest were 
formulated. These rules were reduced to writing and agreed to by the 
competitors.
<p>Article No. 8 of said rules established an absolute prohibition against the 
delivery of sugar cane from one hacienda in the name of another, even if both 
plantations belonged to the same owner, and provided that a single violation of 
the said article No. 8 would be sufficient to disqualify the competitor in the 
present and future contests of the same kind which the central might organize in 
the district.</p>
<p>Article No. 13 of the rules provided that the management or administration of 
the central should act as referee, among the contestants, with the power to 
declare the winners in the three groups of plantations, described in article 10 
of the rules, upon computation of the various points established in accordance 
with the conditions stated in articles 9 and 10 of said rules. The latter 
article divided the competing plantations in three groups: Plantations of from 
15 to 50 hectares were classified as group (a); plantations of from 51 to 99 
hectares were placed in group (b); and plantations with a planted area of 100 
hectares or more formed group (c). Article 11 of the rules fixed the premium for 
group (a) at P1,000, the premium for group (b) at P5,000, and the premium for 
group (c) at P10,000.</p>
<p>The herein plaintiff, Ruperto Montinola, was the owner of four plantations, 
"Nasipunan," "Fe," "Maria Luisa," and "Toreno," and he entered the "Nasipunan" 
in group (c) and the "Fe" in group (b).</p>
<p>Previously to the award of the premiums, the manager of the Sugar Central, 
upon discoveringi certain unexplained irregularities in the train reports 
covering cane deliveries from the plantations "Nasipunan," "Fey and "Maria 
Luisa," directed the chemist, Carlos L. Locsin, to make an investigation of the 
matter. The chemist carried out the investigation and reported the results to 
the Manila office of the company, where the acting president, Jesus J. Ossorio, 
had his headquarters. Ossorio came to Negros and made an additional 
investigation, and after returning to Manila, he addressed a communication to 
the Victorias office of the central ordering the manager to disqualify the 
plaintiff's plantations and stating that the central was bound to strictly apply 
the rules of the contest notwithstanding the suggestion of Locsin that to avoid 
the disqualification, the plantations "Nasipunan," "Fe," and "Maria Luisa" might 
be considered as one in view of the fact that they were contiguous to each 
other. After having so disqualified said plantations, the prize for group (c) 
was adjudicated to Francis J. Cooper, and the prize for group (b) to Irineo V. 
Lapres. Being dissatisfied with the results, the plaintiff brought two actions, 
one against the Victorias Milling Co., Inc., and Francis J. Cooper and the other 
against the Victorias Milling Co. and Irineo V. Lapres.</p>
<p>The sum and substance of the complaints in the two cases is that the 
plaintiff had the largest production of sugar in plantation groups Nos. (b) and 
(c) and was entitled to the prizes or premiums offered by the Victorias Milling 
Co., but that he was deprived of his right to said premiums through the fraud of 
the manager of the central, C. J. H. Penning, and that the disqualification of 
the plaintiff was unjust and illegal. He therefore prayed that he be declared 
entitled to the premiums and that the Victorias Milling Co. and the defendant 
Francis J. Cooper be ordered to jointly and severally pay the sum of P10,000 
with legal interest and that the Victorias Milling Co. and Irineo V. Lapres be 
ordered to jointly and severally pay the sum of P5,000 with interest. The 
defendants, the Victorias Milling Co. and Irineo Lapres, demurred on the ground 
that the complaint did not set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of 
action and that the court had no jurisdiction over the case. The demurrers were 
overruled and all of the defendants filed their answers to the complaint.</p>
<p>The two cases were tried together, and in a lengthy decision, the court below 
rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in accordance with the prayers in 
the complaints. From that judgment the defendants appealed to this court in 
their respective cases. </p>
<p>The cases in question are of first impression in this jurisdiction, and we 
have been unable to find any other cases exactly in point. But by applying the 
principles governing the adjudication of rewards in general, the rights of the 
parties are readily determine.</p>
<p>The basis of the right to a reward is in the nature of a contract and rests 
on one side upon a valid offer and on the other side upon an acceptance of such 
offer, including its terms and conditions. (34 Cyc., 1731.) In competitive 
contests for reward, the acceptance must be in strict conformity with the offer, 
and a qualified acceptance does not create a contract. The offerer of the reward 
may make his offer subject to any legal condition he may see fit, and all 
conditions so imposed will be material elements of the offer and contract. 
(Shuey vs. U. S., 92 U. S., 697; Amis vs. Conner, 43 Ark., 337; Williams vs. 
West Chicago Street Eailway Co., 191 111., 610; Jones vs. Phoenix Bank, 8 N. Y., 
228.)</p>
<p>The Victorias Milling Co. laid down clear and comprehensive terras and 
conditions for the competitive reward, and the plaintiff was furnished a copy of 
the rules embracing said terms and conditions. Article No. 13 of said rules 
reads as follows:</p> <blockquote>"13. Those who get the highest average in groups (a), (b), and (c), article 
10, as computed on the foregoing basis, shall be adjudged the winners of this 
contest by the management of this Central."</blockquote><p></p>
<p>The article quoted is perhaps somewhat awkwardly worded, and the plaintiff 
maintains that it did not give the management of the defendant company the power 
to disqualify any of the contestants, but taking into consideration the context, 
it is, in our opinion, evident that the management of the central was in effect 
the referee of the contest and, if so, it had the power to enforce the 
provisions of article 8 as well as the other clauses of the rules. In the 
absence of fraud or bad faith on the part of a referee, his findings of facts 
will not be disturbed by the courts unless he has misinterpreted the terms and 
conditions of the contest. In the instant cases there was no such 
misinterpretation.</p>
<p>But the plaintiff maintains that the award made by the referee was made 
fraudulently and in bad faith. With the exception of a few insinuations, we can 
find nothing in the record supporting that contention; on the contrary, it 
appears that the fraud, if any, was committed by the other side. Penning, the 
manager of the Victorias office of the central, testified that the laboratory of 
the central submitted to him periodical milling reports which, among other 
things, showed the areas milled and the yield per hectare; that in the last six 
weeks, certain changes in the yield per hectare of the plantations "Nasipunan," 
"Fe," and "Maria Luisa" were discovered in the reports and his attention was 
called to the fact that although the "Maria Luisa" plantation ordinarily was the 
best of the three and the one which always obtained the highest averages, it 
then showed large reductions in its production and that, on the other hand, the 
plantations "Fe" and "Nasipunan" had greatly increased their normal yield; that 
while on July 2d the "Nasipunan" plantation had an average production of 80.9 
piculs per hectare, which was more or less the average of the harvest up to that 
time, the 16.42 hectares harvested between July 2d and September 3d produced an 
average of 150.9 piculs per hectare. On the other hand, the average on July 2d 
from the "Maria Luisa" plantation was 72 piculs per hectare, considerably less 
than the usual average on that plantation, but of the 5.31 hectares harvested 
between July 2d and September 3d, the plantation produced only 3.7 piculs per 
hectare.</p>
<p>Such abnormal changes in the production of the two plantations indicated that 
cane had been taken from the non-contesting plantation, "Maria Luisa," and 
credited to the contesting plantation, "Nasipunan," and upon investigation it 
was found that such was the case.</p>
<p>That the plaintiff did not personally bring about these irregularities may 
well be conceded; in all probability, the hired administrator of the 
plantations, Cecilio Jereza, was responsible therefor. But that does not alter 
the case; the fact remains that cane from two or more plantations was in part 
commingled, and such plantations were consequently barred from entry into the 
final contest and from participation by the owner in the distribution of the 
rewards. The object of the rule prohibiting the delivery of cane from one 
plantation in the name of a contesting plantation is obvious; if such a thing 
had been permitted, it would have been practically impossible to accurately 
determine the relative production of each separate plantation.</p>
<p>No fraud, bad faith, or misinterpretation on the part of the 
defendants-appellants having been established by the evidence, the appealed 
judgments are, hereby reversed, and the cases are dismissed upon the merits. 
Without costs. So ordered.</p><i>Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez </i>and<i> Villa-Real, JJ</i>.,
