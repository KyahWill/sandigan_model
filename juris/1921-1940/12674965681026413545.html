appellants were sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Ilocos
Norte for the crime of adultery to three years, six months and
twenty-one days of <em>prision correccional</em> and appealed to this
court, assigning the following error: "The court below erred in not
holding that the offended husband consented to the adultery committed
by his wife Ursula Sensano in that he refused to live with her after
she extinguished her previous sentence for the same offense, and by
telling her then that she could go where she wanted to and do what she
pleased, and by his silence for seven years notwithstanding that he was
informed of said adultery."
  <p>  The facts briefly stated are as follows:</p>
  <p>
Ursula Sensano and Mariano Ventura were married on April 29, 1919. They
had one child. Shortly after the birth of this child, the husband left
his wife to go to the Province of Cagayan where he remained for three
years without writing to his wife or sending her anything for the
support of herself and their son. Poor and illiterate, without
relatives upon whom she could call, she struggled for an existence for
herself and her son until a fatal day when she met the accused Marcelo
Ramos who took her and the child to live with him. On the return of the
husband (in 1924), he filed a charge against his wife and Marcelo Ramos
for adultery and both were sentenced to four months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>.
The court, in its decision, stated the following: "In the opinion of
the court, the husband of the accused has been somewhat cruel in his
treatment of his wife, having abandoned her as he did." After
completing her sentence, the accused left her paramour. She thereupon
appealed to the municipal president and the justice of the peace to
send for her husband so that she might ask his pardon and beg him to
take her back. At the house of the president she begged his pardon and
promised to be a faithful wife if he would take her back. He refused to
pardon her or to live with her and said she could go where she wished,
that he would have nothing more to do with her, and she could do as she
pleased. Abandoned for the second time, she and her child went back to
her coaccused Marcelo Ramos (this was in the year 1924) and they have
lived with him ever since. The husband, knowing that she resumed living
with her codefendant in 1924, did nothing to interfere with their
relations or to assert his rights as husband. Shortly thereafter he
left for the Territory of Hawaii where he remained for seven years
completely abandoning his said wife and child. On his return to these
Islands, he presented the second charge of adultery here involved with
the sole purpose, as he declared, of being able to obtain a divorce
under the provisions of Act No. 2710.</p>
  <p>    Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code, paragraphs 1 and 2, are as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<em>Prosecution of the crimes of adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape and acts of lasciviousness</em>.â€”The crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended spouse.</p>
    <p>"The
offended party cannot institute criminal prosecution without including
both the guilty parties, if they are both alive, nor, in any case, if
he shall have consented or pardoned the offenders."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Apart from the fact that the husband in this case was assuming a mere
pose when he signed the complaint as the "offended" spouse, we have
come to the conclusion that the evidence in this case and his conduct
warrant the inference that he consented to the adulterous relations
existing between the accused and therefore he is not authorized by law
to institute this criminal proceeding.</p>
  <p> We cannot accept the
argument of the Attorney-General that the seven years of acquiescence
on his part in the adultery of his wife is explained by his absence
from the Philippine Islands during which period it was impossible for
him to take any action against the accused. There is no merit in the
argument that it was impossible for the husband to take any action
against the accused during the said seven years.</p>
