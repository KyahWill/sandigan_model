				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Antonino Espiritu and Felix Tuason brought separate actions for 
damages against the Manila Electric Co. for personal injuries sustained by them 
in a head-on collision between two street cars belonging to the defendant 
company and operating on the company's Manila-Pasig line. The actions are based 
on identical facts and were tried together. The trial court rendered judgment in 
favor of the defendant corporation and absolved it from the complaints without 
costs. From this judgment both of the plaintiffs appealed. 
<p align="justify">The collision was due to negligence, and the plaintiffs were 
passengers on one of the cars at the time. They were, therefore, clearly 
entitled to compensation for the injuries sustained by them (De Guia vs. Manila 
Electric Railroad &amp; Light Co., 40 Phil., 706), and the only question for our 
consideration is whether certain agreements made between the parties in the 
evening of the day the accident occurred are binding on the plaintiffs. Briefly 
stated, the facts relating to this question are as follows: </p>
<p align="justify">The accident occurred near Fort McKinley. Antonino Espiritu, 
seeing that the collision was inevitable, jumped out of the car in which he was 
riding and fractured one of the bones in his left leg. Felix Tuason was thrown 
down on the floor of the car and broke his left collar bone. Both of them were 
taken to Fort McKinley for emergency treatment and shortly afterwards 
transferred to St. Paul's Hospital in Manila, where they were placed under 
treatment at the expense of the defendant. In the evening of the same day, the 
plaintiffs were visited by Feliciano P. Santiago, a representative of the 
defendant corporation and after some conversation, Espiritu agreed to accept the 
sum of P300 in full compensation for his injuries and signed the following 
document: </p>
<p align="center">"MANILA ELECTRIC RAILROAD AND LIGHT COMPANY </p>
<p align="center">"GENERAL AND SPECIAL RELEASE </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I hereby acknowledge the receipt from the Manila Electric 
Railroad and Light Company, of three hundred pesos, Philippine currency, in full 
settlement of all claims and demands and rights of actions which I may have 
against the said Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company, its officers or 
employees, and specifically in settlement of all damages and in injuries 
sustained by me either in person or property, on the 25th day of December, 1926, 
in Manila, Philippine Islands, at or near Pasig Line at McKinley. </p>
<p align="justify">"And in consideration of said sum I hereby release and 
discharge the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company its officers or 
employees, from all obligations now existing or that may hereafter arise in my 
favor by reason of the said damages and injuries by me sustained on the 25th day 
of December, 1926. </p>
<p align="justify">"I have read and understood the foregoing release, and signed 
the same this 25th day of December, 1926. </p>
<blockquote>

</p>
<p align="left">"Witness:<br>"(Sgd.) FEL. SANTIAGO" </p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote>
</blockquote></div></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Felix Tuason accepted the sum of P140 and signed a document of 
the same purport as that signed by Espiritu, but, as he was not well versed in 
the English language, the document was written in Tagalog. The money was paid 
over to the plaintiifs the same evening. </p>
<p align="justify">Counsel argues that the appellants, through fraud and deceit, 
were induced to enter into the agreements without being fully cognizant of the 
consequences, and that therefore said agreements are of no force and effect. The 
agreements rest on the same principles as any ordinary contract, and if the 
plaintiffs' assertions that such agreements were obtained by fraud and deceit 
and that they, the plaintiffs, were in such a condition that they were not fully 
conscious of what they were doing, the agreements would, of course, be invalid. 
But the weight of the evidence is contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, and we 
can find no indication of fraud. Neither can we say that the agreements were so 
unconscionable as to affect their validity. While the amounts agreed upon may 
seem inadequate, it nevertheless appears that they are in excess of what the 
plaintiffs, if uninjured, could have earned in the length of time required for 
the healing of their injuries in the present case. </p>
<p align="justify">We therefore hold that the plaintiffs are bound by their 
respective agreements, and the appealed judgment is affirmed, with the costs 
against the appellants. So ordered. </p>
