				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for a writ of
certiorari filed by the petitioners, for the purpose of setting aside
the orders entered by the respondent judge on November 29, 1933, July
31, 1934, requiring them, together with other persons, by means of the
writ of preliminary injunction issued therein, to refrain from
interfering with the possession enjoyment of certain portions included
within the <em>Hacienda del Progreso</em> from gathering therefrom the
unharvested palay, finding them other individuals guilty of contempt
for having violated the terms of said writ of preliminary injunction,
ordering them each to pay a fine of P50, with corresponding subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency.
<p> In l registration case No. 2727 of the Court of First Instance of
Nueva Ecija, G. L. R. O. Record No. 47721, the respondent Crispulo
Sideco applied for the registration of his title to the <em>Hacienda del Progreso</em>,
together with the improvements thereon, alleging that he iS the owner
thereof. The herein petitioners many other persons who likewise alleged
themselves to be the owners of the portions improvements of which they
were in actual possession which are included within said hacienda,
filed opposition to the registration. While said application the
oppositions thereto were pending hearing while the title to said
hacienda still remained undetermined unadjudicated, the respondent
Sideco filed a motion praying for the issuance against the petitioners
many other persons of a writ of preliminary injunction for the purpose
of restraining them from interfering with the possession of the entire
hacienda from gathering the unharvested palay. After objections thereto
had been filed by the petitioners, the court issued the writ of
preliminary injunction prayed for. The petitioners their co-oppositors
vainly prayed for the reconsideration dissolution of the injunction,
for, their motions were denied. A commissioner was appointed to inspect
the hacienda he reported that the petitioners their co-oppositors
indicated the portions claimed by them together with the unharvested
crop that they, as well as the respondent Sideco, claimed ownership of
the unharvested palay which was sown by various different tenants.
Later, the same respondent Sideco filed another motion charging the
herein petitioners other individuals with contempt, having violated the
terms of the injunction. After due hearing during which the court made
an ocular inspection, the petitioners one Santiago Garcia were found
guilty of contempt were each sentenced to pay a fine of P50, with
corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. The other
co-defendants were acquitted. The petitioners filed a motion for
reconsideration of the latter order but the same was denied.</p>
<p> Contrary to the claim of the petitioners, the respondent judge had
jurisdiction to issue the writ of preliminary injunction, the
dissolution of which is one of the purposes of the present petition.
Section 17 of Act No. 496, as amended by section 3 of Act No. 1680,
grants him such authority. The latter Act has not been entirely
repealed by the final section (<em>b</em>) of Act No. 2711 its
amendments (Revised Administrative Code), as the petitioners contend.
Only section 1 of said Act, which certainly has nothing to do with the
power to grant a writ of injunction, is repealed.</p>
<p> Finding that the respondent judge had authority to issue the
injunction, the only question left to be decided is whether or not he
acted in excess of such authority in issuing the writ of preliminary
injunction, in holding the herein petitioners guilty of contempt, in
sentencing them for such offense to pay the fine above stated.</p>
<p> It is a well established doctrine in this jurisdiction that an
injunction is not the proper remedy for the recovery of possession of
real estate the improvement's thereon, as well as for the ejectments
therefrom of the actual occupants who claim to have title to or
material interest therein. The use of said remedy in such cases has
invariably been considered unjustified, in open violation of the legal
presumption that the <em>bona fide</em> possessor of a certain piece
of l the improvements thereon, holds the same under claim of ownership
with a just title, as an advanced concession of the remedy to which the
claimant might be entitled. (Asombra <em>vs.</em> Dorado  Gesmundo, 36 Phil., 883 ; Golding <em>vs.</em> Balatbat, 36 Phil., 941;  Rustia <em>vs.</em>
Franco, 41 PhiL, 280.) There is not the least doubt that the
petitioners, by themselves or their tenants, were in actual possession
of the portions claimed by them together with the improvements crops
thereon, inasmuch as such fact is shown by the report of the
commissioner by the circumstance that their tenants were likewise
charged with contempt for disobedience to the injunction. If, as
claimed by respondent Sideco, they were his tenants, or if they acted
as his agents, it cannot be understood why they were prohibited from
entering the from harvesting the palay sown by them finally punished
for contempt.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the remedy applied for is granted , with respect to the
herein petitioners, the orders dated November 29, 1933 July 31, 1934,
are hereby set aside, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this
court is declared final, with costs against the respondent Sideco. So
ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Butte, </em><em> Goddard, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
