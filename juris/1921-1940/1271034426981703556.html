<p align="center">STATEMENT</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">After the formal pleas, plaintiff alleges:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I. That it is a corporation organized and existing by virtue 
of the laws of the Philippine Islands, with its principal office in the City of 
Manila, Philippine Islands;</p>
<p align="justify">"II. That the defendant is the Insular Collector of Internal 
Revenue;</p>
<p align="justify">"III. That on May 4, 1923, the plaintiff and the Neuss, 
Hesslein Corporation, which is also a corporation organized and existing by 
virtue of the laws of the Philippine Islands, with its principal office in the 
City of Manila and branches established in the municipalities of Cebu and 
Iloilo, Provinces of Cebu and Iloilo, respectively, executed an agreement in 
writing by virtue of which the plaintiff secured to said Neuss, Hesslein 
Corporation that the managers of the branches of said Neuss, Hesslein 
Corporation in the municipalities of Cebu and Iloilo shall faithfully comply 
with their duties as such managers;</p>
<p align="justify">"IV. That in consideration of the aforesaid security given by 
the plaintiff in favor of the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation, the latter binding 
itself to pay to plaintiff a compensation of a certain per cent upon the 
merchandise sold by the said managers of the branches of the Neuss, Hesslein 
Corporation at Cebu and Iloilo, Provinces of Cebu and Iloilo, respectively;</p>
<p align="justify">"V. That in or about the month of November, 1924, and 
subsequent to said month and year, the defendant, through his agents duly 
authorized in the Provinces of Cebu and Iloilo, alleging that the plaintiff is, 
by virtue of the agreement had between it and the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation 
mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this complaint, a commission merchant, 
collected from the plaintiff the tax upon the sales made by the managers of the 
branches of the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation at Cebu and Iloilo, to wit:</p>
<p align="justify">"Iloilo ....................................................................... 
P5,002.41</p>
<p align="justify">"Cebu 
........................................................................ 
4,957.78</p>
<p align="justify">that is a total of P9,960.19 which the plaintiff paid said 
defendant under protest in writing.</p>
<p align="justify">"VI. That on December 13, 1925, the defendant overruled the 
protest of the plaintiff, and has refused and still refuses to refund to the 
plaintiff said sum of P9,960.19 or any part thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the plaintiff respectfully prays this Honorable 
Court that judgment be rendered ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the 
sum of P9,960.19, with legal interest and the costs of this action. It prays, 
further, for such further other remedies as may be proper in justice and 
equity."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">To which the defendant filed the following answer and special 
defense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The defendant, for his answer, alleges:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. That he admits the allegations contained in paragraphs 1, 
2, 5 and 6 of the complaint; and</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That he denies each and everyone of the other allegations 
of the complaint.</p>
<p align="center">"SPECIAL DEFENSE </p>
<p align="justify">"As special defense, the defendant alleges:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. That the plaintiff company acted as commission merchant in 
regard to the transactions upon which was imposed and collected by the defendant 
the sum claimed in the complaint."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Later, the parties stipulated the following facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The undersigned, counsel for the plaintiff and the defendant 
herein, hereby agree and stipulate that the following facts be considered by the 
court as proven without the introduction of evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">"I. That the plaintiff is a corporation duly organized, 
registered, and doing business under the laws of the Philippine Islands, with 
its principal office in the City of Manila and with branches in the City of 
Cebu, Province of Cebu, and in the City of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo; and that 
the defendant is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting Collector of Internal 
Revenue of the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p align="justify">"II. That the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation is a corporation duly 
organized, registered, and doing business under the laws of the Philippine 
Islands, with its principal office in the City of Manila, and branches in Iloilo 
and Cebu.</p>
<p align="justify">"III. That Walter Meyer and O. Schulthess, acting as agents for 
Neuss, Hesslein Corporation, according to the plaintiff, or the plaintiff 
itself, according to the defendant, during the month of November, 1924, and 
thereafter sold in the Cities of Cebu and Iloilo goods, wares, and merchandise 
in such an amount that applying the rate of the percentage tax thereon, the 
latter is as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"Cebu 
........................................................................ 
P4,957.78</p>
<p align="justify">"Iloilo ....................................................................... 
5,002.41 or a total of P9,960.19.</p>
<p align="justify">"IV. The defendant herein claiming that the sales referred to 
in the preceding paragraph were made by the plaintiff acting as a commission 
merchant for the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation as principal, levied and assessed 
thereon as percentage tax the sum of P9,960.19, above mentioned and demanded of 
the plaintiff to pay said amount, which plaintiff paid under written 
protest.</p>
<p align="justify">"V. That the plaintiff has demanded from the defendant the 
refund of said amount, but the defendant refused and still refuses to make the 
refund thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">"Reservation.—The parties herein reserve the right to present 
evidence on all points and matters not covered by the above agreed statement of 
facts, which may be material to the present case."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In addition to which, H. Gassel, the Vice-President of the 
plaintiff, was called and testified as a witness for the plaintiff. Upon his 
testimony and the stipulated facts, the lower court rendered judgment for the 
plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. On appeal the defendant contends 
that the trial court erred in holding that the plaintiff did not act as a 
commission merchant, and in denying defendant's motion for a new trial.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>JOHNS, J.: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">It appears from the testimony of Mr. Gassel, Vice-President of 
the plaintiff, that it had an arrangement with Neuss, Hesslein, a foreign 
corporation, to represent it in Cebu and Iloilo, and that the sales taxes on all 
of such sales were paid by that corporation, and that later the defendant 
demanded from the plaintiff the payment of another and a different tax, which 
was paid under protest. That O. Schulthess and Mr. Meyer were the agents of the 
plaintiff, and that "they were made by the two agents in Iloilo and Cebu, but 
they were agents of Neuss, Hesslein Corporation; the two agents were 
representatives of Neuss, Hesslein Corporation," and that the offices of the two 
firms "were in the same house but they had separate offices," and that the books 
of the two agencies were kept separately, and that the sales made by the two 
agents were also made separately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Q. How are the orders obtained by your agency?—A. When any of 
the agencies asked for goods, they ordered them directly from the Neuss, 
Hesslein Corporation and F. E. Zuellig, Inc."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On cross-examination, the witness testified that Meyer and 
Schulthess were the agents at Cebu of both the plaintiff and the Neuss, Hesslein 
Corporation, and that the expenses of the branch of the office at that place 
were paid by the plaintiff, and that it received "a commission to pay for the 
expenses and gain something."</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Q. Did not Walter Meyer and O. Schulthess receive any 
commission from the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation for the sales mentioned in the 
complaint?—A. They themselves know; the commission pertaining to them was 
transferred to the firm of F. E. Zuellig, because the firm of F. E. Zuellig paid 
the expenses.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. You said that the firm of F. E. Zuellig, Inc., receives a 
certain commission from Neuss, Hesslein Corporation; in what does that 
commission consist?—A. The commission consists in a certain per cent upon the 
sale, for instance, 5 per cent or 3 per cent.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. And why is that commission given?—A. As F. E. Zuellig, 
Inc., paid all the expenses, the commission was a compensation to cover those 
expenses and to gain something if there is any gain."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In answer to the question as to why that commission was paid, 
the witness testified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"A. This arrangement was made to the effect that F. E. Zuellig, 
Inc., should represent Neuss, Hesslein Corporation in Iloilo and Cebu, because 
from the beginning it was seen that to maintain two separate offices with all 
the expenses also separate would be a failure, would be a loss, that is why we 
combined the two houses; that is to say, we already had or F. E. Zuellig already 
had his office with all his employees, and as Neuss, Hesslein Corporation saw 
that it was impossible to do business in Iloilo and Cebu through a 
representative with employees on account of the great expenses to be made, such 
as the payment of the rent of the house and the salaries of the employees, and 
as we already had our office and our employees, so that combination was made, 
giving us a certain commission for our labor and our expenses and especially for 
the labor of our agency.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. For the labor of whom?—A. Of the agent.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. But those gentlemen Messrs. Walter Meyer and O. Schulthess 
are agents of F. E. Zuellig, are they not?—A. At the same time.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. What do you mean by that?—A. They are agents of F. E. 
Zuellig, Inc., and at the same time agents of Neuss, Hesslein 
Corporation."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">From which it appears that the goods, wares and merchandise of 
the foreign corporation were shipped to, and delivered in, the <em>bodega</em> 
of the plaintiff at Cebu, and when sold they were distributed from its warehouse 
to the purchasers. That Schulthess and Meyer were the agents of both the 
plaintiff and the Neuss, Hesslein Corporation, and that for such sales, the 
plaintiff received a commission of from 3 to 5 per cent of the amount of such 
sales.</p>
<p align="justify">Among other things, section 1459 of the Administrative Code 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">" 'Merchant,' as here used, means a person engaged in the sale, 
barter, or exchange of personal property of whatever character. Except as 
specially provided, the term includes manufacturers who sell articles of their 
own production and commission merchants having establishments of their own for 
the keeping and disposal of goods of which sales or exchanges are effected, but 
does not include merchandise brokers."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the instant case, the record is conclusive that the 
plaintiff had an establishment of its own in Cebu for the keeping and disposal 
of goods of which sales or exchanges were effected. As stated, the plaintiff was 
the owner of the <em>bodega</em> in which the goods, wares and merchandise were 
received, stored and kept, and from and out of which they were delivered by the 
agents, to the different purchasers to whom the sales were made, and for and on 
account of which sales, the plaintiff received a commission ranging from 3 to 5 
per cent.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the admitted facts, we are clearly of the opinion that as 
to the transactions in question, the plaintiff was a commission merchant within 
the meaning of the provisions of section 1459 above quoted. It had an 
establishment of its own for the keeping and disposal of the goods of the Neuss, 
Hesslein Corporation, from and out of Which the sales were made. This 
construction is materially strengthened by section 1453 of the Administrative 
Code which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<em>Privilege taxes on business and occupation</em>.—A 
privilege tax must be paid before any business or occupation hereinafter 
specified can be lawfully began or pursued. The tax on business is payable for 
every separate or distinct establishment or place where business subject to the 
tax is conducted; and one occupation or line of business does not become exempt 
by being conducted with some other occupation or business for which such tax has 
been paid."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the final analysis and upon the stipulated facts, the 
plaintiff was a commission merchant as to the sales in question and had a 
<em>bodega</em> of its own for the keeping and disposal of the goods from which 
the sales were made. It is true that upon such facts one sale only was made, but 
it is also true that such sales were made by and through the plaintiff as a 
commission merchant upon the terms and conditions specified and defined in 
section 1459 above quoted.</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and one will be 
entered here for the defendant, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</em> and 
<em>Villa-Real, JJ.</em>, concur.<br><em>Johnson, J.</em>, reserves his 
vote.</p></div>
