<p>Enrique Echaus delivered the first of these three promissory notes to the 
plaintiff by means of the following endorsement:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Pay to the order of the Philippine Trust Company. Manila, Jan. 4th, 1924.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">"ENRIQUE ECHAUS"</p></blockquote>
<p>The second note was also delivered by the following endorsement:</p> <blockquote>"THE VISAYAN GENERAL SUPPLY CO., INC.<p></p><div style="text-align: right;"> "ENRIQUE ECHAUS<br>"<em>President</em>"</div></blockquote><p></p>
<p>Enrique Echaus, in turn, endorsed it in blank to the plaintiff, with his 
signature, "ENRIQUE ECHAUS."</p><p></p>
<p>The third note was also delivered to the plaintiff with this endorsement:</p>
<blockquote>"THE VISAYAN GENERAL SUPPLY CO., INC.<p></p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"ENRIQUE ECHAUS<br>"<em>President</em>"</p></blockquote>
<p>Of these three promissory notes, the first two are the subject matter of the 
two proceedings leading up to the present decision (civil case No. 6721 of the 
lower court), and the last note is the subject matter of the other proceeding 
(civil case No. 6720 of the same court).</p>
<p>The plaintiff prays for judgment in its favor in both cases for the amount of 
these obligations, plus interest thereon.</p>
<p>The defendants the Visayan General Supply Co., Inc., and Enrique Echaus were 
declared in default and judgments were rendered against them.</p>
<p>The defendant F. M. Yap Tico &amp; Co., Ltd., filed an answer and set up 
special defenses in both causes.</p>
<p>After joint trial of both proceedings the court rendered judgment against the 
last named defendant in civil case No. 6720 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In consideration of the premises, judgment is hereby rendered in said case 
No. 6720, in favor of the Philippine Trust Co., and against the defendant F. M. 
Yap Tico &amp; Co. Ltd., for the sum of P25,000, with interest thereon at 9 per 
cent per annum from March 6, 1924 until fully paid, and legal interest at 6 per 
cent per annum on the interest accumulated from the date of the filing of the 
complaint until the date of the judgment, plus the costs of the 
action."</p></blockquote>
<p>And in civil case No. 6721, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of these facts, judgment is hereby rendered against F. M. Yap Tico 
&amp; Co., Ltd., jointly with the Visayan General Supply Inc., for the sum of P50,000 with interest thereon at 9 per cent per annum from February 11, 1924 
until fully paid, and with legal interest at 6 per cent per annum on the 
interest accumulated from the date of the filing of the complaint until the date 
of the judgment. And judgment is hereby rendered against the defendant F. M. Yap 
Tico &amp; Co., Ltd., for the sum of P25,000, with interest thereon at 9 per 
cent per annum from March 5, 1924, plus legal interest at 6 per cent per annum 
on the interest accumulated from the date of the filing of the complaint until 
the date of the judgment, plus the costs of this action."</p></blockquote>
<p>F. M. Yap Tico &amp; Co., Ltd., appeals from these judgments, alleging that 
its president and general manager Yap Seng, signed the promissory notes as an 
accommodation party without having received any valuable consideration 
whatsoever, and that neither he nor his corporation is empowered to sign 
promissory notes as accommodation parties. These points were not proven. Yap 
Seng's deposition wherewith efforts were made to prove them, was rightly 
rejected from the evidence by the trial court. Yap Seng is now estopped from 
denying the validity of the corporate transaction which he executed in the name 
of the corporation, thereby leading a third person to believe that both he and 
his corporation had authority to execute it. (14 [A] C. J., 333-334, 372; <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> 
Coleman vs. Hotel de France Co., 29 Phil., 323.)</p>
<p>The appellant also alleges that at the time of the endorsements the plaintiff 
knew that Yap Seng had signed the promissory notes only as an accommodation 
party. Neither has this point been sufficiently established. All the 
circumstance of the case, even to the sum total of the promissory notes 
executed in favor of Echaus, are strongly against the appellant's contention. In 
the face of the evidence of record, such a contention cannot be considered 
proven, even taking into account Enrique Echaus's testimony. We find no merit in 
the first assignment of error.</p>
<p>It appears from the record that the plaintiff received these three promissory 
notes in the ordinary coarse of business, paid their value after discounting the 
9 per cent interest per annum for three months, demanded payment of the 
defendants, and that nothing was paid on account, despite the fact that the 
periods fixed had expired. These are established facts. The inconsistencies 
attributed to O'Malley's testimony detract no force or efficacy therefrom. The 
second assignment of error is not proven.</p>
<p>As the appellant has.not proven that the promissory notes were signed as a 
mere accommodation paper, it was incumbent upon said appellant, in order to 
exhaust its defense, to show that it was not empowered to execute such 
promissory notes, and this has not been established. The third assignment of 
error is untenable.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p> <em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand,</em> and <em>Villa-Real, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</div>
