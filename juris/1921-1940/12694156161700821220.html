				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Juan C. Isada, a member of the Philippine
bar, was convicted of the crime of concubinage and is now serving his
sentence in Bilibid Prison. The Code of Civil Procedure, in its section
21, provides that a member of the bar may be removed or suspended from
his office of lawyer by the Supreme Court by reason of his conviction
of a crime involving moral turpitude. It is held that the crime of
concubinage involves moral turpitude. (<em>In re</em> Basa [1920], 41 Phil., 275.)<br>
    <br>
It is the order of the court that beginning with the day when Juan C.
Isada shall be discharged from prison, he be suspended from his office
of lawyer for one year.
