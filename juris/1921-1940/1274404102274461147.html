				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO OLFINDO ET AL., DEFENDANTS. DOMINGO OLFINDO, GREGORIO TONGO, AND MICAEL ODI, APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The defendants are accused of the crime of double murder, the information 
alleging "that on or about July 10, 1923, in the municipality of Viga, 
Catanduanes, Province of Albay, Philippine Islands, the said accused did 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with evident premeditation and treachery, 
kill Maria Magdalena and Aproniano de la Cruz by choking Maria Magdalena and 
drowning her in the river, and tying a rope around the neck of Aproniano de la 
Cruz and drowning him in the river afterwards."</p>
<p>The trial court found the defendants Gregorio Tongo, Micael Odi and Domingo 
Olfindo guilty as principals of the murder of Maria Magdalena and of the 
homicide of Aproniano de la Cruz; and Domingo Olfindo was found guilty as an 
accomplice in the murder of Maria Magdalena. The principals were sentenced to 
suffer <em>cadena perpetua</em> and the accomplice to suffer fourteen years, 
eight months and one day of <em>cadena temporal,</em> with the accessory 
penalties and an indemnification to the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 
P1,000.</p>
<p>After the judgment had been rendered the three persons convicted presented a 
motion for a new trial on the ground that the principal witness for the 
prosecution, Ignacio Ucero, had retracted the testimony given by him before the 
court and had confessed that he knew nothing about the case. The court denied 
the motion and the defendants appealed both from the judgment of conviction and 
from the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>
<p>It appears from the evidence that on the occasion of the death of a young 
daughter of one Clemente Odi, a large number of persons, among them Domingo 
Olfindo, Rafael Tulang, Ignacio Ucero, Gregorio Tongo and Micael Odi, a brother 
of Clemente, gathered at the latter's house, situated in the barrio of San 
Isidro, municipality of Viga. While some of them were constructing a coffin in 
the basement of an adjoining house belonging to the accused Gregorio Tongo, 
others were reading the <em>pasion</em> in the house of the dead and still 
others were passing to and fro between the house of Clemente and the basement 
where the coffin was made.</p>
<p>As seems to be the custom in that locality on such occasions an abundance of 
<em>tuba</em> was consumed, the accused Gregorio Tongo and Micael Odi partaking 
very liberally and becoming more or less intoxicated.</p>
<p>In the evening of the same day Domingo Olfindo, Rafael Tulang, Ignacio Ucero, 
Micael Odi, Julian Aldave and Gregorio Tongo were gathered together in the 
latter's house, and in conversation among them it was suggested that the 
deceased girl probably had been bewitched by one Maria Magdalena, an elderly 
woman, who pretended to have some knowledge of medicine and was generally 
engaged in treating the people of the community for minor ills. Domingo Olfindo 
then proposed that Maria be killed. In this Micael Odi agreed and proposed in 
turn that Aproniano de la Cruz, a young boy, Maria's son, be also put out of the 
way inasmuch as he, too, undoubtedly was a wizard and no better than his mother. 
Both propositions were accepted by the persons present and it was agreed that 
two parties be formed, one composed of Domingo Olfindo, Rafael Tulang and 
Ignacio Ucero for the purpose of killing Maria Magdalena and the other 
consisting of Gregorio Tongo, Micael Odi and Julian Aldave to take the life of 
Aproniano de la Cruz.</p>
<p>The party designated to kill Aproniano immediately went in search of him and 
found him alone in his mother's house in the <em>sitio</em> of Napo. The accused 
Gregorio Tongo and Micael Odi entered the house and after a short struggle beat 
the boy into submission, tied a rope around his neck and dragged him down to a 
river where they held him under the water until he was dead. They thereupon 
threw the body into a deep pit and covered it with earth.</p>
<p>When Tongo and Micael Odi, after having buried Aproniano, returned to San 
Isidro, found that Domingo Olfindo, Rafael Tulang and Ignacio Ucero, had, 
through fear of Maria's supposed witchcraft, desisted from their purpose of 
killing her, Gregorio Tongo then said that he would kill Maria if no one else 
would do it and inquired of Domingo Olfindo where she might be found. Domingo 
replied that she was in the house of his father Segundo Olfindo whom she was 
treating for some illness, but that she would soon arrive. He thereupon 
instructed his son Gaudencio to go to the house of Segundo and ask Maria to come 
over to his, Domingo's house, because he was sick and needed treatment. 
Gaudencio did so and returned immediately stating that Maria would arrive in a 
few moments. Upon learning this, Gregorio Tongo and Micael Odi secreted 
themselves downstairs in Domingo's house where there was no light. Shortly 
afterwards Maria arrived, but as she began to ascend the stairs of the house 
Gregorio Tongo, without any warning, seized her by the feet and dragged her to 
the nearby river where he and Micael Odi held her under the water until life was 
extinct. With the assistance of Ignacio Ucero, Rafael Tulang and Domingo Olfindo 
the body was taken to a place some six hundred meters distant and was there 
buried in a grave so shallow that the remains came to the surface about two 
weeks later, which led to the detection of the crime and the apprehension of the 
defendants.</p>
<p>The facts stated are conclusively proven by the repeated confessions of all 
of the accused and by the testimony of the witnesses. The principal witness for 
the prosecution, Ignacio Ucero, has, however, signed an affidavit to the effect 
that his testimony before the court was false, and that he was not in the barrio 
of San Isidro on the date of the commission of the crime and knew nothing about 
it. The court below denied the motion for a new trial based on this affidavit 
and the appellants make this ruling their only assignment of error.</p>
<p>We do not think that the court erred in denying the motion; leaving out the 
testimony of Ucero, there is still sufficient evidence in the record to sustain 
the conviction. Moreover, a reading of the testimony convinces us that Ucero 
told the truth on the witness-stand and that he does not tell the truth in his 
affidavit. His story that he was not present in San Isidro at the time of the 
planning of the crime is entirely out of harmony with the rest of the evidence. 
In view of the fact that he is a brother-in-law of Domingo Olfindo and that 
popular opinion in the locality undoubtedly is in favor of the defendants, 
Ucero's retraction may be readily understood. We may say further that ordinarily 
but little weight can be placed on retractions of testimony. In the case of 
United States <em>vs.</em> Dacir (26 Phil., 503), this court said:</p>
<p>" * * * Manifestly, loose statements or even sworn statements of witnesses, 
made after the trial has closed, varying or contradicting their testimony given 
at the trial, will rarely be sufficient in the absence of special circumstances, 
to raise such a doubt as to the truth of their testimony given at the trial and 
accepted as true by the trial judge, as to justify the granting of a new 
trial."</p>
<p>Though the appellants' assignment of error only goes to the denial by the 
court below of the motion for a new trial, the defendants appealed against the 
judgment as a whole and under the settled doctrine of this court such an appeal 
throws the whole case open to review, and it becomes the duty of the appellate 
court to correct such errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from 
whether they are made the subject of assignments of error or not. (U. S. vs. 
Abijan, 1 Phil., 83.) In examining the present case, we find that the trial 
court treated the offenses alleged in the information as one single crime and 
imposed the penalty accordingly. Under the rule laid down in United States 
<em>vs.</em> Balaba (37 Phil., 260), this was error. There were two separate and 
distinct crimes committed, namely, the homicide of Aproniano de la Cruz and the 
murder of Maria Magdalena.</p>
<p>Gregorio Tongo and Micael Odi are guilty as principals of both crimes. Taking 
into consideration the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity and the 
extenuating circumstance of intoxication, they should be sentenced to <em>cadena 
perpetua</em> for the murder of Maria Magdalena and to twelve years and one day 
of <em>reclusion temporal</em> for the homicide of Aproniano de la Cruz.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore modified as to the defendants 
Gregorio Tongo and Micael Odi and each of them is.sentenced to suffer <em>cadena 
perpetua</em>, with the accessory penalties, for the murder of Maria Magdalena, 
and jointly and severally with Domingo Olfindo to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the sum of P1,000. The same defendants are each of them sentenced to 
suffer twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the 
accessory penalties, for the homicide of Aproniano de la Cruz and jointly and 
severally to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000. In 
serving the respective penalties the provisions of paragraph 1 of article 88 of 
the Penal Code shall be observed. The judgment appealed from is affirmed as to 
the defendant Domingo Olfindo. Each of the appellants will pay one-third of the 
costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avancena, Villamor, Johns</em>, and 
<em>Romualdez, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
