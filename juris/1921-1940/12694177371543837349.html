				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This appeal was taken by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Igorrotes </span>Kalingas Dayug and Bannaisan from the judgment&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; the Mountain&nbsp; Province, finding each of them guilty of the crime of&nbsp; double murder, with the qualifying circumstance&nbsp; of evident&nbsp; premeditation,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentencing them,&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of the aggravating&nbsp; circumstance of treachery and that the crime was committed&nbsp; in&nbsp; an uninhabited place,&nbsp; which&nbsp; circumstances are offset by the special extenuating circumstance provided in article 11 of&nbsp; the Penal Code,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended, to suffer life imprisonment, with&nbsp; the accessories&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law,&nbsp; each to indemnify the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased in the sum&nbsp; of P1,000,&nbsp; and to pay one-half of the costs.<br><br>The attorney <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> appointed&nbsp; by this court, in compliance with his duty, has presented a statement in which he declares that after a careful examination of the evidence contained in the record he can find no reason justifying the revocation of the appealed judgment.<br><br>The facts prove at the trial, beyond a reasonable doubt, are as follows:<br><br>Tile <span style="font-style: italic;">Igorrotes </span>Kalingas Abauag and Gumpad were previously accused, convicted, and&nbsp; sentenced to life imprisonment&nbsp; for having killed the family&nbsp; of another&nbsp; Kalinga <span style="font-style: italic;">Igorrote </span>named Suguian.&nbsp; The herein accused are relatives of Suguian and wanted, to revenge the death of the family of their relative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been informed that Kalinga Daupan; a relative&nbsp; of Abauag and Gumpad, and Kalinga Panabang had gone to the barrio of&nbsp; Laya,&nbsp; an Igorrote&nbsp; woman named Banayan told them to intercept the travellers on the road.&nbsp; On January 5, 1926,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused started out ahead of them and upon arriving at; the barrio of Pakik waited in ambush.&nbsp; At about noon Daupan and Panabang passed by them.&nbsp; The accused followed them at a distance of about 80 yards, trying not to be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Belen they overtook them, Dayug attacking Panabang and Bannaisan attacking Daupan, each using his respective bolo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dayug first wounded Panabang on the right shoulder and&nbsp; later in the back.&nbsp; Panabang started&nbsp; to&nbsp; run away, Dayug pursuing him and when he overtook&nbsp; him,&nbsp; Panabang&nbsp; faced him.&nbsp; Dayug then gave him&nbsp; a third blow&nbsp; with the bolo&nbsp; which penetrated the&nbsp; abdomen. As&nbsp; Panabang&nbsp; again&nbsp; attempted&nbsp; to&nbsp; run&nbsp; away, Dayug gave him&nbsp; the&nbsp; fourth&nbsp; blow which struck his right leg above&nbsp; the knee, causing him&nbsp; to fall face downward on the ground&nbsp; when&nbsp; he again&nbsp; stabbed him&nbsp; in the buttock. Panabang died&nbsp; instantly.&nbsp; After&nbsp; his death Dayug searched his clothes and found P18,&nbsp; consisting&nbsp; of 10 silver&nbsp; pesos, 4 one-peso bills and 2 two-peso bills, in a purse wrapped in a handkerchief.&nbsp; He also found five&nbsp; silver rings on the person of Panabang.&nbsp; While Dayug was engaged with Panabang,&nbsp; Bannaisan pursued the <span style="font-style: italic;">Igorrote</span> Daupan, inflicting a wound in her abdomen, another in the right lumbar region, another across the left cheek and another in the right buttock.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused divided the money&nbsp; and the rings, Bannaisan taking the P10 in silver&nbsp; and three rings and Dayug the rest.<br><br>The facts above related were freely and voluntarily confessed by the accused. Undoubtedly the accused,&nbsp; urged by the members of their tribe and following their traditional custom,&nbsp; wanted to avenge the death of the family&nbsp; of&nbsp; a relative of Bannaisan who had been murdered by Abauag and Gumpad.&nbsp; As they were unable to take revenge on the latter because of their imprisonment, they selected Daupan, a relative of Abauag and Gumpad, and Panabang as their victims and took advantage of the occasion&nbsp; when they set out for Laya.&nbsp; There having been a&nbsp; concert of&nbsp; mind and unity of&nbsp; purpose, each of the accused carrying out his part of the plan, each is liable for the&nbsp; death of the two victims.<br><br>The crime committed by them is double murder&nbsp; with the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation,&nbsp; as shown by the fact that they agreed to kill the two victims, started out ahead of them and waylaid them in&nbsp; the road.<br><br>The trial court has held that the crime was committed with&nbsp; the generic aggravating circumstance of treachery, with which the Attorney-General&nbsp; agrees. The rule of procedural law is that the aggravating circumstances must be conclusively proven.&nbsp; According to the&nbsp; accused Dayug, he and his coaccused&nbsp; were pursuing&nbsp; their victims and it was during the pursuit that they wounded them.&nbsp; The fact that a&nbsp; person is being pursued by another&nbsp; does not&nbsp; save the latter&nbsp; from all danger that might arise from a resistance on the part of the former,&nbsp; because during&nbsp; the pursuit it might occur to the pursued to turn upon his pursuer and suddenly attack him.&nbsp; The&nbsp; wounds&nbsp; on the&nbsp; back&nbsp; and shoulders of the victims alone are not sufficient to legally establish the existence of the aggravating circumstance of treachery,&nbsp; inasmuch as it is necessary&nbsp; to prove that the aggressor did not run any risk which&nbsp; might have arisen from a defense on the part of the offended party.<br><br>The Attorney-General&nbsp; is of the opinion that the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength should be taken&nbsp; into account.&nbsp; As&nbsp; we have seen, the fight&nbsp; was single-handed&nbsp; and, there is no&nbsp; evidence in the record to show that the aggressors, individually and collectively, were greatly superior in strength&nbsp; to the offended parties.<br><br>In regard to&nbsp; the accused Bannaisan, the aggravating circumstance of disregard&nbsp; of sex must&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; into consideration inasmuch as his victim was a woman.<br><br>The Attorney-General is&nbsp; also of the opinion&nbsp; that the aggravating circumstance of cruelty should be taken&nbsp; into account.&nbsp; This circumstance has its own value and meaning in law.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; cruelty when&nbsp; the&nbsp; culprit enjoys and delights in&nbsp; making&nbsp; his&nbsp; victim suffer&nbsp; slowly and gradually, causing him unnecessary moral and physical pain in the consummation of the criminal act which he intends to commit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere fact of inflicting various&nbsp; successive wounds upon a person in order to&nbsp; cause his death, no appreciable time&nbsp; intervening between the infliction of one wound and that of another to show that he&nbsp; had wanted to prolong the suffering&nbsp; of his victim,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; sufficient for taking&nbsp; this aggravating circumstance into consideration, Briefly, the only&nbsp; aggravating circumstances in&nbsp; regard to the&nbsp; two accused which, in our&nbsp; opinion,&nbsp; can properly be considered are,&nbsp; the&nbsp; uninhabited place&nbsp; and&nbsp; the disregard of sex in respect&nbsp; to the accused Bannaisan, all&nbsp; of which are offset by the special extenuating&nbsp; circumstance provided in article 11 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2142, more especially in regard to the&nbsp; members of the non-Christian&nbsp; Tribes, to whom, due to their custom and traditions, it is second nature to revenge the&nbsp; death of a relative, which only&nbsp; instruction and education can eradicate.<br><br>For the foregoing, we have arrived at the conclusion that each of the accused is guilty of the crime of double murder and there&nbsp; being no circumstance to modify the criminal liability, the penalty provided&nbsp; by law of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal</span> in its maximum degree to&nbsp; death, must be imposed&nbsp; in&nbsp; its medium&nbsp; degree, or life imprisonment..&nbsp; But&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as each of the accused must suffer two life imprisonments, the total duration of which is sixty years, and, also, according to article 88 of the Penal Code, when a person is&nbsp; guilty of two&nbsp; or more crimes,&nbsp; all of the penalties corresponding to the several violations shall be&nbsp; imposed, the same to be simultaneously served,&nbsp; if possible, and when not, the court can only impose the triple penalty corresponding to the gravest crime, in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with article 89 of&nbsp; the Penal Code, but never exceeding forty years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration of the two penalties of&nbsp; <i>cadena perpetua</i> must never exceed forty years.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i> Cabrera,&nbsp; 43 Phil., 64&nbsp; and 82.)<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing, with the sole modification that the joint duration of the penalties imposed upon each of the accused shall not exceed forty years&nbsp; of <i>cadena perpetua,</i> the judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is affirmed, with the costs against the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Johnson,&nbsp; Street,&nbsp; Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur. <br></div>
