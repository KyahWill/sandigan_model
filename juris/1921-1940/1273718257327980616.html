				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff seeks to recover from the defendant the sum of P10,200, as the 
rental of certain premises at the rate of P300 per month, for the period between 
July 1, 1919, and April 30, 1922, plus P122.35 for water used, with legal 
interest thereon and costs.
<p>The defendant denies generally and specifically the facts alleged in the 
complaint, and alleges as a special defense that the rent of the premises 
occupied by him during said period is only P100 per month; and sets up a 
counterclaim for the sum of P10,000 for damages caused by an attachment procured 
by the plaintiff and levied upon a drug store run by the defendant.</p>
<p>After trial, the lower court adjudged and decreed that the rent which the 
defendant was bound to pay was P100 per month, and rendered judgment against him 
for P3,410, as the rental corresponding to the period of time during which the 
defendant has occupied the premises, which was from July 1, 1919, to May 3, 
1922. It likewise found the defendant liable to the plaintiff only for one-half 
the amount of water consumed, that is to say, P61.18.</p>
<p>The plaintiff appeals from said judgment, alleging that the lower court 
erred:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. In not finding that a contract enforceable by action was perfected 
between the plaintiff and the defendant, whereby the latter had agreed to pay 
the plaintiff P300 as monthly rental of the premises leased.</p>
<p>"2. In not sentencing the defendant to pay the plaintiff, agreeably with the 
contract entered into, the stipulated rents corresponding to the months of from 
July, 1919, to May 3, 1922, at the rate of P300 per month aggregating the sum of 
P10,230.</p>
<p>"3. In finding that the plaintiff allowed the defendant to continue occupying 
the premises in question by the month after June 30, 1919, without requiring him 
to vacate them or to pay the increased rents.</p>
<p>"4. In holding that the defendant had the right to continue occupying the 
premises in question by paying the same rents as before July 1, 1919.</p>
<p>"5. In not rendering judgment against the defendant for the costs of the 
suit, as well as the proper interest upon all the amounts due to the plaintiff 
and claimed by the latter.</p>
<p>"6. In not granting the motion for new trial presented by the plaintiff on 
the ground that the decision is against the law and is not sufficiently 
supported by the evidence introduced at the trial."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first assignment of error raises the question whether the contract of 
lease existing on July 1, 1919, was the same as that entered into by the parties 
prior to said date, or different. The defendant contends that it was the same, 
on the ground that there was a tacit renewal, inasmuch as he continued to enjoy 
the premises leased during that whole period of time aforesaid with the 
acquiescence of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>This contract of lease was, among other things, the subject of a judicial 
controversy between the same parties, this court having, on April 12, 1922, 
solved the question in the sense that the term of the lease was one year, which 
expired June 30, 1919, and not by the month, as the plaintiff claimed, nor by 
the year and subject to be extended for five years, as the defendant 
contended.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Before this ruling of the Supreme Court, the defendant, on March 25, 1919, 
brought an action against the plaintiff to compel him to execute a deed of lease 
for one year ending July 1, 1919, subject to be extended for five years at the 
option of the lessee.</p>
<p>The herein plaintiff, in turn, through his attorney, sent the defendant, a 
few days later, a letter (Exhibit A) as follows:</p>

<p>"MY DEAR FRIEND: My client Mr. Primitivo Jason has handed me your letter of 
the 29th instant to answer it.</p>
<p>"Following the instructions of my said client I have to tell you that the 
lease of the premises in question (1002, Calle A. Mabini) does not terminate on 
the last day of this month but on the first of July, 1919, it being optional on 
the part of Mr. Jason to consider said term extended from year to year until 
1923. The agreed rent is P100 per month.</p>
<p>"Mr. Jason cannot understand, therefore, on what ground Mr. Andres Garcia 
raises the rent to P300 per month. He does not agree with this new condition and 
abides entirely by the stipulation had with Mr. Garcia. Besides, there is 
pending at present an action brought by Mr. Jason against Messrs. Garcia and 
Enriquez Perez for specific performance of the contract, in which action there 
is involved the question of the lease of the ground floor of the property in 
question.</p>
<p>"That is all I can tell you.</p>

<p>In view of this attitude of the parties, it cannot be said that there was a 
mutual agreement between the parties either as to the term of the lease, or the 
new rent of P300 per month demanded by the herein plaintiff. Consequently the 
conclusion cannot be established that the herein defendant agreed with this new 
amount of rent, demanded in the letter Exhibit A of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>If the particular period of the lease discussed by the parties in this action 
had begun from April 1, 1919, and there had been no question between the parties 
as to the term of the lease, it would be proper to consider the letters of the 
plaintiff, Exhibits A and B, which have reference to said date, as a demand to 
prevent the tacit renewal. But said letters having been written, with knowledge 
on the part of the plaintiff that the defendant did not recognize that the lease 
was to terminate each month, but contended that it did not expire until the end 
of June, 1919, and could be extended at his will for five years more, said 
letters written in March and April cannot be considered as a demand for the 
return of the property on the 1st of July, which date the plaintiff himself, the 
author thereof, did not recognize as the agreed date for the termination of the 
lease which he contended was by the month.</p>
<p>It may be added that the preponderance of evidence shows that the P100 
monthly rent of the premises occupied by the defendant is reasonable, and we 
find that the remarks and findings made by the trial court on this point in its 
decision are correct.</p>
<p>It is true that the plaintiff expressed his intention to require the 
defendant to pay a rent of P300 per month beginning with April 1, 1919; but it 
is also true that the defendant likewise expressed his attitude not to consider 
himself bound to pay such a new amount of rent, on the ground that the contract 
entitled him to continue occupying the property at least until the end of June 
of that year, at the stipulated rent of P100.</p>
<p>The question of the term of the lease having been judicially raised between 
the parties since March, 1919, which question continued unsolved when the 
letters A and B were written, the way was open for a tacit renewal upon the 
failure to demand delivery of the property on July 1, 1919, the date when 
according to the defendant himself the original contract expired. And this 
demand could have been made in such a manner as not to imply any acknowledgment 
or admission of the theory maintained by the defendant, but only as a 
precautionary measure and as an inequivocal expression of the will of the 
plaintiff that, in the hypothesis that the term of the lease was to expire on 
the last day of June, 1919, he required the defendant either to deliver the 
property on July 1, 1919, or to pay a higher rent from that date.</p>
<p>In view of the circumstances of the case, the letters A and B have no legal 
effect as a demand, because their contents were based on a term of the lease 
then in question between the parties in court, which letters by reason of the 
defendant continuing to occupy the property and the plaintiff not making any 
further demand, left the juridical relation then existing between them in 
<i>statu quo</i>. And this juridical relation which was not altered was the one 
created by the original contract, inasmuch as the letters A and B could not, as 
we have stated, have the effect of modifying it. And this original legal bond 
subsisted unaltered throughout the judicial controversies between them until it 
was finally decided that the term of the lease, according to the contract, was 
one year which terminated at the end of June, 1919. But this final decision did 
not affect the amount of the rent as originally stipulated.</p>
<p>As regards the water consumed, the evidence shows that the sums paid by the 
plaintiff on this account are for the water consumed in the floor occupied by 
the defendant as well as in the upper story occupied by the plaintiff. We find 
the conclusion of the trial court to be just in fixing against the defendant 
only one-half the amount of said total consumption.</p>
<p>As to the interest claimed by the plaintiff, we note that the defendant from 
the beginning acknowledged being under obligation to pay the monthly rent of 
P100. As he did not pay the same since the month of July, 1919, and it does not 
appear in this case that he ever offered to pay plaintiff said rent in due 
season, we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to recover legal interest on the 
sum due, computed from the respective dates each monthly rent became due.</p>
<p>We find no reversible error in the judgment appealed from although we do find 
error requiring a modification thereof in the sense above indicated.</p>
<p>Wherefore the judgment appealed from is affirmed with the only modification 
that the defendant stands also sentenced to pay the plaintiff legal interest on 
the sum adjudicated to the plaintiff by the trial court as rent, which interest 
shall be computed from the respective dates on which each monthly rent became 
due until full payment.</p>
<p>Without express finding as to costs. So ordered.</p><i>Johnson, Street,
