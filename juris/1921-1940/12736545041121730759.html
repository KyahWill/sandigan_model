				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This action is brought to recover the sum of P15,000 with interest and costs. 
It is alleged in the complaint that on or about January 20, 1922, the defendant 
corporation represented by its president and principal stockholder, W. Neumark, 
borrowed from the plaintiff the sum of P15,000 which was delivered to the said 
defendant by means of a check drawn in favor of the defendant against the 
plaintiff's account in the China Banking Corporation, which check was deposited 
with the Bank of the Philippine Islands and the amount of it credited to the 
defendant on its current account.</p>
<p>The defendant's answer is a general denial together with a special defense to 
the effect that W. Neumark had never been authorized by the defendant 
corporation to borrow money for its account from the plaintiff to the amount of 
P15,000 and that said defendant has never received nor made use of the sum 
alleged to have been so borrowed. The court below rendered a judgment in favor 
of the plaintiff for the sum of P15,000 with legal interest from October 30, 
1922, and with the costs. From this judgment the defendant appeals to this 
court.</p>
<p>The appellant presents two assignments of errors, viz.: (1) That the court 
erred in holding the defendant responsible for the payment of the money borrowed 
by Neumark, and (2) that the court erred in giving the plaintiff judgment for 
P15,000 with interest and costs.</p>
<p>The first assignment of error cannot be sustained. The evidence shows that 
Neumark was the principal stockholder, the president and the general business 
manager of the defendant corporation. On behalf of the corporation he solicited 
a loan from the plaintiff and, as alleged in the complaint, was given the 
plaintiffs check in favor of the corporation for the sum of P15,000, which check 
was endorsed by him in his capacity as president of the corporation and 
deposited to the corporation's account. It may be true that a large part of the 
amount so deposited was diverted by Neumark to his own use, but that does not 
alter the fact that the money was borrowed for the corporation and was placed in 
its' possession.</p>
<p>It is conceded that Neumark was not expressly authorized by the board of 
directors to borrow the money in question and the general rule is that a 
business manager or other officer of a corporation has no implied power to 
borrow money on its behalf. But much depends upon the circumstances of each 
particular case and the rule stated is subject to important exceptions. Thus, 
where a general business manager of a corporation is clothed with apparent 
authority to borrow and the amount borrowed does not exceed the ordinary 
requirements of the business, it has often been held that the authority is 
implied and that the corporation is bound. (G. V. B. Mining Co. vs. First 
National Bank of Hailey, 95 Fed., 23; Matson vs. Alley, 141 Ill., 284; Topeka 
Primary Association University of Builders vs. Martin, 39 Kan., 750; Africa vs. 
Duluth News Tribune Co., 82 Minn., 283; Rosemond vs. Northwestern Autographic 
Register Co., 62 Minn., 374; Helena National Bank vs. Rocky Mountain Telegraph 
Co., 20 Mont., 379; Fensterer vs. Pressure lighting Co., 149 N. Y. S., 49; Clark 
vs. Freeport Clays etc., Co., 52 Pa. Super., 1.)</p>
<p>In the present case there are ample indications in the record that the 
corporation was in need of funds to carry on its business and it does not appear 
that the amount borrowed was disproportionate to the volume of the business. As 
president, general manager and principal stock holder Neumark appeared, in a 
sense, to be almost the whole corporation and was clothed with apparent 
authority to do everything necessary for the conduct of its business. In these 
circumstances he must be held to have been impliedly authorized to borrow the 
money here in question.</p>
<p>The second assignment of error is well taken; the plaintiff admits that he 
has received P5,000 from the corporation on account of the loan.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is therefore modified by reducing the amount of 
the recovery to the sum of P10,000, with interest at the legal rate from October 
30, 1922, and with the costs. So ordered.</p>

JJ., </em>concur.</p>
