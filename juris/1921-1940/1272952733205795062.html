				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 4, 1917, the Bank of the  Philippine Islands sold some  parcels of land  situated on  the  Island  of Catanduanes, Province  of   Albay, together with the  improvements thereon to Mariano Limjap.   It was agreed between them that Limjap was  to  have the lands surveyed  and apply for  their registration.   It was furthermore  stipulated in the second clause that should the registration of any  of these lands be denied after due diligence  on the part of Limjap, the bank would return to him  the price of the parcel of land the registration of which  had been denied.  Pursuant to this clause the price of parcel No. 10 was  fixed  in the contract at P7,500.<br><br>Limjap  applied for the registration of these lands,  and during the course of the proceeding,  sold them to  Serafin de la Riva on September 9, 1919 for the same price,  and with the special stipulation  that he <i>subrogated Serafin de la Riva in all the other terms of  the document executed vith the  Bank of the  Philippine  Islands regarding  any sum  which the said bank might have to return in accordance with these stipulations</i>.  From that time  De la Riva took Limjap's place as applicant in the proceeding for the registration of these lands which was then pending.   The court rendered judgment in that case  denying the registration  of lot marked No. 10 therein;<br><br>On February 17, 1925, Serafin de la Riva filed the complaint in the present case against the Bank of the Philippine  Islands  and  Mariano  Limjap  praying  that said defendants be  ordered  to pay the  plaintiff  jointly  and severally the sum of P7,500, the price of the unregistered land, with legal interest  from the time of the filing of the complaint.<br><br>The Bank of the Philippine  Islands filed a demurrer, alleging that as it had not entered into any contract with the plaintiff, nor had taken  any part in the execution of the contract between the plaintiff and Mariano Limjap, said  plaintiff had no cause of action against it.   The court below sustained this demurrer in its order of April 7, 1925. The  plaintiff did not take any exception to this ruling nor amend his complaint.<br><br>On September  4, 1925, Mariano Limjap asked leave of the court to file  a counterclaim against the Bank of the Philippine Islands.  This  petition was  denied.  On  November 18th of the same  year, in view of  this  adverse ruling, Mariano Limjap asked that the Bank of the Philippine Islands be included as a necessary party to this action. This petition  also  was denied.  Exception was taken  to both of these rulings.<br><br>On December 8th following, Mariano Limjap answered the complaint alleging, as  special defense, that the plaintiff had no cause of action against him; that the Bank of the Philippine Islands was the only one liable to the plaintiff; that in the proceeding in  which  the registration of the land had  been denied and to  which the complaint made reference, this defendant  was not made a party to the action for eviction.  By way of counterclaim he prays  that the plaintiff be ordered  to pay him  P2,000—the  amount of a promissory note copied in the answer.<br><br>At the  hearing  of this  case and just  before the introduction of the evidence, the court  dismissed the complaint with respect to the bank,  assigning as  the basis of such ruling, the fact that the  demurrer to the  complaint  filed by this defendant had been sustained.   Counsel for Limjap excepted to this ruling.  This was on April 22, 1926, according to the transcript of the stenographic notes,  and not on April 22, 1925, as  stated in the bill of exceptions, which must be only a typographical  error.<br><br>The  court ordered  the  counsel  for  Mariano  Limjap to pay the  plaintiff the  sum  of P7,500  with legal interest from December 3,  1924, until  fully paid, and  it also ordered the plaintiff  to pay to the estate of Mariano Limjap, who had substituted the latter as a party to the action, the sum of P2,000 with legal interest from December 10, 1925, until fully paid.  The administratrix of  Mariano Limjap's estate appealed from this judgment.<br><br>Defendant's appeal refers to that part of the judgment of the  lower court on  the  merit, ordering her to pay the plaintiff the sum of P7,500; to the court's ruling denying Mariano Limjap's petition  to file a counterclaim  against the bank; to the ruling denying Mariano  Limjap's petition to include the Bank of the Philippine Islands as a necessary party to this case, and to the ruling dismissing the complaint as against the bank.<br><br>In view of the  conclusion at which we have arrived  in this case we deem it unnecessary to discuss the judgment on the merit, and we shall take up only the three last orders involved in  this appeal.<br><br>The trial court denied  in these two  orders the petition of counsel  for  Mariano  Limjap to  file a  counterclaim against  the Bank of the Philippine Islands, and to have the latter included as a necessary  party to  this case on the ground  that Limjap did not make the bank a party to the eviction proceeding at the opportune time, since he did not notify it that a complaint  had been filed against him  in this cause at the  time of the  filing of the  complaint, nor during  the  time  that elapsed from  then until  the  court favorably ruled upon the bank's demurrer on April 7, 1926, nor within the period provided by articles 5  and 8 of the rules  of the Courts of First Instance, from the said date of April 7, 1925, which is understood to be  the shortest time possible as provided for  in article 1482 of the Civil  Code. From these facts  the trial court found that the defendant had renounced its right to  the warranty in  regard to the thing sold.   This shows that the view of  the trial court is that,  in order that Limjap  might have a right to enforce against  the  bank the warranty in regard  to the thing sold, it was necessary that Limjap should have notified the bank of the eviction in this action.  This is erroneous.<br><br>The vendor is  bound to  deliver  and warrant the  thing sold  (article 1461, Civil Code) and  by this obligation  he is responsible to the purchaser for its legal  and peaceful possession (article 1474,  Civil  Code)  and  if,  by final judgment  and by virtue of a previous right  to  the purchase, the purchaser is deprived of this thing purchased, the vendor shall be obliged to return the price  (article 1478, Civil Code).   According to this, the purchaser's right to demand the return  of  the price implies  two  actions.   First, an action brought  by a third person against the purchaser, in which final judgment has  been rendered, depriving  the latter of the thing bought.  Second, the purchaser's action against the vendor for  the return  of  the price.  But in order that the vendor be  obliged to return the price because of the purchaser having  been deprived of the thing bought by virtue of a  final judgment, the law requires that said vendor  be  notified  of the action in which that  judgment was rendered in order that he might defend the purchaser's legal  and peaceful possession, for which he is responsible (articles 1481,  1482, Civil Code).  It is clear that this notification must  be given in the action brought by the third party against the purchaser, because it is there that  the vendor  must defend  the right he has  transferred  to  the purchaser,  to prevent the latter from being deprived of the peaceful possession  of the thing sold. Consequently, this notification to the  bank should have been  given in this case  during the registration  proceeding  in  which judgment was   rendered which, in accordance  with  the agreement  between  the parties,  should  give  rise  to  the bank's obligation to return the price.<br><br>It is  also clear that it was not necessary to notify  the bank  in the present action.  This is an action on the warranty to recover the  price of the thing sold, of the legal and peaceful possession  of which the purchaser has been deprived by reason of the eviction.  The  purchaser's eviction is already  a consummated fact by  virtue of the judgment  rendered  in the registration proceeding.  The present action  is its result.   Vendor's opportunity to defend the right to the  thing  which he transferred to the purchaser has already passed.  For such purpose it was useless to notify him in this action in which he can no longer make such a defense.   This is  an action now brought by the purchaser against  the vendor to enforce the  warranty  of  the thing sold, taking the eviction  for granted, as the cause and basis  of the  right  claimed.  What has  here caused some confusion is the fact that the plaintiff in the present case is Fermin de la Riva and the defendant Limjap.  But, if it is well  considered,  there  is no  reason for  this confusion.  De  la  Riva's action  does not  contemplate depriving Limjap of the land which he bought from the bank and there was no need to notify said bank of this  action in order that it might defend that which is not  attached. The action now brought  by De la Riva against Limjap is the same as Limjap would have brought against  the bank had he not transferred his rights to De la Riva.<br><br>Therefore, the trial court's ground for denying Limjap's petition to present a counterclaim against the  bank and that the latter  be  included as a necessary party to  this action is erroneous.<br><br>Counsel for the  bank  argues in this instance that the law (section 98, Code of Civil Procedure)  allows the defendant to  file  a counterclaim only  against one  of the parties, and that Limjap could not  file  a counterclaim against the bank because the latter was not a party  to the action.  And it  is claimed that the bank was not a party to this  action, even if it was  included as  defendant, because,  having filed  a demurrer to the complaint, on the ground  of lack of cause  of action, this demurrer was sustained without  any exception Toeing made to this  ruling, nor  was the complaint  amended,  which was afterwards dismissed as  regards the bank.  This contention  is untenable.  When Limjap registered his petition to file a counterclaim against the  bank, although the demurrer of the latter had already been sustained and the period for amending the  complaint  had  passed without any amendment being made, it not only did not dismiss the bank  from the action but did not terminate the action as against it, since section  102 of the  Code  of Civil Procedure requires that under  these  circumstances  the  court has  yet to  render judgment according to the law and the facts shown  in the record.  It is true that on April 22, 1926, the lower court dismissed the complaint as against the bank, but  that was a long time after Limjap's petition to file a counterclaim was registered,  and long after the court had denied this petition.  Furthermore, even supposing that that dismissal was equivalent to the judgment which the court had  to render, it is not yet final, since it was excepted to by Limjap's counsel and is now one of the errors assigned in this appeal.  In no sense can it be said that when Limjap's counsel filed his petition  to present a counterclaim against the bank, the latter was not a party to  this action.<br><br>At all events,  the counterclaim may be filed  against a third person  if, according to the allegations of the  answer, such third person is a necessary party to the complete determination of the controversy (Winter vs. McMillian,  87 Cal., 256;  Eureka vs. Gates, 120 Cal., 54;  Mackenzie vs. Hodgkin,  126 Cal., 591;  77 Am. Dec, 209; Lewis vs. Fox, 122 Cal., 244).  That the bank is, in this sense, a necessary party to this case, is beyond doubt.<br><br>The  second clause of the contract between Limjap and the bank, to  which reference has already been made, and by virtue of  which the bank obligated itself to reimburse Limjap for the price of the land the  registration of which might  be denied,  is, in substance, a warranty stipulation in case of eviction, peculiarly framed, so to speak, but legally made  nevertheless, since the  law allows the contracting parties to specify such  conditions as they  may  deem  fit (article 1475, Civil  Code).  Limjap  expressly subrogated De la  Riva in all his rights arising  from this stipulation. The registration of parcel 10 having been denied, De la Riva brought this action against Limjap for the recovery of the  price  paid for this parcel.   Limjap alleges that  by virtue  of this transfer,  the bank is  liable to De la  Riva. The bank's  intervention is, therefore, necessary  in this cause  in  order  to  determine who is really  liable to  the plaintiff.   The fact that  the bank did not enter into any contract with De la Riva is no  bar to this intervention. The rule enunciated in article  1257 of the Civil Code that the contract binds only the parties thereto and their heirs, is not applicable to this case, since the basis of De la Riva's action is Limjap's transfer to him of his right to the warranty, a right which Limjap had  against the bank.   De la Riva's action is the same as Limjap's against the bank and  he exercises it instead  of Limjap, by  virtue  of the transfer.   (Decision of  the  Supreme Court of Spain of January 27, 1897.)<br><br>In regard to the exception to the order of the trial court dismissing the complaint as against the bank, it appears that this dismissal was ordered because the bank's demurrer to the complaint  had been  sustained and said complaint had not been amended within  the  period  fixed by the court.   The order  in  which the  court  sets forth its grounds  for sustaining the demurrer has not been included in the bill of exceptions and for this reason we cannot consider whether it erred or not in dismissing  the complaint against the bank.  On the  other hand, the decision on this point is unimportant in view of the disposition we are going to make of this case.<br><br>The judgment entered on  the merits is  set aside  and the record in this case is  ordered  remanded to the court of origin in  order that it  may permit the administratrix of Mariano  Limjap's estate to present  a counterclaim against the Bank of the Philippine Islands, and, after the proper legal  proceedings, render judgment on the  claims of all parties.  It is so ordered without special pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm,  Johns,  Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
