				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PAMBAYA BAYAMBAO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pambaya Bayambao was charged with the crime of murder, was 
found guilty thereof by the Court of First Instance of Lanao and sentenced to 
twenty years <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal</span>, the accessories of law, costs and to indemnify the 
heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000. 
<p align="justify">He does not deny having caused the deceased's death. He 
alleges, however, that he did it by mistake, believing the deceased malefactor 
who attacked him in the dark. He thus related the occurrence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"A. While my wife was cooking she called out to me saying, 
'Pambaya, Pambaya, someone has thrown a stone at the house.' So I took my 
revolver and went down. Having gone under the house, I looked around, but did 
not see anybody; however, I did not go far because I was alone. Then, while I 
was near the staircase, about to ascend, I heard a noise and saw a black figure 
that rushed at me, with hands lifted up as if to strike me, and becoming 
frightened, I fired at it.<br><br>"Q. Why did you shoot him?—A. Because I 
thought he was an outlaw and he also thought that I was another outlaw, but 
found out later that it was my brother-in-law. </p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Why did you not shout before shooting?—A. I had no time, 
because the man was already very near, when I saw that black figure with 
uplifted arms behind a pillar, and, fearing he would attack me with his <span style="font-style: italic;">kampilan</span> 
or dagger, I shot him before he could kill me. </p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Why did you think that black figure was an outlaw?—A. 
Because my wife screamed that there were evildoers below, and in our place there 
are many outlaws, and those outlaws hate me because I help the Government to 
collect taxes. Some days before, there was killing near my house, a soldier 
killing two outlaws. </p>
<p align="justify">"Q. After you had fired at that black figure, what did you 
do?—A. After having fired, I waited a moment to see if he had other outlaw 
companions, and I was prepared to go up and get my gun. As I did not see anybody 
else, I cried out, 'Brother-in-law, come down, Imo, bring a light.' At that Imo 
and Morid came down with a light and we discovered that the person who was 
moaning was my brotherin-law. Upon seeing him I ran towards him, embracing and 
kissing him, saying: 'Forgive me, I thought you were an outlaw,' and he 
answered: 'And I also thought you were an outlaw.' " (Pages 33-34, t. s. n.) 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The wife of the victim gives another version of the occurrence. 
She testified that when the accused's wife informed him that someone had thrown 
a stone at the house, the accused suggested that the deceased go down and see 
who was throwing stones at them; that the deceased went down and told the 
accused that there was no one under the house; that thereupon the accused, 
telling him to wait there for he was going to use his flashlight, went down 
carrying an automatic revolver in his right hand and a flashlight in the left; 
that, on coming downstairs the accused asked the deceased if the hens there 
belonged to him, and the latter asked the accused to focus his light there in 
order to gather all the hens together; that at this the accused shot the 
deceased, whose wife peered out of the door and saw her husband with the accused 
focusing his flashlight on him and then firing at him again; that the deceased 
told Pambaya that he was wounded; that the deceased's wife upbraided the accused 
telling him that he did wrong, and asked why he had shot the deceased; that the 
accused turned upon her telling her to shut up or he would shoot her 
also.<br><br>Morid, widow of the deceased, is the only witness testifying to 
these facts. Her testimony is uncorroborated. The alleged <span style="font-style: italic;">ante-mortem</span> 
declaration contained in the document Exhibit B, is of doubtful authenticity, 
because, while the justice of the peace and the witness Urunaga state that such 
statement was made by the deceased, Constabulary Lieutenant Cramer, who arrived 
at where the deceased was a few moments before said justice of the peace, 
positively states that the deceased could no longer speak. Consequently, he 
could not very well have made the alleged statement. Of course, it appears that 
it was not the deceased who wrote it, but Urunaga, and upon a typewriter. It 
does not appear that the deceased read it or that it was read to him, or that 
the deceased acknowledged it as his own statement. This proof of identity is 
indispensable for the admissibility of such an <span style="font-style: italic;">ante-mortem</span> declaration as 
evidence. (People vs. Dizon, 44 Phil., 267.) We cannot give any probatory value 
to document Exhibit B.</p>
<p align="justify">Alone and uncorroborated, therefore, stands the testimony of 
Morid, which, besides being incongruous in parts, is flatly and stoutly denied 
by the accused and his wife. Considering the circumstances of the case, it is 
very improbable that, without a previous dispute or even an exchange of words, 
the accused should suddenly and unexpectedly attack the deceased. The 
disagreement that, according to the tatter's widow, arose between the accused 
and the deceased ten days before the incident, has not been proven in the 
record, and it is inconsistent with the conduct of the two during the subsequent 
days up to the time of the incident, with both living peacefully and sleeping 
together in the same house on the night in question, a few moments before the 
occurrence, according to the testimony of Morid herself.</p>
<p align="justify">On the other hand, the accused's narration seems natural. And 
as it is corroborated not only by his wife's testimony, but on some points by 
that of Lieutenant Cramer and Sergeant Tumindog, to the effect that immediately 
after the occurrence the accused betook himself to the commanding officer of the 
place in order to give an account of the incident, and to ask for prompt medical 
help for his unexpected victim, it cannot but produce in the mind a conviction 
that what happened to the unfortunate Mangutara was an accident, without fault 
or guilt on the part of the herein appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">The latter, on that occasion, acted from the impulse of an 
uncontrollable fear of an ill at least equal in gravity, in the belief that the 
deceased was a malefactor who attacked him with a <span style="font-style: italic;">kampilan</span> or dagger in hand, 
and for this reason, he was guilty of no crime and is exempt from criminal 
liability (art. 8, No. 10, Penal Code.) </p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, his ignorance or error of fact was not due to 
negligence or bad faith, and this rebuts the presumption of malicious intent 
accompanying the act of killing. In an analogous case, this court acquitted the 
accused (U. S. vs. Ah Chong, 15 Phil., 488), and we deem the doctrine laid down 
in that case applicable to this one. <br><br>The judgment appealed from is 
reversed and the appellant acquitted, with costs de officio, and other 
pronouncements in his favor. So ordered.</p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</span> 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur. </div>
