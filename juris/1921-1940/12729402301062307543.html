				<H3>LEON TEMPORAL, JOSE TEMPORAL, GENOVEVA TEMPORAL, ANTONIA BELARMINO AND CRISTINO BAGAY, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. FERNANDO MATEO AND FELISA MONTALON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Martin Temporal had two children named Maria  and Juan.  Maria, now deceased, had a daughter named Antonia Belarmino.  Juan, also deceased, had three sons, Leon, Jose and Prudencio.  Prudencio, likewise deceased, had  a daughter named  Genoveva Temporal.  Hence,  plaintiffs Antonia Belarmino, Jose Temporal and Leon Temporal are Martin Temporal's grandchildren, and Genoveva Temporal is his great-granddaughter.  Cristino Bagay is also a plaintiff as the husband of Antonia Belarmino.<br><br>Martin  Temporal owned the lands described in the complaint.  In  1882  Martin Temporal mortgaged said lands to Pedro  Lopez de  Leon as security for a loan of P1,200 from the  same, giving him  possession thereof.   The defendant spouses,  Fernando Mateo and  Felisa  Montalon, applied for  the registration of these lands in their name, and  the same having been granted them by  the  decision of January 11, 1917, the proper  decree  was  issued on April 10th  of the  same year,  and the proper certificate of title Was issued  in their favor.  In the course of that registration proceeding the defendants presented the document Exhibit 3 in  support of their  application.  Said document  appears to be dated August 6,  1911 and  subscribed before a  notary on the 13th of the same month and  shows that the three brothers, Leon,  Jose and Prudencio Temporal redeemed these lands from Pedro Lopez de Leon by paying him the  P1,200 for  which they were mortgaged.  They also presented the document Exhibit A, dated August 21,  1911,  and  subscribed to before a notary on the same date,  wherein it appears that the said brothers Leon, Jose  and Prudencio Temporal sold  these lands to the defendants.  Upon  the strength of such evidence the lands were adjudicated  to the defendants as above stated. On November 4, 1920, Florencia  de Dios, alleging to be the owner of the lands so adjudicated to  the defendants in that registration proceeding, brought  a  civil  action for the annulment of the certificate of title  issued to the defendants,  or for  damages,  alleging that the  defendants obtained  the issuance of said  certificate by  fraud. Said fraud is made to consist in their having  presented in said registration proceeding, Exhibits  A  and 3,  which  she alleges were falsified.   In the decision  rendered in  that case no finding was  made  as  to  Exhibit  A, but  it was insinuated that Exhibit 3 appeared to have been tampered with.  In that action the brothers Jose and  Leon Tem- poral,  two  of the  herein plaintiffs, supported Florencia de Dios in their  contention, declaring that she was the real owner of the lands, having purchased them  from  their grandfather, Martin Temporal, and giving it to understand that they did not .consider  themselves to have any right to said lands.   That action filed by Florencia de Dios was adversely decided by the  lower court as  well  as  by this court to which it came on  appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup><br><br>The plaintiffs, alleging that they are the heirs of Martin Temporal and that  the  defendants acquired title to said lands by fraud,  now pray that the defendants  be ordered to indemnify them for damages.   Said  fraud  is made to consist, as  in the  action filed by Florencia  de Dios,  in defendants having presented Exhibits A  and 3 in that registration proceeding, which are alleged  to be falsified, in support of their application and by means thereof obtained the issuance of the title to them.<br><br>As to Exhibit 3  it is said  that its  true date is that of  September 13,  1911,  and that  this was  changed  to August 6th  of the same  year, so it would not appear that the lands were sold  to the defendants before having been redeemed from Pedro Lopez.   It is claimed that the date of this document was thus altered, because it  shows the month of September as  appearing on the stamps affixed thereon, and that in the  ratification before the notary the word "August"  was erased  and  the word "September" written over it. At most, however, this  indicates that the document was ratified before  a notary in  September, but it  does not prove that it was  not executed in August. We do not  believe  that  said document was falsified.   At all  events, the  defendants took no part in its execution and there is no  proof that they participated in its alteration, even supposing that it was altered.<br><br>Neither is there any proof that Exhibit A is false.  Leon Temporal, one of the plaintiffs, admits that he subscribed said document, although he claims he did so because he was given to understand that it was a deed  of  sale  to  the lands executed by Florencia de  Dios  in favor of the defendants.   But we  are at  a loss to  understand why he subscribed to it for this reason if he was, as he now asserts he  is,  one of the owners of these lands.  Said plaintiff further admits that after he had subscribed that document, he was made to take charge of the lands by the defendants for three years.  And it is  indeed strange that two of the herein plaintiffs,  Leon and  Jose Temporal,  claim to have a right in these lands as heirs of Martin Temporal, after having testified in the  civil action instituted by Florencia de  Dios that  they had no such  right  and that  the lands belonged to her, she having purchased them from Martin Temporal.<br><br>The fraud alleged by the plaintiffs as the basis of their action was  not committed in the course  of the  registration proceeding, but in the documents presented as evidence therein.  The plaintiffs did not then take  any steps to protect their alleged rights and  to  content  these documents.  Under such circumstances the  plaintiffs  should present complete  proof,  which  they  have  not  done, In order to establish  such fraud.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the  appellants. So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor,  Ostrand, Johns, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> De Dios vs. Mateo and Pantaleon, G.
