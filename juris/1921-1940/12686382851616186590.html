				<H3>IN THE MATTER  OF  THE  VOLUNTARY INSOLVENCY OF THE CAPIZ CENTRAL.  URQUIJO, ZULOAGA Y ESCUBI, PETITIONER, <I>VS.</I> TIMOTEO UNSON AND HIS WIFE, CLARA LACSON,  JOSE ALTAVAS, ANTONIO  BELO, AND HONORABLE FRANCISCO SANTAMARIA,  JUDGE  OF  FIRST  INSTANCE  OF  ILOILO, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an application for a writ of mandamus to compel the respondent&nbsp; Judge of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Iloilo to approve, sign, and certify a record on&nbsp; appeal from an order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; September 24, 1925, in&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; of the voluntary insolvency of the&nbsp; Capiz Central,&nbsp; whereby his Honor recognized the claims&nbsp; of the respondents, Timoteo Unson and his wife,&nbsp; Clara Lacson, Jose Altavas, and Antonio Belo,&nbsp; as&nbsp; preferential&nbsp; claims&nbsp; against the&nbsp; estate of said&nbsp; insolvent and further admitting the claim&nbsp; of the petitioner, Urquijo,&nbsp; Zuloaga y Escubi,&nbsp; as an ordinary unpreferred debt against said insolvent, but nevertheless denying the preferential character of said latter claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon presentation of the petition in this court the usual order requiring the&nbsp; respondents to appear&nbsp; and show cause, if any there be, why the remedy prayed for should not be granted was issued,&nbsp; in obedience to which the various respondents appeared and&nbsp; answered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the submission of the cause for the&nbsp; determination of the matters involved it was found that the respondents were insisting upon more than one point as grounds for denial of&nbsp; the relief sought, and one of these points appeared to be of a preliminary&nbsp; character. It was accordingly disposed of by this court in a resolution of December 21, 1925; and as&nbsp; the point embodied&nbsp; in this resolution appears to be of some importance as a matter of practice, it will be here stated.<br><br>In this connection it appears that the petition, as&nbsp; tendered, did not set out substantially the&nbsp; record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal to which the signature of the respondent judge was desired, nor&nbsp; was any affidavit attached to the complaint containing the&nbsp; required verification&nbsp; by the attorney of the truth of the record on appeal, as tendered by the party or his lawyer, the oath appearing thereon merely reciting that the attorney for the petitioner was informed of the facts alleged in the petition and that the same were true to the best of his knowledge and&nbsp; information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Objection having&nbsp; been made in behalf of the respondents&nbsp; to the sufficiency of the petition in the respects mentioned, this court, in the&nbsp; resolution above-mentioned, sustained the objection and ordered the cause to be dismissed, unless within&nbsp; fifteen days after notification&nbsp; of the order the petitioner should submit to the court a properly verified record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal, consistently with the&nbsp; practice observed in applications for mandamus to compel the signing of&nbsp; a bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; exceptions. This order having now been&nbsp; complied with, we now proceed to consider the other grounds relied&nbsp; on as constituting a justification of the position taken by the trial judge in&nbsp; refusing to certify the record on appeal.<br><br>The first proposition which the attorney for the&nbsp; respondents propounds is that under existing law mandamus does not lie to compel a&nbsp; judge&nbsp; of a Court of First Instance to sign and certify a record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal; and attention is&nbsp; directed to the fact that section 499 of the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure, which provides&nbsp; for the remedy of mandamus to compel a judge to certify a bill of exceptions is not applicable to the certification of a record on appeal.&nbsp; The reason&nbsp; for this,&nbsp; as pointed out&nbsp; in the argument of the attorney for respondents,&nbsp; is that when that section was enacted into law the record on appeal was not required to be approved, signed, or certified by the judges from whose judgment or order the appeal was&nbsp; intended to be taken. As the law then stood the&nbsp; record on appeal was prepared in this court from certified copies&nbsp; of the orders,&nbsp; decrees, or judgments of the court below, and the trial judge had no intervention in the matter.&nbsp; By rule 16 of Courts of First Instance, effective January 1,&nbsp; 1919, it&nbsp; was prescribed&nbsp; by this court for the first time&nbsp; that the record on appeal should be approved by&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial judge.&nbsp; From this&nbsp; circumstance, as well as from the circumstance that section&nbsp; 499 specifically&nbsp; refers only&nbsp; to bill&nbsp; of exceptions,&nbsp; the inference is drawn that section 499 cannot&nbsp; be invoked as a ground for allowing a writ&nbsp; of mandamus&nbsp; to compel the judge to approve and certify a record on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument is no doubt correct in so far as&nbsp; respects the application of section&nbsp; 499 of the Code of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; But it must be borne in mind that&nbsp; under section 515 of the same Code this court is given original jurisdiction over Courts of First Instance and the&nbsp; judges thereof whenever said court&nbsp; or judge "unlawfully neglects the performance of a duty which the law specifically or especially enjoins as a duty&nbsp; imposed upon such court or judge." Now the rules of this court, adopted pursuant to law, have the force of law; and when it is required by rule 16 that the judges of the Courts of First Instance shall approve the record&nbsp; on appeal&nbsp; before transmission to this court,&nbsp; the writ of mandamus undoubtedly lies to compel the performance of this duty.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was not necessary that any&nbsp; special&nbsp; provision should be made granting the writ of mandamus for negligence in the&nbsp; performance of this duty.<br><br>In the second place it is&nbsp; contended that no appeal whatever lies from the order from which appeal&nbsp; is sought to be taken in this case for&nbsp; the reason that the order complained of was not made at the hearing of an account of the assignee in insolvency.<br><br>Section 82 of the Insolvency Law&nbsp; (Act No.&nbsp; 1956)&nbsp; in the part here material to&nbsp; be quoted, reads as follows:<br><blockquote> "SEC. 82. An appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court in the&nbsp; following cases:<br><br>"1 *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>"2. From an order made at the hearing of any account of an assignee, allowing or rejecting a creditor's claim, in whole or in part, when the&nbsp; amount in dispute exceeds three hundred pesos."<br></blockquote>It should be noted that&nbsp; the order from which the petitioner&nbsp; here seeks to appeal involved&nbsp; an&nbsp; adjudication of a claim far in excess of the P300 limit specified in the statute, amounting in fact to many thousands of&nbsp; pesos.&nbsp; No question&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; can be made&nbsp; as to the sufficiency of&nbsp; the amount in controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the point upon which reliance is chiefly placed by the respondents is that the order complained of&nbsp; was not made at the hearing of an account of the assignee in the sense&nbsp; intended by the statute.&nbsp; The situation with respect to this feature of&nbsp; the case appears to be&nbsp; that after the&nbsp; various claimants&nbsp; with which this petition is&nbsp; concerned had filed their claims in&nbsp; the court of insolvency, that court especially set a day, namely, August 25, 1925, as the date for "the hearing of any and all claims against the insolvent."&nbsp; Subsequent to said&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; his Honor,&nbsp; Judge Rovira, who was then presiding, made the order of September 24, 1925.&nbsp; On the date mentioned no account of the assignee, requiring the court to pass upon debits or credits of the assignee, was in fact heard; and the order complained of&nbsp; was&nbsp; determined upon the issue raised by the several claimants wherein preferential rights with&nbsp; respect to their claims&nbsp; were asserted by them.&nbsp; It is insisted that no&nbsp; account of the assignee having been heard or discussed at the hearing referred to no appeal will lie.<br><br>Although the position taken&nbsp; by the attorney for the respondents finds some support&nbsp; in the strict letter of the statute, we are of the opinion&nbsp; that the contention against the appealable character&nbsp; of the order in question&nbsp; is not well founded; and the right of appeal must be respected. It may&nbsp; be admitted that the right of appeal in insolvency cases is governed by the Insolvency Law; but it should be remembered that provisions of this character are of a remedial nature and should be liberally interpreted in furtherance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; right of&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; The statute&nbsp; above quoted undoubtedly assumes that an&nbsp; order allowing or rejecting a creditor's&nbsp; claim will be made at some hearing of the accounts of the assignee.&nbsp; But the words "made at the hearing of any account of an assignee" do not in our opinion state a condition precedent to the maintenance of an appeal. Those words are rather descriptive&nbsp; of the conditions under which orders allowing or rejecting&nbsp; the&nbsp; claims are supposedly&nbsp; made; but it was not intended that if a court departs from this practice and allows or rejects&nbsp; a creditor's claim at some other&nbsp; stage of the proceeding than upon the hearing of an account of the assignee, the right of appeal shall not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose, we think, was that the right of appeal should exist from orders allowing or rejecting claims in whole or in part, when the amount in dispute exceeds P300; and the&nbsp; circumstance that the statute supposes such orders to be made at the hearing of an account of the assignee does not defeat the right of appeal when the order is&nbsp; made&nbsp; at some other time or stage of the proceedings; It&nbsp; is a well-known fact that our Insolvency Act is an adaptation from the obsolete Insolvency Law of the State of California, which in turn was based upon the&nbsp; United States Bankruptcy Act of 1867.&nbsp; We note that in the Bankruptcy Act now in force in&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; the&nbsp; provision has been&nbsp; changed, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; result&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; embarrassment created by the words mentioned has been done away with. We are of the opinion, however, that even as the law stands in&nbsp; our Insolvency Law the right of appeal exists under the circumstances existing in this&nbsp; case. A contrary interpretation of the law on this point would lead to the result that a court could completely frustrate the right of appeal from orders affecting claims by simply passing upon them at some other stage than at the&nbsp; hearing of an account of the&nbsp; assignee.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; could not&nbsp; have&nbsp; been intended by the lawmaker.<br><br>Another contention put forth in behalf of the respondents and argued by their attorney with much vigor has reference to the fact that the petitioner is not attempting to appeal from so much of the questioned order as&nbsp; recognizes the validity of the claims of the petitioner and of the creditor respondents,&nbsp; but only from so much of said order as concedes priority to the claims of&nbsp; said respondents and denies priority to the claim of the petitioner,—all of which appears from&nbsp; the exception taken to said order by the attorney for the petitioner on September 25,&nbsp; 1925.&nbsp; The contention is that in order to be appealable an order must be one allowing or rejecting a&nbsp; creditor's claim in whole or in part with respect to the amount of the claim and not with respect to the declaration of its&nbsp; preferential or nonpreferential character.&nbsp; In this connection it will be well to&nbsp; state that the property of the insolvent appears to consist chiefly of the proceeds of the&nbsp; machinery&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; grinder, which&nbsp; has already been sold&nbsp; for the&nbsp; sum of P80,266.&nbsp; The claim of the respondents&nbsp; Unson&nbsp; and wife is in&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P30,000; that of Altavas is in the amount of P8,000, while that of Belo is in the amount of P11,000.&nbsp; The claim of each&nbsp; of these&nbsp; creditors&nbsp; was&nbsp; allowed in the&nbsp; respective amounts stated,&nbsp; and they were&nbsp; declared to be entitled to preference in the order stated, owing to liens acquired by said creditors by virtue of attachments obtained by them respectively in connection with&nbsp; certain civil&nbsp; actions&nbsp; previously instituted by&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; claim of the petitioner, Urquijo, Zuloaga y Escubi,&nbsp; is in the amount of P90,000; but with respect to P30,000 of this claim the petitioner asserts a priority, claiming a vendor's lien&nbsp; under&nbsp; article 1922 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; The trial court admitted the petitioner's claim in its entire amount in the character of an ordinary credit but rejected the claim to any preference with respect thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the petitioner desires to put an issue in the appellate court only so much of the order referred to as relates to the allowance of preference in favor of the claims of the respondent creditors and to the&nbsp; denial of the&nbsp; preference with respect to the claim of petitioner.<br><br>It is insisted&nbsp; for the&nbsp; respondents that the descriptive words&nbsp; "in whole or in part" which appear in subsection 2 of section 82 of the Insolvency Law immediately following the words "allowing or rejecting a creditor's claim" refer to the amount of the claim allowed or rejected&nbsp; and not to its preferential or nonpreferential character.&nbsp; It is therefore supposed that the exception taken by the attorney for the petitioner is not broad&nbsp; enough to justify the appeal, or rather that the appellate court has&nbsp; no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal with respect to the feature mentioned. We are of the opinion that this proposition is based upon too narrow an interpretation of the language of the statute. We think that in allowing or rejecting a claim to a preference the court allows or rejects a claim&nbsp; in whole&nbsp; or in part within the meaning of the statute.&nbsp; In support&nbsp; of the narrower interpretation proposed by the attorney for the respondents certain decisions from American Bankruptcy courts&nbsp; are cited which hold that under the existing&nbsp; Bankruptcy Act of 1898&nbsp; an order allowing or disallowing&nbsp; a preference is not appealable.&nbsp; But we note&nbsp; that the statute provides&nbsp; another&nbsp; way for securing the review of such an order, which is by petition to revise.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; refinement of procedure is not&nbsp; in harmony&nbsp; with our statute, which we consider broad enough to justify an appeal not only with respect to the amount but with respect to the preferential or nonpreferential character of the claim.&nbsp; If a preference is disallowed in a case where&nbsp; the assets are not sufficient to satisfy all creditors, the effect of&nbsp; the order&nbsp; is to deprive the creditor asserting such preference of a part of the amount&nbsp; of his claim to the same&nbsp; extent as if a part of the amount of&nbsp; the claim had been expressly disallowed; and&nbsp; similarly the allowance of&nbsp; a preference in&nbsp; favor of one creditor&nbsp; deprives the other ordinary creditors of a part of the proceeds which might have been distributed among them.<br><br>Lastly&nbsp; it is contended that the order from which the petitioner attempts to appeal was correct and that the writ of mandamus, even if obtained, would be of no&nbsp; practical benefit to him.&nbsp; We&nbsp; are of the&nbsp; opinion that this&nbsp; point is one not proper to be considered upon application of the character now before us, since it deals with the merits of the case,—a&nbsp; matter appropriate to be ventilated when the cause reaches this court upon appeal.<br><br>It results from&nbsp; the foregoing&nbsp; that the petitioner is en titled to a writ of&nbsp; mandamus and the same will be granted, with costs against&nbsp; the respondents other than the respondent judge.<br><br><i>Avanceña,&nbsp; C.
