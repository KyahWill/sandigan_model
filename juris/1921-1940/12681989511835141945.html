				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT OF  THE PHILIPPINE  ISLANDS,  PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLANT, VS.  THE BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS,  DEFENDANT  AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The question submitted for our decision is whether the facts&nbsp; alleged in the complaint by the Government are sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant bank.<br><br>The Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; sustained the demurrer, but the Government contends that the ruling was erroneous and prays, for the reasons given in its brief, that it be&nbsp; reversed and the record remanded to the court below for further proceedings.<br><br>The allegations of the&nbsp; complaint relevant to the point in question&nbsp; are the following:<br><blockquote>"2. That&nbsp; on October 10, 1919, a&nbsp; certain Mr. Federico Luchsinger, then a resident of the Philippine Islands, sold his Hacienda Progreso in La Carlota, Occidental Negros, to Messrs.&nbsp; Urquijo, Zuloaga&nbsp; and Escubi also of La Carlota, Occidental Negros, for the sum of 1*275,000, payable in five annual installments of P55,000 each.<br><br>"3. That,&nbsp; thereafter, or on October 14, 1919, the said Federico Luchsinger appointed&nbsp; the defendant herein&nbsp; his true&nbsp; and lawful attorney-in-fact with full&nbsp; power among other things to collect all&nbsp; credits standing in&nbsp; his favor in these Islands and to pay to the Government of the Philippine Islands such taxes as might from time to time be due from him.<br><br>"4. That, thereafter, the said Federico Luchsinger&nbsp; left the Philippine Islands to reside in Paris, France, where he has since remained and that he no longer has any real estate property in these Islands.<br><br>"5. That, thereafter, or&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 20, 1920, June 20, 1921, June 20,&nbsp; 1922,&nbsp; June 20, 1923,&nbsp; and June 20,&nbsp; 1924,&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; collected&nbsp; from Messrs.&nbsp; Urquijo,&nbsp; Zuloaga,&nbsp; and Escubi the sum&nbsp; of P55,000 on each&nbsp; of the aforementioned dates, or a total of P275,000,&nbsp; the same representing&nbsp; the total selling price of the <i>Hacienda Progreso</i> which the aforementioned Federico Luchsinger had sold to Messrs. Urquijo, Zuloaga, and Escubi.<br><br>"6. That in the sale&nbsp; of the said hacienda for the sum of P275,000, a net profit of P139,000 was realized by the vendor, which, distributed among the&nbsp; five years in which the payments were made, represented net profits of P27,800 for each of the years from&nbsp; 1920 to 1925, inclusive.<br><br>"7. That on February 28, 1921, March&nbsp; 10, 1922,&nbsp; March 23, 1923, February 27,&nbsp; 1924, and February 26, 1925, the defendant,&nbsp; acting as attorney-in-fact of the said Federico Luchsinger, filed income-tax&nbsp; returns on behalf of the latter in which returns the defendant omitted to mention the net income&nbsp; represented by the collection of the payments for the sale of&nbsp; the <i>Hacienda Progreso</i>.<br><br>"8. That the amount of income tax due from the said Federico Luchsinger on the profit realized from" the sale of the property in question is P5,077.87.<br><br>"9. That due demand for the payment of the taxes mentioned above from the Bank of the Philippine Islands has been made by the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal Revenue but, notwithstanding said demand,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant has failed and refused and still fails and refuses to pay the same.<br><br>"10. That the said amount of P5,077.87 is&nbsp; subject to a surcharge of 5 per cent or&nbsp; P253.89 and bears interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from January 20, 1928, to date of&nbsp; payment.<br><br>"Wherefore, the plaintiff prays this court to render judgment ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P5,077.87 plus P253.89, with interest on the P5,077.87 from January 20,&nbsp; 1928, together with the&nbsp; costs of this action.<br><br>"Plaintiff also prays&nbsp; for such&nbsp; other relief as this court may deem just and equitable."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pages&nbsp; 2 and 3, Bill of Exceptions.)</blockquote>Section 9, paragraphs (b) and (c)&nbsp; of&nbsp; our Income Tax Law, Act No. 2833, imposes the duty upon agents of making a complete return of the income and profits of their principal, paying the proper tax thereon.<br><br>The complaint&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; allege that the defendant bank was or was not aware that the sale&nbsp; of estate had netted a profit to&nbsp; their principal; that is to say, that said principal had received an&nbsp; income subject&nbsp; to the tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the complaint have alleged this in order to establish the defendant's liability, or&nbsp; may&nbsp; it be presumed from what has been alleged that the defendant bank was&nbsp; positively aware of it? We believe the complaint need not allege that the defendant bank knew of such income, because being an agent of&nbsp; said Luchsinger&nbsp; especially&nbsp; authorized with&nbsp; full&nbsp; power&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay all the taxes due the Government from the latter, the&nbsp; presumption is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,&nbsp; that the defendant bank as agent knew or would know in due time all the taxable income of its principal.<br><br>It should likewise be remembered that the&nbsp; defendant's obligation which the complaint alleges to have been breached,&nbsp; did not arise from&nbsp; a contract, but from the law, and&nbsp; it is therefore sufficient if the complaint alleges the breach of such obligation.<br><br>"Where the cause of action arises&nbsp; out of the breach&nbsp; of a duty owed by defendant to plaintiff, the declaration,&nbsp; complaint, or petition should show the right of plaintiff and the duty of defendant, and state the nature of the duty and the facts from which it arose.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been considered, however, that <i>if the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; is one imposed&nbsp; by law, and involves no element of contract it need not be expressly alleged</i>.&nbsp; There must also be an&nbsp; allegation of a&nbsp; breach of the duty,&nbsp; and while this may be averred by way of&nbsp; a conclusion&nbsp; it&nbsp; is necessary to state the&nbsp; facts which are relied on as constituting such breach."&nbsp;&nbsp; (49&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; 143,&nbsp; 144.)<br><br>The complaint&nbsp; states that the defendant bank failed to include in the proper tax returns the income here in question.&nbsp; Assuming that it was&nbsp; the defendant's legal duty to do&nbsp; so, such a failure constitutes&nbsp; a <i>prima facie</i> breach of duty.&nbsp; And if&nbsp; it has&nbsp; any excuse or reason for such an omission which does not appear in the complaint, the defendant&nbsp; was bound&nbsp; to&nbsp; allege it in its answer.<br><br>We therefore hold that the complaint as it is,&nbsp; gives rise to the presumption that the defendant bank knew of the income in question, and taken in connection&nbsp; with this presumption which has not been overcome or&nbsp; destroyed, the facts alleged in the complaint constitute a sufficient cause of action against the defendant bank.<br><br>If the latter, through excusable ignorance, did not know of the income in question&nbsp; of&nbsp; its principal Luchsinger, or for any&nbsp; other legally sufficient reason believes it has&nbsp; any defense to set up against the complaint, and to relieve itself of responsibility, it may in its answer allege such defense, and later establish&nbsp; it&nbsp; at the trial for the decision of the competent court.<br><br>But the complaint,&nbsp; as it stands,&nbsp; alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br><br>For all these considerations, the order appealed from is reversed and the defendant's demurrer overruled, and it is ordered that the record be remanded to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> for further&nbsp; proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Johnson,&nbsp; Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
