				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an application&nbsp; for certiorari&nbsp; which presents&nbsp; the question of whether the order of the Public Service Commission which&nbsp; is challenged was&nbsp; without the jurisdiction of the&nbsp; commission.&nbsp; This&nbsp; question,&nbsp; in turn,&nbsp; requires&nbsp; a ruling on the question raised by the petitioner as to when a decision of the Public Service Commission becomes final.<br><br>The petitioner herein,&nbsp; the Rural Transit Company,&nbsp; filed with the Public Service&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; on August&nbsp; 30, 1929, an&nbsp; application&nbsp; for a certificate of&nbsp; public&nbsp; convenience. Written oppositions were interposed by several parties, among whom was Pedro Sumaquiao.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case was heard on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1929,&nbsp; without the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of either Pedro Sumaquiao or his attorney.&nbsp; Accordingly, on May 31, 1930,&nbsp; the&nbsp; associate&nbsp; commissioner&nbsp; rendered his&nbsp; decision granting the application for the lines applied for.&nbsp; In the decision there&nbsp; was a provision to&nbsp; the effect that the same&nbsp; should become final thirty days after the notification of the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of the decision was&nbsp; served on all the parties, including&nbsp; Pedro Sumaquiao, on June 5, 1930. After the expiration of the thirty-day period, or to be exact, on&nbsp; July 11,&nbsp; 1930,&nbsp; Pedro Sumaquiao&nbsp; filed a&nbsp; motion for rehearing.&nbsp; Opposition to this motion Was&nbsp; registered by the Rural Transit Company, but&nbsp; the same was granted by the associate&nbsp; commissioner in&nbsp; an order of&nbsp; October&nbsp; 9, 1930,&nbsp; which suspended the effects of the decision previously promulgated.&nbsp;&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration presented on behalf of the&nbsp; Rural Transit&nbsp; Company was&nbsp; denied, after which it was requested that it be decided, if the decision of the associate&nbsp; commissioner was&nbsp; final,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the motion for rehearing was filed.&nbsp; When the commissioner sustained his authority in the premises, these certiorari&nbsp; proceedings were&nbsp; initiated.<br><br>Section 35 of the Public&nbsp; Service Law, Act No. 3108, as amended, provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; "Any order made by the commission may be reviewed&nbsp; on the application of any&nbsp; person or public service affected&nbsp; thereby, by certiorari in appropriate cases, or by petition, to&nbsp; the Supreme Court, within thirty days&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date upon which such order becomes effective."&nbsp; Section 28&nbsp; of the same law further&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that "The Commission, at any time,&nbsp; may order a rehearing to extend,&nbsp; revoke, or modify any order made by&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a case has been decided after the rehearing, any interested party may, if he so desires, take an appeal to the Supreme Court by following the procedure prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; section thirty-five of this Act,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; In actual practice also, the commission, pursuant to its rule making power, inserts a proviso such as is to be found in the decision in this case, making the decision final after thirty days for the purposes of appeal.<br><br>The facts not being in dispute, and&nbsp; the applicable law being known, we address attention to the question suggested in the beginning of this opinion.&nbsp; We&nbsp; note no vagueness in the law.&nbsp; We experience no hesitancy in announcing the rule which&nbsp; should&nbsp; be followed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankly&nbsp; speaking,&nbsp; what is the use in debating the question whether a motion for rehearing was filed in time,&nbsp; when the law gives the Public Service&nbsp; Commission full power&nbsp; to grant&nbsp; a&nbsp; rehearing <i>at any time</i>?<br><br>To elucidate further, let us suppose, as in this case, that notice of the decision was served on the parties&nbsp; on June 5, 1930.&nbsp; Under the law and pursuant to recognized practice, the losing party had thirty days within which to file&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration and&nbsp; within&nbsp; which to take the necessary steps to elevate the case to the Supreme Court by certiorari or petition for review.&nbsp; After the expiration of that thirty-day period, the decision would become final and unappealable.&nbsp;&nbsp; But at any&nbsp; time,&nbsp; for instance&nbsp; as&nbsp; in this case on&nbsp; July 11, 1930, or six days after the decision&nbsp; became final, for the purposes of appeal, the&nbsp; commission could legally order a rehearing on&nbsp; any order made&nbsp; by it.&nbsp; It is, therefore, perfectly&nbsp; clear that the decisions or orders of the Public Service Commission&nbsp; become final&nbsp; after thirty days not in&nbsp; the sense that it loses control over the same to revive them&nbsp; for the purpose either of extending, revoking, or&nbsp; modifying them, but in the sense that no appeal therefrom may be taken to the Supreme Court.<br><br>We&nbsp; hold that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public Service&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; acted properly in the exercise of&nbsp; discretionary jurisdiction&nbsp; expressly conferred by law upon the Public Service Commission in granting&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; rehearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the application will be denied, with the costs of this instance against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
