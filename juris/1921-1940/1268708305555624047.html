				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal by the plaintiff from&nbsp; a judgment of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; dismissing the complaint with costs against the plaintiffs.<br><br>The&nbsp; plaintiffs allege in their complaint,&nbsp; among other things,&nbsp; that&nbsp; some time during the year 1917,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Roque Ferer borrowed two hundred fifty pesos from the said Casimiro Tinio, with interest at the usurious rate of 24 per centum per annum; that as security for the said loan,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Roque Ferer conveyed to the said Casimiro Tinio by way&nbsp; of mortgage the parcel of land described in the complaint;&nbsp; that on July 27, 1919, the said Roque Ferer paid to the said Casimiro Tinio sixty pesos as interest on the said loan for the&nbsp; year 1917- 1918; and on&nbsp; May 29,&nbsp; 1920,&nbsp; he paid to the said&nbsp; Casimiro Tinio a second sixty pesos as interest on the said loan for the year 1918-1919;&nbsp; that some time during the year 1924,&nbsp; the said Casimiro Tinio took possession of the land above described and retained possession thereof until his death,&nbsp; after which the defendant administrators of his estate succeeded him&nbsp; in possession of the said land;&nbsp; that the said Casimiro Tinio and the defendants administrators&nbsp; of his estate have received the fruits from the&nbsp; land above described ever since the year 1924; that notwithstanding the fact&nbsp; that the plaintiffs have repeatedly made known to&nbsp; the defendants their desire to redeem the said land,&nbsp; and notwithstanding the further fact that the plaintiffs have&nbsp; made repeated&nbsp; demands on the defendants for an accounting for the fruits received therefrom,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said defendants have refused and continue to refuse to render an account.<br><br>The plaintiffs therefore pray judgment for an accounting for the fruits received from the land described in the complaint; for the cancellation of the mortgage also alleged in&nbsp; the complain upon the payment of the debt secured thereby;&nbsp; for the return of the land to the plaintiffs;&nbsp; and for the refund of all interest paid on the loan.<br><br>In her&nbsp; answer&nbsp; the defendant denies each and&nbsp; every allegation of the complaint, and as a special defense alleges that the contract of sale mentioned in her original&nbsp; answer having been executed by Roque&nbsp; Ferer,&nbsp; who is now deceased,&nbsp; without questioning&nbsp; its genuineness,&nbsp; legality,&nbsp; and authenticity, during his life&nbsp; time, the plaintiffs are now estopped and barred to object to its legality and&nbsp; genuineness."<br><br>After a careful examination we cannot find sufficient evidence in the record&nbsp; to prove the plaintiffs' allegations; on the contrary,&nbsp; the evidence of&nbsp; the defendant seems more clear and admits but little doubt as to Tinio's ownership of the land in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment appealed from is affirmed without<br><br>Ten days after the promulgation of this decision final judgnent will be entered,&nbsp; and five days thereafter the record will be remanded to the court below.<br><br>It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J. Johnson,&nbsp; Villamor,</i> and <i>Villa-Real,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
