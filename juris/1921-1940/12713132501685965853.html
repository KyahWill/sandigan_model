				G.R. No. 29147, November 21, 1928</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DELFIN PARCASIO ET AL., DEFENDANTS. DELFIN PARCASIO, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court of First Instance of Leyte convicted the appellant, 
Delfin Parcasio, of homicide committed on the person of Romualdo Bitangjol, and 
sentenced him to seventeen years, four months and one day <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, 
with the accessory penalties, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum 
of P1,000, and to pay one-fourth of the costs. 
<p align="justify">On the night of August 27, 1927, the appellant visited a 
certain young woman by the name of Antonina Ojida at her house in the 
municipality of Abuyog, Province of Leyte, and while there Romualdo Bitangjol, 
the deceased, also came in. Appellant asked Antonina Ojida to sing, but she 
replied that he begin for she did not know how to sing. Whereupon Bitangjol 
laughed and the appellant went away telling them to <span style="font-style: italic;">wait</span>. The deceased having 
observed this attitude of the appellant, he, too, went downstairs, remarking, in 
turn, "There seems to be something wrong." A few moments afterwards the two met 
in the cockpit in which the deceased's body was found later. </p>
<p align="justify">On the following day Ulpiano Fernandez, a Constabulary soldier, 
found an anonymous letter (Exhibit C), on the threshold of his house which 
stated that the person responsible for Romualdo's death was the herein appellant 
and that he had thrown away the dagger used near a <span style="font-style: italic;">malobago</span> tree in the vicinity 
of the cockpit. In fact a blood-stained dagger (Exhibit B), bearing the initials 
D. P. on the handle, was found at the place indicated. </p>
<p align="justify">Leon Ojida testified that on that night he saw the appellant 
strike the deceased with a dagger near the cockpit. He went up and separated 
them. When Romualdo found himself wounded he ran away and the appellant did 
likewise. But the latter first warned Ojida to tell no one what he had seen. 
This witness recognized Exhibit B as the dagger used by the appellant in 
attacking the deceased, and the same one which the appellant usually carried. 
Cleto Abejar, another witness, testified that on the same night he, too, saw 
Leon Ojida coming from the cockpit with the appellant behind him. </p>
<p align="justify">The defense tried to prove that it was one Serapio de Paz who 
attacked the deceased, introducing for this purpose, the witnesses Matias Dorsa 
and Teodora Montejo, who stated that they saw Serapio de Paz attack the 
deceased. But it appears that when these witnesses were called before the 
justice of the peace and before the municipal chief of police during the 
investigation conducted on the day following the incident, they declared that 
they knew nothing whatever of what had happened. These witnesses deserve no 
credit and the trial court in not believing their testimony committed no error. 
</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court imposed upon the appellant the maximum penalty 
prescribed for homicide, taking into account the aggravating circumstance No. 24 
of article 10 of the Penal Code, considering the dagger used in the aggression 
as a prohibited arm. We agree with the Attorney-General that such circumstance 
was not present and hence that the medium penalty prescribed by law should be 
imposed. A dagger is not <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> a prohibited arm and becomes so only when 
carried about concealed (Act No. 1780). It does not appear that the appellant 
concealed the dagger he had before the aggression. On the other hand, since the 
mere carrying about of a concealed dagger is in itself a crime especially 
punished by Act No. 1780, such circumstance cannot be considered for the purpose 
of increasing the penalty of another crime, in the commission of which it was 
present. (Art. 78, Penal Code.) </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, it being understood that the appellant is sentenced 
to fourteen years, eight months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, the judgment 
appealed from is hereby affirmed with the costs. So ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
