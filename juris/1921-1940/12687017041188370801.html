				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was commenced in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Camarines Norte on July 25, 1928.&nbsp; Its&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; was to&nbsp; recover two&nbsp; parcels of land situated in the municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Daet,&nbsp; of said province.<br><br>The intervenor Monico Cabanela alleged that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was the&nbsp; owner of one of said parcels with an area of about thirty&nbsp; hectares, having acquired the same as homestead from the Government.&nbsp; The defendants Pablo and Laureano Cabanela alleged that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were&nbsp; in possession of the other parcel, as applicants for homestead.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Director of Lands in his answer alleged that the&nbsp; lands belonged&nbsp; to the&nbsp; public domain and that the plaintiffs'&nbsp; right&nbsp; therein,&nbsp; if any, had&nbsp; been lost by abandonment.<br><br>Upon the issue thus presented the cause was&nbsp; brought&nbsp; on&nbsp; for trial.&nbsp; After hearing the evidence the honorable&nbsp; A. M. Recto,&nbsp; judge, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring&nbsp; that they were the owners of the parcels of land in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; but that the defendants were entitled to recover the value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; improvements thereon, without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; dispositive part of the decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"POR LAS COUSIDERACIONES EXPUESTAS, el&nbsp; Juzgado&nbsp; declara que las dos porciones de terrene, descritas&nbsp; en&nbsp; la contestacion enmendada de los demandados de fecVia 18&nbsp; de&nbsp; marzn de&nbsp; 1928 e indicadas como lote No. 1 y ' x' en el plano Exhibit&nbsp; 'C de las demandantes, son de la propiedad ds estas por hallarse coraprendidas dentro del titulo de informacion posesoria Exhibit 'D' expedido a favor de&nbsp; su causante, Ignacio Mopera, y que el tercerista Mcmico Cabanela y los demandados laureano y Pablo Cabanela, por haberlas sembrado de buena fe, tienen derecho a resarcirse del&nbsp; valor de sus siembras,&nbsp; en la forma arriba expuesta; sin expreso pronunciamiento&nbsp; en cuanto a las costas."</blockquote>From that judgment the defendants appealed.&nbsp; Later&nbsp; the Director of Lands withdrew his appeal.<br><br>The appellants now contend that&nbsp; the lower court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; —<br><blockquote><ol> <li>In finding that exhibits A, B and D show that the parcels of land in question form part of the land&nbsp; described therein; and </li><li> In not&nbsp; holding that the plaintiffs have lost their right in the land by abandonment&nbsp; in other words, that their right of action has prescribed.</li></ol></blockquote>An examination of exhibits A, B, and D fails to&nbsp; show that the lands therein referred to are the two parcels now in question, or that these two parcels form part of the lands mentioned&nbsp; in said exhibits.&nbsp; The boundaries of the lands therein described are different from the boundaries of the two parcels in question as given in Exhibit C.&nbsp; No satisfactory explanation was given&nbsp; for said difference.<br><br>Furthermore, Exhibit D, which the lower court erroneously Called possessory information title,&nbsp; is not such title.&nbsp; It is only an application for said title, filed with the Government by the father of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; However, no title was ever issued, evidently for applicant's failure to prosecute.&nbsp; At the bottom of the last page of said Exhibit D is a <u>providencia</u>,&nbsp; for the hearing of said application on a certain date, in the presence of the promotor fiscal; but no such hearing was held and no adjudication of title was made to the applicant.<br><br>The second contention,&nbsp; to wit, abandonment or prescription, is supported by the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Monico Cabanela applied for lot No. 1 as homestead in 1917,&nbsp; the encargado of the plaintiffs filed an opposition with the&nbsp; Director of Lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said opposition was denied in January,&nbsp; 1918,&nbsp; "but&nbsp; the plaintiffs took no further steps to assert their alleged right until the&nbsp; lapse&nbsp; of more than ten years,&nbsp; or on&nbsp; July 25,&nbsp; 1928,&nbsp; when this&nbsp; action was instituted. On the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; during that period of over&nbsp; ten years,&nbsp; Monaco remained in the peaceful,&nbsp; quiet, continuous and uninterrupted possession of said land as a homesteader.<br><br>A great preponderance of the evidence shows that the two parcels of land in question are public&nbsp; land,&nbsp; occupied Toy the appellants as homesteaders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment appealed from should&nbsp; be and is hereby reversed,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; appellants are&nbsp; hereby relieved from all liability under the complaint,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp;&nbsp; the appellees.&nbsp; It is so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br>Ten days after the promulgation of&nbsp; this&nbsp; decision final judgment will be entered, and five days thereafter the record will be remanded to the court below.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Villamor, Ostrand,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
