				<H3>FELIPE TAYKO, EDUARDO BUENO, BAUTISTA TAYKO, BERNARDO SOLDE AND VICENTE ELUM, PETITIONERS, VS. NICOLAS CAPISTRANO, ACTING AS JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ORIENTAL NEGROS, ALFREDO B. CACNIO, AS PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF ORIENTAL NEGROS, AND JUAN GADIANI, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of prohibition enjoining the 
respondent judge from taking cognizance of certain civil and criminal election 
cases in which the petitioners are parties.
<p align="justify">The petitioners allege that the respondent judge, previous to 
this date, was appointed judge of the Court of First Instance of Oriental 
Negros, to hold office during good behavior and until he should reach the age of 
65 years; that he now has reached that age and, therefore, under the provisions 
of section 148 of the Administrative Code as amended, is disqualified from 
acting as a judge of the Court of First Instance. The petitioners further allege 
that in view of the many election protests and criminal cases for violation of 
the election law filed in the Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros arising 
from the last election of June 5, 1923, the Honorable Sixto de la Costa was duly 
designated and acted as auxiliary judge of the Province of Oriental Negros; that 
between the auxiliary judge and the respondent judge herein there was an 
understanding, and the assignment of the said auxiliary judge was made with this 
understanding, that the said auxiliary judge so designated would hear and take 
cognizance of all election protests and criminal actions then pending or to be 
filed arising from the said last general election, and that the respondent 
Honorable Nicolas Capistrano would try and-hear the ordinary cases pending in 
the said court, but, notwithstanding this understanding or agreement, the 
respondent judge tried and is still trying to take cognizance of the election 
protests and criminal actions in said court; that the respondent judge declared 
in open court that he will try the criminal cases herein mentioned for the 
reason that the auxiliary judge refused to try the same on the ground that the 
preliminary investigations were held before him, when, in truth and in fact, the 
said auxiliary judge did not make the statement imputed to him and was and is 
still willing to try all the election protests and criminal cases for violation 
of the election law pending in the court of the Province of Oriental Negros; 
that the respondent Honorable Nicolas Capistrano, in spite of the fact that he 
was holding and is now pretending to hold the office of judge of the Court of 
First Instance of Oriental Negros, took great interest and active part in the 
filing of criminal charges against the petitioners herein to the unjustifiable 
extent of appointing a deputy fiscal, who then filed the proper informations, 
when the provincial fiscal refused to file criminal charges against the 
petitioners for violation of the election law for lack of sufficient evidence to 
sustain the same; that said respondent is neither a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> nor <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span>, 
but that, notwithstanding this fact, he continues to hold the office of judge of 
the Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros and pretends to be a duly 
qualified and acting judge of the said province; and that he has tried, and 
continues to try, to act as such judge and that there is reasonable ground to 
believe that he will take cognizance of the cases in question unless he be 
restrained by order of this court; that, in acting as a duly qualified judge 
notwithstanding the facts alleged in the fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs 
hereof, the respondent judge acted and is about to act without and in excess of 
jurisdiction and also after the loss of jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">To this petition the respondents demur on the ground that the 
facts stated do not entitle the petitioners to the relief demanded in that (1) 
none of the facts alleged in the petition divest the respondent judge of his 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the cases referred to in the complaint, and 
(2) even admitting as true, for the sake of this demurrer, the facts alleged in 
paragraph 7 of the petition, the respondent judge is still a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> judge and 
his title to the office and his jurisdiction to hear the cases referred to in 
the petition cannot be questioned by prohibition, as this writ, even when 
directed against persons acting as judges, cannot be treated as a substitute for 
<span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>, or be rightfully called upon to perform any of the functions of 
that writ. </p>
<p align="justify">The grounds upon which the petition rests may be reduced to 
three propositions: (1) That the assignment of the Auxiliary Judge, Sixto de la 
Costa, to Dumaguete was made with the understanding that he was to hear and take 
cognizance of all election contests and criminal causes for violation of the 
election law and that the respondent judge was to take cognizance of the 
ordinary cases and that there was an understanding between them that this 
arrangement was to be followed.&nbsp;
</p><p align="justify">(2) That the respondent judge took great interest and an active 
part in the filing of the criminal charges against the petitioners herein to the 
unjustifiable extent of appointing a deputy fiscal who filed the proper 
informations when the regular provincial fiscal refused to file them for lack of 
sufficient evidence. </p>
<p align="justify">(3) That the respondent judge is already over 65 years of age 
and has, therefore, automatically ceased as judge of the Court of First Instance 
of Oriental Negros and that he is neither a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> nor <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span>. </p>
<p align="justify">(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) But little need be said as to the first proposition. A writ 
of prohibition to a judge of an inferior court will only lie in cases where he 
acts without or in excess of his jurisdiction (section 226, Code of Civil 
Procedure), and it is obvious that a mere "understanding" as to the distribution 
of cases for trial did not deprive the respondent judge of the jurisdiction 
conferred upon him by law. It may be noted that it is not alleged that another 
judge had taken cognizance of the cases in question or that they had been 
definitely assigned to trial before such other judge. </p>
<p align="justify">(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) The second proposition is equally untenable. That the 
respondent judge took great interest and an active part in the filing of the 
criminal charges against the petitioners to the extent of appointing a deputy 
fiscal when the regular provincial fiscal refused to file the proper 
informations, did not disqualify him from trying the cases in question. Section 
1679 of the Administrative Code provides that "when a provincial fiscal shall be 
disqualified by personal interest to act in a particular case or when for <span style="font-style: italic;">any 
reason</span> he shall be unable, or <span style="font-style: italic;">shall fail, to discharge any of the duties</span> of his 
position, the judge of the Court of First Instance of the province shall appoint 
an acting provincial fiscal, * * *." (Italics ours.) </p>
<p align="justify">The determination of the question as to whether the fiscal has 
failed to discharge his duty in the prosecution of a crime must necessarily, to 
a large extent, fie within the sound discretion of the presiding judge, and 
there is no allegation in the petition that such discretion was abused in the 
present instance. It is true that it is stated that the appointment of the 
acting fiscal was "unjustifiable," but that is only a conclusion of law and not 
an allegation of facts upon which such a conclusion can be formed and may, 
therefore, be disregarded. It follows that in appointing an acting fiscal, the 
respondent judge was well within his jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) The third ground upon which the petition is based is the 
most important and merits some consideration. It is well settled that the title 
to the office of a judge, whether <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span>, can only be determined in 
a proceeding in the nature of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> and cannot be tested by prohibition. 
But counsel for the petitioners maintains that the respondent judge is neither a 
judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> nor <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> and that, therefore, prohibition will lie. In this, 
counsel is undoubtedly mistaken.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondent judge has been duly appointed to the office of 
Judge of the Court of First Instance of Oriental Negros, but section 148 of the 
Administrative Code, as amended, provides that "Judges of the Court of First 
Instance and auxiliary judges shall be appointed to serve until they shall reach 
the age of sixty-five years." In view of this provision and assuming, as we 
must, that the allegations of the petition are true, it is evident that the 
respondent is no longer a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span>, but we do not think that it can be 
successfully disputed that he is still a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span>. </p>
<p align="justify">Briefly defined, a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> judge is one who exercises the 
duties of a judicial office under color of an appointment or election thereto 
(Brown vs. O'Connell, 36 Conn., 432). He differs, on the one hand, from a mere 
usurper who undertakes to act officially without any color of right, and on the 
other hand, from a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> who is in all respects legally appointed and 
qualified and whose term of office has not expired (State vs. Carroll, 38 Conn., 
449; Denny vs. Mattoon, 2 Allen [Mass.], 361; Van Slyke vs. Farmers' Mut. Fire 
Ins. Co., 39 Wis., 390).&nbsp;
</p><p align="justify">"Apart from any constitutional or statutory regulation on the 
subject there seems to be a general rule of law that an incumbent of an office 
will hold over after the conclusion of his term until the election and 
qualification of a successor" (22 R. C. L., pp. 554-5). When a judge in good 
faith remains in office after his title has ended, he is a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> officer 
(Sheehan's Case, 122 Mass., 445). <br></p><p align="justify">Applying the principles stated to the facts 
set forth in the petition before us, we cannot escape the conclusion that, on 
the assumption that said facts are true, the respondent judge must be considered 
a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span>. His term of office may have expired, but his successor has not 
been appointed, and as good faith is presumed, he must be regarded as holding 
over in good faith. The contention of counsel for the petitioners that the 
auxiliary judge present in the district must be considered the regular judge 
seems obviously erroneous.</p>
<p align="justify">In these circumstances the remedy prayed for cannot be granted. 
"The rightful authority of a judge, in the full exercise of his public judicial 
functions, cannot be questioned by any merely private suitor, nor by any other, 
excepting in the form especially provided by law. A judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> assumes the 
exercise of a part of the prerogative of sovereignty, and the legality of that 
assumption is open to the attack of the sovereign power alone. Accordingly, it 
is a well established principle, dating from the earliest period and repeatedly 
confirmed by an unbroken current of decisions, that the official acts of a <span style="font-style: italic;">de 
facto</span> judge are just as valid for all purposes as those of a <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> judge, so 
far as the public or third persons who are interested therein are concerned. The 
rule is the same in civil and criminal cases. The principle is one founded in 
policy and convenience, for the right of no one claiming a title or interest 
under or through the proceedings of an officer having an apparent authority to 
act would be safe, if it were necessary in every case to examine the legality of 
the title of such officer up to its original source, and the title or interest 
of such person were held to be invalidated by some accidental defect or flaw in 
the appointment, election or qualification of such officer, or in the rights of 
those from whom his appointment or election emanated; nor could the supremacy of 
the laws be maintained, or their execution enforced, if the acts of the judge 
having a colorable, but not a legal title, were to be deemed invalid. As in the 
case of judges of courts of record, the acts of a justice <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> cannot be 
called in question in any suit to which he is not a party. The official acts of 
a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> justice cannot be attacked collaterally. An exception to the general 
rule that the title of a person assuming to act as judge cannot be questioned in 
a suit before him is generally recognized in the case of a special judge, and it 
is held that a party to an action before a special judge may question his title 
to the office of judge on the proceedings before him, and that the judgment will 
be reversed on appeal, where proper exceptions are taken, if the person assuming 
to act as special judge is not a judge <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span>. The title of a <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> officer 
cannot be indirectly questioned in a proceeding to obtain a writ of prohibition 
to prevent him from doing an official act, nor in a suit to enjoin the 
collection of a judgment rendered by him. Having at least colorable right to the 
office his title can be determined only in a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> proceeding or 
information in the nature of a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> at suit of the sovereign." (15 R. C. 
L., pp. 519-521.) </p>
<p align="justify">The demurrer to the petition is sustained, and inasmuch as it 
is evident that the weakness of the petition cannot be cured by amendment, the 
present proceedings are hereby dismissed with the costs against the petitioners 
jointly and severally. The preliminary injunction hereinbefore issued is 
dissolved. So ordered. </p><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez,</span>
