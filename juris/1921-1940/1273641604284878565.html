				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Emilio G. Mapua, the plaintiff in this case, recovered in the lower court on 
a default judgment, from the defendants jointly and severally, the sum of 
P38,200, representing double the amount which he had lost in a game of 
<i>monte</i>, with legal interest from January 30, 1922, and with costs. The 
defendants appeal and assign six errors.
<p>The record before us and ancillary records in other cases are perfect 
examples of professional carelessness, closely akin to gross negligence in 
pleading and practice. This will partially explain why the court has had the 
case under advisement for so long a period of time, and why it is now necessary 
to pick our way as best we may through an accumulation of uncertain data to as 
just a conclusion as is possible.</p>
<p>Records Nos. 19413<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> and 18133,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> the first a civil action brought by Felix 
Mendoza, one of the instant defendants, against Emilio G. Mapua, the instant 
plaintiff, and the second, an original action in mandamus brought by Emilio G. 
Mapua, the present plaintiff, against Felix Mendoza, one of the instant 
defendants, and Judge of First Instance Harvey, disclose that in these 
proceedings, Mapua set up a counterclaim for P38,200. But this was denied by the 
trial court and this denial was sustained here on the ground that a joint debt 
may not be set up against a separate demand. Encouraged, nevertheless, by this 
intimation, Mapua instituted the present action in the Court of First Instance 
of Manila against Felix Mendoza, and Prudencio Navoa and his wife Isabel Pelayo 
(No. 19295).</p>
<p>The situation can best be visualized by making first a statement of the case 
which will disclose the outstanding proceedings and dates. Then our next task 
will be to apply the procedural law to the facts; after which, we shall be in a 
position to give attention to the merits of the controversy.</p>
<p>Turning directly to the record and the bill of exceptions, the following is 
noted:</p>
<p>Plaintiff's complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila on 
January 30, 1922. Summons were issued and served on the defendants that same 
day. As is customary, the latter were required to enter their appearance in the 
office of the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila within twenty days 
after the service of the summons, and to answer the complaint of the plaintiff 
within the time fixed by the rules of the court, which is ten days after 
appearance. The attorneys for the defendants, however, waited until February 
21st of the same year to enter their appearance. On the supposition that this 
appearance was in time, and this point is not questioned, the defendants then 
had ten days within which to demur or answer.</p>
<p>No action having been taken by the attorneys for the defendants up to and 
including the last day permitted by the law and the rules, on March 6, 1922, the 
attorney for the plaintiff moved for a default judgment, and on this motion the 
trial judge noted as of March 8, 1922, "Como se pide." The proper orders for 
default were made on March 9 and March 11, 1922.</p>
<p>It appears that the attorneys for the defendants had presented in court on 
March 7, 1922, a motion for a bill of particulars, without, however, proving 
service on the attorney for the plaintiff. On March 13, 1922, the attorneys for 
the defendants renewed their motion for a bill of particulars and asked that the 
declaration of default be set aside. Copy of this unverified motion was received 
by the attorney for the plaintiff. Said motion was amended and amplified on 
March 17, 1922, in another motion which was subscribed to by counsel before a 
notary public.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, trial was had on March 14, 1922, without the 
presence of the defendants, and the case for the plaintiff was submitted. The 
trial court thereupon rendered judgment and handed down an appropriate order on 
the motions to raise the default against the defendants. The decision set out 
the complaint and the various steps in the proceedings, made findings of fact 
based on the testimony for the plaintiff, and, in conformity with the Gambling 
Law, Act No. 1757, gave sentence in favor of the plaintiff and against the 
defendants for P38,200, with legal interest and costs, as above indicated. The 
subsequent order on the motions to set aside the default against defendants 
stated various reasons leading to the conclusion that there was no ground for 
allowing said motions.</p>
<p>On appeal in this court, after the passage of considerable time, the bill of 
exceptions and the briefs were finally presented and the case was placed on the 
December, 1922, calendar. It then came to the knowledge of the court, through a 
motion filed by attorneys for the appellants after the case was submitted for 
decision, that the stenographic notes had not yet been written up and elevated 
to the appellate court. The evidence, however, is now before us.</p>
<p>The law applicable to the foregoing incidents in this case is full and clear. 
Abridging its provisions somewhat for the appropriate sections of the Code of 
Civil Procedure and the Rules of Court are, of course, familiar to the 
profession; the Code provides, in part, that the only pleadings allowed on the 
part of the defendant are (1) the demurrer to the complaint, and (2) the answer. 
(Sec. 89.) The defendants had ten days after they had entered their appearance 
to serve and file their demurrer or answer to the complaint. (Rules of the Court 
of First Instance of the Philippine Islands, No. 5.) The court could, however, 
in its discretion, have allowed an answer or other pleading to be made after the 
time limited by the Rules of the Court for filing the same. (Code of Civil 
Procedure, secs. 2, 110; Unson <i>vs</i>. Abrera [1909], 14 Phil., 146.) But if 
a defendant fails to appear at the time required in the summons or to answer at 
the time provided by the Rules of the Court, the court shall, upon motion of the 
plaintiff, order judgment for the plaintiff by default and shall proceed to hear 
the plaintiff and his witnesses, and to render final judgment. (Code of Civil 
Procedure, sec. 128.)</p>
<p>It is perfectly obvious that the defendants did not file their demurrer or 
answer to the complaint within the period fixed by the Code and the Rules. Nor 
did they make proper representations to secure additional time within which to 
present an answer or other pleading. Judgment by default was thus properly 
rendered, unless there was some special reason for taking the case out of the 
general rule.</p>
<p>For a motion to set aside a default judgment to prosper, the moving party 
must show by an affidavit of merits that if the default is set aside, he has a 
just and valid defense to present. Motions to set aside judgments by default are 
addressed to the sound discretion of the court. (Coombs <i>vs</i>. Santos 
[1913], 24 Phil., 446; Daipan <i>vs</i>. Sigabu [1913], 25 Phil., 184.)</p>
<p>The situation here is somewhat complicated by the action of counsel for the 
defendants in filing a motion for a bill of particulars instead of presenting 
either a demurrer or an answer. They assert that as this motion was pending when 
the order of the default was made, it should be construed as tolling the time 
for them to demur or answer. It is, however, not incumbent upon us to settle the 
interesting question of whether the pendency of a motion to make the plaintiffs 
plead more definitely, or to file specifications, so as to furnish the adverse 
party with complete information as to the claims which he is required to meet, 
in conformity with section 108 of the Code of Civil Procedure, extends the time 
to demur or answer. While it is generally irregular to enter judgment by default 
whiles motion remains pending and undisposed of, yet, where such motion is filed 
out of time, it would not be reversible error to enter a judgment by default. 
(There can be noted the cases of Naderhoff <i>vs</i>. Geo. Benz &amp; Sons 
[1913], 25 N. Dak., 165; 47 L. R. A., 853; D. S. Register &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. 
Pringle Brothers [1909], 58 Fla., 355; Shinn <i>vs</i>. Cummins [1884], 65 Cal., 
97; Higley and Higley <i>vs</i>. Pollock [1891], 21 Nev., 198; Plummer 
<i>vs</i>. Weil [1896], 15 Wash., 427, holding that the motion filed by the 
defendant for a bill of particulars, is sufficient <i>ipso facto</i> to extend 
the time for answering.)</p>
<p>Without deciding, therefore, if the application for a bill of particulars 
extends the time for the defendants to demur or answer, it is sufficient to say 
that the application for such an order must be seasonably made. Here, as the 
defendants neither demurred nor answered, or filed their motion for a bill of 
particulars in time, and as their motion to set aside the default judgment 
showed no meritorious defense and was in itself defective, we reach the 
conclusion that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge 
in proceeding as he did and in refusing to set aside his order of default 
against the defendants.</p>
<p>On the merits, little need be said. The complaint alleged, and the plaintiff 
proved to the satisfaction of the court, that in a game of <i>monte</i> 
conducted by Felix Mendoza, Prudencio Navoa and Isabel Pelayo, the plaintiff was 
the loser to the extent of P19,100 as disclosed by the checks of record. Our 
Gambling Law permits any person who loses any money or valuable consideration or 
thing in any gambling house, or at any prohibited game such as <i>monte</i>, or 
his heirs, executors, administrators, or judgment creditors to recover within 
three years thereafter the money, consideration, or thing, together with an 
additional sum equal to the value thereof from the persons in charge of the 
game, or in control of the gambling house. The only doubtful point is as to the 
liability of Isabel Pelayo; but as to her, construing the provisions of articles 
1406 and 1411 of the Civil Code in relation with sections 6, 7, 8 and ] 1 of the 
Gambling Law, we decide that she is jointly and severally liable with her 
codefendants. (<i>See</i> Manresa, <i>Comentarios al Codigo Civil, vol. 9,</i> 
p. 645.) Moreover, no specific assignment of error is made or argued to this 
end.</p>
<p>While the records under consideration disclose that the plaintiff Emilio G. 
Mapua is a gambler who, not content to accept his losses without murmur, has 
seen fit to take advantage of the law to recoup himself, and while his action 
engenders no sympathy, we have, nevertheless, to apply the law, and in so doing 
find present no reversible error which would warrant us in disturbing the 
appreciation of the case as made by Judge Harvey.</p>
<p>Judgment is affirmed with costs against the appellants. So 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Johnson, Street, Avanceña, Villamor, Ostrand,
