				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to reverse a judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Cagayan, finding the appellants, Ricardo Paredes and 
Abelardo Crisologo, guilty of the offense of falsification of a commercial 
document, and sentencing each of them to undergo imprisonment for six years and 
one day, <i>presidio mayor</i>, with the accessories provided by law, to pay a 
fine of P250, and jointly and severally to indemnify the Aparri branch of the 
Philippine National Bank in the amount of P55,000, and each to pay one-fourth 
part of the costs.
<p>In the information two other persons, to wit, Teodorico Angeles and Miguel G. 
Concepcion, were named as codefendants with these two appellants; but a 
severance was had and the trial of the present appellants occurred at a 
different time than the trial of their coaccused, and before a different judge. 
The present opinion will therefore be confined to the appeal interposed by these 
two appellants. Ricardo Paredes and Abelardo Crisologo, from the decision of his 
Honor, Francisco Dominguez, published on December 31, 1921.</p>
<p>The case is closely related with that of Miguel G. Concepcion, who was 
charged jointly with these appellants;<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> 
and in fact all these appeals have been heard together in this court, and to 
some extent upon the same record. It should be stated, however, that the present 
appellants were tried first; and the principal witness against them was 
Teodorico Angeles, as to whom a dismissal had been entered in order that he 
might be used as a witness for the prosecution. In said trial Miguel G. 
Concepcion was not introduced as a witness for either party. When the time for 
the trial of Concepcion arrived Teodorico Angeles had died, and the prosecution 
was unable to use against him the testimony given by Teodorico Angeles in the 
earlier trial against Paredes and Crisologo. Accordingly the prosecution 
introduced the present appellants as witnesses against Concepcion, and they then 
gave an account of the transactions which led to the prosecution substantially 
identical with the story that had been told by them when testifying as witnesses 
in their own behalf in the earlier trial.</p>
<p>In considering the appeal of the two present appellants, therefore, upon the 
record presented at the trial of their own cause, we take account only of the 
proof submitted to that trial and ignore the proof adduced by both parties in 
the later trial against Concepcion.</p>
<p>The facts, however, as revealed at the two trials, are not materially 
different; and we refer to our opinion upon the appeal of Miguel G. Concepcion 
for a general statement of the facts relevant to the present prosecution. In the 
present opinion we shall content ourselves with the statement of such additional 
facts as are necessary to dispose of the appeal of the two appellants whose case 
is now before us.</p>
<p>As intimated in our opinion upon the other appeal, the persons principally to 
blame in the acts leading to this prosecution were undoubtedly Miguel G. 
Concepcion and Teodorico Angeles, while Ricardo Paredes and Abelardo Crisologo 
were rather victims of the artifices of the two than designing participants in 
crime; and we shall now take up the case of each of these appellants in 
turn.</p>
<p>The items of proof against Ricardo Paredes in relation with the offense in 
question are in brief these: (1) That he was present at the interview in the 
house of his son-in-law, Abelardo Crisologo, on the day, in October, 1919, when 
the subject was discussed between Angeles, Concepcion, and Crisologo as to 
whether the latter would allow his name to be used in the documents relative to 
the loan which was contemplated to be made for the convenience of Concepcion; 
although, as the witness Angeles states, Paredes took no active part in that 
conversation and the three interlocutors appear to have spoken on that matter 
somewhat apart from Paredes; (2) that Paredes on that or the next day went with 
Angeles to look at some tobacco then deposited in Tuguegarao and which Angeles 
pretended to have believed was part of the tobacco that was to be covered by a 
quedan signed by Crisologo; (3) that, on October 24, 1919, Paredes received 
P18,500, constituting the net proceeds of the two notes on that day discounted 
by the bank, as already stated in our opinion upon the appeal of Concepcion; (4) 
that after the first notes executed by Crisologo had been in the bank for some 
time, Paredes, acting for Crisologo and others concerned, made a payment of 
interest due or to become due upon said notes, using upon this occasion about 
P1,600, believed to have been derived from the resources of Concepcion; (5) 
that, upon another occasion, acting as attorney in fact of his son-in-law, 
Abelardo Crisologo, he went through the form of executing in favor of the bank a 
pledge of the same non-existing tobacco that had been included in original 
quedans signed by Crisologo; (6) that upon still another occasion, after all the 
notes had long been overdue, and the bank desired to get its credits 
consolidated, Paredes, also acting under a power of attorney from Crisologo, 
went through the form of consolidating the original notes and quedans into one 
note and one quedan.</p>
<p>The mere recital of these circumstances suffices to show that they are far 
from proving criminal complicity on the part of Ricardo Paredes in the original 
<i>estafa</i> and falsification which is the sole subject of this prosecution. 
His intervention on behalf of Crisologo, in doing certain acts as attorney in 
fact of the latter, is explainable by the fact that Crisologo was his son-in-law 
and lived in Tuguegarao, while the acts which Paredes did in behalf of Crisologo 
were done at the bank in Aparri upon occasions when Crisologo was at home in 
Tuguegarao and was not or could not conveniently be present.</p>
<p>It is of course to be assumed that at the time when Ricardo Paredes went 
through the form of executing a pledge and later through the form of renewing 
the notes and quedans—all of which was done at the instance of the bank—he knew 
that the tobacco referred to in the pledge and quedans was non-existent, but no 
<i>estafa</i> was then committed and the only offense charged in the present 
information has reference to the original <i>estafa</i> and falsification 
committed when the money was obtained. We therefore see no just basis for 
attributing to Ricardo Paredes any criminal complicity in the acts for which 
Concepcion has been convicted.</p>
<p>With respect to Abelardo Crisologo, it is evident that his formal connection 
with the offense is much closer than that of Ricardo Paredes, inasmuch as he 
signed the promissory notes and the quedans for the tobacco which supposedly 
justified the loan. In signing these notes Crisologo was, civilly speaking, 
substantially in the position of an accommodation maker; and he of course made 
himself personally liable to the bank upon those notes for the benefit of 
Concepcion. The act of affixing his signature to the quedans was done in a 
spirit of blind complaisance explainable only in the light of his friendly 
personal relations with Concepcion and his deference to the joint wishes of 
Concepcion and the bank's manager. It must be remembered also that this act was 
done in response to the representation of Teodorico Angeles that Concepcion had 
the tobacco and that the signing of the quedans by Crisologo was all a matter of 
mere formality. Crisologo therefore misrepresented nothing to anyone; and we are 
of the opinion that criminal responsibility cannot be predicated of his acts, 
for want of the essential element of criminal intent. He was a mere tool in the 
hands of others and is sufficiently punished by the ruin that must follow from 
making himself civilly liable for so large a sum of money.</p>
<p>From what has been said it is evident that the judgment convicting these two 
accused of the offense charged in the complaint must be reversed, and they will 
be freely absolved from the complaint, with costs of both instances <i>de 
oficio</i>. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor,
