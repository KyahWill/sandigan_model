				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The question involved in the present case is one of two partly overlapping 
Torrens titles and is before this court upon appeal from a decision of the Court 
of First Instance in a cadastral registration case adjudging the land to the 
appellee Arsenia Enriquez.</p>
<p>The title of the appellant Jose Insa is deraigned from one Severino Lerma 
who, by a decree of the Court of Land Registration dated January 3, 1905, 
obtained an original Director of Lands vs. Insa and Enriquez certificate of 
title to the land in dispute. The appellee Arsenia Enriquez claims title under a 
transfer certificate of title from Prisca de los Reyes and sisters, who held the 
original certificate of title under a decree dated December 19, 1905. (See 
sketches figures Nos. 1 and 2.)</p>
<p align="center">(IMAGE)</p>
<p>The situation of the land in question may be best understood by a reference 
to the sketch, fig. 1. The portion lying within the points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, 9 and 10 of the sketch is high land and the undisputed property of the 
appellant Insa. The triangular portion lying within the points 1, 10, 9, 8, 7 
and 11 is in dispute and is low grass land. The adjoining land to the west of 
the line 1-11 and to the south of the line 7-11 is the undisputed property of 
the appellee Enriquez and is low land of the same general character as the 
disputed portion. Points Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7 are marked with very old monuments 
of adobe stone and points Nos. 9 and 10 are marked with old Bureau of Lands 
monuments probably placed there at the time of the land registration surveys in 
the year 1904. Most of the other points are marked with new Bureau of Lands 
monuments. There is no monument of any kind at point No. 11. The line 1-10-9-8-7 
is also indicated in the field by a continuous row of heavy bamboo along the 
entire length of the line.</p>
<p>As already stated, the disputed portion is covered by the certificates of 
title of both parties. As the decree upon which the appellant's title is founded 
is older than that of the appellee, the former would, under ordinary 
circumstances, prevail (Legarda and Prieto vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil., 590) and if 
the plans from which the land description in the appellant's certificate of 
title were taken correctly reflected the surveys made for the purpose of the 
registration we should unhesitatingly reverse the judgment appealed from, 
irrespective of the consequences to the parties.</p>
<p>But here it is conclusively shown not only by undisputed testimony but also 
by the plans themselves that the western line shown on the Lerma plan is not the 
line surveyed and monumented, but simply an imaginary line which has crept into 
the plan through a mistake of the draftsman in interpreting the field notes of 
the surveyor.</p>
<p>This clearly appears from sketch fig. 2, a copy of the Lerma plan from which 
the land described in the appellant's certificate of title is taken. The 
diminutive squares at corners 1, 2, 3 and 5 represent adobe monuments 
corresponding to the monuments at points 1, 7, 5 and 2 of sketch fig. 1. In 
making the survey the surveyor evidently used an Azimuth Compass and began his 
survey at point 1. In sighting from that point to the monument on the SW. corner 
of the land, the reading of the compass would be approximately SE. 163° 30' 
instead of SW. 203° 30' as appearing on the plan. The method employed by the 
surveyor in indicating the courses of the lines was practically unknown in this 
country at that time and errors in drafting might therefore readily occur.</p>
<p>The error was not discovered until the cadastral survey was made some sixteen 
years later. In the meantime the appellee occupied the land now in dispute and 
neither the appellant nor his predecessors in interest laid any claim to it; 
evidently the thought did not occur to them that the land was included in their 
certificate of title.</p>
<p>It is also to be observed that in the first few years after the enactment of 
the Land Registration Act the plans submitted to the Court of Land Registration 
were usually grossly inaccurate. In the present case the plan we have discussed 
has an error of closure of 1:119, which shows the existence of such large 
discrepancies in the courses of the various lines of the plan that it, in any 
event, would be impossible to determine the exact limits of the land from the 
plan itself. That the plan on which the description of the land in the 
certificate of title of the appellee is taken is even more inaccurate does not, 
of course, improve matters.</p>
<p>The court has therefore somewhat reluctantly arrived at the conclusion that 
the judgment appealed from must be affirmed. The evidence that the Lerma plan 
does not show the true lines of the survey upon which it is based and that the 
error in question lies in the drafting of the plan is conclusive. This is 
established by the undisputed testimony of persons who were present at the time 
the survey was made and by the fact that the surveyor very evidently took the 
adobe monument at point 7 of fig. 1 as the southwestern corner of the land; it 
is f urthr shown by the bamboo hedges surrounding the land and by the monuments 
existing thereon previously to the survey; and, finally, it is also indicated by 
the continuous and open occupation of the now disputed portion by the appellee 
and her predecessors for over sixteen years subsequent to the entry of the 
decree of registration, without any adverse claim on the part of the 
appellant.</p>
<p>The survey as actually made must prevail over an erroneous plan where the 
variance between the two is conclusively established by the evidence and the 
true boundary lines followed by the surveyor can be definitely ascertained.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor, Johns,</em> and 
<em>Romualdez, JJ,,</em> concur.</p>
