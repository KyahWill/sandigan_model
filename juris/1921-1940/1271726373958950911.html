				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case calls for the application of. articles 361, 453, and 454 of the 
Civil Code to the proven facts.<p></p>
<p>On November 6, 1916, Leandra Solis and her husband Bernardo Solis brought an 
action in the Court of First Instance of Tayabas against Martin Mendoza for the 
recovery of a certain piece of land. Judgment was rendered in that case 
absolving Mendoza from the complaint, and this judgment was subsequently 
affirmed by the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> When the ease was remanded to the court of 
origin, the trial judge issued an order requiring the provincial sheriff 
immediately to dissolve the preliminary writ of injunction and to put Mendoza in 
the possession of the land. By virtue 6f this order, Mendoza was in fact put in 
possession of the property.</p>
<p>In the cadastral proceedings of the municipality of Sariaya, Tayabas, the 
piece of land above-mentioned was identified as lot No. 687. In the decision 
rendered in the cadastral ease, this lot was adjudicated in favor of Martin 
Mendoza and Natalio Enriquez in equal parts <i>pro indiviso</i> 
subject to the right of retention on the part of Manuel de Guzman until he shall 
have been indemnified for the improvements existing on the land. By virtue of 
this judgment, De Guzman presented a motion requesting the issuance of a writ of 
possession for lot No. 687 in his favor which was granted on June 25, 1924. From 
the time Leandra Solis and Bernardo Solis, as well as Manuel de Guzman who was 
working on the land, were ejected therefrom, Martin Mendoza possessed it until 
June 25, 1924, when De Guzman obtained the writ of possession abovementioned. 
Since then De Guzman has had dominion over the land.</p>
<p>Being unable to come to an agreement as to the amount which should be allowed 
for the improvements made on the land, Martin Mendoza and Natalio Enriquez began 
an action requesting the court to (<i>a</i>) fix the value of the 
necessary and useful expenses incurred by Manuel de Guzman in introducing the 
improvements; (<i>b</i>) require the defendant to render an 
accounting of the fruits received by him and order that the value of the fruits 
be applied to the payment of the necessary and useful expenses; and 
(<i>c</i>) decree the restitution of the postettion to the 
plaintiffs. To the complaint, the defendant filed an answer in the form of a 
general denial with special defenses and appended a counterclaim and 
cross-complaint, in which a total of P6,000 was asked. During the pendency at 
the case, Bernardo Solis, or Max B. Solis, one of the persons who was ejected 
from the land, asked leave to intervene, alleging, among: other things, that De 
Guzman, in consideration of the sum of P5,000, had transferred all his rights 
in the improvements and in the lot to him with the exception of two hundred 
coconut trees. This petition was granted by the trial court.</p>
<p>When the case was called for trial, the parties entered into the following 
stipulation:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>"1. That the plaintiffs are the owners and proprietors of 
the land described in the second paragraph of the complaint.<p></p>
<p>"2. That a decree of registration has been issued on said land in the terms 
set forth in paragraph 3 of the complaint.</p>
<p>"3. That the defendant Manuel de Guzman is the one who has been in possession 
and enjoyment of the land from June 25, 1924, up to the present time by virtue 
of a writ of possession obtained by him from the Court of Land Registration.</p>
<p>"4. That the defendant has made improvements on said land by planting coconut 
trees thereon.</p>
<p>"5. That the plaintiff Martin Mendoza is the one who has been in possession 
and enjoyment of said property and its improvements since December 16, 1916, by 
virtue of a writ of possession in civil case No. 356 until said possession was 
transferred to the defendant Manuel de Guzman.</p>
<p>"6. That from March 20, 1920, the plaintiff Natalio Enriquez has been in 
possession and enjoyment of a portion of the land, the subject matter of the 
complaint herein, by virtue of a deed of sale executed in his favor by Attorney 
Agustin Alvarez, who, in turn, acquired it from the other plaintiff Martin 
Mendoza, until June 25, 1924.</p>
<p>"The parties desire to submit, as they do submit, under this stipulation of 
facts the following questions:</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) The amount of the indemnity to be paid to the 
defendant for the improvements made by him on said lot and the basis upon which 
said amount shall be fixed.</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) Whether or not the defendant is obliged to render an 
account of the fruits received by him from June 25, 1924, until the improvements 
are delivered after same have been paid for.</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) Whether the value of said fruits and products 
received by the defendant shall be applied to the indemnity to which he is 
entitled, or whether said defendant is obliged to deliver to the plaintiffs the 
remainder in case of excess.</p>
<p>"(<i>d</i>) Whether or not the defendant has the right to be 
paid by the plaintiffs in whole or in part for the value of the fruits received 
by Martin Mendoza and Natalio Enriquez from the respective dates that they were 
in possession and enjoyment of the land until June 25, 1924.</p>
<p>"The parties at the same time that they submit to the court for decision the 
questions presented in the above stipulation reserve to themselves, whatever 
said decision may be, the right to present later their evidence in support of 
their respective views with respect to the amount of the indemnity.</p>
<p>"After the preliminary questions have been decided, the parties request that 
commissioners be appointed to receive said evidence with respect to the amount 
of the indemnity in accordance with the views of both 
parties."<br></p></blockquote>The trial court resolved the questions 
presented by holding (1) that in accordance with the provisions of articles 453 
and 454 in relation with article 361 of the Civil Code, the value of the 
"indemnizacion" to be paid to the defendant should be fixed according to the 
necessary and useful expenses incurred by him in introducing "las plantaciones 
en cuestion"; (2) that the plaintiffs as the owner of the property have the 
right to make their own "las plantaciones hechas por el demandado" upon payment 
in the form indicated in No. 1, the defendant having the right to retain the 
land until the expenditures have been refunded; (3) that the defendant is 
obliged to render a detailed and just account of the fruits and other profits 
received by him from the property for their due application; and (4) that the 
value of the fruits received by the defendant should first be applied to the 
payment of the "indemnizacion," and in case that it exceeds the value of the 
"indemnizacion," the excess shall be returned to the plaintiffs. With respect to 
the last question as to whether or not the plaintiffs are obliged to return to 
the defendant the value of the fruits received by them before the defendant took 
possession of the land, the trial court abstained from making any pronouncement 
for the reason that the circumstances under which the plaintiffs acquired 
possession and the defendant again acquired it were not before him, the parties 
needing to submit their evidence with respect to this point.<p></p>
<p>At the trial which followed and at the instance of the parties, two 
commissioners were appointed with instructions to inspect the land and to count 
the number of coconut trees planted thereon, determining the number of 
fruit-bearing trees and those that are not fruit-bearing as well as the 
condition of the same. After trial, Judge of First Instance Gloria rendered 
judgment declaring (<i>a</i>) that the defendant Manuel de Guzman 
and the intervenor Bernardo Solis have the right to collect from the plaintiffs 
Martin Mendoza and Natalio Enriquez the sum of P2,046 as compensation for the 
necessary and useful expenditures in the proportion of 20 per cent for Manuel de 
Guzman and 80 per cent for Bernardo Solis; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that Manuel de Guzman and 
Bernardo Solis are obliged to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of P666.93 per 
annum from June 25, 1924, one-fifth of this amount to be paid by Manuel de 
Guzman and the other four-fifths by Bernardo Solis. As on the date when this 
judgment was rendered, that is on September 23, 1927, the amount that the 
plaintiffs were required to pay to the defendant and intervenor exceeded the 
amount that the latter were to pay the former, the defendant and intervenor were 
ordered to deliver the land and its improvements as soon as the plaintiffs have 
paid the difference, without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p>The appeal of the defendant and intervenor is based on fourteen assigned 
errors relating to both questions of fact and of law. The question of fact 
mainly concerns the amount to be paid as "indemnizacion" in the form of 
necessary and useful expenditures incurred by the defendant. The question of law 
mainly concerns the interpretation of articles 361, 453, and 454 of the Civil 
Code. Counsel for the appellants has presented a learned brief divided into 
three chapters. Counsel for the appellees has countered with an equally helpful 
brief in which the fourteen assigned errors are reduced for purposes of argument 
to four fundamental questions. It would not be profitable and it is not 
necessary to follow opposing counsel into all of their refinements of fact and 
law.</p>
<p>As to the facts, the findings of the trial judge should be given effect. An 
examination of the evidence shows that these findings are fully substantiated. 
Our only doubt has been as to the just value for each coconut tree now found on 
the land. However, everything considered, we have at last determined that we 
would not be justified in changing the value per tree of 92 as fixed in the 
trial court. With respect to the fruits received by the defendant while the land 
was in his possession, the finding in the trial court is correct.</p>
<p>With the facts as above indicated, little time need be taken to discuss the 
points of law. Article 361 of the Civil Code in the original Spanish text uses 
the word "indemnizacion." However one may speculate as to the true meaning of 
the term "indemnizacion" whether correctly translated as "compensation" or 
"indemnity," the amount of the "indemnizacion" is the amount of the expenditures 
mentioned in articles 453 and 454 of the Civil Code, which in the present case 
is the amount of the necessary and useful expenditures incurred by the 
defendant. Necessary expenses have been variously described by the Spanish 
commentators as those made for the preservation of the thing (4 Manresa's 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Comentarios al Codigo Civil</span>, p. 258); as those without which the thing would 
deteriorate or be lost (Scaevola's <span style="font-style: italic;">Comentarios al Codigo Civil</span>, p. 408); as 
those that augment the income of the things upon which they are expended (4 
Manresa's <span style="font-style: italic;">Comentarios al Codigo Civil</span>, p. 261; 8 Scaevola's Comentarios al 
Codigo Civil, p. 416). Among the necessary expenditures are those incurred for 
cultivation, production, upkeep, etc. (4 Manresa's <span style="font-style: italic;">Comentarios al Codigo Civil</span>, 
p. 257). Here the plaintiffs have chosen to take the improvements introduced on 
the land and are disposed to pay the amount of the necessary and useful expenses 
incurred by the defendant. Inasmuch as the retentionist, who is not exactly a 
possessor in good faith within the meaning of the law, seeks to be reimbursed 
for the necessary and useful expenditures, it is only just that he should 
account to the owners of the estate for any rents, fruits, or crops he has 
gathered from it.</p>
<p>In brief, therefore, and with special reference to the decision appealed 
from, the errors assigned on appeal, and the argument of counsel as addressed to 
the decision in the lower court and the assignment of errors, we may say that 
we are content to make the findings of fact and law of Judge Gloria in the lower 
court the findings of fact and law in the appellate court.</p>
<p>Based on the foregoing considerations, the judgment appealed from will be 
affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellants.</p>
