				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an  application for the registration of  various parcels of land which comprise nearly all of Bonga Island, situated about 25  kilometers from the coast of  Cotabato, almost in front of the mouth of the large river by  that name.<br><br>The applicants'  right  to  the  registration of these  parcels dates back to about ten years before American occupation, when Tomas Eoales entered into possession and commenced to cultivate this island, later, between  1893 and 1895, obtaining a grant of the same from the Military Political  Commander of Illana Bay and then organizing the anonymous  association known as <i>Fortuna</i> among several  persons whose names  are  mentioned  in the  grant. The  <i>Fortuna</i> having failed  to pay the land tax on this island, it was sold at public auction to Francisco Diaz, from whom the appellants acquired the parcels, the registration of which is now sought.<br><br>As regards  parcels 4,  6,  7 and 8, the court reached the conclusion that they had been occupied and cultivated by the applicants and their predecessors ten years before,American occupation and ordered the registration of  the same in their names.  As regards parcel 2, the court found that only a portion  of it had been occupied and ordered the applicants to  present  an amended plan thereof, using as a basis the sketch Exhibit X of the oppositor,  on which the part occupied is  indicated by red lines, for the  purpose of resolving, in due time, its  final adjudication.  In regard to the other portion of lot 2 and all of  lot 3, the court denied the registration in the name of the applicants.<br><br>The appeal  refers only to the portion of lot 2  and all of lot 3, the  registration of which has been denied.<br><br>The only ground of the lower court for the denial of the registration of this  tract  is that neither the  applicants nor their  predecessors have had actual possession  of it.  But, following the decision of this  court  in the case of Ramos vs. Director of Lands (39 Phil., 175),  the judgment appealed  from should  be  reversed.   In that case it was held that "the possession  and cultivation of a portion of a tract of land, under claim of ownership of all, is a constructive  possession of all,  if the remainder  is not in the adverse  possession  of another.  *   *  *   Possession  in the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to  have his feet on  every square meter of ground before it can be said that  he is  in possession.  *   *  *   peaceable, and notorious possession of a portion of the property, sufficient to apprise the community and the world that the land was for his enjoyment."<br><br>Taking into  consideration that the applicants and their predecessors, as admitted in the judgment  appealed from, have  cultivated and have  been in actual  possession  of a large tract of this island which, according to the evidence, comprises more than two-thirds of the same, this possession includes, within  the meaning of the law, the remaining portion although the same has not yet been reached by the physical action of the applicants.   The actual acts of possession of the greater part of the island are acts  of constructive possession of all of it, as evidenced by the fact that application was  made and  a  grant obtained by the predecessors of the applicants for all of the island.   For the same  reason that the  registration of parcels 4,  6, 7 and 8 and part of 2 was granted in favor of the applicants, must the registration of the remainder, which consists  of a portion  of lot 2 and all of lot 3, be granted.  Moreover, there is evidence that this tract has been in actual possession, having been used for  the pasture of some cows, and within which trees have been cut for the construction  of boats.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is modified and it is ordered that lots 2 and 3 be registered in their entirety, without any special pronouncement as to costs.   So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ, </span> concur.</div>
