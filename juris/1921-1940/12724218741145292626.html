  </div><p>
It is alleged that the Philippine Shipowners' Association is a domestic
corporation composed of numerous persons and entities, each of whom is
engaged in the business of common carrier, of freight and passengers,
in the coastwise trade of the Philippine Islands. That the petitioner,
Compañia Maritima, is a domestic corporation, and that Fernandez
Hermanos is a duly registered mercantile partnership. That on October
13, 1922, and upon petition of the National Coal Company, a certificate
of public convenience was issued by the respondent to the said company
to operate the steamship <em>Pompey</em>, a government-owned vessel,
in the coastwise trade. That on February 27, 1923, the Coal Company
filed another petition in which it was requested that it be authorized
to include the port of Davao in its regular schedule. That on March 2,
1923, your petitioners filed a petition with the respondent to the
effect that the continued operation of the steamship <em>Pompey</em>
in the coastwise trade was prejudicial to the public interest for five
different reasons specified in the petition. That in due course, after
numerous hearings, a decision was rendered by the Acting Public Utility
Commissioned, the Honorable M. V. del Rosario, in which he found that
it would not be justified, under the principles which protect the
public against unfair and ruinous competition, to permit the National
Coal Company to compete with existing commercial public utilities
operating between Manila and Davao. That from that decision an appeal
was taken to this court in which a decision was rendered on January 30,
1925,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> confirming that
decision of the Public Utility Commissioner. That notwithstanding the
decision of this court, the National Coal Company, on April 20, 1925,
filed a petition with the Public Utility Commission again requesting
that it be permitted to operate on the Manila-Davao run, which petition
was supported by an argument showing dissatisfaction with the decision
of this court, based upon the contention that this court, in making its
decision, "acted without knowledge of the true facts." That in June,
1925, your petitioners filed a motion with the Acting Public Utility
Commissioner requesting that the application lie dismissed upon the
grounds that the questions therein presented have already been decided
by the Commission and the Supreme Court. That when the motion came on
to be heard before the Honorable M. V. del Rosario, he suggested that
it be transferred to the respondent, for the reason that, having
rendered the former decision, which had been sustained by this court,
it was embarrassing for him to decide the motion. That on July 6, 1925,
the respondent herein rendered a decision denying petitioners' motion
that the application of the National Coal Company be dismissed. That on
July 16, 1925, your petitioners filed a motion requesting a
reconsideration of the order of July 6, 1925, in which it was stated,
among other things, "that the situation of the parties had not changed
and that in fact there was not even a pretense that there had been any
change; and that the <em>Pompey</em> continued to be a
government-owned vessel." That on August 19, 1925, the respondent
denied petitioners' motion for a reconsideration, and set the case 4own
for a rehearing on the merits on August 25, 1925. It is then alleged
"that said orders reopening this controversy merely because the
National Coal Company is dissatisfied with the former decision of the
Acting Public Utility Commissioner and of this Honorable Court are
unjust and prejudicial to public interest, and in issuing said orders
the respondent Commissioner has not regularly pursued its authority,
but has exceeded its jurisdiction in the premises."</p>
  <p>
Petitioners pray that this court require the respondent Public Utility
Commissioner to certify the records of all proceedings had before the
Commissioner of the matter, and that upon such hearing, the order of
the respondent be held improper and set aside, and they also pray for a
preliminary injunction, which was granted.</p>
  <p>  Based upon the petition, an order was made to show cause.</p>
  <p>
August 27, the respondent made his return, in which it is alleged that
on March 31, 1925, the shippers of the ports of Cebu, Zamboanga and
Davao filed their petitions with the Public Utility Commission, asking
that steamship <em>Pompey</em> be permitted to make regular calls at the port of Davao. Then follows a specification by them of ten different grounds.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"III. That, consistent with these petitions, the National Coal Company, agent for steamship <em>Pompey</em>, filed an application with the Public Utility Commission asking that the certificate of public convenience of said steamship <em>Pompey</em> be amended so as to include the authority for regular calls at the port of Davao.</p>
    <p> "IV. That the petitions, mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, were granted by the respondent because the <em>public convenience</em> so demands.</p>
    <p>"V.
That the order granting said petitions is based upon the new facts
presented—different from those involved in the case of the National
Coal Company <i>vs.</i> the Public Utility Commission, <em>supra</em>.</p>
    <p> "VI. That the proceedings under the Public Utility Act are administrative or quasi-judicial, and the doctrines of <em>res judicata</em> and <em>stare decisis</em>, invoked by the petitioners herein, are not applicable."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  Wherefore, the respondent prays that the petition be dismissed, without any finding as to costs.</p>
  <p>
The entire record before the Commission was certified and brought up to
this court, and the question now presented is whether or not the
petitioners are entitled to the relief prayed for, or whether, as the
respondent contends, the petition should be dismissed.</p>
  <p>    <b>JOHNS, J.:</b></p>
  <p>
By comparison, it will be found that the grounds stated in the original
petition of the National Coal Company, which was filed on February 27,
1923, are almost identical with those stated in its petition filed on
April 20, 1925. In both petitions, the National Coal Company is the
moving party, and the steamship <em>Pompey</em> is the bone of contention.</p>
  <p>
There is no claim or pretense that there has been a change in the
ownership of the vessel, or any change in the vessel itself. On the
first petition, there was an exhaustive hearing in which in legal
effect the same showing was made by the shippers that is now made by
them in their respective affidavits in support of the second petition.
It appears upon the face of the record that there has not been any
change in the steamship <em>Pompey</em> or the situation of the
parties, the shippers or the ports of call, or the route of travel. In
other words, it does not appear that there has been any change in the
situation as it existed at the time the former decision of the Public
Utility Commissioner was rendered, which was later affirmed by the
decision of this court. In the original petition, the National Coal
Company was the moving party, and it is the moving party in the second
petition. The shippers were not parties to the first petition, and they
are not parties to the second petition. In the first petition, the
purpose and intent of the shippers was to aid and assist the National
Coal Company in obtaining a license to have the steamship <em>Pompey</em>
placed on the Davao run, and their evidence was introduced for that
purpose, and that is true as to the second petition. There are no legal
grounds shown or alleged in the second petition that were not shown or
alleged in the first. In its final analysis, the National Coal Company,
in its second petition, seeks to have the respondent set aside the
decision of the Commissioner in the first petition, which was affirmed
by this court on the appeal of the National Coal Company. In other
words, to not only have the Commission review its former decision, but
in legal effect to review a final decision of this court.</p>
  <p> If
it be a fact, as appears from their affidavits, that the shippers have
a cause of grievance against any vessel operated as a public utility,
the law gives them a complete, speedy and adequate remedy. That is the
purpose of Act No. 3108 "creating a Public Utility Commission and
prescribing its duties and powers, and for other purposes," and the
reason why it was enacted, section 13 of which says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The
Commission shall have general supervision and regulation of
jurisdiction and control over, all public utilities, and also over
their property, property rights, equipment, facilities and franchises
so far as may be necessary for the purposes of carrying out the
provisions of this Act. * * *</p>
    <p>"Sec. 14. The Commission shall have power:</p>
    <p>"(<em>a</em>)
To investigate, upon its own initiative, or upon complaint in writing,
any matter concerning any public utility as herein defined.</p>
    <p align="center">      *	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>
    <p>"(<em>e</em>)
After hearing, by order in writing, to fix just and reasonable
standards, classifications, regulations, practices, measurements, or
service to be furnished, imposed, observed, and followed thereafter by
any public utility as herein defined.</p>
    <p>"Sec. 15. The Commission shall have power, after hearing, upon notice, by order in writing to require every public utility:</p>
    <p align="center">*	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>
    <p>"(<em>b</em>)
To furnish safe, adequate, and proper service as regards the manner of
furnishing the same as well as the maintenance of the necessary
material and equipment: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the
inspection and regulation, for the purposes of sanitation and safety,
of the vessels operated within the Philippine Islands, shall be under
the jurisdiction and authority of the Insular Collector of Customs or
his duly authorized agents.</p>
    <p>"Sec. 16. No public utility as herein defined shall:</p>
    <p>"(<em>a</em>)
Make, impose, or exact any unjust or unreasonable, unjustly
discriminatory or unduly preferential individual or joint rate,
commutation rate, mileage, and other special rate, toll, fare, charge,
or schedule for any product or service supplied or rendered by it
within the Philippine Islands.</p>
    <p align="center">      * * * * * * *</p>
    <p>" (<em>c</em>)
Adopt, maintain, or enforce any regulation, practice, or measurement
which shall be unjust, unreasonable; unduly preferential, arbitrarily
or unjustly discriminatory; or otherwise in violation of law, nor shall
any public utility as herein defined provide or maintain any service
that is unsafe, improper, or inadequate or withhold or refuse any
service which can reasonably be demanded and furnished when ordered by
said Commission.</p>
    <p>" (<em>d</em>) Make or give, directly or
indirectly, by itself or through its agents, attorneys or freight
brokers, or any of them, discounts or rebates on authorized freight
rates, or any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any
person or corporation or to any locality or to any particular
description of traffic in any respect whatsoever, or subject any
particular person or corporation or locality or any particular
description of traffic to any prejudice or disadvantage in any respect
whatsoever.</p>
    <p>"Sec. 23. All hearings and investigations
before the Commission shall be governed by rules adopted by the
Commission, and in the conduct thereof the Commission shall not be
bound by the technical rules of legal evidence."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It will thus be seen that the law affords any shipper a complete and
adequate remedy for any just cause of grievance against a public
utility, and that the Commission not only has the right, but that it is
its duty to hear and grant relief in all proper cases, and that it not
only has the authority, but that it has the power to make and enforce
all reasonable rules and regulations for the operation of any public
utility, including water crafts, vessels and steamships. That is to
say, if the steamships now used on the Davao run are not adequate for
the service, or they are not properly equipped to care for and handle
the Davao business, the Commission has the authority to make reasonable
rules and regulations for such service and equipment and to enforce
them.</p>
  <p> Assuming, without deciding, that the shippers have a
just cause of grievance, that alone would not be a valid reason to
grant a license to the National Coal Company to operate the steamship <em>Pompey</em> on that route, so long as it is owned by the government and is used for and operated in the business of the government.</p>
  <p>
The real question involved here is whether or not upon the same state
of facts, the Public Utility Commission has the legal right to review a
final decision of this court.</p>
  <p> The authorities cited in
respondent's brief are good law, but upon the facts, they are not in
point. Based upon the petition and the facts in the record, we are
clearly of the opinion that all of the proceedings before the
Commission on the second petition are null and void.</p>
  <p> It is
the judgment of the court that the temporary injunction, which was
granted upon the filing of the petition, shall be, and is hereby, made
permanent, and that, neither party recover costs. So ordered.</p>

  <p align="center"><em>DISSENTING </em></p>
  <p><strong>OSTRAND, J.:  </strong></p>
  <p>I dissent. It is well settled that a Public Utilities Commission is an administrative body and that its decisions are not <em>res judicata</em>; it is conceded in the majority opinion that the cases cited to that effect by the defendant (<em>In Re</em> Swan Creek Electric Co., P. U. R. 1915-F; <em>In Re</em> Random Lake Telephone Company, P. U. R. 1916-A; <em>In Re</em> Long Island R. Co., N. Y. 1st Dist, Case No. 1,727, April 4, 1917; Stratton <i>vs.</i> Railroad Commission, 198 Pac., 1051; etc.) are good law.</p>
  <p>
But without stating any reasons, it is asserted that these cases are
not in point. If they are not in point, it must be because the
Commission's decision in the case upon which the petitioners rely for
their plea of <em>res judicata</em> (Public Utilities case No. 2875)
was reviewed and affirmed by this court whereas in the cases cited
there was no such affirmance. That is a distinction without a
difference in principle. Under section 35 of the Public Utilities Act,
all that the court was called upon to do in the case, was to determine
whether the Commission had been acting within its jurisdiction and
whether there was evidence to reasonably support the decision under
review. Upon these points the court found in favor of the Commission
and, simply affirmed its order or decision.</p>
  <p> Now, it seems
clear that such an affirmance of an order cannot change its character;
an administrative order affirmed is none the less an administrative
order, and if so, it is not <em>res judicata</em>. And if the Public Utilities Commission is an administrative body and its decisions are not<em> res judicata</em>,
it necessarily follows that it at any time, if it so sees fit, may
reinvestigate or re-examine the facts upon which one of its former
decisions was based. It must respect the law laid down by this court,
but as to conducting investigations of facts, the Public Utilities Act
gives it a free hand within the limits of its jurisdiction. It is
dealing with constantly changing conditions and in order to properly
exercise its functions, it must have this freedom of investigation; to
hold that just because a court has found that one of the Commission's
orders was reasonably supported by the evidence then before it, the
Commission is forever barred from further investigations of the subject
matter of the order, would necessarily lead to results of which the
Legislature never dreamed and would be disastrous in its consequences.</p>
  <p>
But the court holds that because the petition in this case contains
substantially the same allegations as the petition in the former case,
the Commission has no jurisdiction to reinvestigate the matter and
inquire into the facts. This, I think, is an erroneous conception of
the powers of the Commission. The pleadings in a case before the Public
Utilities Commission are of little importance as far as the
jurisdiction is concerned; the Public Utilities Act expressly gives it
power to institute investigations on its <em>own initiative</em> and that must necessarily mean that it may proceed without any complaint or petition whatever.</p>
  <p>
There is therefore nothing in the law to prevent it from investigating
shipping conditions in Davao at any time upon its own initiative, and
in view of the positive provisions of the statute, I do not think it
can be honestly disputed that if upon such investigation and hearing
the Commission finds that the situation so requires, it has<em> jurisdiction</em>
upon application to order the issuance of a certificate of convenience
to the National Coal Company for the operation of its ships on the
Davao route. If the Commission's order should not be reasonably
supported by the evidence, that would be a matter for review by this
court, but not for the issuance of a writ of certiorari.</p>
  <p> The
preliminary injunction hereinbefore issued orders the Commission to
abstain from further proceeding in the case before it and the decision
of the court makes this injunction permanent. Carrying the decision to
its logical conclusion it means that if there were no petition in the
case, the Commission might proceed, but that with the petition in the
record, it cannot do so. This is technicality with a vengeance. It does
not seem to be good sense and it is not good law. It is significant
that though public utility commissions have for many years existed in
practically every state in the Union, no case can be found where the
courts have by certiorari or otherwise prevented such commissions from
carrying out investigations within their jurisdiction.</p>
  <p> There
is no danger that the Public Utility Commission will undertake
unnecessary investigations; its burden of work is heavy and it will no
doubt know how to protect itself against frivolous demands upon its
time. Undue and unnecessary judicial interference with its functions is
bound to do more harm than good.</p>
  <p>  The decision of the Court contains the following statement:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Assuming,
without deciding, that the shippers have a just cause of grievance,
that alone would not be a valid reason to grant a license to the
National Coal Company to operate the steamship <em>Pompey</em> on that route, <em>so long as it is owned by the government and is used for and operated in the business of the government.</em>" (Italics mine.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
I find it difficult to speak of this statement with patience and in
fairness to the court I think it proper to say that, as far as I know,
neither in this case nor in the case of the National Coal Co. <i>vs.</i>
Public Utility Commission, (47 Phil., 356), was the proposition that
government owned vessels should be discriminated against in the
granting of certificates of public convenience submitted to the vote of
the court. That is a political or legislative question, wholly outside
of the province of the courts. In view of this fact and the further
fact that in this country, with its very limited capital and still more
limited shipping facilities, it has in the past often been found
necessary to supplement the privately owned shipping with government
owned vessels, I do not think this court will deliberately give its
assent to the view expressed upon this point by the writer of the
decision. By our oath of office we are bound to administer evenhanded
justice without regard to parties. Government competition in shipping
need not necessarily be unfair; the Public Utilities Commission has
ample power to so adjust rates as to eliminate such unfairness. </p>
