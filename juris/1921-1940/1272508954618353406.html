				G.R. No. 20366, August 30, 1923</h4>
				<H3>IN RE ESTATE OF WALTER NEUMARK, DECEASED. PAUL P. DANIELSEN, PROPONENT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of the City of 
Manila, denying probate to the document Exhibit B, which purports to be the last 
will and testament of W. Neumark. The will in question was typewritten at Manila 
in the German language upon a single sheet of legal-cap paper and bears the date 
of June 28, 1922. It is signed by the purporting testator and below his 
signature to the left are words which in English mean "signed in the presence 
of," followed by the names of three attesting witnesses M. Cruz, P. Medel, R. 
Petrich.
<p>The document in question fulfils all the requirements of section 618 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure concerning the requisites to the due execution of a will 
in the Philippine Islands, with the sole exception that there is no formal 
attestation clause annexed to the will and containing the matter specified in 
the last sentence of section 618, as amended.</p>
<p>The trial judge denied probate to the document on the sole ground that the 
attestation clause is wanting, and notwithstanding the fact that he was fully 
convinced that the document is authentic and was executed with all the 
formalities required by law with the single exception of the absence of the 
attestation clause.</p>
<p>An earnest effort has been made in this court by the attorneys for the 
proponent of the will to procure a reversal of the order denying probate to the 
will, on the ground that the want of the attestation clause is immaterial where 
the instrument submitted to probate is in fact otherwise executed in the manner 
required by law.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the trial judge committed no error in refusing probate 
to this instrument. As section 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure originally 
stood it contains the following sentence at the end: "But the absence of such 
form of attestation shall not render the will invalid if it is proven that the 
will was in fact signed and attested as in this section provided." As the law 
thus stood the instrument before us was undeniably admissible to probate; but 
when Act No. 2645 was passed, the sentence above quoted was omitted and the last 
sentence of said section as it now stands reads as follows: "The attestation 
shall state the number of sheets or pages used, upon which the will is written, 
and the fact that the testator signed the will and every page thereof, or caused 
some other person to write his name, under his express direction, in the 
presence of three witnesses, and the latter witnessed and signed the will and 
all pages thereof in the presence of the testator and of each other."</p>
<p>In many cases that have arisen since Act No. 2645 went into effect, this 
court has uniformly held that there must be an attestation clause and that it 
must express the material matters mentioned in the foregoing quotation with 
substantial accuracy. Among the considerations conducing to this conclusion was 
the fact that the Legislature had suppressed the last sentence of the section as 
it originally stood, from which the intention was deduced that the Legislature 
intended that the requirement as to the presence of an attestation clause and as 
to its contents should be mandatory.</p>
<p>The admission of the document now before us to probate would abrogate a long 
line of decisions in which the point now in question has been under 
consideration by the court; and we are unable to bring ourselves to disturb a 
rule now generally known and accepted by the profession as embodying our 
interpretation of the statute.</p>
<p>The jugdment appealed from must be affirmed, and it is so ordered, without 
special pronouncement as to costs.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Malcolm, Avance√±a,

<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>For the reasons assigned in my dissenting opinion in G. R. No. 19680, decided 
by this court on March 3, 1923, in the case of Esconde <i>vs</i>. Belen,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> I dissent in this case.</p>
<p>In the instant case, the will is all written on one side of one sheet of 
paper, and is signed by both the testator and the witnesses on the same side of 
the sheet. After it was signed, it was deposited by the testator with the German 
Consul for safe-keeping.</p>
<p>The purpose of the law is to prevent fraud in the making of wills.</p>Under 
the facts shown in the record, in the instant case fraud would be a physical 
impossibility. I am of the opinion that the will was legally executed under the 
existing law, and, for such reason, I dissent.<br><br><br>
