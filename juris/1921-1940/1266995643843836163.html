				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal taken by the accused Dominador Flores y Aguilar from the judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; finding him self-confessed and guilty of the crime of frustrated theft provided for and punished in article 309, case 5, in connection with article 50, of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing him to the principal penalty of eleven days of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor&nbsp;</span> and the additional penalty of two&nbsp; years, four months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prison correctional</span> for being a habitual delinquent, with the accessory penalties of the law and costs.<br><br>In support of his appeal, the appellant contends that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> erred in sentencing him to the principal penalty of eleven days of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>.<br><br>The penalty&nbsp; prescribed by article 309,&nbsp; case&nbsp; 5, of the Revised Penal Code for the crime of consummated&nbsp; theft is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> to its full extent, if the value of the&nbsp; thing stolen is over P5 but&nbsp; does not exceed P50.&nbsp; As the crime of which the defendant-appellant pleaded&nbsp; guilty is&nbsp; frustrated theft, the penalty which should be imposed&nbsp; upon him is the one next lower in degree to <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, which is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>, in accordance with the provisions of article 50, in connection with articles 61 and 70 of said&nbsp; Code. Inasmuch as the aggravating&nbsp; circumstance of recidivism (art.&nbsp; 14, subsec. 9 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code), which is compensated by the mitigating circumstance of the plea of guilty (art. 13, subsec. 7, of said Code), was present at the commission of the crime,&nbsp; said&nbsp; penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> should be imposed in its medium period,&nbsp; or from eleven to twenty days&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>, pursuant to rules 1 and 4 of article 64 of said Code.&nbsp; The principal penalty imposed by the trial court is, therefore, in accordance with law.<br><br>The defendant-appellant does not&nbsp; assign as error&nbsp; the fact that he was declared a habitual delinquent and imposed the corresponding&nbsp; additional&nbsp; penalty by the trial court. Having pleaded guilty of the crime of frustrated theft with which he is charged in the information, and having admitted thereby only the facts alleged therein, which facts are insufficient to prove the existence of habitual delinquency because neither the dates of the former convictions nor those of the commission&nbsp; of the crimes of which he was convicted are&nbsp; specified&nbsp; in said information, the&nbsp; additional penalty prescribed for habitual delinquency cannot "be imposed upon him and, therefore,&nbsp; the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> committed an error of law&nbsp; in declaring the defendant-appellant a habitual delinquent.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People vs. Santiago, 55 Phil., 266; People vs. De la Cruz, G. R. No. 33786, promulgated&nbsp; February 7, 1931, not reported; People vs. Ventura, 56 Phil., 1; Paguntalan vs. Director of Prisons, 57 Phil., 140; People vs. Morales,&nbsp; 61 Phil., 222; People vs. Artigas, G. R. No. 43901, promulgated November 27, 1935 [62 Phil., 972]; People vs. De la Rama, G. R. No. 43744, promulgated November 27,1935 [62 Phil, 972]; People vs. Venus, p. 435, ante.)<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the appealed sentence is reversed in so far as it declares the accused a habitual delinquent and,imposes the corresponding&nbsp; additional penalty upon&nbsp; him, and it is affirmed in all other respects, with the costs of&nbsp; both instances to the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
