				<H3>HERCULES LUMBER  CO.,  INC., PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE, VS. THE  MUNICIPALITY  OF ZAMBOANGA AND  CARLOS DOMINGUEZ, MUNICIPAL  TREASURER OF ZAMBOANGA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was instituted in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Zamboanga by the Hercules Lumber Co., Inc.,&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of recovering from the defendant municipality of Zamboanga,&nbsp; of&nbsp; which the&nbsp; co-defendant Carlos&nbsp; Doxninguez is municipal treasurer, the sum of P112.66 for taxes paid under protest.&nbsp; Upon hearing&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause the&nbsp; trial court gave judgment for the plaintiff to recover the amount sued for with interest from the date of the filing of&nbsp; the complaint, but without costs.&nbsp; From this judgment&nbsp; the defendants appealed.<br><br>It appears that the&nbsp; plaintiff maintains in&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality of Zamboanga a shed&nbsp; (<i>camarin</i>)&nbsp; from&nbsp; which&nbsp; it is accustomed&nbsp; to sell lumber; and, in connection therewith, it operates&nbsp; a machine for sawing lumber, driven by a motor-engine of twenty five&nbsp; (25) horse power. Although these&nbsp; activities&nbsp; are&nbsp; conducted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; upon a moderate scale,&nbsp; we&nbsp; think&nbsp; that they are not&nbsp; improperly designated when we&nbsp; say that&nbsp; the plaintiff is&nbsp; engaged in maintaining a lumber yard and operating&nbsp; a saw-mill.<br><br>On December 14,&nbsp; 1928,&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; council of Zamboanga, acting under the supposed authority of subsection (d)&nbsp; of section 2625&nbsp; of the Administrative Code of 1917, enacted an ordinance&nbsp; (No. 226) purporting to impose a license tax in the amount of one hundred&nbsp; pesos per annum upon each person engaged in selling lumber from a fixed place of deposit&nbsp; (<i>coda vendedor de madera con depdsito estableddo</i>) and also&nbsp; a further annual&nbsp; tax of five pesos per horse power upon&nbsp; each motor-engine for sawing wood (<i>coda mdquina de motor de aserrar madera</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; This ordinance was made effective January 1, 1929, immediately prior to which date the municipal&nbsp; treasurer of the municipality made a formal demand upon the plaintiff for&nbsp; the payment of the&nbsp; license fees upon&nbsp; the activities conducted by it as&nbsp; above stated.&nbsp; The plaintiff questioned the right of the treasurer to collect the tax, but paid the same&nbsp; under protest,&nbsp; and instituted this action&nbsp; to recover the money, as stated in the first paragraph of this opinion.<br><br>Subsection (d)&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 2625&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Administrative Code of 1917 enumerates the&nbsp; activities upon which license taxes may be imposed by the municipal council of municipalities contained in the Province of Zamboanga; but no mention is made therein of the keeping of&nbsp; lumber yards or the maintenance of motor engines for sawing lumber. This is fatal to&nbsp; the&nbsp; pretension of the municipal authorities that&nbsp; they have the power to impose the taxes here in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that in subsection (e) of section&nbsp; 2625, lumber yards and saw-mills are mentioned as&nbsp; businesses that may be regulated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; council; but regulation in the&nbsp; sense&nbsp; intended in said subsection does not include the levying of&nbsp; license taxes for&nbsp; the purposes&nbsp; of revenue.&nbsp; The separate enumeration of the activities which may be lawfully&nbsp; taxed&nbsp; and the activities which&nbsp; may only be regulated reveals the distinction in the mind of the lawmaker between the&nbsp; act of taxing and the act of regulating.&nbsp; The power to regulate should not be construed as including the power&nbsp; to impose license taxes for revenue purposes.&nbsp; It is well&nbsp; established doctrine&nbsp; that subordinate entities like municipal councils can&nbsp; exercise the power of taxation only to the extent specified&nbsp; by law; and this power cannot be extended by strained implications.<br><br>The judgment ordering the refund of the tax will therefore be affirmed, and&nbsp; it is&nbsp; so&nbsp; ordered, with costs against the appellant municipality.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J.,&nbsp; Johnson, Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real,</i>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> JJ.,</span>&nbsp; concur.</div>
