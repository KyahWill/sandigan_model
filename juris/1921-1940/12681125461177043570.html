				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the 28th day&nbsp; of January, 1930,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant was charged in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of the Province of Tayabas with the crime of <i>estafa</i>, in&nbsp; violation of article 534, No. 2, of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3313. The information alleged:<br><blockquote>"Que en o hacia el dia 27 de julio de 1928, en el Municipio de Lucena, Provincia de Tayabas, Islas Filipinas,&nbsp; y dentro de la jurisdiccidn de este Juzgado, el referido acusado Bernabe M. Villapando, con el&nbsp; proposito de defraudar y con ammo&nbsp; de lucro, voluntaria, ilegal y criminalmente, firmo y expidio el cheque&nbsp; No. 36085,&nbsp; por&nbsp; la suma de P200,&nbsp; contra el Philippine&nbsp; National Bank, de Lucena, Tayabas, en pago a cuenta de su deuda con Tan Chuaco, sabiendo dicho acusado que al tiempo de expedirlo&nbsp; no tenia suficientes fondos en dicho banco, para satisfacer su importe, en&nbsp; perjuicio del citado Tan Chuaco en la referida suma de P200, equivalentes a 1,000 pesetas.<br><br>"Con infracci6n de la ley." <br><br>Upon arraignment the defendant pleaded not guilty, was tried, found guilty of the crime&nbsp; charged, and sentenced by the Honorable Anastasio&nbsp; R.&nbsp; Teodoro, judge, to suffer four months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, with the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the offended person in the sum of P200 and to pay the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; From that sentence the defendant&nbsp; appealed, and now contends, in effect, that the evidence is not&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; show beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty&nbsp; of the crime charged.</blockquote>The&nbsp; pertinent facts of this case, as disclosed by the evidence,&nbsp; may be stated as follows:<br><blockquote>The&nbsp; appellant is a physician,&nbsp; and at the time he issued the check in question&nbsp; (Exhibit A) he was&nbsp; engaged in the practice of his profession in&nbsp; Lucena, Tayabas; that on June 30,1928 he issued said check in favor of Tan Chuaco for the sum of P200 to apply on his account with the latter; that he postdated the&nbsp; check "July 27, 1928"; that&nbsp; on the date he issued the check (June 30th)&nbsp; he did not have sufficient funds in the bank, but he expected&nbsp; to collect from&nbsp; his clients sufficient amount to pay said check on July 27,&nbsp; 1928;&nbsp; that a few days before this date, foreseeing his inability to raise the amount of the&nbsp; check, the appellant went to see Tan Chuaco and asked him not to present the check at the bank for collection on June [July] 27, 1928, and at the same time offered to pay the amount thereof in installments, to which Tan Chuaco agreed; that in accordance with said arrangement, the appellant made several payments to Tan Chuaco on account of said check, amounting to P90.</blockquote>We are of the opinion that the appellant cannot be convicted&nbsp; of the crime of <i>estafa</i> on the facts above stated.&nbsp; He issued&nbsp; a postdated check, believing&nbsp; in&nbsp; good faith that he would&nbsp; be able to deposit in the bank sufficient&nbsp; funds to pay said check&nbsp; when&nbsp; presented for&nbsp; collection.&nbsp; He was justified in&nbsp; expecting&nbsp; that he could raise the necessary amount from his fees as a&nbsp; physician, before the check fell due.&nbsp; Then later, foreseeing his inability to pay said check at maturity, he made an arrangement with his creditor to pay it little&nbsp; by little.<br><br>In view of the foregoing,&nbsp; we find that the appellant is innocent of the crime of which he was convicted. Therefore, the sentence appealed&nbsp; from is hereby reversed; the information is dismissed and the appellant is acquitted and ordered released from&nbsp; the&nbsp; custody&nbsp; of the law, with costs <i>de oficio</i>.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Street,&nbsp; Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand, Villa-Real</i>, and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
