				G.R. No. 27588, December 31, 1927</h4>
				<H3>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOP OP NUEVA SEGOVIA, AS REPRE- SENTATIVE  OF THE  ROMAN  CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE  PROVINCIAL  BOARD OF ILOCOS NORTE ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff, the Roman Catholic Apostolic  Church, represented herein by the Bishop of Nueva Segovia, possesses and is the owner of a parcel of land in the municipality of San  Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, all four sides of which face on public streets.  On the south side is  a part of the church-yard, the convent and an adjacent lot used for a vegetable garden, containing an area of 1,624 square  meters,  in which there is a stable and a well for the use of the convent in the center is  the remainder of  the churchyard  and the church.  On the north side is an old cemetery with two of its walls still standing, and a portion where formerly stood a tower, the base of which may still be seen, containing a total area of 8,955 square meters.<br><br>As required by the defendants, on July 3, 1925 the plaintiff paid, under protest, the land tax on the lot adjoining the convent and  the lot which formerly was the cemetery with the  portion where  the tower  stood.<br><br>The plaintiff filed this action for the recovery of  the sum paid by it to the defendants by way of land tax,  alleging that the collection of this tax is illegal.  The lower court absolved  the defendants from the complaint in regard to the lot adjoining the convent  and declared  that  the  tax collected on the lot, which formerly was the cemetery and on the portion where the tower stood,  was illegal.  Both parties appealed from this judgment.<br><br>The exemption in favor of the convent in the payment of the land tax (sec. 344  [c] Administrative Code) refers to the home of the priest who presides over the church and who has  to take care of himself in order to discharge his duties.  It therefore must, in  this sense, include not only the land  actually occupied by the  church, but also the adjacent ground destined  to the ordinary incidental uses of man.  Except in large cities where the density of the population and  the development of commerce require  the  use of larger tracts  of land for buildings, a vegetable garden belongs to a house and,  in the case of a convent, its use is limited to the necessities of the priest, which comes under the exemption.<br><br>In regard to the lot which  formerly  was the cemetery, while it is  no longer used as  such, neither is it used for commercial purposes and, according to the evidence, is now being used as a lodging house by the people who participate Bishop of Nueva Segovia vs. Prov. Board of Ilocos Norte in religious festivities, which constitutes  an  incidental use in religious functions, which also comes within the exemption.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is reversed in all its parts and it is held that both lots are exempt from land tax and the defendants are ordered to refund to plaintiff whatever was paid as such tax, without any special pronouncement as to  costs.   So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street,  Villamor, Ostrand, Johns</span>,  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real,  JJ</span>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Malcolm, J.</span>, dissenting:<br><br>The Assessment Law exempts from taxation "Cemeteries or burial grounds  *   *   *  and all lands,  buildings, and improvements  used  exclusively   for  religious  *  *  * purposes; but this exemption shall not extend to property held for investment, or which produces income, even though the income be devoted to  some one or more of the purposes above specified."   (Administrative Code,  sec. 344; Act No. 2749,  sec. 1.)  That is the  applicable law.  The facts may be taken as found by the judge of First Instance, who made his findings more certain by an  ocular  inspection  of the property under consideration.  The testimony and the inspection  disclosed that the  lot known as  "huerta" was not devoted to religious purposes, and that  the old cemetery had long since ceased to be used as such  and had been planted to corn.  Those are the facts.  The test to be applied  to  the  combined law and facts must  be the actual use of the property.   The property legally exempt from the payment of taxes must be devoted to some purpose specified in the law.  A "huerta" not needed or  used  exclusively for religious purposes  is not  thus exempt.  A cemetery or burial ground no longer  a  cemetery or a burial ground is not thus exempt.   Accordingly, I prefer to vote for the affirmance of Judge Mariano's decision.</div>
