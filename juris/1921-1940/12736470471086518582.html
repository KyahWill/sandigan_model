of the Province of Camarines Sur on January 18, 1923, the plaintiffs, Juliana 
Abragan and her daugther, Julieta Abragan, seek to recover from the defendant, 
Jose N. Garchitorena, administrator of the estate of Andres Garchitorena, 
deceased, three parcels of real property described in paragraph I of the 
complaint; to obtain a judicial declaration that said property belongs in 
usufruct to the plaintiff, Juliana Abragan, with the nude ownership in her 
daugther, Julieta; and further to recover a sum of money as alleged damages for 
detention of the said properties. Upon hearing the cause the trial court 
absolved the defendants from the complaint and the plaintiffs appealed.
<p>It appears that Julieta G. Abragan is the natural daughter of Don Andres 
Garchitorena, deceased, formerly a resident of the municipality of Tigaon, in 
the Province of Camarines Sur. Not long before his death in the year 1921 the 
said Andres Garchitorena executed two deeds of gift, Exhibits A and B, bearing 
the date of February 10, 1920, though the correct date was evidently 1921. The 
first of these documents conveys by way of gift to Julieta G. Abragan and her 
mother Juliana Abragan, two parcels of property, namely, first, a piece of land 
planted with fruit-bearing coconut trees and having an area of nine hectares, 
located in the barrio of Matacla, in the municipality of Goa, Camarines Sur, 
valued at P2,000; and, secondly, a building lot in the <em>pueblo</em> of 
Tigaon, of an area of 446 square meters, containing a warehouse 
(<em>camarin</em>) for commercial use, and having a value of P1,900. The 
instrument gives to the mother, Juliana, the lisufruct in these properties and 
to the daughter, Julieta, the nude ownership. By the second instrument (Exhibit 
B) the same donor gives to the same donees and in the same manner a piece of 
hemp land having an area of twenty hectares, and located in the barrio of 
Tinawgan, municipality of Tigaon, Camarines Sur. Both of these instruments 
contain an acceptance of the gifts on the part of Julieta G. Abragan, aided by 
her mother Juliana; but owing to circumstances not necessary to be here set out, 
neither document was at any time acknowledged before a notary public.</p>
<p>After the death of the donor, Rita G. de Centenera, who is the sole heir of 
Andres Garchitorena, qualified as special administratrix of his estate; and on 
April 1, 1921, she executed a public document (Exhibit D) in which she recites 
that her deceased father had in life made two donations in favor of his 
daughter, Julieta G. Abragan, and Juliana Abragan, vesting the nude ownership in 
Julieta and the usufruct in Juliana. The declarant then proceeds to give a 
description of the two properties described in the deed of gift Exhibit A, but 
making no' mention of the hemp land described in the document Exhibit B; and she 
declares that, being the universal heir of all the property left by her deceased 
father, she recognizes said donations as his last expressed will, "in order that 
they may have full legal effect in the premises" (<em>para que tengan sus 
efectos, cuantos en derecho lugar haya</em>).</p>
<p>After this document had been executed and delivered, Rita G. de Centenera 
ceased to be special administratrix of the estate of her father and one Jose N. 
Garchitorena was appointed as administrator in her stead. The properties 
mentioned in the deeds of gift appear to have come into the possession of the 
said administrator of Andres Garchitorena, who now refuses to recognize the 
validity of the donations. The present action was therefore instituted by the 
Abragans, mother and daughter, to test their rights upon the facts above 
recited.</p>
<p>It is quite evident, as declared by the trial judge, that these deeds of 
gift, Exhibits A and B, had no effect whatever per se, for the reason that the 
instruments referred to never took the form of a public document and were not 
accepted by the donees in any public document in the life of the donor. 
(Velasquez vs. Biala, 18 Phil., 231; Abellara vs. Balanag, 37 Phil., 865.) Nor 
can it be said that the donations are onerous and subject to the rules governing 
contracts (art. 622, Civ. Code), although said donations are declared by the 
donor to rest in part upon consideration of the past services rendered to him by 
Juliana Abragan. A gift in compensation for services is considered to have been 
made upon an onerous consideration (<em>causa onerosa</em>) only when the 
services which constitute the determining cause have not yet been rendered. 
(Carlos vs. Ramil, 20 Phil., 183.)</p>
<p>It appears that the deed of conveyance of the hemp land, Exhibit B, imposes 
on the donee the duty to pay off a mortgage for P5,000 in favor of the 
Philippine National Bank; and it is suggested that this gift should be 
considered as having been made upon an onerous consideration from the existence 
of this obligation, but it is clear that it cannot be so considered. As was said 
by Chief Justice Arellano in Castillo vs. Castillo and Quizon (23 Phil., 364, 
367), "A gift of this kind is not in fact a gift for a valuable consideration, 
but is remuneratory or compensatory, made for the purpose of remunerating or 
compensating a charge, burden or condition imposed upon the donee, inferior to 
the value of the gift, * * *" and under article 622 of the Civil Code such a 
gift is governed by the provisions relating to gifts and not contracts.</p>
<p>It remains to consider what effect, if any, can be attributed to the deed 
executed by Rita G. de Centenera after her father's death, in which she, in her 
own right and as sole heir of her father, recognized the validity of the gifts 
contained in Exhibit A (not Exhibit B). Upon this point it is at once obvious 
that this act cannot be considered as naving retroactively perfected the gifts 
attempted to be made in the Exhibit A. But we are of the opinion that this 
document should operate, with respect to the lands mentioned therein, as a 
quitclaim on the part of Rita G. de Centenera, and she is estopped from 
asserting any right to said properties. In this connection we note that the 
commentator Manresa cites a decision of the supreme court of Spain, from June 
12, 1896, in which a ratification by the heirs of a deceased donor was given 
effect although the deed of gift had never been accepted in the form required by 
law. (5 Manresa, 2d ed., 115.) The deed of ratification in the case before us 
was based upon a commendable motive, which was the desire of the declarant to 
give effect to the wishes of her father. This was a good consideration in law 
and sufficient to give legal effect to the instrument, though not precisely in 
the sense expressed. It is needless to say that this document could not be given 
effect to the prejudice of creditors of the estate of a deceased person, and 
while we hold that it is effective for the purpose of raising an estoppel 
against the heir, the plaintiffs cannot maintain this action against the 
administrator of the donor. It will therefore be necessary for them to intervene 
in the proceedings in administration and ask that their rights to the properties 
covered by Exhibit A be there recognized.</p>
<p>A judgment of affirmance <em>pro forma</em> must therefore be entered, 
without prejudice to the rights of the plaintiffs to assert their rights by a 
proper proceeding in the administration of the estate. The judgment will be 
affirmed, without express pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Malcolm, Avancena, Villamor, Ostrand</em>, and <em>Romualdez, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
