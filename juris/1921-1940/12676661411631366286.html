				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">About the month of July,&nbsp; 1925, the offended party, Rafaela M.&nbsp; Cruz, lived with her husband and two children, aged 8 and 4 years, respectively, in their house in the barrio of San Roque of the municipality of Zamboanga.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the afternoon of the 6th day of that month the complaining witness was&nbsp; alone in her house with her two children, as her husband,&nbsp; who had&nbsp; gone to&nbsp; town,&nbsp; did not come home that afternoon.&nbsp; At about half-past six&nbsp; the defendant, Matias Ebol, uncle of the offended party, went to the house carrying some fishes which he said, as was the fact, were sent to her by her husband.&nbsp; The offended party took the fishes and cooked them&nbsp; and then&nbsp; invited the&nbsp; accused to take supper with her, which&nbsp; invitation he accepted.&nbsp; After the supper it seemed as though it was&nbsp; going to rain and the accused, fearing that the rain might overtake him on the way,&nbsp; asked the offended party to allow&nbsp; him to pass the night in her&nbsp; house to which she consented.&nbsp; The accused slept&nbsp; in the&nbsp; parlor and the offended party in the room accompanied&nbsp; by her two children.&nbsp; Between the two compartments&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; door that&nbsp; was&nbsp; kept&nbsp; open most&nbsp; of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 4 o'clock in the morning the complaining witness woke up, feeling that a man, who was the defendant, was on top of her&nbsp; attempting to have carnal knowledge&nbsp; with her.&nbsp; The offended party did all she could to avoid the&nbsp; defendant's evil purpose&nbsp; but the latter overcame&nbsp; all her&nbsp; resistance and succeeded&nbsp; in&nbsp; having carnal intercourse with her.&nbsp; When the defendant left the house at dawn, the offended party immediately repaired to her mother's house in another&nbsp; barrio, where her aunt Encarnacion Aguilar lived, in order to tell them what had happened to her.&nbsp; When she arrived at&nbsp; her mother's house and after relating the outrage just committed upon her, Encarnacion Aguilar accompanied her to the town to look for the husband&nbsp; of the complaining witness,&nbsp; and when they found him, she told him all&nbsp; that had happened to her.<br><br>That same morning when the defendant saw the&nbsp; complaining witness and Encarnacion Aguilar in the town, he expressed his resentment to the former for having informed her husband of the matter, telling her that he did it during a nightmare and prayed Encarnacion to intercede between him and the husband of&nbsp; the offended party to&nbsp; avoid&nbsp; a heavy punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the afternoon of that&nbsp; same day, July 7, the defendant was in the house of Macario Bonifacio and told the latter that he had&nbsp; "forced" the offended party and mentioned the fact that he had no other alternative than to plead guilty and asked him&nbsp; to look after his children.&nbsp; These facts appear from the testimony of the complaining witness, Encarnacion Aguilar and Macario Bonifacio. Encarnacion Aguilar is a sister of the accused and Macario Bonifacio is his nephew.<br><br>About 10 o'clock in the same morning the offended party was examined by&nbsp; Doctor Rodriguez&nbsp; who found within her vagina&nbsp; positive existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; spermatozoa.&nbsp;&nbsp; The offended party stated that&nbsp; she had&nbsp; not had carnal intercourse with her husband since the 3d of that month.<br><br>The accused having been&nbsp; charged with&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of rape, he&nbsp; was found guilty and there being present the aggravating circumstance&nbsp; of nocturnity he was sentenced to seventeen years, four months and one day of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion temporal&nbsp;</span> and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the costs.<br><br>The defendant's guilt is clearly&nbsp; proven.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sole defense was his own testimony&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; His counsel&nbsp; in this instance states that&nbsp; his guilt has&nbsp; been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and only urges that the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity should not be taken into consideration as was&nbsp; done by&nbsp; the trial court.&nbsp; The Attorney-General,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; the aggravating circumstance of the crime having been committed in the dwelling of the&nbsp; offended party must be considered&nbsp; in the&nbsp; imposition of the penalty.&nbsp; We are of the opinion&nbsp; that at least the crime was committed with abuse of confidence taking into consideration the relationship between the offended&nbsp; party&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; and&nbsp; the fact that the latter asked for shelter in&nbsp; her house that night. At&nbsp; any rate&nbsp; the concurrence&nbsp; of this circumstance justifies the imposition of the penalty in its maximum degree.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed with costs against&nbsp; the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Street,&nbsp; Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
