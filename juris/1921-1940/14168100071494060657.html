				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; action&nbsp; was&nbsp; commenced in the Court of First Instance of the Province&nbsp; of Iloilo.&nbsp; Its purpose was to recover of the defendant the&nbsp; municipality of Iloilo the sum of P15,780 as the value of two lots Nos. 537 and 703 which, the plaintiff claimed, the defendant municipality had illegally appropriated, together with the sum&nbsp; of P5,000 as damages and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; The recovery of said sums was opposed by the defendants upon the ground that the plaintiff and appellant&nbsp; was not and&nbsp; never had been&nbsp; the owner of said lots&nbsp; Nos. 537 and&nbsp; 703..&nbsp;&nbsp; The municipality&nbsp; of Iloilo contended that it had purchased said&nbsp; lots from Concepcion Lopez&nbsp; on the&nbsp; 9th day of March,&nbsp; 1925, for the purpose of widening the adjoining&nbsp; streets&nbsp; and had paid therefor the sum of P25,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other defendants answered the petition and&nbsp; supported the contention&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipality.<br><br>After hearing&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; presented, the Honorable Leopoldo Rovira reached the conclusion that&nbsp; a preponderance&nbsp; of the evidence supported the contention of the defendants, and rendered a judgment&nbsp; absolving them from all liability under the complaint, without any finding as to costs.&nbsp; From that judgment the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>In order that the facts in the present cause may be more clearly understood,&nbsp; reference to the following map may be made:<br><br>See Image Vol. 49 Phil. 771<br><br>It appears from the documentary evidence found in the record that prior to the 9th day of March, 1915, Concepcion Lopez was the owner of lots 228-A, 228-B, 537, and 703 as seen in said map, and that on said 9th day of March, 1915, all of said lots constituted lot No, 228.&nbsp; On the 9th day of March, 1915,&nbsp; Concepcion Lopez sold to the City of Iloilo a part of said lot, now numbered 537 and 703 for the sum of P25,000.&nbsp; The&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Iloilo promised to pay to Concepcion Lopez the said sum of&nbsp; P25,000&nbsp; within a&nbsp; period of ten years&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 1).&nbsp; On the 10th&nbsp; day of November, 1915, after the presentation of a petition for the registration of lot 228,&nbsp; a certificate of title&nbsp; (No. 464)&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued in favor of Concepcion for said lot 228, including lots 537 and 703.&nbsp; The inclusion of said lots&nbsp; (537 and 703) in said certificate of title was evidently an error on the part of someone connected with the office of the registrar of titles under the Torrens system.<br><br>Later and on&nbsp; the 27th day of April, 1918,&nbsp; Concepcion Lopez sold to Maximo M. Kalaw and wife said lot 228, including lots 537 and 703 evidently by mistake (see transfer certificate No. 617 and Exhibits B and 6).&nbsp; It is&nbsp; said that the inclusion of said lots 537 and 703 was a mistake because Concepcion Lopez&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as Maximo M. Kalaw&nbsp; and wife were&nbsp; ignorant of the fact&nbsp; that said&nbsp; lots were included in their&nbsp; transfer certificate of title.&nbsp; Later&nbsp; and&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 11th day of August, 1919,&nbsp; Concepcion Lopez, representing Maximo&nbsp; M, Kalaw, sold said lots (228, 537, and 703) to Julio Ledesma, which sale was ratified by Maximo M. Kalaw and his wife on the 15th day of August, 1919&nbsp; (see Exhibit D.) Later a transfer certificate of title No.&nbsp; 908 was&nbsp; issued in favor of Julio&nbsp; Ledesma (Exhibit H).&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the admissions of Julio Ledesma lots 537&nbsp; and 703&nbsp; were included by mistake.<br><br>On the 15th day of September, 1919, Julio Ledesma sold a portion&nbsp; of lot No. 228 to Tomas Locsin <i>et al.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; Later&nbsp; a subdivision of lot 228 was made into two lots&nbsp; 228-A and 228-B.&nbsp; Lot&nbsp; 228-A&nbsp; remained&nbsp; the property of Julio Ledesma (see transfer certificate of title&nbsp; No. 1131, Exhibit I).&nbsp; Said&nbsp; lots 537 and&nbsp; 703,&nbsp; according to said&nbsp; transfer certificate,&nbsp; remained the property of Julio Ledesma.<br><br>On the 2d day of August, 1922, folio Ledesma sold to the appellant herein lots Nos. 228-A, 537, and 703 (see transfer certificate 1989 in favor of Celso Ledesma, Exhibit J).<br><br>Again, according to Julio Ledesma, lots 537 and 703 were included in the transfer of lot No. 228-A to Celso Ledesma by mistake.<br><br>The theory of the&nbsp; appellant is that, by reason of the fact that said&nbsp; lots 537 and 703&nbsp; had been included in the registered title&nbsp; (title No. 464) of Concepcion&nbsp; Lopez in November, 1915, and Concepcion included in&nbsp; each succeeding transfer&nbsp; of&nbsp; title to&nbsp; him said lots, that he was the indisputable owner&nbsp; thereof, and because the City of Iloilo had appropriated said lots, that he was entitled to recover the value of said lots together with damages.<br><br>With reference to the theory of the appellant, an examination&nbsp; of the record shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; as early as April,&nbsp; 1915, said lots had been turned over by Concepcion Lopez to the City of Iloilo under&nbsp; a contract of sale for&nbsp; street purposes.<br><br>That fact was well known.&nbsp; The said lots had been included&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; part of the streets of the City&nbsp; of Iloilo.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had been segregated from the lot formerly owned by Concepcion Lopez.&nbsp; Said lots 537 and 703&nbsp; had become a part of a public&nbsp; highway established by law.&nbsp; The same were therefore&nbsp; illegally included, in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 39&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 496, in the certificate&nbsp; of title issued&nbsp; to&nbsp; Concepcion Lopez&nbsp; on the 10th&nbsp; day of November, 1915.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; fact was&nbsp; recognized by&nbsp; Concepcion Lopez as well as by each of the subsequent purchasers&nbsp; of said lots.&nbsp;&nbsp; The simple possession of a certificate of title, under the Torrens system,&nbsp; does not necessarily make the possessor a true owner of all the property described therein.<br><br>If a person obtains a title, under the Torrens system, which includes by mistake&nbsp; or oversight land which cannot be registered under the Torrens system, he does not, by virtue&nbsp; of said certificate alone, become the owner of the lands illegally included.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Legarda and Prieto<i> vs.</i> Saleeby, 31 Phil., 590.)<br><br>The inclusion of public highways in a certificate of title does&nbsp; not thereby necessarily give&nbsp; to&nbsp; the holder&nbsp; of such certificate said public highways.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant, therefore, even though a part of said streets (lots 537 and 703) had been&nbsp; included in the original&nbsp; certificate of title and in the subsequent transfers of title,&nbsp; did&nbsp; not become the owner&nbsp; of said lots and is not therefore entitled to recover their value from the&nbsp; City of Iloilo nor&nbsp; the&nbsp; damages prayed for.<br><br>For all of the&nbsp; foregoing reasons, the&nbsp; judgment of the lower court is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs..&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avancena, C. J., Street, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ, </i>concur.<br><br><i>Malcolm, </i>and <i>Ostrand, JJ., </i>concur in the result.<br></div>
