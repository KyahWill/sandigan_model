				<H3>THE GOVERKMENT OF THE PHIUPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CLARA SANTOS, AS GUARDIAN OF AMBROSIA, LUIS, ANDRES, ROQUE, AND FELISA, ALL SURNAMED CEPILLO CRUZ.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was instituted by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Government of the Philippine Islands to recover from Clara Santos,&nbsp; as guardian of Ambrosio, Luis, Andres, Roque, and Felisa,&nbsp; of the surname Cepillo Cruz, a sum of money alleged to be owing as income tax of their father for the years 1923 and 1925.&nbsp; Upon hearing the cause the trial court gave judgment for the plaintiff to recover of the defendant the sum of P318.43 as income tax&nbsp; for the year 1923 and the sum of P710.04 for the year 1925, with the surcharges and interest as fixed by law, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the defendant.&nbsp; From this judgment the defendant guardian appealed on behalf of her wards.<br><br>No question is&nbsp; made as to the fact that for the years mentioned income accrued&nbsp; against Felix Cepillo Cruz,&nbsp; the father of the minor defendants,&nbsp; or against his estate, after his death, in the amount found by the trial court and that said&nbsp; income taxes have not been paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two questions of moment are raised in the&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; brief,&nbsp; which, are,&nbsp; first,&nbsp; that the claim should have&nbsp; been filed with the&nbsp; commissioners appointed to receive and report&nbsp; upon claims against&nbsp; the estate,&nbsp; and, secondly, that an&nbsp; action will&nbsp; not lie&nbsp; against the heirs, the administrator&nbsp; being the person primarily chargeable with this obligations.<br><br>These two points are fully met by&nbsp; two decisions of this court.&nbsp; The.first is&nbsp; Pineda&nbsp; vs. Court of First Instance of Tayabas,&nbsp; 27 O.&nbsp; G. 1272, and the second&nbsp; is Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Pamintuan,&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; Ho. 33139.&nbsp; It appears that the property&nbsp; belonging to the estate of Felix Cepillo Cruz has been&nbsp; distributed among his&nbsp; children,&nbsp; the minor defendants in&nbsp; this case, who are&nbsp; hie heirs;&nbsp; and the propriety of permitting&nbsp; this action&nbsp; directly against the guardian of the heirs follows&nbsp; from that fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is really&nbsp; an action for equitable contribution from the heirs.&nbsp; Of course their liability could not be extended&nbsp; beyond the&nbsp; amount of the property severally received by them, but no question is made that the&nbsp; guardian is in possession of ample&nbsp; means to meet the&nbsp; obligations.<br><br>Furthermore, ample authority for the maintenance of thi3 action is contained in section 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a3&nbsp; interpreted&nbsp; by this court in Lopez vs. Enriquez, 16 Phil. 336.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said section clearly recognizes the&nbsp; obligation of heirs and legatees&nbsp; who&nbsp; have come into the possession of property subject to any liability chargeable against the estate of their testator&nbsp; to contribute ratably, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the amount of property which&nbsp; has&nbsp; come into their&nbsp; hands, to the satisfaction of such liability;&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the&nbsp; last clause&nbsp; of said section it is said: "and the persons who, as heirs,&nbsp; have received the estate not disposed of by will, shall be liable to&nbsp; contribute like the devisees or legatees."<br><br>The judgment appealed from will be affirmed, and it is so ordered, with costs against the appellant guardian.<br><br>Ten days after the publication of this decision final judgment will be entered, and five days thereafter the record will be remanded to the court below.<br><br>JIDGMEITT AFFIRMED .<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.J., Malcolm, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
