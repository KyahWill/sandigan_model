<p>This is an action to recover damages resulting from a fire on June 29, 1921, 
alleged to have been caused by sparks emitted from a locomotive of the 
defendant. The complaint alleges negligence, first, in allowing dangerous 
combustible materials to accumulate on its right of way, and in permitting 
several nipa houses to be constructed close to its railroad track; second, in 
not providing engine No. 33 with a spark-arrester; third, in using wood in the 
engine as fuel; and, fourth, in negligently operating the engine causing large 
amounts of sparks and cinders to emit from its chimney, which kindled the fire 
that destroyed the house of Tomas Diores and the houses of the plaintiff and 
other persons.</p>
<p>For answer, the defendant made a general denial, and, as a special defense, 
alleges the proper equipment and management of its engine, and the contributory 
negligence of the plaintiff in allowing his two houses to stand 19 and 30 
meters, respectively, from the railroad track. The defendant denies the use of 
wood for fuel in engine No. 33 on the day in question, although it admits it did 
use wood in all of its other engines. It also admits that engine No. 33 was not 
provided with spark-arrester, but claims that the engine does not need one. The 
defendant also admits that nipa houses were constructed very close to its track, 
and that it had formerly collected rents from the houses. But at the time in 
question, it had ceased to collect rents, and had advised the occupants to 
vacate the premises. It also admits that the houses of the plaintiff were not 
built on defendant's right of way, but on his own lot, and it appears that they 
were built long before the existence of the defendant as a corporation. The 
plaintiff claims damages in the sum of P6,127.</p>
<p>As a result of a long and tedious trial, the lower court rendered judgment 
for the plaintiff in the sum of P3,000, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent 
per annum from the filing of the complaint and costs, from which the defendant 
appeals, assigning thirteen different errors, in substance, that the court erred 
in finding that the fire was due to the negligence of the defendant in the 
operation of its engine; that the origin of the fire was due to the emission of 
sparks from the engine; that the engine should be equipped with a 
spark-arrester; that it emitted sparks, as alleged; that the fuel used was wood 
instead of coal; that at or about the time of the fire, sparks were seen to be 
emitted from the smoke stack of the locomotive; that at the time the engine was 
hauling three loaded cars, and in failing to find that the plaintiff was guilty 
of contributory negligence, and that the law of railroads is not in force, and 
in its valuation of the property destroyed; and in not finding for the 
defendant.</p>
<p>The amount involved on this appeal is only P3,000, and costs, but it appears 
from the record that a number of other cases are pending against the company to 
recover damages resulting from the same fire, amounting in the aggregate to more 
than P10,000, and, for such reasons, and on account of its importance, this case 
has been considered in <i>banc</i>.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Both parties have filed able and exhaustive briefs.</p>
<p>In a well-written opinion, his Honor, Judge Adolph Wislizenus, made the 
following analysis of the facts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a suit for damages caused by the destruction by fire of two houses 
belonging to plaintiff. Plaintiff's houses were built long before the 
construction of defendant's railroad and even before defendant's existence as a 
corporation. They stood on land not belonging to defendant on the north side of 
Calle Panganiban in Cebu city facing south, this street having a general east 
and west course. On the south side of Calle Panganiban a very few feet south is 
the track and railway of the defendant, which runs along and more or less 
parallel with Calle Panganiban. Near these tracks and on the railroad road bed 
stood the house of Tomas Diores which faced Calle Panganiban and extended to 
within a few feet of the south side of Calle Panganiban. Almost opposite the 
house and on the north side of Calle Panganiban which is here only twenty feet 
wide stood the two houses of plaintiff.</p>
<p>"Along the railroad track described defendant was in the habit of running or 
operating a switch track with engines with or without cars, from the wharf in 
Cebu city to its main station in Cebu and <i>vice versa</i>. The land between 
defendant's tracks and the south side of Calle Panganiban was all of it except a 
bolt of a few feet in width near the south side of Calle Panganiban the property 
of defendant acquired by condemnation proceedings. This land belonging to the 
defendant, at the date complained of, was occupied by a number of houses 
including the house of Tomas Diores, mostly of light materials, some of them 
with wooden partitions, others with bamboo partitions, but all with nipathatched 
roofs. These houses were some of them of persons owning the land on which they 
stood before the defendant acquired the land by condemnation proceedings; others 
belonged to people who were allowed to 'squat' by defendant.</p>
<p>"On June 29, 1921, at about 9.30 a. m., a 'pony engine' owned and operated by 
defendant passed along the tracks described (also owned and operated by 
defendant) going from the Cebu city wharf to the main station in the same place. 
It carried three heavily loaded roof freight cars—one loaded with cross ties and 
the other two with wood for fuel (called 'rajas' in Cebu). There is some 
testimony that the engine drew four or five cars but the court finds that they 
did not exceed three in number.</p>
<p>"As the cars passed along the tracks parallel with Calle Panganiban from a 
point known as Forbes Bridge (where Calle Magallanes is carried over the tracks) 
it passed the house of one Tomas Diores. This house was situated across Calle 
Panganiban (20 feet wide at the place) and on the south side of said street. 
Opposite to it and on the north side of Calle Panganiban were plaintiff's 
houses. Diores' house was almost in contact with defendant's tracks. It had a 
nipa roof. A few charred rear <i>harigues</i> of Diores' house are still to be 
seen within twenty feet of the nearest rail. The eaves of its roof were (before 
the fire) within five feet of the near rail. As one witness said 'it was 
possible from Diores' house to pull off a stick off the cars loaded with wood as 
they passed.' The rear part of Diores' house stood on defendant's land and a 
portion of the front part of Diores' house reached to within a few feet of the 
south line of Panganiban street separated from plaintiff's houses which stood on 
the north side of Panganiban street by the width of said street, <i>i. e.,</i> 
some twenty feet.</p>
<p>"As the engine and cars passed the house of Tomas Diores clouds of smoke 
poured from the smoke stack of the engine which was not provided with a 
spark-arrester. The south wind was blowing strongly, and blew the smoke which 
carried numerous cinders hot and incandescent to the nipa roof of Tomas Diores' 
house which almost touched the tracks. Before the train had proceeded more than 
a few hundred yards (toward Calle Colon) the wind had fanned these sparks and 
cinders into flames, the roof of Diores' house visibly burning and the cry of 
'fire!' was raised. The upper part of the house ('los altos') was locked and 
unoccupied. The lower part ('los bajos') was occupied by a <i>lavandera</i> who 
had not made any fire in the 'fogon' that morning having made a breakfast of 
cold rice left over from the evening before. This woman describes the time which 
elapsed from the passing of the train till the cry of 'fire!' was raised quite 
graphically. She was counting laundry pieces as the train went by and had not 
counted a hundred pieces (laundry is charged for by the hundreds in Cebu) before 
the cry of 'fire!' was raised. From the house of Diores the fire spread by 
sparks carried by the wind to other houses which were standing near (much less 
than a stone's throw) from Diores' house. From these houses the fire spread 
across Panganiban street (twenty feet wide at that place) to plaintiff's houses 
on the north side of Panganiban street which were destroyed by the fire before 
assistance could be rendered by the firemen.</p>
<p>"Considerable stress was laid in the course of argument whether at the time 
in question the engine was using wood or coal as fuel. The court is inclined to 
believe that wood was used as fuel, at least immediately before and while 
passing the house of Tomas Diores. Whether wood or coal was used as fuel, the 
court has no doubt that the fire started in the roof of Diores' house by hot 
sparks and cinders carried in the smoke cloud which issued from the smoke stack 
of engine number 33 unprovided, as heretofore stated, with a spark-arrester. 
Furthermore defendant was guilty of negligence in allowing the house of Tomas 
Diores (and those of others) to remain on its land in such close proximity to 
its railroad tracks that the only wonder is that the fire did not happen long 
ago. Indeed from a remark dropped by one of the witnesses (though perhaps not 
relevant in fixing the blame in this case) quite a number of fires have occurred 
at the place from the same alleged causes. Of course plaintiff (whose houses did 
not stand on defendant's land) is not responsible for negligence in that 
regard.</p>
<p>"It is true that defendant sent formal notices to Diores and others (not 
plaintiff) to remove their houses from its land, but no real effort (by suing 
defendants in ejectment in justice's court) was made until after the fire 
complained of.</p>
<p>"There is no attempt to deny that engine 33 was unprovided with a 
spark-arrester. The court can take judicial notice of the fact that a locomotive 
engine unprovided with a spark-arrester is likely to throw sparks and cause 
fires. The court takes judicial knowledge that for many years ordinary caution 
has exacted the use of spark-arresters on engines passing near combustible 
materials. No amount of 'expert' testimony can affect that knowledge.</p>
<p>"Defendant has offered an ocular inspection to prove that engine number 33 
can go along its tracks at the site of the fire in question, without emitting 
sparks or hot cinders from its smoke stack. This appears to be begging the 
question. The court has no doubt that with special care as to fuel and firing 
(not exercised on June 29, 1921) engine number 33 <i>can</i> pass the site of 
Diores' house without showering the adjoining houses and territory with 
dangerous sparks especially if the day appointed for the 'demonstration' be 
wind-still and not with a strong south wind blowing as on June 29, 1921. In fact 
defendant's contention that engine 33 <i>could</i> have avoided throwing out 
sparks calls upon it to explain why on June 29, 1921, it did not do so. On that 
point testimony of plaintiff's witnesses as to what <i>did</i> happen with 
engine sparks and houses on June 29, 1921, outweighs—in the court's opinion—the 
testimony of those of defendant's witnesses calling themselves experts (without 
being ocular witnesses) as to what should or even could have happened on that 
day.</p>
<p>"As to the value of plaintiff's two houses destroyed by the fire, started by 
defendant's negligence, plaintiff claims one to have been worth P5,000 and the 
other to have been worth P1,000 and their furniture to have been worth P154. 
Before the fire plaintiff had valued these properties for taxation purposes at 
P2,100 and P50 respectively. Afterwards (before the fire) plaintiff had obtained 
a reduction of this valuation to P1,200 and P50. In the United States the 
veriest 'runts' are apt to develop into pedigreed stock if killed on the 
railroad tracks. Something of this kind has evidently happened in this case. As 
a rule in this jurisdiction the assessed value of property for taxation purposes 
is one-half or one-third of its selling value. The court believes that P3,000 
represents the reasonable value of plaintiff's property (two houses and 
furniture) destroyed by the fire."</p></blockquote>
<p>All of such findings are well supported by the evidence. In fact the record 
shows an aggravated case of negligence on the part of the defendant. Under the 
conditions then and there existing, a fire of this nature could have happened at 
almost any time.</p>
<p>Among other defenses, the defendant relies upon a Royal Decree promulgated on 
the 23d of November, 1877. Article 11 of that Decree provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whenever there are individual rights existing prior to the establishment of 
a railroad or to the promulgation of this act which after its passage cannot be 
created and are to be abolished for the need or use of the railroads, the rules 
for condemnation proceedings on account of public utility provided for in the 
Act of July 17, 1836, the provisions of the act on public works and the 
administrative regulations to enforce it should be observed."</p></blockquote>
<p>The record here is conclusive that the plaintiff's houses were on his own 
property, and that they were constructed before the railroad was built or even 
the company was organized. It is also conclusive that for some time previous to 
the fire, the defendant was the owner of land adjoining its track, upon which a 
number of houses stood within a few feet of the track, and from which it was 
collecting rents. In other words, by its own acts, the defendant was violating 
the spirit and intent of the Royal Decree of 1877, to protect railroad property 
from loss by fire. Where, as in the instant case, the violation of the Royal 
Decree by the defendant was the proximate cause of the injury, it may well be 
doubted whether the Decree could be invoked as a defense to the action. Be that 
as it may, article 11 above quoted simply provides that, in such cases, the 
property of adjoining owners can be condemned and taken by the payment of its 
value. In no event, without condemnation proceedings, could the Royal Decree of 
1877 be made to apply to houses which were constructed before the railroad was 
built, and which became adjoining property by the building of the railroad.</p>
<p>The proof is conclusive that the fire was caused by sparks emitted from one 
of defendant's engines, which set fire to one of its own houses standing within 
a few feet of its track, resulting in the destruction of a large amount of 
adjoining property. The evidence shows a clear case of negligence on the part of 
the defendant.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed, with costs. So 
ordered.</p><i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor,</i> and 
<i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
