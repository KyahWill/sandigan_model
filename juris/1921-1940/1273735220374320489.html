<p>(Then follows the notarial acknowledgment in due and regular form.)</p>
<p>It is admitted that at the time of its execution, the grantor was the owner 
in fee simple of all the lands therein described. In the course of time the 
grantor died and at the time of her death Pedro Emilio Mata, the grantee in the 
deed, and Ester Magno, entered upon and took possession of the lands.</p>
<p>The plaintiff applied for and was appointed administrator of the estate of 
the grantor Severa Magno y Laureta, deceased, and made a demand upon the 
defendants for possession of the lands which was refused, resulting in this 
action by the plaintiff as administrator, to recover possession of the premises 
and the sum of P9,000 as the value of the products of the land from April 9, 
1918, until the termination of the case, for the sum of P1,200 damages, for the 
unlawful and wrongful withholding of possession, and costs.</p>
<p>For answer the defendants made a specific denial of all of the material 
allegations of the complaint, and pray judgment for costs.</p>
<p>Upon such issues the case was tried and submitted upon a stipulation of facts 
to the effect that any title or right of possession which Pedro Emilio Mata has 
to the possession of the premises is founded upon Exhibit A.</p>
<p>The lower court rendered judgment to the effect that the plaintiff was 
entitled to the possession of the lands in question and the sum of P1,050, the 
agreed rental value and costs, from which the defendants appeal, assigning nine 
different errors, the combined substance of which is that the lower court erred 
in holding that the donation made by the deceased, known as Exhibit A, should be 
construed under the provisions of article 620 of the Civil Code, and that the 
defendants did not acquire title to the lands under it, that their possession 
was illegal, and that the land was the property of the heirs of the deceased, 
and in rendering judgment for the plaintiff, and in overruling the defendants' 
motion for a new trial.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Its execution having been admitted, the question involved is the 
construction, legal force, and effect of Exhibit A. Among other things it 
recites that I, Severa Magno y Laureta, widow, seventy years old * * * hereby 
declare that for the purpose of giving the young Pedro Emilio Mata, single, 
seventeen years old, * * * and son of Pastor Mata, already deceased, and Ester 
Magno, "a reward for the services which he is rendering me, and as a token of my 
affection toward him and of the fact that he stands high in my estimation, I 
hereby donate 'mortis causa' to said youth all the properties described as 
follows." In the second paragraph it is said: "Therefore, all the part that was 
allotted to me in the said partition is the subject of this donation." In the 
third it recites: "I also declare that I likewise donate to the said youth the 
right to, and usufruct of, two parcels of land situated in Mariquet, etc." In 
the fourthâ€”"I also declare that it is the condition of this donation that the 
donee cannot take possession of the properties donated before the death of the 
donor, etc."</p>
<p>The donee, Pedro Emilio Mata, was the son of Pastor Mata, deceased, and was 
seventeen years old at the time the instrument was executed. The instrument 
further recites that Ester Magno, a widow and the mother of Pedro Emilio Mata, 
with all the conditions imposed by the donor, accepted the donation on behalf of 
her son, and thanked the donor for her liberality and the affection for her 
son.</p>
<p>The plaintiff contends and the trial court found that Exhibit A should be 
construed under the terms and provisions of article 620 of the Civil Code as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donations which are to become effective upon the death of the donor partake 
of the nature of disposals of property by will and shall be governed by the 
rules established for testamentary successions."</p></blockquote>
<p>As we analyze it, Exhibit A is a donation <i>in praesenti</i> and conveyed 
the fee simple title to the lands in question subject only to the life estate of 
the donor. It must be conceded that during her lifetime the grantor had a legal 
right to convey the fee simple title to her lands to any person in her 
discretion, reserving to herself a life estate. In legal effect, that is what 
she did here, The conveyance of the lands took effect upon the making and 
delivery of the deed, reserving a life estate only in the donor. The conveyance 
itself was not "to become effective upon the death of the donor," but took 
effect at the time of its execution. The instrument does not recite that the 
conveyance itself is not to become effective until the death of the donor, but, 
in legal effect, it recites that an actual conveyance is made subject to the 
life estate of the donor. Upon its face Exhibit A comes squarely within the 
provisions of article 623 of the Civil Code, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A donation is perfected as soon as the donor has knowledge that it has been 
accepted by the donee."</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, it appears from the instrument itself that Ester Magno accepted the 
donation on behalf of the son, and the acceptance is incorporated in the body of 
the instrument and made a part of it, and is signed by the donor and acceptor in 
the presence of witnesses and the instrument as a whole is legally acknowledged 
before a notary public.</p>
<p>Again, when the instrument is construed as a whole it shows upon its face a 
delivery and acceptance. The donor conveys the lands, and in and by the same 
instrument the mother of the donee accepts the conveyance upon the terms and 
conditions stated in the deed.</p>
<p>Corpus Juris, vol. 18, p. 208, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Where, however, a deed containing a provision that it is not to take effect 
until the grantor's death is actually delivered to the grantee during the 
lifetime of the grantor, it will be sustained as a present grant of a future 
interest."</p></blockquote>
<p>That is this case. Legally speaking, it was a delivery and an acceptance of 
the deed. The facts bring the case squarely within article 623 of the Civil 
Code. Here, there was a donation and an acceptance both in the same instrument 
which made it a perfected donation within the meaning of article 623.</p>
<p>Commenting on article 620 of the Civil Code in volume 5, page 82, of the 1910 
edition, Manresa says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In pure donations, in donations until an affixed day, and in donations with 
a resolutory condition the property is of course conveyed to the donee during 
the life of the donor and as to this point there is no question.</p>
<p>"When the time fixed for the commencement of the enjoyment of the property 
donated be at the death of the donor, or when the suspensive condition is 
related to his death, confusion might arise. To avoid it we must distinguish 
between the actual donation and the <i>execution</i> thereof. That the donation 
is to have effect during the lifetime of the donor or at his death does not mean 
the delivery of the property must be made during his life or after his death. 
From the moment that the donor <i>disposes</i> freely of his property and such 
disposal is accepted by the donee, the donation exists, perfectly and 
irrevocably (articles 618 and 623). Until the day arrives or until the condition 
is fulfilled, the donation, although valid when made, cannot be <i>realized</i>. 
Thus, he who makes the donation effective upon a certain date, even though to 
take place at his death, disposes of that which he donated and he cannot 
afterwards revoke the donation nor dispose of the said property in favor of 
another. If the thing is lost thru the fault of the donor, or if it is damaged, 
indemnity may be recovered. Regarding donations with suspensive conditions, it 
is sufficient to read articles 1120 and 1122 to understand the effects which 
this kind of donation has during the lifetime of the donor. He who makes a 
donation effective after his death, makes a donation, not a legacy. 1'he mere 
name of the act, when a different intention does not clearly appear, is enough 
in order to make applicable thereto the rules of law referring to donations. 
However, if the ill-named donor not only postpones the date of the execution of 
the donation until his death but also reserves the right to revoke said act at 
his pleasure, then this act is not valid as a form of contract; this is in truth 
a disposition of property <i>mortis causa</i> which requires the same 
solemnities as required in making a will."</p></blockquote>
<p>Although it is not included in the stipulation of facts, it does appear from 
the record that some of the property described in Exhibit A was sold and 
disposed of by the donee during the lifetime of the donor.</p>
<p>In any event, Exhibit A was a donation <i>in praesenti</i> as distinguished 
from a gift <i>in futuro</i>, hence does not come under the provisions of 
article 620 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>The effect of this decision is to hold that Pedro Emilio Mata took and 
acquired a valid title to the premises in dispute at the time Exhibit A was 
executed, subject only to the life estate of the donor, and he is now the owner 
of the lands described in the pleadings. But the defendants made a general 
denial, and did not ask for affirmative relief, hence none can be granted.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and the plaintiff's complaint is 
dismissed, with costs in favor of the defendants. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, 
C.J., Street, Malcolm, AvanceÃ±a, Ostrand,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
