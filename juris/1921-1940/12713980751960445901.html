				G.R. No. 29077, October 27, 1928</h4>
				<H3>JUAN DE ROTAECHE, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. "LA URBANA," MUTUAL BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff being a common-stock holder of the defendant, 
applied for and obtained from the same a loan of P7,000 for ten years, executing 
the proper mortgage deed, acknowledging an indebtedness to defendant of P8,050, 
of which P7,000 represents the loan obtained, and the P1,050, the 15 per cent 
premium for the ten years fixed by the board of directors of the defendant. 
<p align="justify">The plaintiff, however, does not consider himself bound to pay 
the premium for the whole ten years, but only for one year, that is, the sum of 
P150. Hence, of the P1,050 which he paid for premiums, he claims the sum of P900 
in this action which is the premium for nine years at the rate of 1 1/2 per 
centum per annum. </p>
<p align="justify">As a basis, he contends that while section 181 of the 
Corporation Law (Act No. 1459) authorizes mutual building and loan societies 
such as the herein defendant, to deduct the amount of the premium from the loan, 
nevertheless, Act No. 3291, amending Act No. 2655 (Usury Law) provides that the 
premium which such societies may collect "<span style="font-style: italic;">shall in no case exceed two per centum 
per annum, computed in annual payments from the date when the loan was made 
until the day when the obligation is totally extinguished</span>," maintaining that the 
phrase "<span style="font-style: italic;">computado por anualidades</span>" contained in the quotation, of which the 
official English version is "<span style="font-style: italic;">Computed in annual payments</span>" means that the payment 
of such premiums cannot be for more than one year. </p>
<p align="justify">The Court of First Instance of Rizal that tried the case held 
said deduction of P1,050 made by the defendant from the loan given to the 
plaintiff, to be perfectly legal and absolved the defendant. </p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff impugns said judgment, basing his appeal on two 
grounds, which constitute the errors as committed by the lower court, to wit: 
(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) In holding that Act No. 3291 authorizes mutual building and loan societies 
to collect the total amount of the premiums in advance; and therefore, (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) in 
not ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the P900 claimed.<br><br>Section 181 
of the Corporation Act (No. 1459), provides as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The moneys in the hands of the treasurer of the corporation 
and such sums as may be borrowed by the corporation for the purpose shall be 
loaned out in open meeting to the stockholders who shall pay the highest premium 
for such loan, or said moneys may be loaned at such premium as may be fixed from 
time to time by the board of directors. The premium may be deducted from the 
amount of the loan or such proportion may be so deducted as may be prescribed in 
the by-laws. Where only a part of the premium is deducted the balance thereof 
must be paid to the corporation in such installments as the by-laws shall 
determine: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however</span>, That the number of installments into which the 
premium is divided shall be uniform for all loans made by the corporation, and 
that the time and manner of payment of such installments shall be prescribed in 
the by-laws."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">This section, as may be seen, allows two ways of collecting the 
premiums: The first by deducting them from the amount of the loan ("<span style="font-style: italic;">the premium 
may be deducted from the amount of the loan</span>"), and the second, by deducting the 
proportion prescribed by the by-laws of the association ("<span style="font-style: italic;">or such proportion may 
be so deducted as may be prescribed in the by-laws</span>"). It was so held by this 
court in the case of Lopez and Javelona vs. El Hogar Filipino (47 Phil., 
249.)</p>
<p align="justify">Section 1 of Act No. 3291, amending section 2 of Act No. 2655 
(Usury Law), in its pertinent part provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Mutual building and loan societies incorporated under Act 
Numbered Fourteen hundred and fifty-nine, known as the 'Corporation Act' may, 
however, charge in addition a premium the percentage of which shall be fixed 
from time to time by their boards of directors but shall in no case exceed two 
per centum per annum, computed in annual payments from the date when the loan 
was made until the day when the obligation is totally extinguished." 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is to be noted that of the two ways of collecting the 
premiums provided in the Corporation Law, Act No. 1459, Act No. 3291 deals only 
with the second, that is, the case of charging "<span style="font-style: italic;">a premium the percentage of 
which shall be fixed from time to time by their boards of directors</span>". This last 
law does not prohibit the first way of collecting the premiums, and therefore, 
the power conferred by the Corporation Law on such societies of deducting them 
totally from the amount of the loan, subsists. The only thing in Act No. 3291 
that may affect said first way of collecting the premiums is that referring to 
the rate of the latter, which, according to the last law, must not exceed two 
per centum per annum. </p>
<p align="justify">The phrase "<span style="font-style: italic;">computado por anualidades</span>" or its translation 
"<span style="font-style: italic;">computed in annual payments</span>" does not mean that premiums cannot be collected 
for more than one year. It will be noted that the law does not say "<span style="font-style: italic;">collected</span>" 
or "<span style="font-style: italic;">paid</span>," but "<span style="font-style: italic;">computed</span>." What such expression means is that "<span style="font-style: italic;">computed in 
annual payments from the date when the loan was made until the day when the 
obligation is totally extinguished</span>," the rate per cent collected as premium, 
"<span style="font-style: italic;">shall in no case exceed two per centum per annum</span>." Moreover, said phrase 
"<span style="font-style: italic;">computado por anualidades</span>" ("<span style="font-style: italic;">Computed in annual payments</span>") has not, and cannot 
have the effect of prohibiting or abrogating the first way referred to of 
collecting the premium authorized by the Corporation Law, and is not alluded to 
either directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication in any part of 
section 1 of Act No. 3291, except with respect to the limit of the amount of the 
premium. </p>
<p align="justify">Consequently, so long as the premium keeps within these 
specified bounds, the law still sanctions its total deduction from the loan 
unless the same is prohibited by the by-laws of the society. </p>
<p align="justify">The rate of the premiums in question does not exceed 2 per 
centum per annum (it is 1 1/2 per centum per annum), and the by-laws of the 
defendant society permit its total deduction from the loan, according to the 
stipulation of facts submitted by the parties. Therefore, the defendant acted 
with the authority conferred on it by the law and its by-laws in deducting the 
P900 from the loan granted to plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against 
the appellant. So ordered. </p>
