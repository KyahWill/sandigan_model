				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; action&nbsp; for&nbsp; the expropriation of land situated&nbsp; in the municipality of Lucena, Tayabas,&nbsp; is before us on appeal taken by the plaintiff province and the intervenors Godofredo Reyes and Domingo Lopez.<br><br>The appraising commissioners were duly appointed, heard the parties, and rendered their report to the court recommending that lots X-1 and X-3 be assessed at P8&nbsp; per square meter, and lot X-2 at P3.50 per square meter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant's two sheds on the land were assessed at P3,500.<br><br>These values were accepted by the trial court according to the judgment appealed from by the plaintiff,&nbsp; which insists upon a&nbsp; reduction of the price.<br><br>Godofredo Reyes and Domingo Lopez have appealed from the judgment of the court below which denied their complaint of intervention on the ground that it had been filed out of time—after judgment—and that the record did not show the necessity of a new investigation to protect them from certain abuse of authority insinuated to have been committed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial officials.<br><br>We note, however, that although the defendant asked that the commissioners' report be set for hearing (page&nbsp; 50, original record)&nbsp; and that the court assigned November 5, 1930, for that purpose (page 51, id.), the record does not appear ever to have actually&nbsp; come up&nbsp; for&nbsp; hearing in court,. for the reason, perhaps, that the&nbsp; plaintiff submitted it to the court without making any recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be that as it&nbsp; may, the plaintiff's&nbsp; pleading, invoking the&nbsp; court's discretion, asks for a reduction of the proposed evaluation, and the defendant objects to the request in a pleading presented to that effect.<br><br>It is&nbsp; the intention of the&nbsp; law that a proper&nbsp; hearing, with both parties present,&nbsp; be had upon the commissioner's report in condemnation proceedings like the present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in cases where both parties, the plaintiff and the defendant, agree with the commissioners in their report, such acquiescence must appear in the record of&nbsp; that hearing&nbsp; (City of Manila vs. Battle, 27 Phil., 34).<br><br>It is true that the original&nbsp; Spanish text of section 246 of the Code of Civil Procedure,&nbsp; as it appears on page 427 of the first volume of Public Laws, states: ''presentado el inf orme, el Juzgado, previa <i>lectura</i>, podra aceptarlo;" * * * (Italics ours).&nbsp;&nbsp; But the English text&nbsp; of the same section, as it appears on page 416, volume 1, Public Laws, clearly says: "Upon the filing of&nbsp; such&nbsp; report in court, the&nbsp; court shall, upon&nbsp; <i>hearing</i> accept the&nbsp; same,"&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; (Italics ours again).&nbsp; And it&nbsp; is well known&nbsp; that&nbsp; in case a law published by the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Commission, like the Code in&nbsp; question, is to be&nbsp; interpreted,&nbsp; the English text&nbsp; must prevail, except when there is some ambiguity, omission or mistake, in which case the Spanish text may be consulted.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 15, Admn. Code of 1917.)<br><br>In the matter of condemnation proceedings the&nbsp; rule fol- lowed by the courts is that the provisions of the law are to be strictly&nbsp; followed&nbsp; so&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; party whose property may be sought to be expropriated, may have all the legal guarantees of due process of law.&nbsp; For this reason, this court enunciated this very rule in the case of Manila Railroad Co. vs. Rodriguez (13 Phil., 347), where it was said that when the&nbsp; commissioners' report is not in&nbsp; accordance with the law on the matter, it cannot serve as the basis of the judicial&nbsp; decision but must be annulled and set aside, and the case remanded to the court below for the reopening of the trial.<br><br>Wherefore, the judgment appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; set aside, and it is&nbsp; ordered that the record be remanded to the court of&nbsp; origin so that the case may be reopened, and a hearing&nbsp; be held on&nbsp; the&nbsp; commissioners' report, at&nbsp; which hearing the appellants Godofredo Reyes and Domingo Lopez may be&nbsp; heard,&nbsp; together with any other person who may have a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either party, or any interest adverse to the latter.&nbsp; Without express&nbsp; pronouncement of&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
