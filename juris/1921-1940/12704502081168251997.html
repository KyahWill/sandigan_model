				<H3>JULIAN T. AGUÃ‘A, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ANTONIO LARENA, JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATOR OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED MARIANO LARENA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action is brought to recover the sum&nbsp; of P29,600 on two causes against the administrator of the estate of the deceased Mariano Larena.<br><br>Upon his first cause of action, the plaintiff claims the sum of P9,600, the alleged&nbsp; value&nbsp; of services rendered by him to said deceased as his agent in charge of the deceased's houses&nbsp; situated in Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the second&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of action the&nbsp; plaintiff alleges that one of the buildings belonging to the deceased and described in his complaint was built by him with the consent of the deceased,&nbsp; and for that reason he is entitled to recover the&nbsp; sum disbursed&nbsp; by&nbsp; him in its construction,&nbsp; amounting to P20,000.<br><br>From the evidence it appears undisputed that from February, 1922, to February, 1930, the plaintiff rendered services to the deceased, consisting in the collection of the rents due&nbsp; from&nbsp; the tenants&nbsp; occupying the deceased's houses&nbsp; in Manila and&nbsp; attending&nbsp; to the repair of&nbsp; said houses when necessary.&nbsp; He also took any such steps as were necessary, to enforce the payment of rents and all that was required to protect&nbsp; the interests of the deceased&nbsp; in connection with said houses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence also&nbsp; shows that during the time the plaintiff rendered his services,&nbsp; he did&nbsp; not receive any compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, however, a fact admitted that during said period the plaintiff occupied a house belonging to the deceased without paying any rent at all.<br><br>As to the building whose value is claimed by the plaintiff, the record shows that said building was really erected on a parcel of land belonging to the deceased on Calle Victoria, Manila, and that the expenses&nbsp; for&nbsp; materials and labor in the construction thereof&nbsp; were&nbsp; paid by the appellant, the construction having begun in 1926 and terminated in 1928, but the ownership of the money invested in the building is in question.<br><br>Upon the&nbsp; first cause the plaintiff-appellant insists that, the services having been rendered, an obligation to compensate them must necessarily arise.&nbsp; The trial court held that the compensation for the services&nbsp; of the plaintiff was the gratuitous use&nbsp; and&nbsp; occupation of some of the houses of the deceased by the plaintiff and his family.&nbsp; This conclusion is correct.&nbsp; If it were true that the plaintiff and the deceased had an understanding to the effect that the&nbsp; plaintiff was to receive compensation aside from the use and occupation of the houses of the deceased, it cannot be explained how the plaintiff could&nbsp; have rendered services as he did for eight years&nbsp; without&nbsp; receiving&nbsp; and claiming&nbsp; any&nbsp; compensation from&nbsp; the deceased.<br><br>As&nbsp; to the second cause,&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence presented&nbsp; by the plaintiff is his own testimony,&nbsp; that of&nbsp; his witnesses, and several documents,&nbsp; consisting of municipal&nbsp; permit, checks, vouchers, and&nbsp; invoices.&nbsp; The testimony of the plaintiff's witnesses, the persons who sold the materials and furnished the labor, proves a&nbsp; few unimportant facts, and as to the ownership&nbsp; of the money&nbsp; thus invested, there is only the testimony of the plaintiff-appellant, who&nbsp; said&nbsp; that it all belonged to him and that his understanding with the deceased was that the latter would get the rents of the house, and, upon his death, he would bequeath it to the plaintiff, but unfortunately, he died intestate.&nbsp; This testimony, however, was objected to on the ground that it is prohibited by section 383, paragraph 1, of the Code&nbsp; of Civil&nbsp; Procedure, which provides that the party&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; action against an executor or administrator cannot testify on any fact that took&nbsp; place before the death of the&nbsp; person against whose estate the claim&nbsp; is presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower&nbsp; court admitted this testimony but did not believe it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; certainly it cannot be believed, even assuming it to&nbsp; be&nbsp; admissible,&nbsp; in view of the circumstances appearing undisputed in the record, namely, the fact that the plaintiff-appellant did not have any source of income that could produce him such a large sum of money&nbsp; as that invested in the&nbsp; construction of the house; and the fact that the deceased&nbsp; had more than the necessary amount to build the house.<br><br>But above&nbsp; all,&nbsp; the facts appearing from&nbsp; Exhibit 40 are conclusive against the claim of the plaintiff-appellant.&nbsp; Exhibit 40 is a book of accounts containing several items purporting to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; advanced by&nbsp; the deceased to the plaintiff-appellant for the construction&nbsp; of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff admitted that the first two lines constituting the heading of the account on the first&nbsp; page were written by himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; two lines say:&nbsp; "Dinero Tornado a Don Mariano Larena para&nbsp; la nueva casa."&nbsp; Appellant further admits that the first entry in Exhibit 40 was made by him and that the sum of P3,200 mentioned in the third entry was received by him.&nbsp; It is to be noted that the first entry is dated February 1,1926, and the last is under the date of December 31,&nbsp; 1927.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other entries are admitted by the plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; to have been made by the deceased.&nbsp; Finally the appellant admitted in cross-examination that this book, Exhibit 40, was his and that whenever he received money from the deceased, he&nbsp; handed it&nbsp; to&nbsp; the deceased in order&nbsp; that the latter&nbsp; might enter what he had received.&nbsp; The total of the items contained in this book is P17,834.72, which is almost the amount invested in the construction of the building.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the items entered in Exhibit 40, appear in Exhibit 41 as&nbsp; withdrawn by the deceased,from&nbsp; his account with the Monte de Piedad, and a corresponding entry appears in Exhibit 43 showing a deposit made by the plaintiff in his current account&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; National Bank.&nbsp; From all of this it is&nbsp; clear that the money invested in&nbsp; the construction of the building in question did not belong to the plaintiff.<br><br>The appealed judgment is affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Street, Malcolm, Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Hull, Vickers, Imperial,</i> and <i>Butte, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
