				<h4>
				G.R. No. 19996, March 12, 1923</h4>
				<H3>THE BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. LAGUNA COCOANUT OIL COMPANY AND FIDELITY AND SURETY COMPANY OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order sustaining a demurrer to the amended 
complaint. Paragraph 3 of the complaint alleges that the defendant Fidelity and 
Surety Co. of the Philippine Islands "<i>se obligo</i> a pagar a cualquier 
tenedor de dicho pagare el importe del mismo, en el caso de que Laguna Cocoanut 
Oil Co. no lo satisficiere" and the only question to be resolved is whether the 
expression "<i>se obligo</i>" is a conclusion of law or whether it is an 
allegation of a fact.
<p>The word "obligar" as here used is usually translated into English as "to 
bind" and in jurisdictions where the rules of good pleading are more thoroughly 
understood by the Bar than is the case here, a statement that a person "bound 
himself" to do a certain thing would probably be held by the courts to be a mere 
conclusion of law; indeed, the books abound in cases where even stricter 
criteria have been applied. (For illustrations, <i>see</i> Cyc., pp. 52-65.)</p>
<p>The majority of this court is, however, of the opinion that under the 
conditions here prevailing a more liberal rule should be followed and that the 
obligation in question should be considered sufficiently well pleaded.</p>
<p>It must be conceded that strong reasons may be advanced in support of this 
view. Not only is great liberality in construing the remedial law enjoined upon 
the courts by our Code of Civil Procedure, but in this particular case it is 
also to be observed that in Spanish dictionaries the expression "obligarse" 
seems to be regarded as synonymous with "comprometerse," thus implying an 
obligation based upon a promise or agreement. When, therefore, it is alleged in 
the complaint that the defendant Fidelity and Surety Co. "se obligo a pagar," it 
may, perhaps, be considered as equivalent to an allegation that the company 
"promised" or "agreed" to pay, which would be a statement of fact.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is reversed, the demurrer to the amended complaint is 
overruled and the case is remanded to the court below for further proceedings. 
No costs will be allowed in this instance. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., 
Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
