				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify"> The plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant, a
domestic corporation, three distinct sums of money which were the
subject matter of another three separate causes of action. At the
trial, the plaintiff asked for the dismissal of his third cause of
action, the debt involved therein having been paid, and the defendant,
in turn, made a confession of judgment with respect to the first and
second causes of action and consented to have judgment entered against
it for the sums of money claimed thereunder. The trial proceeded for
the purpose of passing upon the defendant's counterclaim seeking
judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of P15,549.82.<p></p>
<p> The court rendered judgment ordering the defendant to pay the sum
of P1,000 with interest thereon at 12 per cent per annum from November
3, 1931, until fully paid, with costs, and dismissing the counterclaim.
The defendant appealed from the last part, of the judgment.</p>
<p> Upon instituting his action the plaintiff secured an order of
attachment on the defendant's vessel Ethel Conklin, alleging as his
ground that said defendant had sold and was about to sell its property
with intent to defraud him and the other creditors. It appeared,
however, that the defendant could not dispose of either one of the two
vessels it was operating because they were mortgaged to the Philippine
Trust Company, which acted as trustee by virtue of a public instrument
signed with others, by the plaintiff himself. It is true that the
defendant had sold a car to Fernandez Hermanos, but the sale could not
have been fraudulent on the ground that it had been made by the board
of directors of the defendant of which the plaintiff was a member. The
plaintiff approved the sale and the same was consummated with his
consent.</p>
<p> It is clear, therefore, that the order of attachment was issued
without any justifiable motive and that the plaintiff is liable for the
damages caused by him. The question that now arises relates to the
extent of said damages. The defendant claims the sum of P16,334.05 in
the following concept:</p>

<p> The second and fourth items represent damages properly imputable to
the plaintiff. The vessel was attached and tied up for six days and
loading and unloading was delayed by reason thereof. The vouchers
presented by the defendant justify everything that it was compelled to
pay to the owners of the cargoes and lighters which remained by the
vessel's side. This court believes that the other items have not been
satisfactorily proven and that the last two, particularly, are based on
alleged damages which are very remote and problematical. We are of the
opinion that the defendant is entitled to recover from the plaintiff
only the sum of P1,574.82.</p>
<p> The appealed judgment is hereby modified and it is ordered that the
plaintiff pay to the defendant, on its counterclaim, the sum of
P71,574.82,, without costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Butte,</em> and <em>Goddard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
