				<H3>ARSENIO MACAU, PETITIONER, <i>VS.</i> THE HONORABLE EULOGIO P.  REVILLA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN, AND BUENAVENTURA OCAMPO, PROVINCIAL FISCAL OF BULACAN, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a proceeding instituted by Arsenio Macali against the Honorable Eulogio P. Revilla, Judge of First Instance of Bulacan, and the Provincial Fiscal of Bulacan, Buenaventura Ocampo, in which he prays that an order of mandamus be issued ordering the respondent judge to allow the appeal&nbsp; filed by the&nbsp; petitioner on December&nbsp; 1, 1925, and to forward to this court the record of criminal case No.&nbsp; 4438,&nbsp; People of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands <i>vs.</i>.&nbsp; Arsenio Macali, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Bulacan,&nbsp; for a review of the judgment entered therein.<br><br>The respondents, in answer&nbsp; to the complaint, admit&nbsp; all the facts therein set forth&nbsp; and, as a special defense, allege that the petitioner had&nbsp; waived&nbsp; his&nbsp; right&nbsp; to appeal and had begun to serve his&nbsp; sentence surrendering himself to the proper authorities for the execution of the judgment and stamping his thumb mark on the order of commitment of his person to the Director of Prisons.<br><br>The bare facts&nbsp; resulting from the pleadings&nbsp; and from the oral&nbsp; argument of counsel for both parties are the following: October 29, 1924, the respondent&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal of Bulacan&nbsp; filed in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of said province a&nbsp; complaint against the herein petitioner Arsenio Macali, accusing him of the crime of murder.&nbsp; On November 18, 1925, the said Provincial Fiscal&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bulacan, after obtaining the permission of the&nbsp; court, amended the said complaint, changing the crime of murder for that of homicide.&nbsp; On being arrainged upon the amended information on November 18, 1925, and at the suggestion of his attorney, petitioner pleaded guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, the respondent judge, Honorable Eulogio&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Revilla,&nbsp; rendered judgment, sentencing the petitioner to seventeen years, four months, and one day <i>reclusion temporal</i>, with the accessories&nbsp; of the law, to&nbsp; indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P1,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency on account of the nature of the principal penalty, and to pay the costs of the action.&nbsp; On the same day, November 18, 1925, upon hearing the judgment rendered&nbsp; against him,&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner, through ignorance, stated that&nbsp; he waived his right&nbsp; to appeal from said judgment and surrendered himself to the proper authorities,&nbsp; who thereupon proceeded to commit&nbsp; him to Bilibid, the petitioner having stamped his thumb mark on the order issued for that purpose,&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; to the Director of Prisons.&nbsp; On December&nbsp; 1, 1925, the herein petitioner filed an appeal with the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Bulacan, stating that he withdrew the waiver of his right to appeal&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had formerly made, and that&nbsp; he thereby appealed to the Supreme Court from the judgment rendered against him.&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 11, 1925, the respondent Judge of First Instance of Bulacan disallowed&nbsp; the appeal. Petitioner&nbsp; excepted in due time to this&nbsp; order&nbsp; disallowing his appeal.<br><br>If the accused were intelligent and possessed of a certain degree of&nbsp; education, his plea of guilty, his waiver of the right&nbsp; to appeal and his submission&nbsp; to the&nbsp; authorities for confinement would&nbsp; undoubtedly be sufficient to&nbsp; make the judgment final and subject to&nbsp; execution and to take him&nbsp; out of the judicial power and&nbsp; put him under the executive&nbsp; control, even though the period of fifteen days fixed in section&nbsp; 47&nbsp; of General&nbsp; Orders No.&nbsp; 58,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the perfection&nbsp; of&nbsp; appeals in criminal cases, may not have expired; but when&nbsp; dealing with an&nbsp; ignorant person, without&nbsp; the least&nbsp; amount of education,&nbsp; as the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner, who at the&nbsp; mere suggestion of&nbsp; his&nbsp; attorney pleads guilty to a grave crime, such as homicide,&nbsp; and&nbsp; waives his&nbsp; right to appeal from a judgment whereby he is sentenced to suffer the&nbsp; afflictive penalty of seventeen years, four months and one day of&nbsp; <i>reclusion temporal</i>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay an indemnity of P1,000, there is sufficient reason, if not&nbsp; of a juridical nature, of a social character, to stop and ponder to see if that person has Understood&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; extent of, and all the consequences following, such a waiver of a right that the constitution and&nbsp; statutes grant him.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section 15 [8]&nbsp; of&nbsp; General Orders No.&nbsp; 58; section 3, Jones&nbsp; Law.) When he found himself separated from the outside world and from the persons that are dear to him by the thick iron bars&nbsp; of a jail, the petitioner&nbsp; then felt&nbsp; the&nbsp; consequences of his plea of guilty and of his waiver of his right to appeal from the judgment rendered against him, and hurriedly filed an appeal,&nbsp; withdrawing&nbsp; the said waiver. This is a very clear indication that he&nbsp; did not well understand the&nbsp; significance and extent&nbsp; of&nbsp; his confession of guilt, nor of the consequences of his waiver of his&nbsp; right to appeal.<br><br>In the case of&nbsp; United&nbsp; States<i> vs.</i>.&nbsp; Rota&nbsp; (9 Phil.,&nbsp; 426), cited&nbsp; in United States <i>vs.</i>. Agcaoili (31&nbsp; Phil., 91), this court said the following:&nbsp; " 'The procedure for the trial of criminal, causes makes no specific provision for the trial of a&nbsp; cause when&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant pleads guilty.&nbsp; We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the Courts of First Instance may sentence defendants in&nbsp; criminal causes who plead guilty to the offense charged in the complaint,&nbsp; without the&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; of taking&nbsp; testimony.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; in all cases, and&nbsp; especially in cases where the punishment to be inflicted is severe, the court&nbsp; should&nbsp; be sure that the defendant fully understands the nature of the charges preferred against him and the character&nbsp; of the&nbsp; punishment to be imposed before sentencing him.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * '&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp; And in the said case of United States<i>vs.</i>. Agcaoili, supra, this court, furthermore, said&nbsp; the&nbsp; following: "While it is true that a judgment convicting and sentencing&nbsp; a defendant may lawfully be pronounced upon a solemn plea of 'guilty' in open court and on arraignment, entered by the accused with full knowledge of the&nbsp; meaning and effect&nbsp; of his plea, nevertheless, where the complaint charges a capital&nbsp; offense, the possibility&nbsp; of misunderstanding or mistake in so grave a matter justifies and in&nbsp; most instances requires&nbsp; the taking of such available evidence in&nbsp; support of the allegations of the&nbsp; information as the trial judge may deem&nbsp; necessary to remove all&nbsp; reasonable possibility that the accused might have entered his plea of 'guilty' improvidently, or without a&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and&nbsp; precise understanding of its&nbsp; meaning and effect."<br><br>The waiver of the right to appeal, like the plea of guilty, must be voluntary, that is to say,&nbsp; the accused must understand the significance and the meaning of his act, as also the consequences deriving therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; If in pleading guilty to a grave crime such as homicide, in waiving his&nbsp; right to appeal from a heavy sentence, such as one&nbsp; depriving him of his liberty for&nbsp; seventeen&nbsp; years, four months and one day, and ordering him to pay an indemnity of P1,000, in surrendering himself to the authorities because he&nbsp; could not find bondsman and in stamping his thumb mark in the order of <span style="font-style: italic;">mittimus,</span> the herein petitioner did so, without knowing the full significance nor&nbsp; the&nbsp; meaning and consequences of such acts, due to his ignorance and lack of instruction, it cannot properly be said&nbsp; that he voluntarily renounced his right to appeal, and that he submitted himself voluntarily to serve the sentence&nbsp; imposed upon&nbsp; him; wherefore the said judgment did not become&nbsp; final and subject to execution, and since the fifteen days fixed by law for perfecting an appeal in criminal cases had not elapsed, the trial court has jurisdiction to admit the appeal filed by the petitioner.<br><br>However, as the petitioner has pleaded guilty and was sentenced without any trial, this&nbsp; court cannot review his case.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is no bar to the revision of the information, as&nbsp; regards its validity and sufficiency,&nbsp; since&nbsp; these requisites have not been admitted by the plea&nbsp; of guilty (17&nbsp; C. J., 32, par. 3295); and also of the judgment, as regards the qualification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime and the degree of the penalty imposed.<br><br>Wherefore, the petition is granted&nbsp; and the respondent judge is ordered, immediately upon receipt of this order, to allow&nbsp; the appeal filed by&nbsp; the petitioner and proceed in connection therewith as prescribed by law, without special pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</span>&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Romualdez, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johns, J.,</span> did not take part.<br></div>
