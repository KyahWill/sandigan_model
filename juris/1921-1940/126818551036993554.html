				<H3>W. S. PRICE, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. YU BIAO SONTUA ET AL., DEFENDANTS. ENRIQUE T. YU CHENGCO AND THE YEK TONG LIN FIRE & MARINE INSURANCE CO., LTD., APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p> </p><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the defendants
Enrique T. Yu Chengco and the Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance
Co., Ltd., from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the
dispositive part of which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p> "Wherefore, said former plaintiff W. S. Price is
relieved from all subsequent liability arising from the administration
of the vessel Y. Sontwi, and the bond of P100,000 filed by him for the
attachment of said vessel is cancelled. So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In support of their appeal, the appellants assign the following
alleged errors as committed by the trial court in its said order, to
wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "1. The court <em>a quo</em> erred in denying the
motion of the defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco on the ground that he was
not a party to the action and therefore had no right to a notice of the
motion dated October 18, 1928, of W. S. Price, nor of the order of the
court of October 22, 1928.</p>
  <p> "2. The court <em>a quo</em>
erred in denying the motion of the defendant the Yek Tong Lin Fire
&amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., on the ground that the said Yek Tong
Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., does not appear to be a
party to this proceeding.</p>
  <p> "3. The court <em>a quo</em> erred
in not holding that the order of October 22, 1928, is void and of no
effect, and in not declaring the bond filed by W. S. Price as still
subsisting."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The following pertinent facts are necessary for the resolution of the questions raised in this appeal:</p>
<p> The vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>, belonging to Yu Biao Sontua y Cia.,
was mortgaged by its owner to Enrique T. Yu Chengco in a deed of May
18, 1927, for the sum of P50,000.</p>
<p> On June 17, 1927, said commercial firm Yu Biao Sontua y Cia. again
mortgaged the vessel for the sum of P50,000 to the herein
plaintiff-appellee W. S. Price, with the consent of said first mortgage
creditor Enrique T. Yu Chengco, who agreed to have the mortgage in
favor of said plaintiff-appellee W. S. Price registered as a first
mortgage.</p>
<p> Inasmuch as the mortgage debtor Yu Biao Sontua y Cia. had failed to
comply with the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgage creditor W. S.
Price, on October 10, 1927, filed against Yu Biao Sontua y Cia. and
others the complaint which gave rise to this case, praying for the
attachment of the mortgaged vessel, filing a bond in the sum of
P100,000 to answer for the "prosecution of the action, for the return
of the property to the defendant, if the return thereof be adjudged,
and for the payment to him of such sum as may in the cause be recovered
against the plaintiff (W. S. Price) and the costs of the action." (Bill
of Exceptions, pages 14, 15.)</p>
<p> On November 8, 1927, hardly a month after the filing of said
complaint, the defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco assigned and transferred
to Pelagio Yu Singco all his rights, interest and participation in the
second mortgage constituted in his favor on said vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>.
(Exhibit H.) No notice of this assignment of mortgage rights was served
upon the interested parties in the mortgaged vessel. Neither was the
assignee Pelagio Yu Singco substituted as defendant in the case in lieu
of the assignor Enrique T. Yu Chengco.<br>
    <br> On December 2,
1927, the plaintiff W. S. Price also assigned absolutely all his rights
as a first mortgage creditor to said Pelagio Yu Singco, who was
substituted as plaintiff in lieu of the former not only for having
acquired the rights of said W. S. Price as a first mortgage creditor,
but also those of the defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco as a second
mortgage creditor.</p>
<p> On June 7, 1928, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of
Pelagio Yu Singco and against Yu Biao Sontua y Cia., the dispositive
part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In view of the foregoing consideration, judgment
is entered in favor of the plaintiff Pelagio Yu Singco, and the
defendant Yu Biao Sontua y Cia. is ordered to pay him the following
sums: one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000) with interest thereon at
twelve per cent (12%) per annum from September 17, 1927, until fully
paid, plus ten per cent (10%) thereof as penalty; and two thousand
fifty pesos (P2,050) with legal interest thereon from the date of the
filing of the complaint, with costs.</p>
  <p> "It appearing from the record that the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>,
which was mortgaged by the defendant, was operated and administered by
W. S. Price and the herein plaintiff Pelagio Yu Singco during the
pendency of the suit, it is ordered that both render, within the period
of ten (10) days from the date of their receipt of a notice of this
judgment, a detailed accounting of their respective administration, and
after their account has been examined and approved, the court will
determine if said vessel should still be sold in order to satisfy the
amount of the judgment with the proceeds thereof. So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> On June 15, 1928, that is, eight days after the above judgment had
been entered, the original plaintiff W. S. Price filed a motion praying
that he be relieved from the obligation of rendering an accounting of
the administration of said vessel F. Sontua and all liability arising
thereunder from the date of its attachment, on the ground that Yu Smgco
Hermanos y Cia., the shipping agents thereof, who had been appointed
special sheriff, had, by virtue of said appointment, continued to
administer it in its custody and control and had purchased all his
rights, interest and participation in the vessel in question, assuming
all responsibility that might arise from the administration of said
vessel from the date of its attachment.</p>
<p> On June 18, 1928, Pelagio Yu Singco, who had been substituted for
the plaintiff W. S. Price, rendered a detailed accounting his
administration of the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em> from October 18, 1927,
the date on which he had received it from the sheriff by virtue of the
writ of attachment, to June 15, 1928. Pelagio Yu Singco's accounting
showed a profit of P22,277.99, less his remuneration for the
administration of said vessel, for which he asked P500 monthly. Pending
the approval of said account, said plaintiff Pelagio Yu Singco, on
August 14, 1928, filed with the court a petition praying for the sale
of said vessel Y, Sontua at public auction and the application of the
proceeds thereof to the amount of the judgment rendered in his favor.</p>
<p> Acting upon said petition, the lower court, on August 16, 1928,
entered an order the dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Wherefore, it is ordered that, after the plaintiff
has filed a personal bond in the sum of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000)
to answer to the assignee and to Enrique T. Yu Chengco for such balance
as may result from the account of administration, the sheriff of this
city sell at public auction the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em> to the
highest bidder for a cash price of not less than eighty-five thousand
pesos (P85,000), said sale to be subject to the condition that it will
not be valid unless approved and confirmed by the court.</p>
  <p>
"The sheriff shall post notices of said sale at three public places
within this city for twenty consecutive days and shall furthermore
publish the same once a week for the same period in the newspapers 'The
Philippines Herald' and 'La Vanguardia' which are edited in English and
Spanish, respectively, and with a general circulation in this city and
in the entire archipelago, and, within thirty (30) days from the date
of this order, shall inform the court of the result of said sale."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In pursuance of the above order, Pelagio Yu Singco, as principal
obligor, and the appellant the Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance
Co., as surety, filed a bond for the sum of P30,000 to answer for "such
balance as might result against the plaintiff (Pelagio Yu Singco) from
the account of administration of the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em> after the same has been examined by the court, provided it does not exceed the above sum."</p>
<p> On September 5, 1928, the lower court entered an order granting the
petition of the plaintiff W. S. Price but declaring his bond as still
subsisting for the reason that the administration of the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em> by Pelagio Yu Singco who had been substituted for said W. S. Price as plaintiff, was without judicial authority.</p>
<p> On October 18, 1928, the original plaintiff W. S. Price filed
another motion of the same tenor as that of June 15, 1928, praying, for
the reasons stated therein that he be relieved from all further
liability in connection with the administration of the vessel F. Sontua
and that his bond in the sum of P100,000 for the issuance of the writ
of attachment of said vessel be cancelled, of which motion only the
plaintiff Pelagio Yu Singco and the assignee of the insolvency of Yu
Biao Sontua y Cia., through their respective counsel, were notified.</p>
<p> On October 20, 1928, Pelagio Yu Singco rendered an accounting of
his administration of the vessel Y. Sontiui from June 16, 1928, to
September 12th of the same year.</p>
<p> On October 22, 1928, the court, granting W. S. Price's motion dated
October 18, 1928, entered an order the dispositive part of which reads
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Wherefore, said former plaintiff W. S. Price is
relieved from all further liability arising from the administration of
the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>,, and his bond for P100,000 for the attachment of said vessel is cancelled. So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> On March 29,1933, the defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco filed a
motion praying for the reconsideration of the above order dated October
22, 1928, and that the bond filed by W. S. Price be declared as
subsisting and in force.</p>
<p> The principal obligor W. S. Price and his surety the Philippine
Guaranty Co., Inc., opposed the motion and the trial court, in an order
of May 31, 1933, denied said motion for reconsideration filed by the
defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco.</p>
<p> On June 21, 1933, the defendant the Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine
Insurance Co., Ltd., as surety of the plaintiff by substitution Pelagio
Yu Singco, in turn, filed a motion praying the court to set aside its
order of October 22, 1928; declare the bond filed by W. S. Price in
force, and apportion <em>pro rata</em> the liability of Pelagio Yu Singco between the bond filed by him and that of W. S. Price.</p>
<p> On June 24, 1933, the trial court denied all the motions.</p>
<p> The first question to be decided is whether or not the trial court
erred in declaring that the defendant-appellant Enrique T. Yu Chengco
had no right to be notified of the motion of W. S. Price dated October
18, 1928, praying for the cancellation of his bond, or of the order of
October 22, 1928, granting said motion on the ground that said
defendant had already ceased to be an interested party in said action.</p>
<p> The appellants contend that inasmuch as it did not appear in the
record that the defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco had transferred his
mortgage rights to the plaintiff Pelagio Yu Singco in substitution,
before the original plaintiff assigned his to the latter, who had been
substituted for him, the trial court had no authority to consider said
transfer. If it was an error for the trial court to consider that the
defendant Enrique T. Yu Chengco already had no right or interest in the
suit, having assigned his rights therein to Pelagio Yu Singco, for the
reason that said assignment does not appear in the record, such error
is purely procedural and, therefore, technical. Said assignment being
true, the consideration thereof did not in the least prejudice said
defendant, inasmuch as the purpose of the bond filed by W. S. Price was
only to answer for the prosecution of the action, for the return of the
attached property to Yu Biao Sontua Hermanos y Cia. and for the payment
to it of such sum as may be adjudicated in its favor and against the
plaintiff W. S. Price, and the costs.</p>
<p> As said procedural error is technical and has not caused any
prejudice, it cannot serve as a ground for the reversal of the judgment.</p>
<p> With respect to the alleged ordinary credit of Enrique T. Yu
Chengco against Yu Biao Sontua, inasmuch as the latter has been
declared insolvent and an assignee of his insolvency was appointed,
said assignee became the legal representative of each and every one of
the insolvent's creditors, including said Enrique T. Yu Chengco
(section 32, Act No. 1956) and, the attorney for said assignee having
been notified of the motion for the cancellation of the bond filed by
the plaintiff-appellee, W. S. Price, the creditor Enrique T. Yu
Chengco, whom he represents, was also notified by operation of law.
(Unson <em>vs.</em> Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 50 Phil., 654.)</p>
<p> In its appeal, the third party claimant the Yek long Lin Fire &amp;
Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., claims that it is interested in the bond of
Pl00,000 filed by the Philippine Guaranty Co. to secure the obligation
of the plaintiff-appellee W. S. Price, inasmuch as it filed the bond of
P30,000 to secure the obligation of Pelagio Yu Singco, as administrator
of the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>, arising from the sale of said vessel
at public auction, with the understanding that said bond of P30,000 was
supplementary to that of P100,000 filed by said plaintiff-appellee W.
S. Price.</p>
<p> The conditions of the bond filed by said plaintiff-appellee W. S. Price are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "And whereas the plaintiff has commenced an action
in this court praying for the recovery of the possession of the above
described property, and has asked that a warrant be issued to the
sheriff of Manila for the seizure of same, we, the principal, and the
undersigned sureties, jointly and severally bind ourselves in the sum
of one hundred thousand pesos (P100,000) for the prosecution of the
action, for the return of the property to the defendant, if the return
thereof be adjudged and for the payment to him of such sum as may in
the cause be recovered against the plaintiff, and the costs of the
action."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The obligation contracted by the defendant-appellant the Yek Tong
Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., under the bond filed by it
in favor of the assignee of the insolvency of Yu Biao Sontua Hermanos y
Cia. is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Wherefore, we, Pelagio Yu Singco, as principal
obligor, and the Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., in
consideration of the foregoing, hereby jointly and severally bind
ourselves in the sum of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000) Philippine
currency, under the condition that we and the plaintiff shall pay to
the assignee of the insolvency of Yu Biao Sontua Hermanos y Cia. and
the creditor Enrique T. Yu Chengco such balance as may result against
the plaintiff by reason of the account of the administration of the
vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>, after the same is examined by the court, provided it does not exceed the above stated sum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The bond filed by W. S. Price, as principal obligor, and the
Philippine Guaranty Co., as surety, answers for the prosecution of the
action brought by said principal W. S. Price against Yu Biao Sontua et
al., for the return of the attached vessel to the defendants, if the
return thereof be adjudged, and for the payment to them of such sum as
may be recovered against the plaintiff, and the costs. The bond filed
by the plaintiff in substitution, Pelagio Yu Singco as principal
obligor, and the Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., as
surety, in favor of the assignee of the insolvency of Yu Biao Sontua
Hermanos y Cia. and Enrique T. Yu Chengco, answers for the payment to
the latter of such balance as may result against said plaintiff by
reason of the account of the administration of the vessel <em>Y. Sontua</em>,
after the same has been examined by the court, provided it does not
exceed the sum of P30,000. It will be seen, therefore, that the
liability of the former bond is different and distinct from that of the
latter, so that if one were not sufficient, the deficiency could not be
supplied by the other. Guaranty cannot be extended beyond its specific
limits. (Article 1827, Civil Code.) Therefore, inasmuch as the third
party claimant the Yek Tong Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.,
has no interest whatsoever, whether adverse or favorable, direct or
indirect, in the bond filed by W. S. Price, as principal obligor, and
the Philippine Guaranty Co., as surety, it was not entitled to any
notice of the motion for the cancellation of said bond filed by the
plaintiff-appellee W. S. Price, and the trial court committed no error
in denying its motion for reconsideration of the order canceling said
bond.</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of the opinion and
so hold: (1) That failure to serve notice of a motion upon a defendant,
whose right and interest has been transferred to the plaintiff without
making such transfer appear in the record, is a purely technical error
and cannot serve as a ground for the revocation of an order; and (2)
that neither can failure to serve notice of a motion to cancel a bond
upon a surety of a principal obligor, who has been substituted, as
plaintiff, in lieu of another, who had furnished for a different
obligation another bond, the cancellation of which is sought, be a
ground for the revocation of an order.</p>
<p> Wherefore, and finding no error in the appealed order, the same is
affirmed in all its part, with costs against the appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Malcolm, Hull, Butte,</em> and <em>Goddard, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
