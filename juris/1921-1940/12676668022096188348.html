				<H3>TEOPILO HAW, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE INSULAR COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, RESPONDENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BUTTE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by the Insular Collector
of Customs from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in
a habeas corpus case.
<p> The petitioner Teofilo Haw, seventeen years of age, arrived from
China at the port of Manila on October 19, 1933, and claimed the right
to enter and reside in the Philippine Islands as a native born citizen
thereof. There is no dispute as to the fact that the petitioner was
born in Gumaca, Tayabas, Philippine Islands, on February 13, 1916, of
Chinese parentage; that his parents left the Philippine Islands for
China in 1927 taking with them the petitioner; since then none of them
has returned to this country except the petitioner.<br>
    <br> The
respondent, as shown by the proceedings held before him (Exhibit A),
approved the decision of a board of special inquiry and refused to
allow the petitioner to land and ordered that he be returned to China.
The decision of the board gives three grounds for denying the
petitioner's right of entry: First, that his parents have permanently
left the Philippine Islands and established their domicile in China;
second, that the duplicate of the identification affidavit No. 3229
made by the petitioner on January 18, 1927, was issued to one Abundio
Cue Haw, apparently a brother of the applicant; and third, the
applicant is liable to become a public charge.</p>
<p> The petitioner's birth in the Philippine Islands makes him a citizen of the Philippine Islands. (Roa <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs, 23 Phil., 315; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ang, 36 Phil., 858; U. S. <em>vs.</em>
Lim Bin, 36 Phil., 924.) Being a citizen and a subject of these
Islands, it is his right to return thereto and it is his country's
obligation to receive him. The objections of the respondent to his
re-admission are entirely irrelevant.</p>
<p> On this appeal the respondent assigns as errors the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The lower court erred:</p>
  <p> "1. In not
ruling that petitioner, who is a minor and under the parental authority
of his legally recognized Chinese parents, cannot as yet exercise the
right of electing the nationality of his country of birth.</p>
  <p> "2. In not ruling that during his minority he follows the nationality of his Chinese parents.</p>
  <p> "3. In not ruling that petitioner has been expatriated by his Chinese parents."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The first two assignments assume that the petitioner is not only a
citizen of the Philippine Islands but also of the Republic of China,
that is, that he possesses a dual nationality. We cannot take judicial
notice of the law of China with relation to Chinese nationality and
there is nothing in this record which proves that the petitioner is a
citizen of China. Therefore, so far as this record goes, there is no
question of election of nationality here involved.</p>
<p> The Solicitor-General cites no authorities in support of his
argument under the third assignment of error that the petitioner has
been expatriated by his Chinese parents. Expatriation may be
accomplished by citizens who are <em>sui juris</em> by express or
implied renunciations of their citizenship. Express renunciation
usually occurs when a new and different citizenship is assumed. But it
may also be implied from a long period of absence and the adoption of a
domicile in a foreign country without intention to return to the
country of original citizenship. (Lorenzo <em>vs.</em> McCoy, 15
Phil., 559.) In the case cited, Lorenzo, who was born in the Philippine
Islands of a Chinese father, left the Islands when he was about fifteen
years old and remained continuously in China until he was thirty-four
years of age and acknowledged that he had no intention of returning
until the year when he applied for admission here. In other words, he
resided continuously in China for thirteen years after he attained his
majority and was vested with the right to select his own domicile and
citizenship.</p>
<p> In the case of Munoz <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs (20 Phil.,
494), it appears that Munoz was born in the Philippine Islands of a
Chinese father in the year 1880. At eleven years of age (that is, in
the year 1891) he was sent to China where he remained until January,
1911 (that is to say, for ten years after he attained his majority). It
was held that he had not expatriated himself because "he presented
satisfactory proof that he would have returned sooner to the Philippine
Islands had it not been for certain financial difficulties, and that he
never intended to expatriate himself and had never taken active steps
to that end." This court held that under such conditions, "citizenship
is not lost where the stay abroad is not prolonged beyond that shown in
the case at bar, and when there is, in fact, a <em>bona fide</em> return to the native land with the honest intention to make it his permanent home and country." (<em>Ibid</em>., page 498.)</p>
<p> The petitioner not being a person <em>sui juris</em> and being
under a disability of law and of fact, in that he is under the control
of his father, cannot renounce his Philippine citizenship. His
temporary absence from the Philippines with his parents is not
sufficient to warrant an implied renunciation during his minority. Such
an implied renunciation will be inferred in any event from his conduct
only after he attains his majority. (Cf. U. S. <em>vs.</em> Go-Siaco, 12 Phil., 490; Murioz <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs, <em>supra</em>. <em>See also</em> State <em>vs.</em>
Jackson, 79 Vermont, 504; 8 L. R. A. [NS], 1245.) There is no evidence
in this record that his father attempted to renounce the petitioner's
Philippine citizenship for him.</p>
<p> Being at the time of his application for admission a citizen of the
Philippine Islands, the Collector of Customs had no lawful authority to
exclude the petitioner. The judgment is affirmed with costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p> <em>Street, Abad Santos, Hull, </em>and <em>Diaz, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
