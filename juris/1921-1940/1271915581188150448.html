				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants were accused of the crime of frustrated murder. 
It appears from the evidence that in the evening of November 6, 1926, the 
offended party, Vicente Mendoza, was present in the La Loma Cabaret situated in 
the municipality of Caloocan, Province of Rizal. Between 10 and 11 o'clock that 
evening, while walking from the toilet of the cabaret towards the table he had 
been occupying, Mendoza was struck on the right eye by an unknown person and 
embraced from behind by the defendants Felix, Andres and Espinelo Gorospe. While 
he was thus held, Felix Gorospe stabbed him in the back with a pocket-knife. 
Mendoza endeavored to free himself, but the defendant Fernando Gorospe joined 
the other defendants and struck him on the head with a blunt instrument wrapped 
in a small handkerchief, as a result of which blow he fell to the floor. 
Fernando thereupon ran away, but the other defendants continued the attack, 
Espinelo and Andres striking Mendoza with the fists, and Felix stabbing him with 
the pocketknife. Lazaro Faustino, the manager of the cabaret, came to his rescue 
and succeeded in pulling Felix and Andres away from their victim. Ambrosio Cruz, 
a special policeman, also intervened and Seized Espinelo and, delivering him to 
another policeman, pursued the other defendants, who in the meantime had tried 
to escape. He overtook Andres and Fernando and succeeded in arresting the 
former. Fernando escaped in a <span style="font-style: italic;">carromata</span> but was subsequently pursued by Cruz 
with an automobile and captured. Shortly afterwards Felix Gorospe was also 
apprehended. Mendoza was very seriously wounded and was immediately taken to the 
Philippine General Hospital. One of the wounds had penetrated the lungs, and, as 
a consequence, the patient was expectorating blood for several days. Another 
wound was also deep, and very nearly reached the left kidney, and still another 
deep wound almost touched the peritoneum. Due to his robust constitution and the 
immediate medical attendance, Mendoza survived and was discharged from the 
hospital in a few weeks.
<p align="justify">Upon the facts stated, the defendant Felix Gorospe was 
convicted of the crime charged in the information and sentenced to suffer twelve 
years and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">cadena temporal</span>, with the accessory penalties, and to pay 
one-fourth of the costs. The other defendants were found guilty of the crime of 
less serious physical injuries, and each of them was sentenced to six months of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, with the accessory penalties and with the proportional share of 
the remaining three-fourths of the costs. From these sentences the defendants 
appealed and present the following assignments of error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. The court erred in assuming jurisdiction over and 
proceeding with the trial of the complaint.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. The court erred in overruling the defendants' objection to 
the jurisdiction of the court to try the defendants, to which the defendants 
duly excepted.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. The court erred in subjecting the defendants to a trial and 
sentencing them without due process of law.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. The court erred in convicting the defendant and appellant, 
Felix Gorospe, of the crime of frustrated murder.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. The court erred in convicting the defendants and 
appellants, Fernando Gorospe, Espinelo Gorospe, and Andres Gorospe, and each of 
them of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">lesiones menos graves</span>.</p>
<p align="justify">"6. The court erred in holding that the circumstance of 
treachery on the part of the defendants and appellants was proved by the 
evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">"7. The court erred in the severity of the various sentences 
imposed upon the defendants and appellants."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The first three assignments of error present a question of law. 
The provincial fiscal of Rizal filed a complaint in this case in the justice of 
the peace court of Caloocan for a preliminary investigation. Upon such 
investigation, the justice of the peace concluded that the defendants were not 
guilty of frustrated homicide but of <span style="font-style: italic;">lesiones menos graves</span> and so informed the 
fiscal "para los efectos que en derecho tuviere lugar" in an "auto" dated April 
5,1927. The fiscal filed a motion with the Court of First Instance praying "that 
this Honorable Court require the appearance of the justice of the peace, 
Ladislao de Jesus, to make the necessary corrections in his order of April 5, 
1927, or to submit an amended order stating therein whether he would order the 
dismissal of the case for lack of reasonable evidence of the commission of the 
crime charged, or whether he would transmit the case to the court on the ground 
that <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence of the commission of the crime by the herein accused 
had been presented."</p>
<p align="justify">On May 6, 1927, the Court of First Instance, in accordance with 
the fiscal's motion, ordered the justice of the peace to make the necessary 
corrections in his "auto" of April 5, 1927, and in compliance with that order, 
the justice of the peace revoked said "auto" and in another "auto" reported that 
the evidence presented during the preliminary investigation of the case 
established <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> that the crime charged had been committed, and, after the 
approval of this report by the Court of First Instance, the fiscal presented the 
information for frustrated murder. </p>
<p align="justify">The defendants' contention is that the justice of the peace, 
having found and declared that the crime committed was only <span style="font-style: italic;">lesiones menos 
graves</span>, the court had no authority to try the defendants for frustrated murder 
without another preliminary investigation. </p>
<p align="justify">This contention is entirely untenable. The duty of the justice 
of the peace was only to determine whether or not the evidence presented 
supported <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> the allegations of fact contained in the complaint; he had 
no legal authority to determine the character of the crime and his declaration 
upon that point can only be regarded as an expression of opinion in nowise 
binding on the court. His attention was called to this fact, and, in compliance 
with the court's order, he finally did what it was his duty to do, i. e., state 
whether or not the evidence reasonably sustained the allegations of the 
complaint. The court had a perfect right to require him to do so and committed 
no error in taking jurisdiction of the case upon his final report. The 
authorities cited by counsel for the defendants are not in point. </p>
<p align="justify">The fourth assignment of error deals with the guilt of the 
defendant Felix Gorospe, and it is argued that he at most can only be held 
guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">lesiones menos graves</span> without aggravating or mitigating circumstances. 
We cannot give much weight to this argument. The evidence seems conclusive that 
Felix stabbed the offended party in the back while the latter was in a 
defenseless position. That constitutes treachery. The fact that he inflicted 
three deep wounds near vital spots sufficiently shows his murderous intent. The 
sentence imposed on him is in accordance with the law and seems well deserved. 
</p>
<p align="justify">The three remaining assignments of error are equally without 
sufficient foundation. There may, indeed, be some doubt as to whether Fernando, 
Espinelo and Andres should not be held guilty as principals in the commission of 
the frustrated murder, but there is no sufficient evidence of conspiracy to 
commit that crime, and it is not clear that their cooperation was essential to 
its commission. We have therefore concluded that the court below did not err in 
finding them guilty of the lesser crime. </p>
<p align="justify">The sentence appealed from is affirmed with the costs against 
the appellants. So ordered. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, 
JJ.</span>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>STREET, J.: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">I submit that the offense committed in this case would be 
properly characterized as an attempt and not as a frustrated offense. I am 
further of the opinion that all four of the appellants were involved as 
principals.</p></div> <p></p>
