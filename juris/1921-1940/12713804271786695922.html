				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was instituted on November 21, 1921, in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, by the Philippine Trust Company, as assignee in insolvency 
of <i>La Cooperativa Naval Filipina</i>, against Marciano Rivera, for the 
purpose of recovering a balance of P22,500, alleged to be due upon defendant's 
subscription to the capital stock of said insolvent corporation. The trial judge 
having given judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the amount sued for, the 
defendant appealed.
<p>It appears in evidence that in 1918 the <i>Cooperativa Naval Filipina</i> was 
duly incorporated under the laws of the Philippine Islands, with a capital of 
P100,000, divided into one thousand shares of a par value of P100 each. Among 
the incorporators of this company was numbered the defendant Marciano Rivera, 
who subscribed for 450 shares representing a value of P45,000, the remainder of 
the stock being taken by other persons. The articles of incorporation were duly 
registered in the Bureau of Commerce and Industry on October 30 of the same 
year.</p>
<p>In the course of time the company became insolvent and went into the hands of 
the Philippine Trust Company, as assignee in bankruptcy; and by it this action 
was instituted to recover one-half of the stock subscription of the defendant, 
which admittedly has never been paid.</p>
<p>The reason given for the failure of the defendant to pay the entire 
subscription is, that not long after the <i>Cooperativa Naval Filipina</i> had 
been incorporated, a meeting of its stockholders occurred, at which a resolution 
was adopted to the effect that the capital should be reduced by 50 per centum 
and the subscribers released from the obligation to pay any unpaid balance of 
their subscription in excess of 50 per centum of the same. As a result of this 
resolution it seems to have been supposed that the subscriptions of the various 
shareholders had been cancelled to the extent stated; and fully paid 
certificates were issued to each shareholder for one-half of his1 subscription. 
It does not appear that the formalities prescribed in section 17 of the 
Corporation Law (Act No. 1459), as amended, relative to the reduction of capital 
stock in corporations were observed, and in particular it does not appear that 
any certificate was at any time filed in the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, 
showing such reduction.</p>
<p>His Honor, the trial judge, therefore held that the resolution relied upon by 
the defendant was without effect and that the defendant was still liable for the 
unpaid balance of his subscription. In this we think his Honor was clearly 
right.</p>
<p>It is established doctrine that subscriptions to the capital of a corporation 
constitute a fund to which creditors have a right to look for satisfaction of 
their claims and that the assignee in insolvency can maintain an action upon any 
unpaid stock subscription in order to realize assets for the payment of its 
debts. (Velasco <i>vs</i>. Poizat, 37 Phil., 802.) A corporation has no power to 
release an original subscriber to its capital stock from the obligation of 
paying for his shares, without a valuable consideration for such release; and as 
against creditors a reduction of the capital stock can take place only in the 
manner and under the conditions prescribed by the statute or the charter or the 
articles of incorporation. Moreover, strict compliance with the statutory 
regulations is necessary (14 C. J., 498, 620).</p>
<p>In the case before us the resolution releasing the shareholders from their 
obligation to pay 50 per centum of their respective subscriptions was an 
attempted withdrawal of so much capital from the fund upon which the company's 
creditors were entitled ultimately to rely and, having been effected without 
compliance with the statutory requirements, was wholly ineffectual.</p>
<p>The judgment will be affirmed with costs, and it is so 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Malcolm, Avance√±a, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</i> 
and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
