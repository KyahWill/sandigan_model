				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In these  two cases (G. R. Nos. 45892 and 45893), the appellants  Tranquilino  Lagman and Primitivo de Sosa are charged  with a  Violation of  section  60 of Commonwealth Act No.  1, known as  the National  Defense Law.  It  is alleged that these two appellants, being Filipinos and having reached the age  of twenty years in  1936,  willfully and unlawfully refused  to register in the military service between the  1st and 7th of April of said year, notwithstanding the fact that they had been  required to do so.  The evidence shows that these two appellants  were duly notified by the corresponding  authorities to  appear before the Acceptance Board in order to register for military service in accordance with law, and that the said appellants, in spite of these notices, had not registered up to the date of the filing of the information.</p>
  <p>  The appellants do not deny these facts, but they allege in defense that they have not registered in the military service because Primitivo de Sosa is  fatherless and has a mother and a brother eight years old to support,  and Tranquilino Lagman also has a father to support, has no military leanings,  and does not wish to kill or be killed.</p>
  <p>  Each of these appellants was sentenced by the Court of First Instance to one month and one day of imprisonment, with  the costs.</p>
  <p>  In  this  instance, the  validity of the National  Defense Law, under which the accused were  sentenced, is impugned on the ground that it is  unconstitutional.</p>
  <p>  Section 2, Article  II of the Constitution of the Philippines provides as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Sec. 2.  The defense of the State  is a prime duty of government, and in the fulfillment of this duty all citizens may be required by law to render personal military or civil service."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The National Defense  Law, in so  far  as  it establishes compulsory military service, does not go against this constitutional provision but is,  on the contrary, in faithful compliance therewith.  The   duty of the Government to defend  the State cannot  be performed except through an army.  To leave the organization of  an army to the  will of the citizens would be to make this duty of the Government excusable should there be no  sufficient men who volunteer to enlist therein.</p>
  <p>    In the United States the courts have held in a series of decisions that the  compulsory military service adopted by reason of the civil war and the world war does not violate the Constitution, because the power  to establish it is derived from that granted to Congress to declare war and to organize and maintain an army.   This is so because the right of the  Government to  require compulsory military service is  a consequence of  its duty to defend  the State and is reciprocal with its duty to defend the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.   In the  case of Jacobson <i>vs.</i> Massachusetts (197 U.  S., 11; 25 Sup.  Ct. Rep., 385), it was said that, without violating the Constitution, a person may be compelled by force,  if  need  be, against his  will, against his pecuniary interests,  and even against his  religious or political convictions,  to take his  place in the ranks of the army of his country,  and risk the chance of being shot down in its defense.  In the case of United States <i>vs.</i> Olson  (253 Fed., 2S3), it was also said that this is not deprivation of property without due process of law, because, in its just sense, there is  no  right of property to an office or  employment.  The circumstance  that these decisions refer to laws enacted by reason of the  actual existence of war does not make our case any different, inasmuch as, in  the  last  analysis, what  justifies  compulsory  military service is the  defense  of the  State, whether actual  or whether in preparation to make it more effective, in  case of need.</p>
  <p>    The circumstance  that the appellants have dependent families to support does not  excuse them from their  duty to present themselves  before the Acceptance Board because, if such circumstance exists, they can ask for deferment in complying with their duty and, at all events, they can obtain the proper pecuniary allowance to attend to  these family responsibilities  (sees.  65 and  69  of Commonwealth Act No. 1).</p>
<p>The appealed judgment rendered in  these  two cases is affirmed, with the costs to the appellants.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz,  Laurel</em>,  and <em>Concepcion, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
