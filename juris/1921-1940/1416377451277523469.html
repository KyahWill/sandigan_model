				<H3>ANTONIO PARDO, PETITIONER, VS. THE HERCULES LUMBER CO., INC., AND IGNACIO FERRER, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner, Antonio Pardo, a stockholder in the Hercules Lumber Company, Inc., one of the respondents herein, seeks by&nbsp; this original proceeding&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court to obtain a writ of mandamus to compel&nbsp; the respondents to permit the plaintiff and his duly authorized agent and representative to examine the records and business transactions of said company.&nbsp; To this petition the respondents interposed an answer, in which, after&nbsp; admitting&nbsp; certain allegations of the&nbsp; petition, the&nbsp; respondents set forth the facts&nbsp; upon which they mainly rely as&nbsp; a defense to&nbsp; the petition.&nbsp; To this answer the petitioner&nbsp; in turn interposed a demurrer,&nbsp; and the cause&nbsp; is now before us for&nbsp; determination of the issue thus presented.<br><br>It is inferentially, if not directly admitted that the petitioner is in fact a stockholder in. the Hercules&nbsp; Lumber Company,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the respondent,&nbsp; Ignacio Ferrer, as acting secretary&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; company, has&nbsp; refused to permit the petitioner&nbsp; or his agent to inspect the records and&nbsp; business transactions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Hercules Lumber Company, Inc., at times desired by&nbsp; the petitioner.&nbsp; No serious question is of course made as to the right of the petitioner, by himself or proper representative,&nbsp; to exercise the right of inspection conferred by section 51&nbsp; of Act No. 1459.&nbsp; Said provision&nbsp; was under the consideration of this court in the case of Philpotts <i>vs. </i>Philippine Manufacturing Co. and Berry (40&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 471),&nbsp; where&nbsp; we held&nbsp; that the right of examination there conceded to the stockholder may be exercised either by a stockholder in&nbsp; person&nbsp; or by any duly authorized agent&nbsp; or representative.<br><br>The main ground upon which the defense appears to be rested has reference to the time, or times,&nbsp; within which the right of inspection may be exercised.&nbsp; In this connection&nbsp; the answer asserts that in article 10 of the By-laws of the respondent corporation&nbsp; it is declared&nbsp; that "Every shareholder may examine the&nbsp; books of&nbsp; the&nbsp; company and other documents pertaining to the same upon the days which the&nbsp; board of&nbsp; directors&nbsp; shall&nbsp; annually fix."&nbsp; It is further&nbsp; averred that at the directors' meeting&nbsp; of the respondent corporation held on February 16, 1924, the board passed a resolution to the following effect:<br><blockquote> "The board also resolved to call the usual general (meeting of shareholders)&nbsp; for March 30 of the&nbsp; present year, with notice to the shareholders that the books of the company are at their disposition from the 15th to 25th of the same month for examination, in appropriate&nbsp; hours." </blockquote>The contention for the respondent is that this resolution of the board constitutes a lawful restriction&nbsp; on the right conferred by statute;&nbsp; and it is insisted&nbsp; that as the petitioner has not availed himself of the permission to inspect the books and transactions of the company within the ten days thus defined, his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; inspection and examination is lost, at least for this year.<br><br>We are entirely unable to concur in this contention.&nbsp; The general right given by the statute may not be lawfully abridged to the extent attempted in this resolution.&nbsp; It may be admitted that the officials&nbsp; in charge&nbsp; of&nbsp; a corporation may deny inspection when&nbsp; sought at unusual&nbsp; hours or under other improper conditions; but neither the executive officers&nbsp; nor&nbsp; the board of directors have the power to&nbsp; deprive a&nbsp; stockholder&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; right altogether.&nbsp; A by-law unduly&nbsp; restricting the right of inspection is undoubtedly invalid.&nbsp; Authorities&nbsp; to&nbsp; this effect are too numerous and direct&nbsp; to&nbsp; require extended comment.&nbsp; (14&nbsp; C. J., 859; 7 R. C. L., 325; 4 Thompson&nbsp; on Corporations, 2d ed., sec. 4517; Harkness <i>vs.&nbsp;</i> Guthrie,&nbsp; 27 Utah, 248; 107 Am.&nbsp; St. Rep., 664, 681.)&nbsp; Under a statute similar to our own it has been held that the statutory right of inspection is not affected by&nbsp; the adoption by the board&nbsp; of directors of a resolution providing for the closing of transfer books thirty days before&nbsp; an election.&nbsp; (State <i>vs. </i>St. Louis&nbsp; Railroad Co., 29&nbsp; Mo. Ap., 301.)<br><br>It will be noted that our statute declares&nbsp; that the right of inspection can be exercised "at reasonable hours."&nbsp; This means at reasonable hours on business&nbsp; days throughout the year,&nbsp; and not merely during some arbitrary period of a few days&nbsp; chosen by the directors.<br><br>In addition to relying upon the by-law, to which reference is above made,&nbsp; the answer of the respondents calls in question the motive which is supposed to prompt the&nbsp; petitioner to make inspection;&nbsp; and in this&nbsp; connection it is alleged that the information&nbsp; which the petitioner seeks&nbsp; is desired for ulterior purposes in connection with a competitive firm with which&nbsp; the petitioner is alleged to be&nbsp; connected.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also insisted that&nbsp; one of the purposes of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner is to obtain evidence preparatory to the institution of an action&nbsp; which he means to&nbsp; bring&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; by reason of a&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment which once existed&nbsp; between the&nbsp; corporation and himself.&nbsp; These suggestions are entirely apart from the issue,&nbsp; as,&nbsp; generally speaking, the motive of the shareholder exercising the right is immaterial.&nbsp;&nbsp; (7 R. C. L., 327.)<br><br>We are of the opinion that,&nbsp; upon the allegations of the petition and the admissions of&nbsp; the answer, the petitioner is entitled to relief.&nbsp; The demurrer is, therefore, sustained; and the writ of mandamus will issue as prayed, with costs against the respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson,&nbsp; Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Ostrand, </i> and&nbsp; <i>Romualdez, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
