				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by Jose S. Tiaoqui and&nbsp; Salvador&nbsp; E. Imperial against the&nbsp; Honorable Antonio Horrilleno, Judge of First Instance of Manila, Jose Casimiro,&nbsp; sheriff of the&nbsp; City of Manila, and China Insurance &amp; Surety&nbsp; Co., Inc.,&nbsp; a corporation duly&nbsp; organized and registered under the laws&nbsp; of the Philippines.<br><br>It appears that in civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 45807 of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; entitled,&nbsp; "China Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. vs. Adelina Lim&nbsp; Tuaco and Agustin Vergel de Dios," there was issued, at the instance of the plaintiff, a writ of execution&nbsp; against the defendants&nbsp; by virtue&nbsp; of which Jose Casimiro, sheriff of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, levied upon the amount of P8,390.21 due the defendants from one Ong&nbsp; Che as&nbsp; purchase price of&nbsp; certain&nbsp; properties,&nbsp; said amount remaining in the custody of the sheriff; that Jose S. Tiaoqui filed a complaint in which Salvador E. Imperial later intervened (civil case No. 46389 of the Court of First Instance of Manila),&nbsp; wherein both the plaintiff and the intervenor alleged that they had a lien over the 8,390.21 levied upon by the sheriff of Manila, the first up&nbsp; to the amount of P2,567.33&nbsp; and the second up to the amount of P6,000, and both asked that judgment be rendered in their favor and against the China Insurance &amp; Surety Co.,&nbsp; Inc., for the payment of said&nbsp; sums,&nbsp; respectively, with interest and costs; that upon petition of the plaintiff and the intervenor in&nbsp; said civil case&nbsp; No. 46389, writs&nbsp; of injunction were issued&nbsp; by the court restraining&nbsp; the sheriff&nbsp; of the City of Manila from&nbsp; delivering to the China Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., the aforesaid sum of P8,390.21 in his possession until further order; that a judgment was rendered in the said civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 46389 in favor of the plaintiff Tiaoqui and&nbsp; the&nbsp; intervenor&nbsp; Imperial&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with their respective claims, and an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; having been taken therefrom, the court required the defendant, China&nbsp; Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., to put up a bond in the amount of P9,390.21 in order to suspend the execution of the said judgment pending appeal;&nbsp; that the appeal&nbsp; bond&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to having been&nbsp; filed, the respondent judge,&nbsp; upon petition&nbsp; of the China&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; &amp; Surety&nbsp; Co., Inc., and&nbsp; against the objection&nbsp; of&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Tiaoqui and Salvador E. Imperial, ordered, after the corresponding trial, the lifting of the in- junctions issued as aforesaid, for the reasons, among others, set. forth in the following&nbsp; order of the respondent judge of November 5,&nbsp; 1935:<br><blockquote>"The question, therefore, presented to the court is whether in this state of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the injunction issued by the court against the defendants&nbsp; may or may not be&nbsp; lifted. For a better understanding and resolution of this question, it should be recalled that&nbsp; the injunction issued herein had for its purpose to prohibit the sheriff of Manila from delivering to the defendant China Insurance Co., in execution of a judgment in favor of the latter and against Adelina Limtuaco, one&nbsp; of the defendants, the amount of money above-mentioned&nbsp; which&nbsp; said&nbsp; officer&nbsp; had&nbsp; and&nbsp; still&nbsp; has&nbsp; in&nbsp; his possession, which&nbsp; amount of money had&nbsp; been&nbsp; levied upon from Adelina Limtuaco by the sheriff under the aforesaid judgment in a case" wherein the defendant China Insurance Co. was the plaintiff and Adelina Limtuaco and her husband were the defendants.&nbsp; We&nbsp; have said that the defendant China Insurance, to prevent the execution of the judgment rendered in this case against it, filed a bond in favor of the plaintiff and the intervenor in the amount of P9,390.21 to guarantee&nbsp; and&nbsp; secure the&nbsp; rights of the&nbsp; plaintiff and&nbsp; the intervenor&nbsp; in the event the said judgment is affirmed by our Honorable&nbsp; Supreme Court. With the filing of this bond the money&nbsp; in the hands of the sheriff, which is the subject matter of this case, may now disappear&nbsp; without affecting the&nbsp; rights of the plaintiff and the&nbsp; intervenor who&nbsp; are secured by the bond filed by the defendant China Insurance Co.&nbsp; The continuation, therefore, of the injunction the dissolution of which is asked,&nbsp; is of no avail,&nbsp; answers no purpose, and does not protect better the rights of the plaintiff and of the intervenor.&nbsp; This being so, and considering further that the right to the issuance&nbsp; of a preliminary injunction is not a right <span style="font-style: italic;">ex debito justitise</span>' but an equitable remedy whose issuance, continuation, or dissolution rests on the sound discretion of the courts, which, at any stage of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and&nbsp; while&nbsp; they retain&nbsp; jurisdiction, are&nbsp; authorized to issue&nbsp; or dissolve the injunction,&nbsp; we&nbsp; find no principle of equity or of justice which, under&nbsp; the&nbsp; circumstances in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the dissolution of the injunction issued herein is asked, is at&nbsp; war&nbsp; with the order dissolving&nbsp; the same."</blockquote>Jose S. Tiaoqui&nbsp; and Salvador E. Imperial have filed&nbsp; the instant&nbsp; petition&nbsp; asking that we declare the order of November 5, 1935,&nbsp; null and void, alleging that the respondent judge exceeded his powers to the prejudice of the petitioners in issuing the said order lifting the&nbsp; injunctions without requiring the China Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., to file a bond as provided in section 169 of the Code of Civil Procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondents have answered the petition denying that&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction or abused his powers, and asking that the petition be denied.<br><br>The provisions of section 169 of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure, relied upon by the petitioners, refer solely to&nbsp; a case where the petition to lift a preliminary injunction is filed at any time before trial,&nbsp; and have,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; no application to the present case where the petition for that purpose was filed after the judgment had been entered&nbsp; and a bond filed to suspend the execution&nbsp; thereof pending appeal.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; it is the inherent power of all courts "to amend and control its process and orders&nbsp; so as to&nbsp; make them conformable&nbsp; to law and&nbsp; justice."&nbsp; (Section 11,&nbsp; paragraph 7,&nbsp; Act No. 190.)<br><br>One&nbsp; of the essential requisites provided by law for the issuance&nbsp; of a preliminary injunction is "that the commission or continuance of some act complained of during the litigation&nbsp; would probably work injustice to the plaintiff" (section 164, paragraph 2, Code of Civil Procedure), from which it is inferable that with the disappearance of this cause follows that&nbsp; of the reason or justification for the injunction, which should therefore not be continued in force. The filing by the&nbsp; China Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc., of the appeal bond to secure the&nbsp; payment to the plaintiff and the intervenor in civil case No. 46389 of the amounts adjudicated to the latter in the judgment rendered in their favor in the event&nbsp; the same is affirmed on appeal, dispelled the fear of Injury to the interest of said plaintiff and intervenor sought to be&nbsp; safeguarded by the issuance of the aforementioned injunction.&nbsp; The respondent judge not only did not exceed his powers and jurisdiction, but complied with the principles of law&nbsp; and equity in issuing the order of November 5,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1935.<br><br>Wherefore, it is ordered, as we do hereby, that the petition be denied, with costs to the petitioners.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C.
