				<BR><STRONG>VICKERS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The petitioners claim the right to enter
the Philippine Islands as the wife and minor children of Ong Tay Jong,
a resident Chinese merchant. They were given a hearing by a board of
special inquiry, which denied them admission in the following decision:
<blockquote>
    <p> "The applicants, Lim Son, female, 31 years,
Ong Tec Yong, female, 5 years, Ong Le Te, male, 10 years, Ong Le Gee,
male, 18 years and Ong Chuy Suan, female, 20 years, who arrived on
board the S/S <em>Anking</em>, October 7, 1933, except Ong Chuy Suan,
who arrived on March 25, 1933, are seeking admission into this country
as wife and children, respectively, of one Ong Tay Jong, an alleged
resident Chinese merchant. Ong Tec Yong was not required to testify on
account of her tender age.</p>
    <p> "Upon reviewing the testimonies
of the applicants and that of their alleged father and husband, the
following substantial contradictions have been found:</p>
    <p> "1.
Ong Le Gee, one of the applicants, testified before the board that they
had no family picture in their home in China while his sister Ong Chuy
Suan, also one of the applicants, declared that they had a family
picture which was still hanging in the wall of their house in China.
When she left in such a position that occupants of said house could see
it and further declared that Ong Le Gee is one of the persons appearing
in the said family picture.</p>
    <p> "2. Lim Son, one of the
applicants and an alleged wife of Ong Tay Jong, testified that she was
married to Ong Tay Jong on C. R. 11-8-15 (Oct. 5, 1922) while her
alleged husband, Ong Tay Jong, declared that he married to Lim Son on
October 10, 1922.</p>
    <p> "Furthermore, Lim Son, declared that her
husband, Ong Tay Jong, was in this country when their daughter Ong Tec
Yong was born in China and same was corroborated by her alleged
husband, while the rubber stamp at the back of C. R. No. 566/2814 of
Ong Tay Jong shows clearly that he (Ong Tay Jong) was in China during
the birth of Ong Tec Yong as per Spl. Ret. Cert. No. 76801 issued in
his favor on November 7, 1927, and returning here on Feb. 11, 1930.</p>
    <p> "Observation of the Board:</p>
    <p>
"Applicants, Ong Le Gee and Ong Chuy Suan, alleged brothers and sisters
and minor children of Ong Tay Jong appear in the opinion of the board
to be younger and older, respectively, than the ages they have given.
The former in the opinion of the board is only 14 to 15 years old,
while the latter is believed to be about 22 and 23 years old. We submit
the persons of the herein applicants to the reviewing authorities as
the proper evidence.</p>
    <p> "It is the opinion of this board that
the claims of the applicants are unbelievable in view of the fact that
their alleged father and husband declared in this investigation that he
is an employee in the Bureau of Internal Revenue as Chinese Accountant
since 1925 up to the present time and that he had no proof to show that
he is still a merchant. Being not a merchant, Ong Tay Jong, their
alleged father and husband, cannot, therefore, bring in this country
the members of his family residing abroad. Besides, he could not
present license to show that he is still engaged in business. In the
absence of the above mentioned document, Ong Tay Jong could not be
considered to possess a merchant status to entitle him to bring his
family in this country.</p>
    <p> "The mere fact that he had been
indorsed before does not confer upon him the same privilege which he
has otherwise lost by his change of status. His prior indorsement
merely protects and guarantees his return into the country even tho he
subsequently became a laborer or a bankrupt but it could not be in
anyway considered to include the rights of his children when his
changed of status took place long ago. This holding is believed to be
in conformity with the established policy of this Office and is also
considered to be in accord with the essence of the Immigration Laws.</p>
    <p>
"Being a clerk we are of the opinion that he belongs to the class of
skilled laborers. Hence, he is not entitled to the privilege of the
exempt classes.</p>
    <p> "In view of the foregoing, the applicants, are hereby denied admission.</p>
    <p>
"The applicants and their attorney, Mr. Francisco T. Koh, are hereby
informed of this decision and further informed that they have two days
within which to appeal to the Insular Collector of Customs should they
feel dissatisfied therewith."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The
petitioners then appealed to the respondent, the Insular Collector of
Customs, who overruled their appeal and ordered that they be returned
to their port of embarkation.</p>
<p> They next applied to the Court of First Instance of Manila for writ
of habeas corpus, which was granted by Judge Pedro Concepcion, who
found that the contradictions in the testimony of the petitioners noted
by the board of special inquiry were immaterial; that the board abused
its discretion in stating, without giving any reason therefor, that Ong
Chuy Suan and Ong Le Gee appeared to be younger and older,
respectively, than they represented themselves to be; that the board
denied the petitioners admission because Ong Tay Jong, the husband of
Lim Son, and the father of the other petitioners, was an employee of
the Bureau of Internal Revenue and did not prove that he was still a
merchant; that if it is admitted, as it is, that Ong Tay Jong has the
right to remain in the Philippine Islands' because he was a merchant
when he entered this country, and if his right to remain here has not
been lost, and would not be lost even if he had become a laborer
through financial reverses, it is unquestionable that his wife and
children have the right to enter and reside in these Islands, because
such right is the necessary consequence of Ong Tay Jong's right to
reside here, citing the case of Lim Pue <em>vs.</em> Collector of
Customs (33 Phil., 519); that if a Chinese, who has become a laborer,
has the right to bring in his family, with more reason has Ong Tay Jong
that right because he is not a laborer, but a Chinese accountant in the
Bureau of Internal Revenue, and that an employee Who renders services
to the Government of the Philippine Islands is in a better political
condition than a mere laborer, and it is unjust to deny to such
employee of the Government the privileges of a laborer who was formerly
a merchant. The decision of the Insular Collector of Customs was set
aside, and it was adjudged that the petitioners have the right to enter
and reside in the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p> The respondent through the Solicitor-General appealed to this court, and now makes the following assignments of error:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The lower court erred:<br>
      <br>
"1. In holding that the contradictions committed by the detained
immigrants were not so material and important as to deserve any
consideration;</p>
  <p>
"2. In holding that if a Chinese merchant upon later becoming a
laborer, is entitled to bring in here members of his family, more so in
the case of Ong Tay Jong, who is not a laborer, but an officer of the
Government of the Philippine Islands; and</p>
  <p> "3. In ordering the discharge of the petitioners from the custody of the respondent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It is unnecessary for us to discuss the first error assigned,
because the board of special inquiry did not find that the petitioners
were not the wife and children of Ong Tay Jong, and the board merely
expressed the opinion, without giving any reason therefor, that Ong
Chuy Suan was twenty-two or twenty-three years old. The board said:
"The claims of the applicants are unbelievable in view of the fact that
their alleged father and husband declared in this investigation that he
is an employee in the Bureau of Internal Revenue as Chinese Accountant
since 1925 up to the present time and that he had no proof to show that
he is still a merchant. Being not a merchant, Ong Tay Jong, their
alleged father and husband, cannot, therefore, bring in this country
the members of his family residing abroad. Besides, he could not
present license to show that he still engaged in business. In the
absence of the above mentioned document, Ong Tay Jong could not be
considered to possess a merchant status to entitle him to bring hfs
family in this country"</p>
<p> In other words, the board of special inquiry denied the petitioners
admission solely because Ong Tay Jong did not prove that he was still
engaged in business as a merchant. In the absence of any finding to the
contrary by the board of special inquiry, we may accept the finding of
the lower court that the petitioners are the wife and children of Ong
Tay Jong.</p>
<p> The second contention of the respondent is that Ong Tay Jong has
ceased to be a merchant, and that he has therefore no right to bring
his wife and minor children into the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p> The contentions of the petitioners are ably set forth in the decision of the lower court, which we have summarized.</p>
<p> Prior to the Immigration Act of 1924 (Act of Congress of May 26,
1924) a Chinese that had been lawfuly admitted as a merchant did not
become subject to deportation if he became a laborer. (Dang Foo <em>vs.</em> Day [C. C. A.], 50 Fed. [2d], 116, 118, and cases there cited; Yee See Que <em>vs.</em> McGregor, 2 Fed. Supp., 688.)</p>
<p> In the case of Cheung Sum Shee <em>vs.</em> Nagle ([1925], 268 U.
S., 336; 69 Law. e.d., 985), the Supreme Court of the United States,
construing the Immigration Act of 1924 said: "The wives and minor
children of resident Chinese merchants were guaranteed the right of
entry by the Treaty of 1880, and certainly possessed it prior to July
1st when the present Immigration Act became effective. (United States <em>vs.</em> Gue Lim, <em>supra</em>.)
That Act must be construed with the view to preserve treaty rights
unless clearly annulled, and we cannot conclude that, considering its
history, the general terms therein disclose a congressional intent
absolutely to exclude the petitioners from entry.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In a certain sense it is true that petitioners did
not come 'solely to carry on trade.' But Mrs. Gue Lim did not come as a
'merchant.' She was nevertheless allowed to enter, upon the theory that
a treaty provision admitting merchants by necessary implication
extended to their wives and minor children. This rule was not unknown
to Congress when considering the act now before us."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands held in the case of Lim Pue <em>vs.</em>
Collector of Customs (33 Phil, 519), decided in 1916, that a Chinese
person who entered the Philippine Islands as a Chinese merchant and did
business therein for several years as such who, through changes in
financial circumstances, becomes a laborer, may still remain in the
Philippine Islands by virtue of the privileges attaching to the status
which he enjoyed at the time of entry; and the wife of such a person
has the right to enter the Philippine Islands by reason of those
privileges, although her husband has ceased to be a merchant and become
a laborer.</p>
<p> It appears from the record that Ong Tay Jong, husband and father of
the petitioners, has been domiciled in the Philippine Islands for many
years; that he was indorsed as a merchant in 1912; that since then he
has made four visits to China and was permitted to reenter the
Philippine Islands as a merchant on his return in 1914, 1924, 1927, and
1930; that he and his partners had a store in Cebu and another in
Leyte; that he closed his store ("stopped my business") in Cebu in
1920, went to China in 1922, returned in 1924, and entered the service
of the Government of the Philippine Islands in 1925 as a Chinese
accountant in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, where he is at present
employed.</p>
<p> The case of To Ming <em>vs.</em> Commissioner of Immigration (52
Fed. [2d], 791), erroneously cited by the Solicitor-General as having
been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, was decided by
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
in 1981. The decision in that case has no application to the present
case, because To Ming first went to the United States in December,
1924, and in the decision emphasis was laid upon the fact that the
alien's entry was after the effective date of the Immigration Act of
1924; but in the case of Chin Hong <em>vs.</em> Nagle (7 Fed. [2d],
609), decided August 24, 1925, the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth
Circuit, held that the petitioner, Chin Hong, had no right to enter the
United States, because his father was not a merchant at the time when
Chin Hong sought to enter the United States. After citing the facts
showing that while Chin Lung, the petitioner's father, was a member of
a firm engaged in general merchandise business in a small way, he
devoted a considerable part of his time to the business of a lottery
carried on in the same building as the merchandise business, and that
the Commissioner of Immigration and the Secretary of Labor had decided
that Chin Lung was a Chinese laborer, the court said: "* * * Here the
crucial question is whether or not Chin Lung was a merchant at the time
when his minor son sought to enter the United States.*' With this one
sentence the court disposed of the case. The decision is not sustained
by any reasoning or citation of authorities.</p>
<p> In the case of Haff <em>vs.</em> Yung Poy (68 Fed. [2d], 203),
decided December 11, 1933, the record showed that Yung Poy was admitted
into the United States on June 2, 1926 as a minor son of Yung Hong, a
Chinese merchant lawfully domiciled in the United States. In 1927 Yung
Hong ceased to be a merchant and obtained employment as a janitor. On
September 9, 1932 Yung Poy was ordered deported to China on the ground
that he had remained in the United States after failing to maintain the
exempt status, under which he was admitted, of an alien entitled to
enter the United States solely to carry on trade under and in pursuance
of the provisions of the present existing treaty of commerce and labor.
From an order of the District Court granting the petition of Yung Poy
for a writ of habeas corpus the government appealed, and contended (1)
that appellee's rights were measured by the Immigration Act of 1924 and
not by the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with China, dated November
17, 1880, under which appellee's father was admitted as a merchant; (2)
that one admitted to the United States under the Immigration Act of
1924 as a minor son of a trader becomes subject to deportation if his
father ceases to carry on trade.</p>
<p> The Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming the decision of the lower
court held that the provisions of the Immigration Act of 1924,
applicable to Chinese aliens, abrogate only those provisions in the
treaty with China that are inconsistent with the act; that the right of
a Chinese minor alien, admitted as a minor son of Chinese trader or
merchant, to remain in the United States after his father has lost the
exempt status, is governed by the treaty and not by the Immigration
Act; that a Chinese merchant, lawfully admitted prior to the
Immigration Act of 1924, may remain after losing his exempt status as a
merchant; that statutes should be given a sensible construction to
effectuate legislative intention, and, if possible, to avoid unjust or
absurd conclusions; and that a minor Chinese alien, admitted as a minor
son of a Chinese trader or merchant, is not subject to deportation,
where his father, although not subject to deportation, has lost his
exempt status.</p>
<p> The court said: "* * * The right of such a merchant's wife or minor
child to remain here after loss of his or her communicated status, by
reason of the merchant's changed occupation, is, of course, another
question; but that such an alien's right is coextensive with the right
of the husband, or father, seems a Just and reasonable answer, for the
absurdities and hardships of a contrary rule of law are apparent. Thus,
if a merchant, because of illness, mishap, economic condition, or other
misfortune, were required to change his status as a merchant and secure
other employment, should his hapless—and perhaps helpless— family be
deported and he allowed to remain, or perforce required to remain
because of long absence from his native country and environment?
Likewise, must the family of such a merchant be deported because, upon
the death of the merchant, the communicated status of the wife and
children has been lost?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "With these harsh consequences in mind, and in view
of the well-settled rule of law "that statutes should receive a
sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative
intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd
conclusion' (Lau Ow Bew <em>vs.</em> United States, 144 U. S., 47, 59;
12 S. Ct, 517, 520; 36 L. ed., 340), we cannot conclude that the rights
of such aliens to remain here should be construed so narrowly as the
government contends, or that it was the intention of Congress in
enacting the Immigration Act of 1924 that aliens admitted to the United
States by virtue of the 'merchant status' of their prior domiciled
father or husband, as the case might be, should be deported because the
merchant, although not subject to deportation, has lost his status1 as
a merchant."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The rights of the petitioners in the present case are therefore
determined by the treaty between the United States and China and not by
the Immigration Act of 1924. As already pointed out, the Supreme Court
of the United States1 held in the case of the United States vs, Gue Lim
<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> that "Although she did
not come solely to carry on trade she was nevertheless entitled to
enter, upon the theory that a treaty provision admitting merchants by
necessary implication extended to their wives and minor children," and
as was decided in the case of Haff <em>vs.</em> Yung Poy, <em>supra</em>,
if a merchant because of illness, mishap, economic condition, or other
misfortune is required to change his status as a merchant and secure
other employment, his family should not be deported but should be
allowed to remain, it might be contended upon the same reasoning that
the petitioners are entitled to'enter the Philippine Islands as the
wife and minor children of Ong Tay Jong, even if he be at present a
laborer in fact, because he was lawfully admitted as a merchant and is
domiciled here.</p>
<p> In the Lim Pue case, <em>supra</em>, this court held that Tin
Singa, the husband of the petitioner, still enjoyed the privileges of
the status which he had when he entered the Philippine Islands as a
merchant, although he had become a laborer in fact; that the petitioner
participated in the privileges her husband enjoyed, which were derived
from the fact that he entered the Philippine Islands and lived therein
for years as a Chinese merchant.</p>
<p> If the petitioners had come to the Philippine Islands prior to July
1, 1924, the effective date of the present Immigration Act, they would
have been admitted in accordance with the doctrine laid down in the
case of Lim Pue, and since, as we have seen, their rights are not
affected by the Immigration Aet of 1924, they are now entitled to enter
and reside in these Islands.</p>
<p> The decision of the lower court is affirmed, without a special finding as to costs.</p>
