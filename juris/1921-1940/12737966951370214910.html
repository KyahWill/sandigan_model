				<H3>MARIANO UY CHACO SONS & CO., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE ADMIRAL LINE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The plaintiff, Mariano Uy Chaco Sons &amp; Co., alleges as a cause of action, 
that upon arrival of the S. S. <em>Satsuma</em> at the port of Manila on June 
22, 1920, there were short-delivered one case of varnish and paint remover and 
fifty bales of oakum, for the conversion of which, defendant is liable. The 
defendant, the Admiral Line, relies on the defense in its second amended answer 
that the merchandise had been delayed, had been found, and delivery thereof had 
been tendered and rejected. Judgment was for plaintiff for the value of the case 
of varnish and paint remover, P22.80, for the value of the fifty bales of oakum, 
P700, for the freight, P195.50, and for the insurance, P18, or a total of 
P936.30, with legal interest and costs.</p>
<p>It is defendant's contention on appeal that plaintiff was in duty bound to 
have accepted the goods when tendered, as the plaintiff, not the defendant, was 
the owner of the goods and as there was no conversion by defendant. To this, 
plaintiff replies that it was justified, following such a long delay in 
delivery, in refusing the tender of the merchandise so tardily made.</p>
<p>Defendant relies on the general rule that mere delay in the delivery of goods 
by a common carrier, no matter how long continued, is not a conversion thereof, 
but is only a breach of the contract of carriage. Therefore, where a carrier 
fails to deliver goods within a reasonable time, although he thereby makes 
himself liable for the damages incurred by reason of the delay, the consignee 
cannot refuse to accept the goods from him and recover their value, but is 
compelled to receive them. The most usual element of damages for a carrier's 
negligent delay in delivering the goods of the consignee is the difference 
between the market value of the goods at the time when they should have been 
delivered, and the time when they were delivered, to which may be added 
reasonable expenses caused by the delay; but if there has been a conversion of 
the goods by the carrier, and the consignee has not thereafter accepted them, he 
is entitled to recover the value of the goods at the time they should have been 
delivered to him. (10 C. J., pp. 283, 307; 4 R. C. L., pp. 737, 745, 931; 
Carver's Carriage by Sea, sees. 711-727; 2 Hutchinson on Carriers, sec. 651; 
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. <em>vs.</em> O'Donnell [1893], 49 O. St., 489; 
21 L. R. A., 117; Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. <em>vs.</em> Saulsberry 
[1907], 12 L. R. A., [N. SJ, 431.)</p>
<p>That is sound doctrine. It should be applied to the multiform transactions 
coming before the courts. But our heads should not be so lost in the clouds of 
abstract theory, even if charmingly advanced by learned counsel, as to cause us 
to lose sight of the necessity of keeping our feet firmly planted on the mundane 
earth of actual fact.</p>
<p>The relevant data follows: The merchandise should have been landed on June 
22, 1920. Not having been delivered either on that day or any subsequent day 
before May 21, 1921, and all efforts to secure satisfaction from the carrier 
having failed, the complaint was presented on the date last mentioned. It was 
amended on July 12, 1921. Answer in the form of a general denial was interposed 
by the defendant on August 11, 1921. The first amended answer was filed on 
February 18, 1922. Formal tender of the goods was made by the defendant on 
October 7, 1922. Efforts at compromise having failed, plaintiff moved on April 
27, 1923, for the assignment of the case for hearing. On August 14, 1923, 
defendant offered its second amended answer in which the claim now advanced was 
first announced, saying "That since the institution of this action, etc." One 
week later, on August 21, 1923, the trial commenced.</p>
<p>The interval which elapsed between the date when the merchandise should have 
been delivered and the presentation of the complaint was approximately eleven 
months. The delay which ensued between the date when the merchandise should have 
been delivered and the date when it was finally tendered was close to two years 
and four months. The time which passed between the date when the merchandise 
should have been delivered and the date when the defense of tender was set up, 
was over three years, and this particular line of defense was not announced 
until shortly before the trial.</p>
<p>With the facts to the forefront, certain pertinent interrogatories may be 
propounded. Accepting the general principles of carriers, damages, and 
conversion, are there not exceptions to these broad rules? Is there not some 
limit to the time which the consignee must wait for the delivery of his goods 
before he can justly assume conversion of them to have taken place and sue for 
the recovery of their value? Where the goods have not been landed with other 
goods as expected, and where after long delay they are still undelivered, cannot 
the consignee bring suit to recoup himself for the loss, without having to wait 
for a period of time which might extend to eternity, before asking for 
redress?</p>
<p>No case coming either from the local forum or from foreign jurisdictions 
which exactly fits the facts has been found. (But Behn, Meyer &amp; Co. 
<em>vs.</em> Banco Espanol-Filipino [1908], 11 Phil., 253, and Yangco 
<em>vs.</em> Meerkamp &amp; Company, R. G. No. 15498,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> can be noted.) However, we invite attention 
to the following:</p>
<p>Volume 10, Corpus Juris, at page 272, is authority for this: "* * * A demand 
and a refusal to deliver is sometimes essential to show a conversion. Even after 
demand,<em> if the goods are tendered before suit brought</em>, the consignee 
cannot refuse to receive the goods and sue for conversion, his sole remedy being 
an action for damages resulting from the delay." Hutchinsoa's Treatise on the 
Law of Carriers (third edition, vol. 2, p. 717) contains this: "Though the 
carrier may delay ever so long, the owner cannot charge him with a conversion, 
or for value of the goods, if they are safely kept, unjess they have been 
demanded of the carrier and their delivery refused, * * * " relying on Hamilton 
<em>vs.</em> Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Company ([1897], 103 
Iowa, 325). Following the lines of the note to the text, we find this: " Where 
property in the hands of a common carrier is not delivered within a reasonable 
time after it has reached its destination, the carrier, in the absence of any 1 
Promulgated September 7, 1920, not reported. legal exemption and after demand 
has been made and delivery refused, is liable for a conversion of the property. 
The consignee, under such circumstances, may elect to waive all title to the 
property and sue for the conversion, and after he has done so, <em>a subsequent 
tender by the carrier will not be available for it as a defense.</em> * * * " 
Consulting the body of the decision, to confirm the foregoing, we discover this 
statement: " * * * A tender of the property, to be effectual, must have been 
made within the time in which the defendant was entitled to deliver it and the 
plaintiff bound to receive it. The tender made was not until long after the 
lapse of this period, and, not being accepted, is no bar to plaintiff's right to 
recover. ? * * " The subsequent case of Clark <em>vs.</em> American Express Co. 
([1906], 130 Iowa, 254), after distinguishing Hamilton <em>vs.</em> Chicago, 
Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Company, <em>supra,</em> continues: "* * * 
Under the conceded facts defendant tendered the goods to plaintiff <em>before 
this action was com- menced</em>, and plaintiff refused to receive them. His 
action, then, was not for conversion, but for damages. * * *"</p>
<p>A delay of more than two years in making delivery was conclusively 
unreasonable. A delay in pressing a defense predicated on tender, of more than 
two years counted from the date when the complaint was filed, was likewise 
unreasonable. The mancupation of the property by the defendant was sufficiently 
complete since it was unable to turn the goods over to the plaintiff at any time 
before the complaint was presented, and in fact, could not do so until a long 
time thereafter. Add these facts together, and the reasons why the plaintiff can 
be permitted to recover on its action are self-evident.</p>
<p>We would not be understood as laying down the absolute rule that tender not 
made until after the action is commenced is unavailable as a defense. Suit might 
conceivably be instituted with disconcerting haste. In this jurisdiction we have 
a remedial code susceptible to extremely elastic construction. What we do mean 
is that on the facts at bar, defendant was in effect guilty of conversion and 
must accordingly respond for the value of the property at the time of 
conversion.</p>
<p>What has been said disposes of the defendant's first assignment of error, and 
its second and third specifications of error fall with it.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed with costs. So ordered.</p><em>Johnson, Street, Avance√±a,
