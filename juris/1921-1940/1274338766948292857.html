				<H3>IN RE WILL OF GREGORIO NATIVIDAD. JOSE ALVAREZ, CREDITOR AND APPELLEE, VS. CASIMIRO NATIVIDAD ET AL., OPPONENTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">According to the evidence of record and to the decision rendered by this 
court in Natividad vs. Natividad (51 Phil., 613), on March 2, 1928, from which 
the present case originated, Gregorio Natividad died on May 30, 1926. One of the 
heirs, a natural grandson by the name of Alfredo Natividad, propounded a will in 
the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, alleged to have been made by the 
deceased on August 27, 1923. Casimiro and Gregorio Natividad, together with the 
other heirs named Gregorio, Maria, and Miguel Estela, the last two minors being 
represented by their guardian, opposed the probate of the will.
<p>At the hearing of the case, Attorney Vicente Ribaya appeared for the 
proponent, and attorneys Pablo Sibulo, Fernando Alvarez, and Jose Pefias for the 
opponents, the Estela heirs being represented in the case by their uncle, 
Casimiro Natividad. After the proponent's evidence was all in, the court, 
addressing counsel for the opponents, Alvarez, Sibulo, and Peñas, asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Have you any evidence? To which attorney Alvarez answered:</p>
<p>"We waive the presentation of evidence, your Honor, and pray only that 
instead of appointing proponent Alfredo Natividad administrator, Your Honor, 
name one of the testator's children. We propose Mr. Casimiro Natividad. Or, we 
pray that at least in the interests of harmony, Mr. Casimiro Natividad be 
appointed coadministrator.</p>
<p>"COURT. (To Mr. Alvarez.) And you withdraw your opposition to the probate of 
the will?</p>
<p>"ALVAREZ and SIBULO. We do.</p>
<p>"ALVAREZ. We withdraw our opposition, but pray your Honor to appoint Mr. 
Casimiro Natividad coadministrator."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court admitted the will to probate and appointed Alfredo Natividad 
executor, fixing the required bond at P2000.</p>
<p>Casimiro Natividad was not present at the hearing, but the trial judge was 
aware that he was in the courthouse. Casimiro Natividad, however, had not 
authorized his lawyers to compromise the litigation, and on the same day (July 
31, 1926) the will was admitted to probate, he entered his objection to the 
will. And on September 14, 1926, a petition under section 113 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure to set aside the order admitting the will to probate was filed 
on behalf of Casimiro Natividad and Gregorio, Maria, and Miguel Estela, the last 
two being minors represented by their guardian. This petition and a subsequent 
motion for reconsideration were denied by the court, whence the appeal in said 
case of Natividad vs. Natividad, <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p>In deciding that appeal, the Supreme Court relied upon section 27 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, which provides that lawyers cannot, without special 
authority, compromise their client's litigation, or receive anything in 
discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash, citing the rulings of 
the Supreme Court of Georgia in Davis vs. First National Bank of Blakely 
([1913], 139 Ga., 702; 46 L. R. A. [N. S.], 750); Holker <em>vs.</em> Parker 
([1813], 7 Cranch, 436) ; and Jordan <em>vs.</em> Russell (8 Ohio Dec. Reprint, 
467).</p>
<p>Further considering that the case involved the interests of two minors, the 
court decided to grant a new trial to bring out all the pertinent evidence. 
Accordingly it vacated the order in question and remanded the record for trial 
to determine if the will of Gregorio Natividad should be admitted to 
probate.</p>
<p>On April 30, 1927, or a year prior to the decision of this court 
above-mentioned, the committee on claims and appraisals adopted the following 
resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas no claim having been presented since March 21st with regard to the 
testamentary proceedings of the Estate of the late. Gregorio Natividad, although 
publication has been made in the newspaper 'Bicolandia' published in the 
capital, Naga, and notices have been posted in the most public places of this 
locality as well as in other municipalities of Partido Lagonoy, all further 
proceedings in the premises are hereby suspended with respect to the undersigned 
committee, unless the Court of First Instance orders that they should continue 
acting in said capacity, should any claim be presented hereafter. Resolved until 
further orders. (Sgd.) Sebastian Moll, Member.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Sgd.) FRANCISCO ALGARATE, <em>Member.</em>"</p>
<p>The record having been remanded to the Court of First Instance of Camarines 
Sur, Casimiro Natividad, the testator's son was appointed coadministrator of the 
estate on October 4, 1928. On November 9, 1928, Dr. Jose Alvarez moved the court 
to extend the session of the committee thirty days, in order that it might hear 
and pass upon his P10,774 credit, for which he was about to put in a claim. On 
November 27, 1928, counsel for the opponents answered this motion, objecting 
thereto. On January 10, 1929, the court ordered the committee to act thirty days 
longer to give the movant, Doctor Alvarez, an opportunity to file his claim. On 
January 29th, counsel for the opponents filed another motion praying that 
Sebastian Moll and Francisco Algarate be removed from the committee on claims, 
and that Lino Cabaero and Pedro Briones be named in their stead, upon the 
following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The said members are incompetent to discharge their duties.</p>
<p>"2. The said members committed perjury.</p>
<p>"3. The appointment of said members was recommended by Alfredo Natividad 
whose interest is diametrically opposed to the herein oppositors.</p>
<p>"4. The newly proposed appointees are competent and honest 
persons."</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 26, 1930 (this should be 1929) Casimiro Natividad, the 
coadministrator, received the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. CASIMIRO NATIVIDAD: The committee on claims and appraisals with 
reference to the estate of the late Gregorio Natividad is now sitting in special 
session to hear Dr. Alvarez's claim for professional fees in the amount of 
P10,210. Inasmuch as this case will adversely affect the heirs, you should be 
present to oppose this claim. We shall await you. Yours; Mr. FRANCISCO 
ALGARATE."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon receipt of this communication, Casimiro Natividad sent back the 
following reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I cannot at this time go there I expect— (the next word is illegible because 
the figure '300' has been scrawled over it to show the page of the record 
containing this reply) — the decision of the Manila lawyers and the other heirs 
who are not here. Yours, C. Natividad."</p></blockquote>
<p>On January 27, 1929, the committee filed its additional report reading as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On January 26, 1929, at the reopening of its session by this committee on 
claims and appraisals, Dr. Jose Alvarez and the executor-administrator Alfredo 
Natividad appeared, but not the coadministrator, Casimiro Natividad, who asked 
to be excused because he Was still awaiting his lawyers instructions. 
Nevertheless the claimant-creditor Jose Alvarez served him with notice in due 
form, and this committee before reopening its session sent him the official 
notice (see appendix No. 1) attached to this report.</p>
<p>"At 2 p. m. the committee reopened its session to hear and pass upon Dr. Jose 
Alvarez's claim as set forth in his pleading which, with his evidence, is 
attached to this report as appendix No. 2 and No. 3. The claimant asked for ten 
thousand two hundred and ten pesos (P10,210) against the estate, for 
professional medical services rendered to the late Gregorio Natividad during his 
illness; and as it appeared to the committee that the administrators of the 
estate had been duly notified of the hearing, it proceeded to hear Dr. Jose 
Alvarez's evidence in support of his claim.</p>
<p>"Dr. Jose Alvarez was examined under oath with reference to his claim against 
the estate, and it appears that he had rendered professional services to the 
late Gregorio Natividad during the latter's illness for the time mentioned in 
his bill (Exhibit A), which was adduced in evidence, and that the 
executor-administrator Alfredo Natividad admits both that the creditor really 
rendered such services and that they have not been paid for either wholly or in 
part.</p>
<p>"Whereas no evidence was adduced against this claim by the executor or the 
administrator of the estate, the committee hereby admits Dr. Jose Alvarez's 
claim, of ten thousand two hundred and ten pesos (P10,210) as a credit against 
the estate of Gregorio Natividad, with interest at six per cent per annum from 
the date of the claim,, all of which is to be paid to said creditor.</p>
<p>"Another claim was filed by Fr. Sinforoso Ubalde, the parish priest of 
Tigaon, through Mr. Casimiro Natividad, for burial fees with reference to the 
late Gregorio Natividad. Whereas this credit is rather against the heirs than 
the estate, and inasmuch as the committee has re-opened its session for the sole 
purpose of passing upon creditor Jose Alvarez's claim, pursuant to the order of 
the court, the committee hereby disallows the claim.</p>
<p>"Summary of credits claimed against estate: </p>
<p>"Dr. Jose Alvarez: P10,210 at 6 per cent per annum. Allowed. Father Sinforoso 
Ubalde. Disallowed.</p>
<p>"In witness whereof we sign these presents at Tigaon, Camarines Sur, upon 
this 27th day of January, 1929.— (Sgd.) FRANCISCO ALGARATE, Member. (Sgd.) 
SEBASTIAN MOLL, Member."</p></blockquote>
<p>This additional report was received in the office of the clerk of the Court 
of First Instance on February 6, 1929, and the appellants were given notice of 
the fact.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1929, the opponents filed the following motion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Come now the oppositors and the administrator Casimiro Natividad in the 
above entitled cause, and respectfully state:</p>
<p>"1. That a notice was served on the undersigned by the clerk of this court, 
informing us of an additional report submitted by the actual committee on claims 
and appraisals;</p>
<p>"2. That, up to this time, neither the administrator Casimiro Natividad, nor 
your oppositors are aware of the nature of said report, they having received no 
copy of same;</p>
<p>"3. That on or about January 24, 1929, a motion was filed by your oppositors 
praying, for reasons therein contained, for the discharge of the said committee 
and the appointment of a new one, said motion being up to this time pending 
resolution by this court.</p>
<p>"4. That the said committee failed to notify either your oppositors or the 
administrator Casimiro Natividad of its session or sessions for the allowance or 
disallowance of any claim or claims to it submitted; and in spite thereof the 
said committee appears to have allowed claims against the decedent's estate 
without due hearing and in spite of the further fact that the said administrator 
asked for a continuance of the hearing requested by Dr. Jose Alvarez in his 
motion of the 16th ultimo;</p>
<p>"That, so far as the undersigned are concerned, the said committee has not 
set any date or dates for the hearing of the claim of said claimant.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that all the proceedings had up to this 
time by the said committee be declared null and void, the report dissallowed, 
and that our petition for the discharge of the present members thereof, granted, 
and new members appointed.—Manila, for Naga, Camarines Sur, P. I., February 14, 
1929.—Camus &amp; Delgado.</p></blockquote>
<p>By (Sgd.) Macario S. Calayag, Attorneys for oppositors and administrator, 313 
Masonic Temple, Manila."</p>
<p>Subsequently, i. e., on November 27, 1929, the parties compounded their 
difference and submitted to the court for decision the agreement transcribed on 
pages 43 to 46 of the record on appeal; upon hearing thereof on November 29, 
1929, the court reaffirmed its order dated July 31, 1926, admitting Gregorio 
Natividad's will to probate, presented in this case as Exhibit A of the 
petition.</p>
<p>On January 13, 1930, Dr. Alvarez filed a motion asking the court to approve 
the committee's additional report and to order the executor to pay his P10,774 
credit.</p>
<p>On February 12, 1930, the court entered the following ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There has been presented to the undersigned for decision, the motion of the 
creditor, Dr. Jose Alvarez, asking for the approval of the report submitted by 
the committee on claims and appraisals with reference to the claim against the 
estate in the amount of P10,210, and that the administrator be ordered to pay 
him this amount, with the opposition of Casimiro Natividad et al, who, in turn, 
filed a motion praying for the removal of the present members of the committee, 
and the appointment of others in their stead.</p>
<p>"With regard to the first motion, a careful examination of all the orders and 
proceedings of the case, fails to show any sufficient reason for the opponents' 
contention, particularly with reference to the notice given, for it seems 
evident that opponent Casimiro Natividad had been notified of the hearing of the 
claim before the committee, or at least, that he had constructive notice 
thereof. In so far as to the claim of the oppositors, it should be further 
observed that whatever anomalies there may have been in the allowance of this 
claim, the court cannot properly take cognizance of them unless the case be 
brought up to it on appeal under sections 773 et seq. of the Code of Civil 
Procedure ; for which reason the motion of the creditor praying that the court 
approve the report of the committee is likewise improper. There is no law nor 
judicial usage requiring this court to approve or disapprove the report of the 
committee, allowing or disallowing the claims filed before it. Such rulings of 
the committee have the force of a judgment. Therefore, inasmuch as no appeal was 
taken within the time fixed in section 775 of the Code of Civil Procedure from 
the ruling of the committee allowing the creditor's claim^ this court is unable, 
in any manner, to disturb such ruling.</p>
<p>"With regard to the opponents' motion for the removal of the present members 
of the committee on claims, this raises merely a moot question, for, at any 
rate, the past acts of these members will not be affected, and, moreover, there 
are no more claims for the committee to pass upon, as, apparently, all the 
periods and extensions of time provided in section 690 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure have been exhausted.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the opponents' contention is overruled, and the judicial 
administrator is hereby ordered to pay the amount of this claim to Dr. Jose 
Alvarez as soon as he has the necessary funds. So ordered.</p>
<p>"Given at Naga, Camarines Sur, this twelfth day of February, 1930.</p>

<p><em>"Judge of the Court of First Instance<br>"Camarines Norte and 
Sur"</em></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p><br><br>After a motion for the reconsideration of this ruling had been 
denied, the opponents presented their appeal against this order of February 12, 
1930, and now assign the following errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The lower court erred in not declaring that the additional report filed 
by the committee on claims is null and void on account of grave irregularities, 
if not illegalities, committed in connection with the allowance of said 
claim.</p>
<p>"2. The court below likewise erred in not ordering the committee on claims to 
proceed to publish and post the notice required by section 687 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure before passing upon the merit of the claim in question.</p>
<p>"3. The lower court likewise erred in not holding that the committee could 
not have legally met to hear as it did hear the claim in question, without due 
notice served on appellants in. accordance with the law.</p>
<p>"4. The lower court likewise erred in not declaring that the report was null 
and void on the ground that the committee could not have legally met to hear as 
it did hear the claim in question while appellants' motion to discharge the 
members of said committee was pending consideration.</p>
<p>"5. The lower court likewise erred in holding that the additional report has 
been properly filed even though no notice thereof had been sent by the committee 
to appellants' counsel.</p>
<p>"6. The lower court likewise erred in holding that no proper appeal had been 
taken from the additional report filed by the committee."</p></blockquote>
<p>The appellant prays that the order appealed from be set aside, the additional 
report of the committee on claims be declared null, and the record be remanded 
to the court of origin for the purpose of having the proper trial to determine 
the real merits of Dr. Jose Alvarez's claim, in accordance with section 776 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>One of the grounds alleged by the appellant is that the committee did not 
notify the administrator's lawyer of the day when Dr. Alvarez's claim dealt with 
in the additional report would be heard, and did not apprise Casimiro Natividad, 
the coadministrator, of the date and place of said hearing.</p>
<p>With reference to lack of notice to the administrator's attorney, we are of 
the opinion that the doctrine laid down in the case of Palad vs. Cui and 
Calatrava (28 Phil., 44), cited by the appellant, is not applicable to the case 
before us, which is governed rather by section 690 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure. This section provides that when the court decides to authorize the 
committee on claims to extend its session beyond the time formerly fixed, the 
parties are to be served with notice of the date and place of the hearing 
personally. The notice served on the coadministrator, Casimiro Natividad, by the 
committee recites that on January 26, 1929, it was sitting in extraordinary 
session at Tigaon, Camarines Sur, to hear Dr. Alvarez's claim, to which said 
coadministrator was cited to be present and hear or oppose the claim. But the 
latter did not respond to the call of the committee, alleging that he was 
awaiting instructions from his attorneys in Manila and from the other heirs. 
Therefore, the coadministrator, Casimiro Natividad, was notified of the place 
and date in which the claim of Dr. Alvarez was to be heard.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the decision of this case depends upon whether the 
coadministrator did or did not appeal from the committee's ruling allowing Dr. 
Alvarez's claim. In accordance with section 775 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 
it appears that the administrator has not technically appealed from the 
committee's ruling; but we incline to regard the motion filed on February 18, 
1929, as a substantial fulfillment of this provision, as it was filed fourteen 
days after the committee had submitted its additional report, and it manifests 
the appellant's dissatisfaction with the allowance of Dr. Alvarez's claim. And 
we are constrained to place this liberal interpretation upon section 775 in 
order to do justice to the parties, in view of the several irregularities we 
have noticed in the record on appeal with reference to the filing and allowance 
of Dr. Alvarez's claim. This claim was not presented during the ordinary session 
of the committee on claims and appraisals, but almost one year after this court 
had promulgated the judgment in the case of Natividad vs. Natividad, supra; 
coadministrator Casimiro Natividad was not given a reasonable time to object to 
the claim of Dr. Alvarez; and this claim was allowed by the committee without 
coadministrator Alfredo Natividad's making any effort to protect the interests 
of the estate against it, and without any further evidence than the sworn 
statement of the claimant himself, or Dr. Alvarez.</p>
<p>Wherefore, let the order of February 12, 1930, be set aside, and the record 
remanded to the court of origin in order to afford the parties an opportunity to 
thresh out the merits of the claim presented by the alleged creditor, Dr. 
Alvarez, in accordance with the provisions of section 776 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
