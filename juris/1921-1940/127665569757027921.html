				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 31, 1922, the decision of this court in the present case, affirming 
the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, was published, but 
the term of imprisonment imposed by the said court upon the accused, for a 
violation of the Election Law, defined and punished in section 2639 of the 
Administrative Code, was increased to six months from which judgment the present 
appeal was taken by the accused. The accused, after asking for a reconsideration 
of the said decision and a rehearing and pending the resolution on the said 
petition, filed a special motion on May 2d of this year, alleging that the crime 
complained of had prescribed under the provision of section 71 of Act No. 3030, 
enacted by the Legislature on March 9, 1922, and praying that they be absolved 
from the complaint. Upon this motion the Attorney-General was heard, having 
filed an answer and a supplemental answer, with the corresponding arguments, 
opposing the same, as well as the accused who filed their reply thereto and 
supplementary replies, both parties stating at length the reasons and legal 
grounds for their respective contentions.
<p>While it is a rule of general application that unless the defense of 
prescription is pleaded in the trial court, it will be deemed to have been 
waived and cannot later be raised, yet this rule is not of absolute application 
in criminal cases, for if the prescription of the crime, as well as of the 
penalty whereby criminal responsibility is extinguished, may, as is the case 
here with regard to the former, be provided by statute after the termination of 
all the proceedings in the trial court, as well as in the appellate court, and 
when the case has already been submitted for discussion and is awaiting only the 
final judgment; and if the prescription of the crime is but the extinguishment 
of the right of the State to prosecute and punish the culprit, it is beyond 
question that, once the State has lost or waived such right, the accused may, at 
any stage of the proceeding, ask and move that the same be dismissed and that he 
be absolved from the complaint. And not only that,â€”the right to prosecute and 
punish the criminal having been lost by the prescription of the crime expressly 
provided by the statute, the State itself, the Government through the proper 
court, is in duty bound to make a pronouncement to that effect. Therefore, as on 
March 9th of this year, 1922, when Act No. 3030 went into effect, providing in 
its section 71 that offenses resulting from the violations thereof shall 
prescribe one year after their commission, the accused and the Attorney-General 
had already filed their respective briefs in this court for the prosecution of 
the appeal taken from the judgment of the court below, and the hearing of the 
case had already been held, this court itself, without the necessity of any 
motion of the accused, or of the Attorney-General, should have declared the 
crime in question to have prescribed, in view of the provision of said section. 
Consequently, as this court had not up to that time made such pronouncement, the 
accused are perfectly justified in asking, as they have done in their motion of 
May 2d of this year, that the offense having prescribed, they be absolved from 
the complaint. This duty is imperative upon the courts of justice at any moment 
that the offense appears to have prescribed under the provision of the law. With 
particular reference to the present case, this conclusion is necessarily reached 
from the letter as well as the spirit of the provisions of the Penal Code 
relative to prescription, and from that of section 71 of the aforesaid Act No. 
3030, for once the offense or the penalty has prescribed, the State has no right 
to prosecute the offender, or to punish him, and if he has already been 
punished, it has no right to continue holding him subject to its action by the 
imposition of the penalty. The plain precept contained in article 22 of the 
Penal Code, declaring the retroactivity of penal laws in so far as they are 
favorable to persons accused of a felony or misdemeanor, even if they may be 
serving sentence, would be useless and nugatory if the courts of justice were 
not under obligation to fulfill such duty, irrespective of whether or not the 
accused has applied for it, just as would also all provisions relating to the 
prescription of the crime and the penalty.</p>
<p>That such is the duty of the courts of justice and has been so recognized by 
this court, is shown by the decision in the case of United States <i>vs</i>. 
Rama, R. G. No. 16247,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> for the crime of 
murder of four persons, committed in the month of July, 1902, in the province of 
Cebu, in which one of the accused was sentenced by the Court of First Instance 
of the said province to death and the other two to life imprisonment. That case 
was brought to this court on appeal and, after the filing of the respective 
briefs of the accused and the Attorney-General a hearing was had. No allegation 
was made as to the prescription of the crime, yet this court rendered a decision 
(not yet published in the Official Gazette) wherein, after finding that two 
crimes of murder and two of homicide had been committed and that seventeen years 
had already elapsed from the commission of the latter to the institution of the 
judicial proceeding for the investigation and punishment thereof, that is, more 
than the fifteen years fixed by law for the prescription of the crime of 
homicide, this court held that the said two crimes of homicide had prescribed 
and the criminal responsibility of the three accused for the said crimes 
extinguished, convicting the accused only of the two crimes of murder. There is, 
therefore, no reason whatsoever why the allegation of prescription made by the 
accused in their motion of the 2nd of May of this year cannot legally be 
considered; on the contrary, said motion must be decided before the petition for 
the reconsideration of the decision published on the 31st of March of last year, 
and for a rehearing of the case, or, to be more exact, the said petition must be 
ignored, for the resolution of the aforesaid motion, if favorable to the 
accused, would put an end to the proceeding right at its present stage.</p>
<p>The first question to be decided, in connection with the contention of the 
accused, is whether or not the prescription provided in section 71 of Act No. 
3030 refers only to that Act and not to any other, for said section 71 says: 
"Offenses resulting from violations of this Act shall prescribe one year after 
their commission," and section 72 adds: "This Act shall take effect on its 
approval."</p>
<p>It is enough to take into consideration the fact that Act No. 3030, is, as 
its title indicates, amendatory to several sections and parts of sections of 
chapter 18 of the Administrative Code, known as the Election Law, and of chapter 
65 on penalties for the violation of various administrative laws, among them, 
those of the Election Law itself, included in said chapter 18 of the 
Administrative Code, in order to understand that when the Legislature used the 
words "This Act," that is, Act No. 3030, it referred, necessarily, to the 
Election Law included in various sections and provisions of the aforesaid two 
chapters of the above-mentioned Code, that is, the Election Law prior to Act No. 
3030, under which the herein accused were convicted. One needs but examine one 
by one all the sections of said Act No. 3030, each of which declares the sense 
in which each of the sections included in said chapters is amended, in order to 
convince himself that said Act No. 3030 is similar to the law that preceded it, 
with the amendments and some additions thereto. If the Legislature had passed 
and enacted a new Election Law different from that contained in the 
above-mentioned chapters of the Administrative Code, then it may be said that 
the phrase "This Act" can in no way refer to the prior Election Law. 
Furthermore, if the offenses resulting from the violations of the Election Law, 
the provisions of which are contained in the aforesaid chapters of the 
Administrative Code, are the same offenses provided for in Act No. 3030, though 
with some modifications in the details as to some of them and with increase in 
the penalty, it cannot be denied that when the Legislature used the words "This 
Act" in section 71 of Act No. 3030, wherein it is provided that said offenses 
shall prescribe one year after their commission, it necessarily referred to 
offenses resulting from the violations of the former Election Law, as amended by 
said Act No. 3030. Besides, one of the objects of this Act, as its title 
indicates, is to make more effective the provisions and the purposes of the 
former Law contained in the Administrative Code; so that Act No. 3030 rather 
than being an integral part of the former election law is in conjunction with 
the latter the only Election Law in force; and any other interpretation to the 
contrary of the phrase "This Act" cannot, in our opinion, be accepted as good 
logic and in accordance with the principles of sound reasoning.</p>
<p>It is true that in the next section, 72, it is provided that said Act No. 
3030 shall take effect on the date of its approval, which took place on March 9, 
1922, but the meaning of such an expression in connection with prescription is 
that prescription can be invoked from that date, as was done by the accused, and 
not that such provision may have a retroactive effect from that same date.</p>
<p>In this connection, there arises the second question as to whether or not the 
provision of article 22 of the Penal Code above cited, declaring the 
retroactivity of penal laws in so far as they are favorable to the defendant in 
a criminal action for a felony or misdemeanor, is applicable to crimes penalized 
by special laws, as does Act No. 3030, account being taken of the fact that, 
under article 7 of the Penal Code, offenses punishable under special laws are 
not subject to the provisions of the said code.</p>
<p>Several decisions have been rendered by this court on this question in which 
the distinguished members of this court hold opposite views. Among those may be 
cited the case of United States <i>vs</i>. Cuna (12 Phil., 241), which is cited 
in a later case, United States <i>vs</i>. Lao Lock Hing (14 Phil., 86), in which 
case this court did not lay down a definite rule, but expressly reserved its 
opinion as to whether or not article 22 of the Penal Code above referred to was 
applicable. And it was so recognized by the Supreme Court of the United State's, 
in an appeal taken by writ of error by the accused, Ong Chang Wing (40 Phil., 
1046), said high court having limited itself to declaring that the accused, not 
having been convicted by this court of an offense which was not punishable when 
committed, and this court having held only that the right to impose the penalty 
prescribed by the Penal Code of the Philippines had not been lost by the 
subsequent statute, Act No. 1757, of the Philippine Commission, the accused had 
not been denied due process of law, for as the Supreme Court of the United 
States says in its decision, the duty of that court in that case was to 
determine whether or not the judgment of this court amounted to a denial of due 
process of law. Therefore, the decisions rendered in those two cases cannot be 
invoked in the one now before us.</p>
<p>In the cases of United States <i>vs</i>. Lao Lock Hing (14 Phil., 86) and 
United States <i>vs</i>. Calaguas (14 Phil., 739), cited also in support of the 
contrary opinion, as the offenses therein involved were penalized by special 
laws, that is, by the Opium Law, in the former, and by the Law of Police and 
Railroad Preservation, in the latter, this court held, as it could not have done 
otherwise, that, under article 7 of the Penal Code, the provisions of the said 
Code were not applicable to those offenses, inasmuch as said offenses were 
penalized by the said law which prescribed a special and definite penalty for 
said offenses, but in those cases said article 7 of the Penal Code was not 
interpreted in connection with the application of article 22 of the same Code, 
providing for the retroactivity of penal laws favorable to persons accused of a 
felony or misdemeanor. Wherefore neither can the holding of this court in those 
cases have any application to the one now before us.</p>
<p>The case in which this court plainly and definitely decided the question 
under consideration is that of United States <i>vs</i>. Parrone (24 Phil., 29). 
There the said accused was charged with the crime of falsification of a cedula 
certificate, defined and punished in section 55 of Act No. 1189 of the 
Philippine Commission, but before the conviction of the accused, said Act was 
amended by Act No. 2126 of the Philippine Legislature, which prescribed a lesser 
penalty than the previous Act, and this court, after a careful perusal of all 
its decisions dealing with that question, as above indicated, and a luminous and 
exhaustive discussion on the interpretation of article 7 of the same Code in 
connection with the retroactivity of the penalty, in so far as it is favorable 
to the accused, held, upon the appeal taken by the said accused from the 
judgment of the court below, that, under the provisions of article 22 of the 
Penal Code, the penalty provided in Act No. 2126, which was later than Act No. 
1189, was the proper penalty to be imposed upon the accused in that case. In the 
course of that decision, the court said:</p>
<p>"Considering the provisions of article 7 of the Penal Code, are the 
provisions of article 22 of the same Code applicable to the penal laws of the 
Philippine Islands other than the provisions of the Penal Code? Article 22 is 
found in chapter 1 of title 3 of the Penal Code. Said chapter is entitled 
'<i>Penalties in General</i>.' Article 21 of said title and chapter provides 
that 'no felony or misdemeanor shall be punishable by any penalty not 
<i>prescribed</i> by law prior to its commission.' This article is general in 
its provisions and <i>in effect prohibits the Government from punishing any 
person for any felony or misdemeanor with any penalty which has not been 
prescribed by the law</i>. It (art. 21), therefore, can have no application to 
any of the provisions of the Penal Code for the reason that for every felony or 
misdemeanor defined in the Penal Code a penalty has been prescribed.</p>
<p>"The provisions of article 21 can only be invoked, therefore, when a person 
is being tried for a <i>felony or a misdemeanor for which no penalty has been 
prescribed by law</i>. Article 21 is not a penal provision. It neither defines a 
crime nor provides a punishment for one. It has simply announced the policy of 
the Government with reference to the punishment of alleged criminal acts. It is 
a guaranty to the citizen of the State that no <i>act</i> of his will be 
considered criminal until after the Government has made it so by <i>law</i> and 
has provided a penalty. It (art. 21) is a declaration that no person shall be 
subject to criminal prosecution for any act of his until after the State has 
<i>defined</i> the <i>misdemeanor</i> or <i>crime</i> and has <i>fixed a penalty 
therefor</i>. The doctrine announced by this section has been considered of so 
much importance to the citizens of a State that many of the States of the Union 
have been pleased to include its precepts in their constitutions or have so 
declared by express provision of law.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Article 22 provides that 'Penal laws shall have a retroactive effect in so 
far as they favor the person guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, although at the 
time of the publication of such laws a final sentence has been pronounced and 
the convict is serving same.' This provision clearly has no direct application 
to the provisions of the Penal Code. Its (art. 22) application to the Penal Code 
can only be invoked where some former or subsequent law is under consideration. 
It must necessarily relate (1) to penal laws existing prior to the Penal Code, 
in which the penalty was less severe than those of the Penal Code; or (2) to 
laws enacted subsequent to the Penal Code, in which the penalty was more 
favorable to the accused. Rule 80, <i>Ley Provisional para la aplicacion de las 
disposiciones del Codigo Penal</i>. Under the provisions of said article 22, if 
a crime had been committed prior to the date of the Penal Code the punishment 
for which was more favorable to the accused than the provisions of the Penal 
Code, it is believed that the accused might invoke the provisions of said 
article (22) even though he was not placed upon trial until after the Penal Code 
went into effect. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Cuna<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>). So also if by an amendment to the Penal 
Code or by a later special law the punishment for an act was made less severe 
than by the provisions of the Penal Code, then the accused person might invoke 
the provisions of said article. It appears to be clear, then, that article 22 of 
the Penal Code can only be invoked when the provisions of some other penal law 
than the provisions of the Penal Code are under consideration. In other words, 
the provisions of article 22 can only be invoked with reference to some other 
penal law. It has no application to the provisions of the Penal Code except in 
relation with some other law. It is not believed, therefore, that the 
Legislature in enacting article 7 of the Penal Code intended to provide that 
article 22 should not be applicable to special laws."</p></blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt whatsoever that such was the intention of the 
legislator, in view of the doctrine laid down by the supreme court of Spain, 
whose authority as regards the application and interpretation of the provisions 
of the Penal Code of the Philippines is unquestionable, because said Code is the 
same as that of Spain. In two cases (decisions of July 13, 1889 and April 26, 
1892), among others decided by that court, in which article 22 of the Penal Code 
was alleged to have been violated by the imposition of the penalty of <i>prision 
correccional</i> prescribed by the said Code, instead of <i>prision menor</i>, 
prescribed by article 168 of the Election Law of August 30, 1870, upon the 
accused therein, who were found guilty of a violation of the said Election Law, 
which, was therefore, a special law in force prior to the said Penal Code of 
that same year, the said Code having substituted the penalty of <i>prision 
correccional</i> for that of <i>prision menor</i>, said court held that the 
appeal was not well taken on the ground that the penalty of <i>prision 
correccional</i> had taken the place of that of <i>prision menor</i> prescribed 
by the said Election Law, and while the duration of both penalties was the same, 
the correctional penalty was lighter and more advantageous and favorable to the 
accused than <i>prision menor</i>, as it was of a less grave nature; so that in 
those two cases, the supreme court of Spain not only applied the provisions of 
the Penal Code to a special law, but also gave retroactive effect to said 
provisions on account of being more favorable to the therein accused, in 
accordance with the precept of article 22 of the Penal Code. And here we have a 
most complete, clear and satisfactory solution of whatever doubt might have 
arisen as to the interpretation of articles 7 and 22 of the Penal Code 
aforesaid.</p>
<p>It cannot be maintained that said article 22 of the Penal Code refers only to 
penalties and is not applicable to appeals and proceedings, because the 
prescription of the crime is intimately connected with that of the penalty, for 
the length of time fixed by the law for the prescription depends upon the 
gravity of the offense, as may be seen from Title VI of Book I of the Penal 
Code, containing, as its heading indicates, "General Provisions Regarding 
Felonies and Misdemeanors, the Persons Liable and the Penalties," without 
distinguishing between the penalties and the extinguishment of the criminal 
responsibility dealt with in said Title VI of said Book, which title comes next 
to Title V, treating of the penalties incurred by those who evade service of 
sentence and those who, while serving sentence, or after having been convicted 
by a final judgment not yet served, commit some other crime. And aside from this 
intimate connection between the prescription of the crime and that of the 
penalty, a statute declaring the prescription of the crime has no other object 
and purpose than to prevent or annul the prosecution of the offender and, in the 
last analysis, the imposition of the penalty. Moreover, if the provisions 
relative to the prescription of ownership and to the prescription of actions in 
civil matters are part of the civil law, it cannot be denied that the provisions 
relative to the prescription of crimes and of penalties are penal laws or form 
part thereof.</p>
<p>With regard to the question whether prescription must be considered as a 
matter of procedural or formal law, or as a substantive law for the purpose of 
the retroactivity of laws, we must state, with reference to the present case, 
that the prescription provided in section 71 of Act No. 3030 is of the nature 
both of a substantive law, in so far as it gives a person accused of any of the 
crimes therein referred to, the right not to be prosecuted nor punished after 
the lapse of the period of one year from the commission of said crimes, within 
which the criminal action must be commenced, and of a procedural or adjective 
law in so far as it fixes the time within which such action must necessarily be 
commenced in order that the prosecution may be legal and the proper penalty may 
lawfully be imposed. But however said provision may be considered, the same must 
have a retroactive effect, as will be seen later on.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the instant case involves two special laws of the Philippine 
Legislature, to wit, the Election Law contained in the above-mentioned chapters 
of the Administrative Code, and Act No. 3030 which amended and modified the 
former, it is evident that the provision declaring that offenses resulting from 
the violations of said Act shall prescribe one year after their commission must 
have retroactive effect, the same being favorable to the accused.</p>
<p>This, however, is objected to, although it is based on a general principle 
frequently applied by many courts of the American Union, and in support of the 
objection, several decisions of the said courts and a doctrine concerning the 
matter found in Corpus Juris (volume 16, p. 222) and in Ruling Case Law are 
cited, wherein it is established that laws fixing a period of prescription are 
not applicable to crimes previously committed, unless by their terms they are 
clearly retroactive or contain an express provision to that effect.</p>
<p>We need not discuss each and every one of the said cases, it being sufficient 
for our purpose to take up one of them, namely, that of Martin <i>vs</i>. State 
([1859], 24 Tex., 62). There the Supreme Court of Texas held that as regards 
crimes and misdemeanors, prescription had no retroactive effect and that the 
Statute of Limitations enacted in 1854 could not have the effect of barring a 
criminal action instituted within two years after the enactment of said Act, 
provided that no period of prescription was fixed in a former law for the crime 
in question, that is to say, that prescription cannot be invoked as a bar to a 
criminal action for an offense like that of falsification involved in that case, 
where said action was commenced under a statute authorizing it and in the old 
law penalizing that crime no period was fixed for the prescription thereof. As 
can be seen from a reading of the context of the decision in the aforesaid case 
and the opinion of the writer thereof, said doctrine was announced without 
taking into account the difference between the rule governing prescription in 
criminal procedure and that applicable to civil actions, but, on the contrary, 
application was made only of the latter; hence the holding that a special 
provision as to prescription was necessary in the later statute to give it a 
retroactive effect.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the Chief Justice of that Supreme Court 
voted vigorously against the said decision, stating in a well-reasoned 
dissenting opinion the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I * * * am of opinion, that the limitation prescribed to prosecutions 
applies as well to prosecutions for offenses, committed before the passage of 
the statute, as afterwards; and that, as the words of the statute plainly 
import, the limitation commences to run from the time of the 'commission of the 
offense,' whether that was before or after its passage. The statute makes no 
distinction, as respects the limitation; it makes no exception, from its 
provision, of offenses previously committed; and I know of no principle, or rule 
of construction, which will authorize the court to engraft an exception upon the 
statute. It is a statute relating to the remedy, and being enacted for the 
benefit of persons accused, is not an <i>ex post facto</i> law. The 
constitutional inhibition of the enactment of retroactive laws, and laws 
impairing the obligation of contracts, has no application to penal statutes. 
Retroactive criminal laws, which are forbidden, are those which come under the 
denomination of <i>ex post facto</i> laws. There is nothing to prevent statutes, 
respecting crimes, from being retrospective, provided they do not come under 
that denomination.</p>
<p>"It is an acknowledged general rule, in the construction of statutes, that 
they will not be construed to have a retrospective operation so as to destroy or 
impair rights of property, or of action, unless the legislature have plainly 
expressed such to be their intention. But laws which affect the remedy merely 
are not held to be within the rule or the inhibition against retrospective laws, 
unless the remedy be entirely taken away, or so restricted, as to impair the 
right. Nor, as I conceive, do statutes relating to the punishment of offenses 
come within the rule of construction, or the constitutional inhibition, though 
their effect should be wholly to defeat a prosecution. On the contrary, laws 
respecting crimes, whether they relate to the remedy merely, or to the offense, 
are, I think, always construed to relate to past, as well as future offenses, 
where their operation is in any wise beneficial to the accused; unless the 
legislature have plainly declared that they are not to receive such a 
construction. To give such effect to laws respecting crimes and punishments, is 
not to render them retrospective, or retroactive laws, in the sense of the 
constitutional inhibition. These terms have no application to such laws, but 
relate exclusively to laws affecting civil rights. (De Cordova <i>vs</i>. City 
of Galveston, 4 Tex., 470.)</p>
<p>"I do not think the reservation contained in the 81st section of the act was 
intended to have, or should be construed to have, any effect upon the limitation 
contained in the 75th section. That section was intended only to prevent repeals 
by implication, and to enforce the observance of the rule, which would have 
applied on general principles, without its enactment, that where the act 
mitigates the punishment, the milder penalty should be imposed. To hold it to 
apply to the limitation prescribed for prosecutions by the act, would be to 
except all offenses committed before the passage of the act, from the operation 
of the periods of limitation therein contained, and to hold that those offenses 
would never become barred under its provisions. I cannot think that such was the 
intention of the legislature.</p>
<p>"There may be differences of opinion, respecting the policy of prescribing so 
short periods of limitation, to prosecutions for high crimes. But that was a 
question for the law-making power; and I can see no reason why the legislature 
should have intended the limitation to apply to future, and not to past, 
offenses. The same reasons, and the same policy, which dictated that the 
prosecution should be commenced within a prescribed period, after the offense 
was committed, would seem to apply equally to offenses committed before, as to 
those committed after the passage of the statute.</p>
<p>"Entertaining these views, I could not give my assent to the imposition of 
the pains and penalties of the law, where the prosecution had not been commenced 
until after the expiration of the time within which the legislature have 
positively enacted that the offense 'shall be prosecuted,' or be forever 
barred."</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Wharton, cited in one paragraph of the said dissenting 
opinion, in his work entitled Criminal Pleading and Practice, 9th edition, 1889, 
says that, as a general rule, the laws of prescription of actions apply as well 
to crimes committed before the enactment, as afterwards, and speaking of the 
rule to be applied to the prescription of actions and the interpretation of the 
laws on that subject, he says in section 316, page 215, of said book the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We should at first observe that a mistake is sometimes made in applying to 
statutes of limitation in criminal suits the construction that has been given to 
statutes of limitation in civil suits. The two classes of statutes, however, are 
essentially different. In civil suits the statute is interposed by the 
legislature as an impartial arbiter between two contending parties. In the 
construction of the statute, therefore, there is no intendment to be made in 
favor of either party. Neither grants the right to the other; there is therefore 
no grantor against whom the ordinary presumptions of construction are to be 
made. But it is otherwise when a statute of limitation is granted by the State. 
Here the State is the grantor, surrendering by act of grace its rights to 
prosecute, and declaring the offense to be no longer the subject of prosecution. 
The statute is not a statute of process, to be scantily and grudgingly applied, 
but an amnesty, declaring that after a certain time oblivion shall be cast over 
the offence; that the offender shall be at liberty to return to his country, and 
resume his immunities as a citizen; and that from henceforth he may cease to 
preserve the proofs of his innocence, for the proofs of his guilt are blotted 
out. Hence it is that statutes of limitation are to be liberally construed in 
favor of the defendant, not only because such liberality of construction belongs 
to all acts of amnesty and grace, but because the very existence of the statute 
is a recognition and notification by the legislature of the fact that time, 
while it gradually wears out proofs of innocence, has assigned to it fixed and 
positive periods in which it destroys proofs of guilt. Independently of these 
views, it must be remembered that delay in instituting prosecutions is not only 
productive of expense to the State, but of peril to public justice in the 
attenuation and distortion, even by mere natural lapse of memory, of testimony. 
It is the policy of the law that prosecutions should. be prompt, and that 
statutes enforcing such promptitude should be vigorously maintained. They are 
not merely acts of grace, but checks imposed by the State upon itself, to exact 
vigilant activity from its subalterns, and to secure for criminal trials the 
best evidence that can be obtained."</p></blockquote>
<p>But even if the rule generally and frequently applied by many courts of the 
American Union and the doctrine laid down by them were those announced in the 
above-mentioned paragraphs of the Corpus Juris and the Ruling Case Law, the 
precept of article 22 of the Penal Code being clear and unmistakable, according 
to which, penal laws have retroactive effect in so far as they are favorable to 
persons accused of a felony or misdemeanor, the courts of justice of these 
Islands cannot, and must not, make any application of the said rule and 
doctrine, but must, on the contrary, abide by the said precept and comply with 
it and carry it into effect, as hereinbefore stated, although no petition to 
that effect is made by the accused that may be favored by those laws. And a 
provision for the retroactivity of penal laws having, as it has, been made in 
the said article in the terms already mentioned, it is evident that when the 
Philippine Legislature, the majority of whose members are also members of the 
Philippine Bar, and, therefore, were aware of this legal provision, drew section 
71 of the Election Law, Act No. 3030, to the effect that the offenses resulting 
from the violations of the said law prescribe one year after their commission, 
it ought to have known that it was not necessary for it to say that said 
provision was to have retroactive effect in so far as it was favorable to the 
accused, inasmuch as such provision had already expressly been made in article 
22 of the Penal Code, which was applicable not only to the prescription therein 
provided when the same might be favorable to persons accused of those crimes, 
but also to every penal law the retroactivity of which might be favorable to 
persons accused of a felony or misdemeanor. And, this is the best and most 
conclusive proof that in making the provision in section 71 aforecited, the 
Legislature intended that same be given a retroactive effect, because the 
members thereof could not ignore the law. From all of which it also necessarily 
follows that, if that doctrine established by many courts of the metropolis is 
to be applied in the instant case, it must be by saying that the same is useless 
or that it was complied with in so far as the giving of a retroactive effect to 
the said prescription was concerned, because that provision regarding 
retroactivity has already been expressly made in article 22 of the Penal Code, 
and, therefore, it is of no importance that in the former Election Law, that is, 
the amended law, no provision was made regarding prescription to give immediate 
and full effect to the retroactivity provided in section 71 of Act No. 3030. The 
provision of article 22 of the Penal Code, declaring the retroactivity of laws 
favorable to persons accused of a felony or misdemeanor, is to be deemed as if 
also expressly made in any new law at the time of its enactment, when said law 
is a penal law, or one of a penal character, such as the prescription contained 
in section 71 of Act No. 3030 here in question, which is of that nature, as 
above stated, and there is no necessity of making in that law any provisions to 
that same effect. And this is the reason why in the case of Pardo de Tavera 
<i>vs</i>. Garcia Valdez, one of the first cases in the Philippine Jurisprudence 
(1 Phil., 468) in which, the question, among others, was raised whether the 
defendant, who was accused of grave insult defined and punished in paragraph 1, 
article 458, of the Penal Code, should be punished under said article, or under 
the provisions of Act No. 277, which is the Libel Law and went into effect after 
the publication of the libelous article and the institution of the criminal 
action, the court held, as stated in the syllabus, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The general rule that penal laws shall be retroactive in so far as they 
favor the accused has no application where the later law is expressly made 
inapplicable to pending actions or existing causes of action," which clearly 
means that in order for a penal statute favorable to the accused to have a 
retroactive effect, it is not necessary that it be so expressly provided in the 
statutes, or, to put it in another way, that the provision declaring the 
retroactivity be repeated therein, but that if the Legislature intends it not to 
have a retroactive effect, it should expressly so state in the same statute. And 
the reason for it is obvious. For it being the general rule, according to 
article 22 of the Penal Code, that penal laws have retroactive effect in so far 
as they favor the accused, said general rule applies to, all laws that may be 
enacted in the future, and if the Legislature intends to make an exception to 
the said rule, it should expressly say so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the eminent professor of International Law, Mr. Fiore, in his work on 
the Irretroactivity and Interpretation of Statutes, which is termed by various 
eminent jurists "a work full of juridical science," after recognizing as a rule 
universally accepted by the courts and expressly sanctioned by most of modern 
legislations that no penal law can have any retroactive effect, that is, that no 
action or omission shall be held to be a crime, nor its author punished, except 
by virtue of a law in force at the time the act was committed, advocates the 
retroactivity of a penal law favorable to the offender, not as a right of the 
latter, but founded on the very principles on which the right of the State to 
punish and the commination of the penalty are based, and regards it not as an 
exception based on political considerations, but as a rule founded on principles 
of strict justice.</p>
<p>The same author, on studying the questions that may arise in case the new law 
should have changed the rules regarding prescription, that is to say, the 
retroactivity of the law as to prescription, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The modifications as to prescription introduced by the new law may affect 
the penal action or the penalty itself. With respect to the former, it can be 
imagined that the new law has modified the rules as to the applicability or 
inapplicability of the prescription to a given crime, or the necessary 
conditions for its effectiveness, or, finally, the time and period when it will 
have effect.</p>
<p>"The authors who had studied this question have reached different 
conclusions, because some have considered prescription as a law of procedure or 
of form, while others have regarded it as a substantive law, thereby admitting, 
therefore, the principle of vested right on the part of the offender.</p>
<p>"Those who have considered the statutes of limitations as of a formal or 
remedial nature have maintained the opinion that the new law must always be 
applied in all cases of prescription where the period was already running at the 
time of the enactment of the new law on the ground that all procedural laws must 
be deemed retroactive by nature. Against this theory, however, it has been said 
that even admitting the principle enunciated, the truth is that the culprit 
cannot be placed in a worse situation, as would be the case if that theory is 
adopted, for although the prescription begun under the former law, fixing a 
shorter period, might have been completed, he would be subject to criminal 
action under the new law prescribing a longer term, even if the provisions of 
the latter, concerning the substance of the penal action, were not in force at 
the time of the commission of the crime. Again, setting aside the theory of 
vested right on the part of the accused, as we have already done (for we cannot 
admit any vested right on the part of a private individual as against that which 
is considered by the sovereign power as indispensable for maintaining the 
juridical order), it can, however, be maintained that the application of the new 
law about the prescription of the criminal action, when said law has extended 
the time of the prescription, is tantamount to giving that penal law a 
retroactive effect, as regards the very substance of punishment, thus 
prejudicing the offender and admitting, as to him, a right to punish, which, on 
account of the longer period fixed in the new law, cannot be considered as based 
on any law in force and already promulgated at the time of the commission of the 
crime.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, those who have considered prescription as a substantive 
law hold that the old law should always be applied, the principal reason adduced 
by them in support of this opinion being that the accused must at all events 
suffer the consequences of the situation created by himself by committing the 
crime. Against this opinion, it has been held, however, that the consideration 
of public policy, which naturally prevails in matters of prescription, 
constitutes an obstacle to the invariable application of the old law, for if the 
new law is less severe as regards prescription, the result would be that the 
culprit would be subject to the more severe law, which has been modified in 
harmony with the more modern criteria sanctioned by the new law as more in 
consonance with justice.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"To our mind, in accordance with the principles underlying all the foregoing 
theories regarding the retroactivity of a less severe penal law, it must be 
admitted that also when the question is one of prescription must the new law be 
considered retroactive if it is more favorable to the accused than the former 
law, and that contrariwise it should not be so considered, if it is found to be 
more prejudicial Although we are maintaining this opinion, we do not thereby 
accept the unjustified theory above set forth of those who believe that there 
must be admitted here the supposed vested right on the part of the offender, for 
we have already stated the reason why no such vested right can be recognized as 
against the penalty provided by law. On the contrary, we admit this theory, but 
founded on the principles of justice itself upon which the right to punish, 
considered as a supreme right of sovereignty, rests.</p>
<p>"In fact, where the new law has shortened the time of prescription or 
established easier conditions for its effectiveness with respect to a given 
crime, it is clear that the reduction of the period made in the new law implies 
an acknowledgment on the part of the sovereign power that the greater severity 
of the provision of the former statute relative to the substance of the criminal 
action is unjust.</p>
<p>"Consequently, if the sovereign power should enforce its right under the 
former law it would be guilty of an inconsistency in view of its implied 
admission that the old law was too severe and consequently unjust. The necessity 
therefore of applying the less severe new law rests upon the principle that the 
sovereign power cannot exercise its right to punish except only within those 
limits of justice which that sovereign power has established as being just and 
equitable at the time of exercising that right.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, when the latter statute of limitations of criminal 
actions is more severe than the former, either as to the applicability of the 
prescription itself, or as to the requirements and duration of the action, the 
application of the said law to crimes committed before its enactment must be 
avoided not because the culprit has acquired any right to prevent said 
application, but for the reasons above set out. Indeed, on what ground can the 
culprit pretend to prevent the sovereign power from doing what it has the right 
to do for the purpose of maintaining the juridical order? There exists, 
therefore, no reason in support of the theory of vested right on the part of the 
culprit, but what must inevitably be admitted is that the sovereign power 
cannot, without doing an injustice, apply the more severe legal provision in the 
matter of prescription; and that that provision cannot justly be applied unless 
it was previously promulgated, as even the right itself to punish cannot come 
into existence except by virtue of a law duly promulgated and in force at the 
time that it was violated and the crime committed. The more severe law in matter 
of prescription extends the field of criminal action and affects the substance 
of the same, because it determines the basis and the sphere of the right to 
punish. Now, can the sovereign power do all this without any law? Can it, 
without committing an injustice, extend the effect of the new law to acts 
committed before its enactment? As the sovereign power cannot punish any act not 
expressly penalized by a former law, nor punish with a more severe penalty any 
act performed before said penalty was prescribed and the law fixing it 
promulgated, so it cannot extend the criminal action (that is, its right to 
punish) by virtue of a later law by applying to acts completed before its 
promulgation the less favorable provisions therein made regarding prescription. 
In fact, in any case where reduction of the time of prescription formerly fixed 
is to be made under a new law, or where harder conditions are required by the 
said law for effectively taking advantage of the prescription, the sovereign 
power is exercising the right to punish acts committed prior to the promulgation 
of the new law, and it is evident that no such right can be recognized in the 
sovereign power.</p>
<p>"From all of the foregoing, we conclude that upon the very principles of 
justice, under which the less severe provisions of the new law must regulate all 
the elements of the criminal action, said less severe new law must also control 
the matter of prescription, provided that there is no final and irrevocable 
judgment, and this rule holds good even if the modifications of the statute have 
reference to the prescription of the penalty, because in substance the 
prescription of the penalty is equivalent to the prescription of the criminal 
action." (Fiore, pages 423-428.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Wharton gives a clear explanation of the distinction to be made between the 
construction of prescription in criminal actions and that of prescription in 
civil cases in the paragraph above quoted from his book, and the grounds for the 
distinction are also clear and are not unknown to anybody, for, as Wharton says, 
they are inherent in the origin and nature itself of the law of prescription, 
which must be .liberally construed in favor of the accused for if prescription 
in criminal matters is, as said author says, a benefit, a grace granted by the 
State, and a waiver of its right to prosecute and an announcement that the crime 
is no longer the subject of prosecution, from the moment that the granting of 
that grace or benefit, or the making of such waiver, is known, the prosecution 
for the said crime and the punishment of the offender would be a juridical 
contradiction.</p>
<p>But the opinions discussed by Fiore in his book above-mentioned are more in 
point, for he refers precisely to the prescription provided in a later statute 
the subject of which is the criminal action or the penalty, that is, the 
prescription of the crime, as is the case now before us, or the prescription of 
the penalty, whether prescription be regarded as a law of procedure or of form, 
or as a substantive law.</p>
<p>After examining the different opinions of the writers on the matter, Fiore 
has come, as seen from the above quotation, to the conclusion that, whether the 
statutes relative to prescription be considered as of a procedural or formal, or 
substantive, nature, the new statute must be applied if it is less severe or 
more favorable to the accused, but not if it is more prejudicial, 
notwithstanding the general rule that all procedural laws are retroactive in 
regard to prescription. In view of the special motion filed by the accused on 
May 2, 1922, it does not matter and it is of no importance, so far as the 
question herein raised is concerned, whether the provision contained in section 
71 of Act No. 3030 be considered as of a substantive, procedural, or adjective 
character, because applying the principles above enunciated, the result is the 
same, and the more severe law in the matter of prescription extends, as Fiore 
says, the field of the criminal action and affects the very substance thereof, 
because it determines the basis and the sphere of the right to punish.</p>
<p>It may, perhaps, be argued that no term having been fixed in the Election Law 
prior to Act No. 3030 for the prescription of the offenses resulting from the 
violations thereof, and said Act No. 3030 having fixed at one year the period 
for the prescription, the former law is more lenient, less severe, and more 
favorable to the persons accused of those offenses than the latter. Such an 
argument, however, is absolutely erroneous and untenable, if it is borne in mind 
that no period of prescription having been fixed in the former law, those 
offenses were imprescriptible, and the offender could be prosecuted and punished 
at any time and indefinitely, even ten, twenty, or more years after the 
commission thereof, whereas the new law, that is, Act No. 3030 in providing the 
period of one year for the prescription, has, in effect, shortened the time of 
prescription fixed in the old law by virtue of the silence thereof, reducing it 
to one year and has established less difficult conditions for the application of 
the same as regards those offenses, which is evidently more favorable and 
lenient to the violators of the said former law, and, as Fiore says in one of 
the paragraphs above quoted from his book, the reduction made by the new law 
implies a recognition on the part of the sovereign power that the greater 
severity of the former law, as regards the substance of the criminal action, is 
unjust, and it would contradict itself if it would attempt to enforce its right 
under the conditions of the former law which has already been regarded by the 
conscientious public opinion as juridically burdensome, and, therefore, unjust, 
and the sovereign power cannot exercise the right to punish except within the 
limits regarded by it as just at the time of exercising it.</p>
<p>If, therefore, in reviewing the former Election Law contained in the two 
chapters of the Administrative Code herein before mentioned, for the purpose of 
amending and reforming it in accordance with the dictates of reason, justice and 
experience, the Legislature did amend and reform it by the enactment of Act No. 
3030, which supplied the deficiency found in the old law with regard to the 
prescription of the crimes penalized therein, by providing in section 71 of Act 
No. 3030 that those crimes, which under the old law were imprescriptible, shall 
prescribe one year after their commission, because their imprescriptibility was 
considered by the conscientious public opinion as juridically burdensome, and, 
therefore, unjust, it is evident that the State, the Government and the courts 
of justice representing it, cannot, without committing a gross injustice, 
exercise the right to prosecute and punish the violator of the old law under the 
conditions required by the law and outside of the limits now regarded by the 
sovereign power, that is to say, the Legislature, as just by the enactment of 
said Act No. 3030, which took effect on March 9, 1922. And such injustice would 
be more apparent still, if the violators of the old Election Law, which was 
amended by Act No. 3030, would be prosecuted and convicted five, ten, twenty, or 
more years after the said violations when the proof of their innocence may not 
have been kept by them, while the violators of Act No. 3030, who may not have 
been prosecuted within the one year fixed by section 71 aforesaid, would be free 
from being prosecuted and punished for the crimes committed by them. And this 
injustice, which is so contrary to conscientious public opinion and repugnant to 
humane sentiments, would necessarily result, if the provisions of section 71 of 
Act No. 3030, which is now in force, are not immediately applied right at this 
stage of the case in favor of the herein accused, by taking up first the special 
motion of the accused filed on May 2d of this year, before the petition for 
reconsideration and re-hearing hereinbefore mentioned, or, better, by ignoring 
the said petition and disposing of the case by deciding the motion of May 2d, 
wherein the accused invoked the prescription provided an the said section, for 
the reason that this action was commenced on December 20, 1920, one year and a 
half after the commission of the offense resulting from the violation of the 
Election Law with which they are charged.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we find the said crime to have prescribed, and 
setting aside the decision of this court published on the 31st of March of this 
year, the present action is dismissed with all the costs <i>de oficio</i>, and 
the bond given by the accused for their provisional release is cancelled, which 
release is hereby declared final. So ordered.</p><i>Street, AvanceÃ±a,

<p>The high respect which I entertain for the authors of the majority opinions

am strongly of the opinion that judgments grounded in a mistaken view of the law 
are being handed down. My desire to state clearly and bluntly my dissent from 
the majority opinions is only bounded by the paucity of the English language in 
which to express myself. According to my view, as will hereafter be 
demonstrated, the majority decisions discuss questions which need no discussion, 
do violence to plain provisions of the law, take stands supported by no 
authority which can be discovered, and attain the result of effectuating a 
general jail delivery of criminals who had thwarted the people's will during the 
elections in 1919.</p>
<p>An introductory and pertinent inquiry can well be, what is the effect of the 
majority decisions?</p>
<p>Juan Moran, Fructuoso Cansino, and Hilario Oda, election inspectors of the 
first precinct of the municipality of Binalonan, Pangasinan, were found guilty 
by Judge of First Instance Nepomuceno and again on appeal by the Supreme Court, 
with the sole modification that the penalty was increased, of having falsified 
election returns.â€”But Moran, Cansino, and Oda will now never enter the portals 
of prison.</p>
<p>Raymundo Verceles, election inspector of the fifth precinct of the 
municipality of Binalonan, Pangasinan, was found guilty by Judge of First 
Instance Nepomuceno, and again on appeal by the Supreme Court, with the sole 
modification that the penalty was increased, of having falsified election 
returns, and is now serving his sentence.â€”Verceles will now be liberated.</p>
<p>Norberto Parel and Daniel Paz, election inspectors of the second precinct of 
the municipality of Bantay, Ilocos Sur, were found guilty by Judge of First 
Instance Jaranilla, of having unlawfully written the ballots of illiterate 
persons, with the result that following the trial in an election contest, the 
protestant was declared elected.â€”But though the two cases are on the calendar, 
the motion to dismiss being granted, the question of the guilt or innocence of 
Parel and Paz will never be determined by the appellate court.</p>
<p>Andres Imzon, chief of police of the municipality of San Pedro, Laguna, was 
charged in the Court of First Instance of Laguna, with having, unlawfully 
intervened in the elections of 1919, by soliciting votes in the election booths 
and exchanging ballots previously prepared by him with those received by the 
electors from the election board; Claudio de Leon and Alejandro Cailao, election 
inspectors of the second precinct of the municipality of Bay, Laguna, were 
charged with having seized and destroyed fifty official ballots already filled 
in by different persons; and Alejandro Cailao, election inspector of the second 
precinct of the municipality of Bay, Laguna, was charged with having abstracted 
four official ballots duly filled in from the ballot box and having delivered 
them to Julian Carrillo, a candidate for municipal president.â€”But Imzon, De 
Leon, Cailao, and Carrillo will never have these serious charges resolved by the 
courts of justice.</p>
<p>Francisco Hutalla, Jacinto Alfajora, and Hermogenes Orijuela, election 
inspectors in the first precinct of Macalelon, Tayabas, and Francisco Catarroja, 
election inspector in the second precinct of the same municipality, were charged 
with various unlawful acts intended to secure a victory for Demetrio PandeÃ±o, 
their candidate for municipal president.â€”But Hutalla, Alfajora, Orijuela, and 
Catarroja, will now have this record stand without any judicial decision as to 
their guilt or innocence.</p>
<p>Mariano QuiloÃ±a, Bartolome Severo, and Matias Operario, election inspectors 
of the municipality of San Julian, Samar, were found guilty by Judge of First 
Instance Capistrano of having falsified the election returns.â€”But though the 
guilt of QuiloÃ±a, Severo, and Operario is clearly apparent, the appeal in this 
court cannot go forward and they are absolved from the criminal charges.</p>
<p>Liberato Exaltacion, municipal president of Meycawayan, Bulacan, was 
convicted of having extracted ballots from the urn used in Meycawayan, and was 
sentenced by Judge of First Instance Jocson to three months' imprisonment, and 
to pay a fine of P125.â€”But Exaltacion, although thus found guilty by a judge of 
long experience, of a most serious crime, will now be exonerated.</p>
<p>Cesareo Navarrete, Ambrosio Diapo, Luciano Nabaira, Eugenio Nabor, Apolonio 
Castro, Mamerto Navarra, Estanislao Nabor, Tolomeo Segovia, Aproniano Navarrete, 
Hipolito Nalangan, Ricardo Nahil, and Severino Nalangan, residents of the 
municipality of Libacao, Capiz, were found guilty by Judge of First Instance 
Salas of having provoked such tumult and confusion in and about the second 
election precinct of the municipality of Libacao, that the election inspectors 
and policemen were prevented from performing their respective duties, and of 
having seized the ballot boxes and other election effects, thus frustrating the 
election in that precinct.â€”But all these twelve persons found guilty by the 
trial court, and guilty, also, as we read the record, will escape the penalties 
of the law.</p>
<p>Twelve (12) cases pending in this court relating to thirty (30) defendants 
are thus seen to involve the retroactivity of section 71 of Act No. 3030. 
According to the revised figures reported by the Attorney-General, the outcome 
of at least twenty (20) cases in courts of first instance relating to sixty-one 
(61) defendants likewise depend on our decision on this question. <i>All told, 
thirty-two (32) cases and ninety-one (91) defendants. Quite a respectable jail 
delivery</i>.</p>
<p>The point next in logical order, to which I would address attention, is 
whether the question of the retroactivity of Act No. 3030 is properly and 
legally before the court.</p>
<p>The status of the Moran case is of particular interest. Recallâ€”Appeal 
perfected and four errors assigned, but naturally not including the point of 
prescription under Act No. 3030, for the very good reason that the Act was not 
yet on the statute books. Act No. 3030 enacted and effective on March 9, 1922. 
Case submitted, and judgment of Supreme Court rendered on March 31, 1922. Motion 
of reconsideration filed by the attorney for the appellants, within the regular 
fifteen-day period, based on two counts, but again not including the point of 
prescription, although Act No. 3030 was then in force. Not until May 2, 1922, 
that is, <i>not until two months after judgment was rendered</i>, when a third 
motion, which the Chief Justice is pleased to call a "special motion," was 
presented, was the contention made that the alleged crime had prescribed in 
accordance with section 71 of Act No. 3030.</p>
<p>The Chief Justice finds no difficulty in surmounting these obstacles, 
although the constant practice of the court has been not to allow new and 
original questions to be presented for the first time on a motion for rehearing; 
although the court has consistently required that all arguments be advanced in 
one motion of reconsideration, and although the Rules of the Court are explicit 
and mandatory, when they provide that "judgment shall not be entered until ten 
days after * * * publication," that "five days after entry of judgment the clerk 
shall remand the case to the lower court," and that "<i>applications for a 
rehearing shall be * * * filed within fifteen days after the publication of the 
decision of the court</i>." (Note U. S. <i>vs</i>. Serapio [1912], 23 Phil., 
584; Lucido and Lucido <i>vs</i>. Vita [1911], 20 Phil., 449; Espidol <i>vs</i>. 
Espidol and Espidol [1913], 25 Phil., 4; Rules of the Supreme Court of the 
Philippines, 33, 34, 35; 4 C. J., pp. 629, 642.)</p>
<p>Conceding, however, that as to all these preliminary matters the majority are 
right, and I am wrong, I am yet ready to meet them on their own ground and am 
prepared to prove that the provisions of section 71 of Act No. 3030 approved 
March 9, 1922, providing that "Offenses resulting from violations of this Act 
shall prescribe one year after their commission," should not, and cannot be 
given retroactive effect, if the law is to be followed and justice is to be 
done. The importance of the subject will serve as an apology for a lengthy and 
serious consideration of the question above stated.</p>
<p>Act No. 3030 of the Philippine Legislature is entitled, "An Act to amend 
certain sections and parts of sections of chapter eighteen, known as the 
Election Law, and chapter sixty-five, on penalties for violations of certain 
administrative laws, of Act Numbered Twenty-seven hundred and eleven, entitled 
'An Act amending the Administrative Code,' to make more effective the provisions 
and purposes of said Election Law, and for other purposes." The first seventy 
sections of Act No. 3030 amend specifically named sections of the Administrative 
Code "to read as follows." Then follows section 71 above quoted. The Act 
concludes with section 72 reading: "<i>This Act</i> shall take effect on its 
approval." The Act was approved on March 9, 1922.</p>
<p>The first duty of the courts is to apply the law. The last duty of the courts 
is to interpret or construe the law. When, therefore, the Philippine Legislature 
said that "Offenses resulting from violations of <i>this Act</i> shall prescribe 
one year after their commission," it meant exactly what it said, and the only 
duty of the court is to make effective the legislative language. "<i>This 
Act</i>" could mean only Act No. 3030. Judicial interpretation or construction 
are consequently impertinent and offensive in the face of the plain words used 
by the Legislature.</p>
<p>It has, however, been suggested, that "this Act" means "the Election Law as 
amended." Even if this proposition be conceded, yet it remains true that the 
amendatory Act will not be given a retrospective construction; the new 
provisions are to be understood as enacted at the time the amended act takes 
effect. (36 Cyc., 1223.) In this instance section 72 says that "<i>This Act</i> 
(No. 3030) shall take effect on its approval"â€”on March 9, 1922.</p>
<p>It should be observed in relation to what has just been said with regard to 
the appropriateness of merely applying the law, that <i>there is nothing in 
section 71, or in any other section of Act No. 3030, which would authorize a 
retrospective construction. Not one word which even squints at a retroactive 
effect can be found in Act No. 3030</i>. If the Philippine Legislature had 
intended that Act No. 3030 should apply to pending cases, it could easily have 
used language to this effect; as for example, "Offenses heretofore committed," 
etc. Not having done so, the courts cannot write such words into the law without 
usurping legislative prerogatives.</p>
<p>It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction, so elementary that I 
hesitate to repeat it, that if the courts find it impossible to apply the law, 
then their duty is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
law-making body. Here, the intention of the Philippine Legislature is 
self-evident. The various sections of Act No. 3030 were carefully drafted to 
close up the loopholes in the old Election Law and to provide more severe 
penalties. The purpose of the Legislature, as announced in the title of the law, 
is, in part, "to make more effective the provisions and purposes of said 
Election Law." <i>It would be a strange interpretation indeed, which would 
attain the result, in a law of this character, of liberating criminals convicted 
at the time the law went into effect, when the Legislature intended to provide 
more effectively for cleaner elections</i>.</p>
<p>With strong reluctance, therefore, am I led away from the firm ground on 
which my feet are planted, when we simply apply the law and effectuate 
legislative intention, to follow strange and treacherous bypaths. That I do so 
is because of the energy with which these arguments have been pressed by counsel 
and out of respect to the point of view of colleagues in the Court.</p>
<p>The majority say that "Both consistency and sound legal principles, * * * 
demand that we, in this case, seek our precedents in Latin rather than in 
American jurisprudence." I had thought that the Philippines was under American 
sovereignty and that the Election Law was an American importation. But 
apparently I have been mistaken. As, however, the majority with "consistency" 
cite Wharton, an American authority, possibly, also, I may be pardoned if I use 
the same authority and give some prominence to the American precedents.</p>
<p>Mr. Wharton, in his treatise on Criminal Pleading and Practice (9th ed., 
1889) announces the following doctrine: "As a rule, statutes of limitation apply 
to offences perpetrated before the passage of the statute as well as to 
subsequent offences." (P. 219.) The cases cited in support of the text are found 
on examination to be early Federal cases relating to the 32d section of the Act 
of Congress of April 30, 1790. The contention there denied was "that an act of 
limitations to criminal prosecutions can only be used as a bar in cases declared 
by law to be criminal at the time the act of limitations was passed, unless 
there be express words extending it to crimes to be created in future." 
(<i>See</i> Adams <i>vs</i>. Woods [1805], 2 Cranch, 336.)</p>
<p>Corpus Juris (published in 1918), which the majority decisions avoid 
mentioning1, is authority for a different statement of the rule, under the 
subject "Limitation of Prosecutions in Criminal Cases," namely: "Such statutes 
are to be given a reasonably strict construction in favor of accused and against 
the prosecution. <i>By the weight of authority, however, they do not apply to 
crimes previously committed, unless clearly retrospective in their terms</i>." 
(16 C. J., 222.) The cases in support of the last sentence are the following: 
People <i>vs</i>. Lord ([1877], 12 Hun. [N. Y.], 282), and Martin <i>vs</i>. 
State ([1859], 24 Tex., 62). <i>Contra</i>, Commonwealth <i>vs</i>. Hutchinson 
([1850], 2 Pars. Eq. Cas. [Pa.], 453, 1 Phila., 77).</p>
<p>The New York case cited is not available in our library. In a standard 
treatise, Wood on Limitations, special reference is, however, made to it. It is 
said: "<i>In New York such statutes are held not to apply to crimes committed 
before the statute was changed, unless expressly included therein</i>, adopting 
the rule in that respect applicable in civil cases." (Wood on Limitations, 3d 
ed., p. 45.)</p>
<p>In the second case cited in the note to Corpus Juris, Martin <i>vs</i>. 
State, the Supreme Court of Texas held: "<i>Statutes of limitations for the 
prosecution of crimes and misdemeanors, do not have a retrospective 
operation</i>. * * * The statute of limitations passed in 1854 could not operate 
as a bar to a prosecution commenced within two years from the time that statute 
went into operation, there being no previous limitation to the prosecution of 
the offense in question." The Chief Justice rendered a dissenting" opinion, 
which is now made one of the props of the opinion of our Chief Justice.</p>
<p>The same result was obtained in decisions coming from Massachusetts. 
(Commonwealth <i>vs</i>. Boston and Worcester Railroad Corporation [1853], XI 
Cush. [Mass.], 512; and Commonwealth <i>vs</i>. Homer [1891], 153 Mass., 343.) 
In the first Massachusetts case it was held that an indictment against a 
railroad company under St. 1840, c. 80, for negligently causing the death of a 
passenger, is not within Rev. Sts. c 120, sec. 21, limiting actions and suits 
for any penalty, or forfeiture, to one year after the offense is committed, for 
the reason that St. 1853, c. 414, sec. 3, does not apply to indictments pending 
at the time of its passage. In the second Massachusetts case, it was held that 
the Statute of 1889, c. 100, providing that in a criminal prosecution on the 
Pub. Sts. c. 207, sec. 9, for attempting to procure a miscarriage, the dying 
declaration of the woman shall be admissible in evidence, if her death is 
alleged to have been the result thereof, is prospective only in its operation, 
and does not apply to an indictment found after its passage for such an offense 
theretofore committed. The court followed the language of another case, 
namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" '<i>The statute is equivocal and ambiguous in its terms, and might without 
doing violence to the words in which it is expressed be construed as 
retroactive. But such is by no means its necessary interpretation. On the 
contrary, it will have full meaning and effect, consistent with the fair import 
of its language, if it is held to be prospective only. The true rule of 
interpretation applicable to such enactments is well settled, and has been often 
recognized and affirmed by this court. It is, that all statutes are to be 
considered as prospective, and are not to be held to prejudice or affect the 
past transactions of the subject, unless such intention is clearly and 
unequivocally expressed</i>. (Whitman <i>vs</i>. Hapgood, 10 Mass., 439; King 
<i>vs</i>. Tirrell, 2 Gray, 331; Gerry <i>vs</i>. Stoneham, 1 Allen, 319, 323; 
Garfield <i>vs</i>. Bemis, 2 Allen, 446.) <i>No good reason can be given for 
excepting the statute under consideration from the operation of this wise and 
salutary rule.' There is no express intention to make the St. of 1889, c. 100, 
retroactive in its operation, and none can be implied from the subject-matter; 
it will have full effect if construed as prospective only, and, in the opinion 
of a majority of the court, it must be so construed</i>."</p></blockquote>
<p>The following was the holding of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in the 
case of Commonwealth <i>vs</i>. Duffy [1880], 96 Pa. St., 506):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>An act of limitation is an act of grace purely on the part of the 
legislature, and especially is this the case in the matter of criminal 
prosecutions</i>. The state makes no contract with criminals, at the time of the 
passage of an act of limitations, that they shall have immunity from punishment 
if not prosecuted within the statutory period. Such enactments are measures of 
public policy only. They are entirely subject to the mere will of the 
legislative power, and may be changed or repealed altogether as that power may 
see fit to declare. When a right to acquittal has not been absolutely acquired 
by the completion of the period of limitation, that period is subject to 
enlargement or repeal without being obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition 
against <i>ex post facto</i> laws." (<i>See also</i> Thompson <i>vs</i>. State 
[1877], 74 Miss., 740, and Moore <i>vs</i>. State [1881], 43 N. J. L., 
203.)</p></blockquote>
<p>With the exception of the Philadelphia city case, which cannot be found in 
the Philippines, <i>all other courts which have given consideration to the 
subject have refused to give retroactive effect to statutes establishing 
limitations of actions in criminal cases</i>, and have, we think, with all 
propriety, adopted the rule in civil cases pertaining to limitations of 
actions.</p>
<p>A rule as old as law itself is that statutes ought to be construed to be 
prospective, and not retrospective, in operation. Laws look forward and not 
backward. <i>Nova constitutio futuris formam imponere debet, non 
praeteritis</i>. This rule is applicable to statutes of limitation, unless by 
express command, or by necessary and unavoidable implication, a different 
construction is required. It has been held that the rule for the construction of 
statutes of limitations, with respect to their operation as being retroactive or 
not, requires such statutes (whether new, reenacted or amended), to be given a 
wholly prospective effect, that is, to commence running with respect to a 
particular cause of action from the time when the cause is subjected to the 
operation of the act, so that the party may have the full period prescribed 
thereby, unless it clearly appears that the legislature intended the act to 
operate on existing causes, so as to commence running from the time any such 
cause accrued. (Thomas <i>vs</i>. Higgs &amp; Calderwood [1910], 68 W. Va., 152, 
Ann. Cas., 1912A, 1039; Hathaway <i>vs</i>. Merchants' Loan and Trust Co. 
[1905], 218 Ill., 580; 4 Ann. Cas., 164; Moore <i>vs</i>. State [1881], 43 N. J. 
L., 203; Herrick <i>vs</i>. Boquillas Land &amp; Cattle Co. [1906], 200 U. S., 
96, 102; U. S. Fidelity etc. Co. <i>vs</i>. Struthers Wells Co., [1907], 209 U. 
S., 306.)</p>
<p>Ruling Case Law summarizes the principles governing the construction of 
limitation laws as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One rule for the construction of laws is that <i>statutes of limitation are 
presumed to be prospective and not retrospective in their operation, in the 
absence of a clear legislative intent to the contrary,</i> and the presumption 
is against any intent on the part of the legislature to make such statute 
retroactive. It has been said that <i>words of a statute ought not to have a 
retrospective operation unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative that no 
other meaning can be annexed to them, or unless the intention of the legislature 
cannot be otherwise satisfied</i>. * * * Some courts take the view that <i>since 
limitation laws apply only to the remedy,</i> they are not within the principle 
that statutes should be given a prospective rather than a retrospective 
construction, and therefore that they should be construed as retrospective 
unless they contain no language clearly limiting their application to causes of 
action arising in the future. But it has also been pointed out that even 
statutes as to procedure are not necessarily retrospective in their operation 
and the courts are not compelled to construe as retrospective a limitation law 
dealing with procedure only." (17 R. C. L., 682-684.)</p>
<p>"While it is undoubtedly within the power of the legislature to pass a 
statute of limitations or to change the period of limitation previously fixed 
and to make such statute or changes applicable to existing causes of action, 
provided a reasonable time is given by the new law for the commencement of suit 
before the bar takes effect, yet such a statute is not to be readily construed 
as having a retroactive effect, but is generally deemed to apply merely to 
causes of action arising subsequent to its enactment, and the presumption is 
against any intent on the part of the legislature to make the statute 
retroactive. <i>The statute will only be given a retroactive effect when it was 
clearly the intention of the legislature that it should so operate</i>." (25 R. 
C. L., 792, 793.)</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the cases cited in support of the general rule, and oft followed by 
other courts, is United States Fidelity etc. Company <i>vs</i>. Struthers Wells 
Co., <i>supra</i>. In the course of the opinion of the United States Supreme 
Court, it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are certain principles which have been adhered to with great 
strictness by the courts in relation to the construction of statutes, as to 
whether they are or are not retroactive in their effect. <i>The presumption is 
very strong that a statute was not meant to act retrospectively, and it ought 
never to receive such a construction if it is susceptible of any other. It ought 
not to receive such a construction unless the words used are so clear, strong, 
and imperative that no other meaning can be annexed to them or unless the 
intention of the legislature cannot be otherwise satisfied</i>. (Dash <i>vs</i>. 
Van Kleeck, 7 Johns., 477, 499; Jackson ex dem Hicks <i>vs</i>. Van Zandt, 12 
Johns, 169; United States <i>vs</i>. Heth, 3 Cranch, 399, 414; Southwestern Coal 
&amp; Improv. Co. <i>vs</i>. McBride, 185 U. S., 499, 503; United States 
<i>vs</i>. American Sugar Ref. Co., 202 U. S., 563, 577.)</p>
<p>"The language of the amended act is prospective, as it provides 'that 
hereafter any person or persons entering into a formal contract with the United 
States,' etc. That language standing alone would leave little doubt as to the 
intention of Congress in the matter of the taking effect of the amendment.</p>
<p>"It is urged, however, that as the amendment in this respect but reiterates 
the language of the original act, the use of the word 'hereafter' in the 
commencement of the amendment ought not to have the significance which would 
otherwise attach to it, because it is simply in this particular reenacting the 
law as it already stood.</p>
<p>"There is considerable force in the suggestion that the word 'hereafter' is 
not to receive the weight which in other circumstances it ought to have. The 
question is, however, one as to the intention of Congress, and when we come to 
look at the provisions of the statute, as amended, we are convinced that 
Congress did not intend that the amendment should apply to cases where the bond 
had already been executed, the work done, the respective rights of the parties 
settled, and the cause of action already in existence. If Congress had intended 
otherwise, we think it would have still further amended the original act by 
providing in plain language that the amendment should apply to all cases, and 
not be confined to the future. * * *</p>
<p>"Viewing the whole section, we think Congress meant that only in future cases 
should the provisions of the amendment apply, although some trifling portion of 
those provisions might be regarded, technically, as in the nature of procedure. 
It is therefore wiser to hold the entire section governed by the usual rule and 
as applying only to the future."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is, however, insisted with marked earnestness, that notwithstanding the 
simple and plain provisions of section 71 of Act No. 3030, and the almost 
universal rule adopted by the American courts, we are in duty bound to apply the 
provisions of the Spanish Penal Code.</p>
<p>Article 7 of the Penal Code reads: "Offenses punishable under special laws 
are not subject to the provisions of this Code." In the decision of the Supreme 
Court of the Philippines, in which most elaborate consideration was given to 
article 7 of the Penal Code, the rule adopted was: "<i>That, when a crime is 
made punishable by a law other than by the provisions of the Penal Code, the 
provisions of said code do not apply</i>." Following Viada in his commentaries 
on the Penal Code (1 Viada, 84), it was also pointed out that among the special 
laws are election laws. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Serapio [1912], 23 Phil., 584, 592, 
593.) The majority decisions are strangely silent as to the decision last 
cited.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing article 7 of the Penal Code as construed by this court: As 
offenses are made punishable by Act No. 3030, a special law the provisions of 
the Penal Code do not apply. But it is said that article 7 should be interpreted 
with reference to other articles of the Penal Code, and I concede that this is a 
fair argument.</p>
<p>Article 22 of the Penal Code is found in Title III, which is headed, 
"<i>Penalties</i>." Chapter I of Title III is entitled "<i>Penalties in 
General</i>." Only passing reference is made to the epigraphy, in order to 
concede everything possible to the argument of the petitioner in this case. 
Coming then to a consideration of the substance of article 22 of the Penal Code, 
its effect can best be judged by setting it side by side with article 3 of the 
Civil Code, since both articles have been given indiscriminate application to 
criminal laws. These two provisions of Philippine law read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="49%">
<div align="justify">"ART. 22. <i>Penal laws</i> shall have a retroactive effect 
in so far as they favor the person guilty of a felony or misdemeanor, although 
at the time of the publication of <i>such laws</i> a final sentence has been 
pronounced and the convict is serving same."</div></td>
<td valign="top" width="2%">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign="top" width="49%">
<div align="justify">"ART. 3. Laws shall not have a retroactive effect unless 
therein otherwise provided."</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>Article 3 of the Civil Code, given express application to criminal laws in 
the case of United States <i>vs</i>. Cuna ([1908], 12 Phil., 241), bears out the 
general doctrine previously announced. Article 22, on the other hand, is of an 
opposite tenor, and if given controlling effect, might lead to a contrary 
result. The first two words of article 22 are "Penal laws." What is meant by the 
term "Penal laws?" Is section 71 of Act No. 3030 a "penal law?"</p>
<p>I feel that I can, with all propriety, turn to the definition of "penal law" 
given by the American authorities, not only because there are numerous judicial 
definitions of the phrase available, but because the Election Law, establishing 
the Australian Ballot System, is primarily an American innovation, which was 
unknown in Spain when the Penal Code of 1870 was promulgated.</p>
<p>"Penal laws," all of the English and American decisions state, strictly and 
properly are those imposing punishment for an offense committed against the 
state, and which, by the English and American constitutions, the executive of 
the state has the power to pardon. In other words, a penal law denotes 
punishment imposed and enforced by the state for a crime or offense against its 
law. It would be palpably incongruous to call a statute penal which did not 
contain a definite and certain provision for punishment. On the other hand, a 
statute which gives a remedy for an injury belongs to the class of remedial 
statutes, and not to that of penal statutes. (Huntington <i>vs</i>. Attrill

<p>Escriche, <i>Diccionario Razonado de Legislacion y Jurisprudencia</i> (vol. 
III, p. 898), defines "ley penal," the Spanish equivalent of "penal law," as 
follows: "Ley penal es la que tiene por objeto algun delito y la pena con que ha 
de castigarse." <i>Diccionario Enciclopedico de la Lengua Castellana</i> defines 
"penal" thus: "Perteneciente o relativo a la pena o que la incluye;"â€”and "pena" 
thus: "Castigo impuesto por superior legitimo al que ha cometido un delito o 
falta."</p>
<p>The first instance in which our Supreme Court gave consideration to article 
22 of the Penal Code, was in the case of Pardo de Tavera <i>vs</i>. Garcia 
Valdez ([1902], 1 Phil., 468). The Chief Justice, in his decision, relies on the 
syllabus which, of course, is the statement of the reporter and not of the 
court. I prefer to go to the opinion, wherein it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 13 of the same act provides as follows: 'All laws and parts of laws 
now in force, so far as the same may be in conflict herewith, are hereby 
repealed: <i>Provided,</i> That nothing herein contained shall operate as a 
repeal of existing laws' in so far as they are applicable to pending actions or 
existing causes of action, but as to such causes of action or pending actions 
existing laws shall remain in full force and effect.' This act went into effect 
October 24, 1901, subsequent to the publication of the article in question, and 
during the pendency of the prosecution. By article 22 of the Penal Code 'Penal 
laws shall have a retroactive effect in so far as they favor the person guilty 
of a crime or misdemeanor,' etc. The court below in fixing the punishment 
proceeded upon the theory that by the operation of this general rule the 
<i>penalty</i> prescribed in the Penal Code for the offense in question was 
necessarily modified and could not be inflicted in its full extension. In so 
doing we think the court overlooked or improperly construed the proviso in the 
section of Act No. 277, above cited, by virtue of which the previously existing 
law on the subject covered by the act is left intact in all its parts as 
respects pending actions or existing causes of action. The language is general 
and embraces, we think, all actions, whether civil, criminal, or of a mixed 
character. In this view of the case we have no occasion to consider the question 
argued by counsel for the private prosecutor as to whether the provisions of Act 
No. 277 respecting the penalty are more favorable to the accused than those of 
the former law or otherwise. The punishment must be determined exclusively by 
the provisions of the former law."</p></blockquote>
<p>The case of United States <i>vs</i>. Hocbo ([1908], 12 Phil., 304) oft 
mentioned by Mr. Justice Ostrand, merely holds that (I now quote from the body 
of the decision), "All amendments of the law (meaning the Penal Code) which are 
beneficial to the defendant, shall be given a retroactive effect, in so far as 
they favor the person charged with the crime or misdemeanor. * * * We find 
nothing in Act No. 1773 which is more favorable to the defendant than the 
provisions of the Penal Code."</p>
<p>The case of United States <i>vs</i>. Parrone ([1913], 24 Phil., 29), gave 
special attention to the relative effect of articles 7 and 22 of the Penal Code. 
It was said that "Article 22 must necessarily relate (1) to penal laws existing 
prior to the Penal Code, in which the <i>penalty</i> was less severe than those 
of the Penal Code; or (2) to laws enacted subsequent to the Penal Code, in which 
the <i>penalty was more favorable to the accused</i>. Rule 80, <i>Ley 
Provisional para la aplicacion de las disposiciones del Codigo Penal</i>. Under 
the provisions of said article 22, if a crime had been committed prior to the 
date of the Penal Code the <i>punishment</i> for which was more favorable to the 
accused than the provisions of the Penal Code, it is believed that the accused 
might invoke the provisions of said article (22) even though he was not placed 
upon trial until after the Penal Code went into effect. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Cuna 
[1908], 12 Phil., 241.) So also if by an amendment to the Penal Code or by a 
later special law <i>the punishment for an act was made less severe than by the 
provisions of the Penal Code,</i> then the accused person might invoke the 
provisions of said article." We gather from this language that the phrase "penal 
laws" used in article 22 relates to laws enacted subsequent to the Penal Code, 
in which the <i>penalty</i> is more favorable to the accused or the 
<i>punishment</i> for the act is made less severe.</p>
<p>Statutes of limitation, it is well settled, relate to the remedy and not to 
the right; relate to procedure and not to the crime. (Moore <i>vs</i>. State, 
<i>supra</i>; Commonwealth <i>vs</i>. Duffy, <i>supra</i>; 17 R. C. L., 703, 
citing Mulvey <i>vs</i>. Boston [1908], 197 Mass., 178; U. S. <i>vs</i>. 
Serapio, <i>supra</i>.) Viada, in his commentaries on the Penal Code (vol. I, p. 
570, 4th ed.), makes the following observations: "Prescription of the crime only 
means the termination of the right or power to prosecute or punish the offender, 
after the lapse of a definite period from the commission of the offense, or if 
this is not known, from the day of its discovery and the beginning of the 
judicial proceedings for investigation and punishment." The supreme court of 
Spain, in a decision of January 22, 1872, held that when the law speaks of the 
prescription of an offense, it cannot be understood to mean other than that of 
the action to prosecute the same.</p>
<p>This construction is the more apparent, when it is remembered that the Penal 
Code, although it does contain some provisions concerning procedure, is, 
generally speaking, substantive law. As such substantive law, it is but 
reasonable to suppose that it would only reach special laws of a similar nature. 
It must also be recalled that the criminal actions in the case before us and in 
all other cases on appeal to the court, were instituted before the time Act No. 
3030 took effect, and that these courts of first instance had jurisdiction of 
the cases at that time.</p>
<p>What, therefore, is the condition of the much vaunted Latin law and 
jurisprudence on the question under discussion? First, article 7 of the Penal 
Code and our decisions make Act No. 3030 not subject to the provisions of the 
Penal Code; second, article 22 is found in a title and a chapter of the Code 
relating to "Penalties," and the article itself specifies "Penal laws;" third, 
section 71 of Act No. 3030 does not concern "penalties," and is not a "penal 
law," but is a procedural law.</p>
<p>Not a single authority, Latin or American, supports the position of the 
majority.</p>
<p>So much for our opinion on the principal question. I note, however, that the 
majority decision of Mr. Justice Ostrand argues the facts. I had been told that 
a legal question was to be resolved. But somehow or other, although none of us 
have read the record or the briefs in that particular case, it may be a matter 
which strengthens his position. And if this is true, and if the argument at 
least serves as a smokescreen to obscure the real question, who can object?</p>
<p>The majority decisions also essay to sanctify and deify prescription laws. 
What this has to do with the question in issue I do not know. I had thought that 
the Supreme Court was a judicial body, but apparently I have misconceived our 
functions.</p>
<p>The majority further say that "a strong appeal has been made to our emotions 
by describing in rather vivid colors, the disastrous consequences which will 
result from the dismissal of actions," etc., etc. I can find no such plea in any 
of the briefs. But the statement brings to mind a point on which I would gladly 
comment. What then are the consequences which would result from holding that 
section 71 of Act No. 3030 has retrospective effect?</p>
<p>One consequence I have already noted. At least thirty-two cases dismissed, 
and the crimes of ninety-one accused condoned. "A clear legislative intent, by a 
repeal of the act imposing it, or some other expressed purpose, is required to 
take away a penalty or condone a crime by a retroactive law. This is especially 
to be guarded against in legislation designed to favor individuals at the 
expense of the public." (State <i>vs</i>. Startup [1877], 39 N. J. Law, 
423.)</p>
<p>In the next place, such a holding would mean that we would make of Act No. 
3030 an <i>ex post facto</i> law, something which is not claimed for it by 
petitioner, and a pitfall which the courts invariably avoid. And, lastly, I 
would recall another well-known principle of statutory construction: "If the 
language is clear, and the intent manifest, there is, of course, no room for 
presumptions. But if, on the other hand, the language is not clear, and it is 
obvious that by a particular construction in a doubtful case great public 
interests would be endangered or sacrificed, the court ought not to presume that 
such construction was intended by the makers of the law. A statute will not be 
so construed as to work public mischief, unless required by clear, unequivocal 
words, especially if the statute be chiefly to subserve individual interests." 
(25 R. C. L., 1027.)</p>
<p>Having, then, in view the disastrous consequences of one holding, as 
contrasted with the reasonable consequences of another, I can properly recall 
that in every instance in which this court has considered the subject, it has 
avoided the condonation of crime. For example, when the United States Supreme 
Court in its decision in the Weems case ([1910], 217 U. S., 349), held article 
300 of the Penal Code void, it was incumbent upon the Supreme Court of the 
Philippine Islands to apply and construe the decision of the higher tribunal. In 
the case of United States <i>vs</i>. Pico ([1911], 18 Phil., 386), in which this 
court discussed the subject, it was found that according to the official report 
of the Director of Prisons there were serving sentences of analogous crimes four 
hundred and eighty-five accused, and that should this court be bound thereby to 
liberate them, "it * * * would result in a general jail delivery of all those 
heretofore convicted of many of the gravest and most heinous offenses denned and 
penalized by law; and would be substantially equivalent to a proclamation of 
amnesty in favor of all those who have heretofore committed such crimes and have 
not yet been brought to trial, or who may commit them hereafter until such time 
as the Legislature may be able to reform the Penal Code." The court continued: 
"Confronted as we are with the knowledge that consequences so far-reaching and 
disastrous must result from a holding favorable to the contention of counsel on 
this motion, it is manifestly our duty rigidly to restrict the application of 
the doctrine laid down in the Weems case to cases wherein the <i>ratio 
decidendi</i> in that case is clearly applicable and to decline to be bound by 
inferences drawn from observations and comments contained in the opinion in that 
case which appear to be based upon a misapprehension of facts, or upon assumed 
facts which do not accord with the facts in the cases brought before us." (Note 
also Ong Chang Wing <i>vs</i>. U. S. [1910], 218 U. S., 272.)</p>
<p>Before closing, I would like to disencumber myself of the miscellaneous 
authorities which I have discussed, and would again prefer to get back to the 
fundamentals of ascertaining and giving effect to legislative intent. On the one 
hand, by applying the simple phraseology of section 71, it appears to me that we 
effectuate legislative intention and avoid indescribable harm. On the other 
hand, if we give to the language of the Legislature an unusual meaning, we 
nullify legislative intention and turn away from prison persons who are guilty 
of violations of the Election Law.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, the public was edified by executive pardons of criminals 
who had violated the Election Law during the elections of 1913 and 1916. A 
judicial veto of legislative intent, and judicial legislation now effects a 
blanket pardon of persons who audaciously thwarted the people's will during the 
elections of 1919.</p>It is incomprehensible that members of the Philippine 
Legislature convened for the avowed purpose of enacting "a more effective 
Election Law," to use their own language, and cognizant as many of the members 
must have been, of pending cases in the Courts of First Instance and in the 
Supreme Court,â€”that these same members of the Legislature would insert 
provisions tantamount to a legislative pardon of persons who had committed 
crimes during the elections in 1919, but whose causes had tardily been brought 
before the courts. It would, indeed, be a serious charge against the integrity 
of the members of the Philippine Legislature to ascribe to them the purpose of 
inserting in the new Election Law a section to effectuate a general jail 
delivery of convicted criminals, and the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands 
is indeed assuming a grave responsibility when it distorts legislative language 
with the result which I have described. Believing, however, that the Philippine 
Legislature acted in a patriotic manner to advance the general public interests, 
and that no lurking design hides behind the meaning of its legislative product 
to advance private interests, we should enforce the law of an independent branch 
of the Government as we find itâ€”as it is our duty to do.<br><br><br>
