				<H3>RAMON BLANCO ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS, THE SECRETARY-TREASURER OF THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS, AND THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Fifteen participants in the last medical examinations, in a complaint in 
mandamus, ask the court to order the Secretary of the Interior to confirm the 
final results of the examinations. The Attorney-General on behalf of the 
respondents has filed an answer. The petitioners, in turn, have demurred to the 
answer.
<p>The petitioners, along with other qualified persons, took the examinations 
prescribed by law for a physician's certificate on May 13 to 16, 1924, and 
apparently passed the same. The Board of Medical Examiners thereupon submitted 
the final results of the examinations to the Department Head for confirmation. 
But the Secretary of the Interior held the matter in abeyance, pending the 
outcome of an investigation conducted by the Under-Secretary of the Interior. 
The finding of the special investigator was that the questions on the subjects 
of the medical examinations held on May 13 to May 16, 1924, had leaked out 
before said dates. Following the recommendation of the Under-Secretary, the 
Secretary of the Interior annulled the results of the examinations.</p>
<p>The last paragraph of section 776 of the Medical Law, as found in the 
Administrative Code, and as last amended by section 10 of Act No. 3111, provides 
that "The results of all examinations (medical), including the average and 
grades obtained by each applicant, shall be submitted for confirmation to the 
Department Head (the Secretary of the Interior) and made known to the respective 
candidates within one month after the date of the examination." Is this official 
duty discretionary or ministerial in nature?</p>
<p>It is elementary law that the writ of mandamus will not issue to control or 
review the exercise of the discretion of a public officer. Where the law imposes 
upon a public officer the right and duty to exercise judgment, in reference to 
any matter to which he is called upon to act, it is his judgment that is to be 
exercised and not that of the court. "* * * If the law imposes a duty upon a 
public officer, and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be 
performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. * * *" (Lamb 
<em>vs.</em> Phipps [1912], 22 Phil., 456; Gonzalez <em>vs.</em> Board of 
Pharmacy [1911], 20 Phil., 367; Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 515; Mechem on 
Public Officers, pp. 631-633.)</p>
<p>Under the plain terms of the Medical Law, it is the discretionary duty of the 
Secretary of the Interior to confirm or not to confirm—to confirm or, as in this 
instance, to annul—the report of the medical examiners. To hold that the 
Secretary of the Interior must in all cases confirm, shutting his eyes to any 
irregularity, no matter how glaring, would convert him into an automatic rubber 
stamp for imprinting the requisite approval. That the Department Secretary who 
appoints the members of the Board of Medical Examiners, who has the Board under 
his administrative supervision, and who has the power of confirmation of the 
report of the Board, cannot do more than perform the clerical duty of approving 
the results of the examinations, under any and all circumstances, is too 
specious an argument to merit serious consideration. It is likewise elementary 
law that mandamus may issue to correct abuse of discretion, if the case is 
otherwise proper. But here, the record discloses that the Secretary of the 
Interior did not exercise the power granted to him with manifest injustice, or 
with gross abuse. Quite otherise.</p>
<p>The manly course for the petitioners to pursue, the wholesome remedy at their 
command, is to submit anew to examinations free from all hint of carelessness, 
collusion, or fraud.</p>
<p>The complaint is dismissed with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Avancena, Villamor, Ostrand,</em> and <em>Romualdez, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
