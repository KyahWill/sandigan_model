				<H3>THE CITY OF MANILA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. SALVADOR ROXAS Y ELIO ET AL., DEFENDANTS. MARIA ELIO VIUDA DE ROXAS AND CU UNJIENG E HIJOS, APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify"> The City of Manila appeals from the orders of the
Court of First Instance of Manila awarding to two private property
owners whose lands were taken by expropriation proceedings, an
allowance for the taxes paid to the City of Manila under protest,
covering a period of time between the dispossession of the owners and
the taking of title by the city.</p>
<p align="justify"> Several questions as to procedure and fact are
raised in this appeal, although they were not submitted to the trial
court. Subject to a few exceptions, the rule is almost universal, and
it has been repeatedly followed by this court that "questions, of
whatever nature, not raised and properly preserved for review in the
trial court, will not be noticed on appeal." (3 C. J., 689.)</p>
<p align="justify"> Such questions discussed in the appeal will
therefore be disregarded, and we will assume that the proceedings are
regular and that the court was fully apprised as to the facts of the
case before taking action.</p>
<p align="justify"> In expropriation proceedings not only should just compensation be made, but, as well stated by Chief Justice Shaw in Parks <em>vs. </em>City of Boston (15 Pick., 198-208):
</p><blockquote>"* * * if a pre-powder court could be called on the
instant and on the spot, the true rule of justice for the public would
be, to pay the compensation with one hand, whilst they apply the axe
with the other; and this rule is departed from only because some time
is necessary, by the forms of law, to conduct the inquiry; and this
delay must be compensated by interest."</blockquote>
<p>While taxes are assessed against the holder of the title (Cooley, Taxation, vol. II, 4th ed., p. 1215; City of Manila <em>vs. </em>Sy
Quia, G. R. No. 32474, promulgated May 22, 1930, not reported), the
owner of the property is entitled to the beneficent use of his property
until title changes. If pursuant to law, immediate possession may be
taken, the withholding this right from the owner must be compensated
for as well as the formal taking. In In re Mayor, etc., of City of New
York (58 N. Y. Supplement, 58, 61), it is said:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>"It is equally clear that, at the
time of the actual appropriation of the property by the city, the
owners were entitled to be relieved of all burdens incident to their
ownership. Certainly it would not be 'just compensation' to take a
man's land, and compel him to pay the taxes and assessments thereafter
levied on the property, while at the same time withholding the purchase
price. * * * Upon the city's theory, therefore, the owner must Hot
alone be deprived of the unrestricted use of his property and of the ad
interim use of his money, but he must also be compelled to pay for its
police protection, and for public improvements charged against it as a
benefit, during all the period of delay, for which he is in no way
responsible, and which he is powerless to shorten'. It will be seen
that; if this theory be correct, the owner's award would be constantly
diminished by each year's delay, until, if the period were long enough,
it would be entirely wiped out. It can hardly be contended that a
theory which, logically followed out, would under any possible
circumstances produce such a result, affords a satisfactory basis for
an award of 'just compensation.</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "* * * The owner may be allowed the
unrestricted use of the premises after the taking, and the premises may
be of such a character, and so situated, that the income derivable
therefrom is a full equivalent for interest, taxes, and assessments.
Such is the case where the property has been fully improved and rented,
and where there has been no loss of tenancy or diminution of rental
pending the condemnation proceedings."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> As to the question of law involved, we hold that
there is no error in a court's awarding, as part of the just
compensation required by law, the amount of taxes and assessments paid
covering the period where the original owner had merely the naked legal
title. Where all benefits have been taken away, the corresponding
burdens should be assumed by the State.</p>
<p align="justify"> The orders appealed from are therefore affirmed. Costs against appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Abad Santos, Butte, Goddard, </em>and <em>Diaz, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
