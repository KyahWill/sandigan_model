				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant is&nbsp; charged with violation of section 4 of municipal ordinance No. 1, series of 1934, of the municipality of Manapla, Occidental&nbsp; Negros.&nbsp; It is alleged that in January,&nbsp; 1934, the accused, then manager of the North Negros Sugar Co., Inc., established and operated a talking cinematograph without paying the tax corresponding to the first&nbsp; quarter&nbsp; of said year.<br><br>It has been proven that the accused, in a building erected for said&nbsp; purpose, established&nbsp; and operated, through payments, a talking cinematograph wherein not only the laborers of said&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; but also the public&nbsp; in&nbsp; general were&nbsp; admitted.<br><br>Section 4 of municipal ordinance No. 1, series of 1934, of the municipality of Manapla, compels every operator of a talking cinematograph to pay&nbsp; quarterly in&nbsp; advance a municipal license tax of P300 annually.&nbsp; This tax has been levied by virtue of the authority conferred&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the municipal council by section 1 of Act No. 3422 to impose license taxes upon persons engaged in any occupation or business.<br><br>The appellant&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that the cinematograph established by him is not of the nature of&nbsp; a business, the only purpose thereof being to provide&nbsp; the&nbsp; laborers of the&nbsp; corporation, of which he is the manager, with amusement and relaxation and to prevent their having&nbsp; to go to other places in search of amusement.&nbsp; It appears, however, that the entrance fee charged is such that it enables him not only to defray the regular operating expenses but also to cover the value of the machine and the building in&nbsp; which the cinematograph is established.&nbsp; This&nbsp; being so,&nbsp; the enterprise has the character of a business, inasmuch as it is for the purpose&nbsp; of gain.&nbsp; For purposes&nbsp; of .the tax, the proceeds obtained after deducting all&nbsp; the&nbsp; expenses necessary&nbsp; for the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of the business,&nbsp; constitute gain. In this sense, after all the expenses of operating the cinematograph are paid and the value of the machine and the building recovered, these machine and building, in&nbsp; so far as they represent&nbsp; value,&nbsp; would&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; a gain in&nbsp; the operation of&nbsp; the cinematograph.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the appealed judgment ordering the appellant to pay a fine of P25 and a license fee of P75&nbsp; for the&nbsp; first quarter of the year&nbsp; 1934, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in&nbsp; case of insolvency, is affirmed,&nbsp; with the costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Villa-Real,&nbsp; Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, Recto</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
