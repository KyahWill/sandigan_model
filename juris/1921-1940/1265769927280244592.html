				<H3>VALERIANO SOLON, NATIVIDAD SOLON, AND MANUELA IBANEZ, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. APOLONIA SOLON, ZOILO SOLON, ROBERTA SOLON, FELISA SUICO (MINOR), AND THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In his lifetime Eugenio Solon, father of the
parties surnamed Solon, grandfather of defendant Felisa Suico, and
husband of the plaintiff Manuela Ibanezin second marriage contracted on
May 23, 1899, bought, on installments, from the Bureau of Lands the
parcel of land described as "Lot No. 903 of the Banilad Friar Lands
Estate" in transfer certificate of title No. 8379 of the registry of
Cebu, situated in the barrio of Cogon, municipality of Cebu, Cebu
Province, having an area of 6 hectares, 46 ares and 13 centares, and
assessed by said bureau at P403. The sale took place on December 12,
1919, and the time stipulated for the complete payment of its price was
thirteen years, the first annual installment being P31, and the
subsequent twelve installments to be paid every year being P21 each. On
July 30, 1925, with the amount of P126 as part of the agreed purchase
price still unpaid, Eugenio Solon, after securing the consent and
approval of the Bureau of Lands, sold and conveyed for the sum of
P1,000 all his rights, title and interest in the land acquired by him,
executing for that purpose in favor of Apolonia Solon who agreed to pay
the installments still owing to the Bureau of Lands, the deed of
transfer appearing in the record as Exhibit B. Apolonia Solon paid to
the Bureau of Lands on the same date of the execution of the deed the
amount of P21, and the balance of P105 at one time only a month
thereafter. The year following, or on July 10, 1926, Eugenio Solon
died, leaving no will, and two years, eight months and eight days
later, or on March 18, 1929, the register of deeds of Cebu, upon
compliance with the formalities of law, issued transfer certificate of
title No. 8379 in the name of Apolonia Solon. The latter took charge of
the property, occupying it as her own through tenants from the time she
bought the same, according to the evidence for the defendants, and from
the death of Eugenio Solon, according to that for the plaintiffs. <p> Plaintiffs surnamed Solon, all of whom are children of the
deceased Eugenio Solon in his marriage with his widow Manuela Ibanez,
joining with the latter in maintaining that Exhibit B is false and
simulated and that if the same had been executed by Eugenio Solon, it
was without just consideration, commenced this suit praying (1) that
said document be declared null and void because false and simulated,
(2) that they be adjudged the absolute owners <em></em> of the land in
question together with the other heirs of Eugenio Solon, (3) that
defendants Apolonia Solon, Zoilo Solon, Roberta Solon and the latter's
husband Andres Montalban, be sentenced to pay, jointly and severally,
to the plaintiffs the value of the fruits of the land in question from
the death of Eugenio Solon, and (4) that said defendants be sentenced
to pay, also jointly and severally, to the plaintiffs the sum of
P30,000 as damages, besides the costs of the suit.</p>
  <p>
Defendants, by way of defense, filed an answer containing a general
denial and the special defense of prescription based on the fact that
plaintiffs had allowed six years to elapse before exercising their
right of action.</p>
<p> After trial the lower court rendered judgment dismissing
plaintiffs' complaint, without any pronouncement as to costs, and
declaring valid in effect the transfer made by Eugenio Solon in favor
of Apolonia Solon appearing in Exhibit B. From said judgment plaintiffs
appealed to this court after their motion for new trial on the ground
that the judgment was contrary to law and not sufficiently supported by
the evidence was denied.</p>
<p> In support of their appeal appellants assigned eight errors as
committed by the lower court which may be summed up as follows: (1) In
giving no credit to the witnesses for the plaintiffs and in making no
mention of the falsehoods committed by the witnesses for the appellees
in their testimony; (2) in failing to consider the real value of the
land in question by reason of its location and value in 1925 when the
alleged transfer took place; (3) in failing to take into account the
conclusion at which it had arrived during trial, that the land in
question, being located near the Osmeiia bridge, was worth P0,25 per
square meter in 1925, and declaring afterwards in its decision that it
is worth less than P0.01 1/2 per square meter; (4) in not declaring
that Eugenio Solon, like other owners of lands" adjacent to his, knew
of the plan to construct the provincial capitol on lot No. 850
adjoining lot No. 903 in question; (5) in holding that appellants
weakened their side of the case when, after contending that the
document Exhibit B is false and simulated, they conceded that although
the same may have been executed, it must, at all events, be declared
void by reason of the disproportion between the price paid for the land
and its true value at the time; (6) in failing to take into account the
various facts and circumstances showing that the transaction which took
place according to Exhibit £, is fraudulent and false, in view of the
fact that the supposed grantor under said deed was an illiterate, 88
years of age and was furthermore the father of Apolonia Solon, and also
of the fact that the whole transaction was carried out without the
knowledge of his wife and other children; (7) in not holding that
Exhibit B is fraudulent and false and that Eugenio Solon, who was 88
years old, ignorant and illiterate, was induced to sign it; and finally
(8) in not holding null and void the deed in question and in not
finding that the land to which the same refers belongs to all the heirs
of the deceased Eugenio Solon.</p>

    <td width="94%"><div align="justify">It
is a fact clearly shown by the evidence for the defendants, which
appears to us to have more weight than that for the plaintiffs
notwithstanding the latter's efforts to show the contrary, that the
transfer of the land in question made by Eugenio Solon to Apolonia
Solon, according to Exhibit B, had taken place long before the
commencement of the suit of Macleod &amp; Co. against Andres Montalban,
husband of Roberta Solon, as principal, and Eugenio Solon, as surety of
said Montalban. It can not, therefore, be believed, and the lower court
did well in refusing to believe, that Andres Montalban had been making
statements to the effect that Apolonia Solon had paid nothing for the
transfer made in her favor by Eugenio Solon, for the reason that the
same was not real but only simulated and that it was made solely for
the sole purpose of placing the land in question beyond the reach of
any action that might be brought by Macleod &amp; Company against said
Eugenio Solon; and that Apolonia Solon had been telling her tenant
named Eugenio Labra that there had been an understanding among her
brothers of the whole blood that they would cede the said land to her
as part of her inheritance from their father, because, in the first
place, there was no reason to fear' that Macleod &amp; Company would
bring an action against Eugenio Solon for the collection of an amount
greater than P5,000 which as surety, he had bound himself to pay; and,
in the second place, Apolonia Solon could not have made the above
statement attributed to her for the simple reason that she was then
already the owner of the land aforesaid by virtue of the purchase
appearing in Exhibit B. </div></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>When Eugenio Solon bound himself as surety for Andres Montalban for
the payment to Macleod &amp; Company of the amount of P5,000 which
Montalban owed to the latter, he limited himself to giving as security,
by way of mortgage, the land, and no other, belonging to him and
described as lot No. 892 of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate in case No.
5988 of the Court of Land Registration and in transfer certificate of
title No. 2499 of the registry of property of the Province of Cebu. It
is not possible that Macleod &amp; Company could have ever contemplated
bringing an action against Eugenio Solon to obtain possession not only
of the land expressly mortgaged to it, which, as has been said, is lot
No. 892 described in the certificate of title above-mentioned, which is
distinct from lot No. 903, but also of any other land belonging to him
or of lot No. 903 itself, for the purpose of collecting its credit
against Andres Montalban, because it would not have failed to know,
better than any one else, that the contract of suretyship in its favor
does not admit of the interpretation that it could make Eugenio Solon
liable for an amount greater than P5,000 and that it could require him
to pay Montalban's indebtedness, should the latter fail to do so, with
lands other than that he had mortgaged. This is so because the clauses
of a contract of suretyship determine the extent of the liability of
the surety (Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Herrero, 38 Phil.,
410); because said liability should not be extended farther than the
clear terms of the contract of guarantee by mere implications; and
because the surety should be liable only in the manner and to the
extent, and under the circumstances pointed out in the contract of
suretyship or which may be clearly deduced therefrom (La Insular vs.
Machuca Go-Tauco and Nubia Co-Siong, 39 Phil., 567).</p>

believe having proved that the value of the land in question in 1925
was P0.25 per square meter. The evidence upon which they rely was the
testimony of the engineer, surveyor and real estate broker Thomas F.
Breslin, who affirmed that a parcel adjacent to the one under
discussion had been sold to a lady named Consolacion Alba de Rodriguez
in that year at P0.25 per square meter. It should be noted that, upon
cross-examination, said witness had to admit that all he knew
concerning the transaction had been obtained from said lady. Although
the lower court did not order the striking out of such testimony in
spite of a timely motion by defendants to that effect, inasmuch as it
limited itself to saying: "It will be taken into consideration," the
truth is that when it decided the case dismissing plaintiffs'
complaint, it completely disregarded said evidence which is tantamount
to having ordered its exclusion on account of its incompetency. </div></td>

<p> The sales made in 1926 and 1927 of lots Nos. 900 and 1009-A by Jose
Vano to Soledad, Salud and Mercedes Espina, and by Maria Solon to Zenon
Diaz, respectively, at the rate of P0.20 and P0.24 per square meter,
according to Exhibits BB and X, and the sale made by Vidal S. Duterte
to the spouses Severino Rodriguez and Consolacion Alba, of lot No.
1009-B, in October, 1925, at P0.25 per square meter, according to
Exhibit Y, do not necessarily prove that the land in question was worth
that much on the date of its sale. It must be remembered that this had
taken place three months before the sale of the land referred to in
Exhibit Y, and one and two years before those set forth in Exhibits BB
and Y, respectively. Those who acquired said lands, according to their
own testimony, desired to speculate because they had heard that the
capitol of Cebu would be erected nearby. It is, nevertheless, a fact
that since then until the date of the decision appealed from—in the
words of the lower court—the capitol had not been erected, nor had any
road been opened through said parcels, nor had the rumors that the
capitol would be constructed sooner or later in the vicinity had any
appearance of truth. However, .although there may have been a proposal
to erect the capitol thereon, the evidence does not show that Eugenio
Solon had ever had knowledge of that fact. Furthermore, knowing that he
had paid for the land only P270.70, it is only reasonable to suppose
that he was more than satisfied when he received an offer of P1,000
therefor and was paid that amount which is, no doubt, almost three
times that which he had invested, not at one time, of course, but in
six years. On the other hand, the person to whom he transferred the
land was no other than his own daughter. For these reasons, we believe
and so hold that the second error is without merit.</p>

is nothing in the record which proves that the court found that the
value of the land in dispute in 1925 was P0.25 per square meter. All
that the lower court said during the trial, and it appears only
incidentally, in ruling on the objection to a question made for the
purpose of finding out the1 amount at which the land would quote per
.square meter in case the capitol were constructed on parcel No. 850
which is adjacent to the parcel in question, was the following:</div></td>

<blockquote>
  <p>"That is extremely remote. I believe that the best
proof is that of P0.25 per square meter, in 1925. I believe that that
is the real value, and it depends upon whether or not a street will be
opened and on whether or not a capitol will be constructed, and if it
be depression time, as it is now, it can not possibly sell at P2, so
that it is all too problematical."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> And it should be added that the lower court said this before
hearing the other evidence of plaintiffs and before having any idea of
what the evidence of defendants would be. It surely corrected the same
thereafter in the manner set forth in the decision appealed from, We
hold that the third error is likewise not well taken.</p>

fourth error is imaginary. As has been said, there is no evidence of
record to show that Eugenio Solon had any knowledge of the plan to
construct the capitol of Cebu near the land .in dispute upon selling
the same to Apolorjia Solon. The argument of plaintiffs that it must be
presumed that every land owner has knowledge of all the improvements
which are to be made in properties near his own, does not prove
anything because it does nowhere appear as a fact that the capitol of
Cebu was to be constructed sooner or later in the immediate vicinity of
the land in question. But even supposing that Eugenio Solon had guessed
that there would be such a plan, this does not imply that the transfer
he made to Apolonia Solon was void because the owner has the right to
sell what belongs to him to whomever he chooses and for whatever price
satisfactory to him.</div></td>

it is no error for the lower court to have considered that the cause of
the plaintiffs was weakened on account of the fact that they maintain
two propositions which are, in reality, incompatible with each other.
That the document of transfer Exhibit B was false and simulated, and
that it must simply be declared void for the reason that the price paid
therefor is disproportionate to its value in 1925 are two
irreconcilable things. If the latter were true, then it would be
useless to insist that the said document is false or simulated. But the
truth is that there is no disproportion between the price paid for it
and its real value in 1925. The Bureau of Lands itself sold, on July
28, 1924, lot No. 887 of the same Banilad Friar Lands Estate, located
near the land in question and having an area of 3 hectares, 43 ares, 62
centares for the small sum of P190 or less than 6/10 centavo per square
meter. (Exhibit II-A.) There is no occasion to repeat here the same
reasons for the statement that there is no evidence of record in
support of the conclusion that there was a proposal on the part of the
Province of Cebu to construct its capitol on' lot No. 850. If there was
any disproportion between the price paid and the real value of the
land, it was not to the prejudice of Eugenio Solon because he was paid
much more than he really paid therefor to the Bureau of Lands
notwithstanding that he had not made any improvements thereon or
completed the payment he had agreed to make to said office.</div></td>

sixth error attributed by appellants to the lower court has been
practically shown not to exist for the reasons given in discussing the
first five errors. In addition thereto, it may be said that plaintiffs
have not adduced any evidence to show that said transfer did not take
place. On the other hand, defendants proved that it did take place by
means of Exhibit B which, it may be truthfully said, was executed with
all the formalities of the law before a notary public and in the
presence of an official of the Bureau of Lands in the very office of
the latter in Talisay, Cebu, and in that of another, witness, and by
means of the approval of said transfer by the Director of Lands. They
further proved through one of the instrumental witnesses to said
document and through Apolonia Solon herself that the price appearing in
said document Exhibit B was paid to Eugenio Solon; and that the latter
had tried to sell the land before that date to other persons for
P1,500, but that they did not offer him more than P750. All the
foregoing, together with the fact that the last annual payments which
Eugenio Solon should have made to the Bureau of Lands were effected by
Apolonia Solon and that said defendant took possession of the land
immediately after the execution of Exhibit B conclusively show that
said document was neither fraudulent nor false. And it is not true that
Eugenio Solon was then 88 years old and, therefore, could be easily
imposed upon by reason of his mental and physical weakness because the
best evidence appearing of record with respect to his age, Exhibit F,
shows that he was only 66 years, 2 months and 7 days at the time of the
transfer.</div></td>
