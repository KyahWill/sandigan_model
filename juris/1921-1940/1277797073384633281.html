				<H3>CONCEPCION J. VIUDA DE SYQUIA, AS JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED GREGORIO SYQUIA, PETITIONER, VS. PEDRO CONCEPCION, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND RAFAEL PALMA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify"> This is an original petition for a writ of
certiorari instituted by Concepcion J. Viuda de SyQuia, as judicial
administratrix of the intestate estate of the deceased Gregorio SyQuia,
wherein, for the reasons alleged therein, it is prayed that judgment be
entered declaring the order of the respondent judge dated February 21,
1934, having been issued beyond his jurisdiction, as well as the order
entered by him on March 10, 1934, declaring as improperly approved and
reapproving the bill of exceptions of the respondent Rafael Palma, null
and void and of no effect.</p>
<p align="justify"> The following pertinent facts are necessary for the solution of the question raised in this petition:</p>
<p align="justify"> On September 25, 1930, judgment was rendered in
civil case No. 42600 of the Court of First Instance of Manila wherein
the herein petitioner Conception J. Viuda de SyQuia, as judicial
administratrix of the deceased Gregorio SyQuia, was plaintiff, and the
respondent Rafael Palma and Perfecto and Felipe Jacinto were
defendants, ordering the said defendants Perfecto and Felipe Jacinto,
as principals, and the said respondent Rafael Palma, as surety, to pay
to the said plaintiff the sum of P13,596.24, plus interest thereon at 9
per cent per annum from April 18, 1925, until fully paid, with the
costs of the suit.</p>
<p align="justify"> After the parties had been notified of said
judgment, the respondent Rafael Palma, within the reglementary period,
excepted to the same and filed a motion for a new trial. Said motion
having been denied, the respondent, within the reglementary period,
presented for approval his corresponding bill of exceptions, the court
setting the date of the hearing for its approval on December 12, 1933.</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 22, 1933, the herein petitioner filed a
motion to the effect that, in view of the appeal taken by the therein
defendant and herein respondent Rafael Palma, he be ordered to file a
bond for P20,000 and that, upon his failure to do so within the period
to be fixed by the court, the corresponding writ of execution be issued
notwithstanding the said appeal.</p>
<p align="justify"> On December 9, 1933, the respondent judge issued an
order transferring to December 16, 1933 at 8.30 o'clock a. m., the
hearing of the motion of the therein plaintiff and herein petitioner,
dated December 6, 1933, as well as that for the approval of the bill of
exceptions filed by the therein defendants. On the day of the hearing
for the approval of the bill of exceptions and of the motion for the
execution of the judgment or, in lieu thereof, the filing of a bond,
the respondent judge entered an order directing the issuance of a writ
of execution of said judgment against the defendant Rafael Palma,
unless within ten days from December 16, 1933, he should file a bond
for P14,000.</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 4, 1934, counsel for the respondent
Rafael Palma filed a motion for reconsideration supported by an
affidavit which was made an integral part thereof. On January 10, 1934,
while the motion for reconsideration filed on January 4, 1934, by the
respondent Rafael Palma was pending decision, the respondent judge
issued an order approving the bill of exceptions presented by the said
respondent Rafael Palma. Pursuant to said order, the deputy clerk of
the second branch of the Court of First Instance of Manila, on February
16, 1934, certified the approval of said bill of exceptions.</p>
<p align="justify"> On February 16, 1934, the clerk of the Court of
First Instance of Manila notified the parties that the bill of
exceptions of the respondent Rafael Palma had been transmitted to this
court, and on February 19th of the same year the clerk of this court,
in turn, notified the said parties of the receipt of said bill of
exceptions and of the amount to be paid for docketing fees and for
printing said bill of exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> After the said bill of exceptions
of the respondent Rafael Palma had been transmitted, and while the
same, together with all its exhibits, was before this court, the
respondent judge, on February 21, 1934, entered an order as follows:<br>
      <br>
"Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration filed on February
4th last together with the affidavit of the defendant surety Rafael
Palma, and the court being of the opinion that, in view of the facts
stated under oath in the said affidavit, there exist sufficient grounds
for reconsidering the order issued on December 16th last; said order is
hereby set aside and it is declared that there is no legal
justification for issuing a writ of execution of the judgment against
said defendant Mr. Palma. So ordered.</p>

<p align="justify"> On February 26, 1934, the clerk of this court sent
to the parties the required number of copies of the printed bill of
exceptions, the case having been docketed in this court as G. R. No.
41320.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup></p>
<p align="justify"> On March 6,1934, the petitioner filed with the
respondent judge a motion for reconsideration seeking to set aside his
order dated February 21, 1934, the same having been issued beyond his
jurisdiction, and the case being on appeal before this court and the
bill of exceptions already printed. After the hearing of said motion,
the respondent judge, on March 10, 1934, issued an order as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Upon consideration of the motion
filed on the 6th instant by counsel for the plaintiff, praying this
court to set aside its order of February 21st last, whereby the order
dated December 16, 1933, was reconsidered and the defendant Rafael
Palma relieved from complying with the terms of said order of December
16th; considering that the bill of exceptions presented by said
defendant Rafael Palma was improperly approved on January 10th,
inasmuch as on that date the motion filed by said defendant on January
4th, praying that this court set aside the order issued on December
16th last, wherein he was required to file a bond for P14,000 in order
that execution of the judgment might be suspended, was still pending
resolution, of which motion, to be heard on the 13th of the same month,
counsel for the plaintiff was notified on January 4th; considering
that, when the bill of exceptions was approved on January 10th, said
motion of the defendant Rafael Palma had not yet been acted upon and
therefore the bill of exceptions should not have been approved until
after said motion had been decided; the motion for reconsideration
filed on January 17th by counsel for the plaintiff is hereby denied and
the bill of exceptions presented by the defendant Rafael Palma is
hereby approved. So ordered.</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In view of the facts above stated, the question
arises whether or not the respondent judge acted in excess of his
jurisdiction in setting aside his order of December 16, 1933, requiring
the respondent Rafael Palma to file a bond for P14,000 for the
suspension of the execution of the judgment rendered against him, and
otherwise ordering its execution, after having approved the bill of
exceptions presented by the said respondent, after the bill of
exceptions had been certified to this court by the clerk of the Court
of First Instance of Manila, and after the clerk of this court had
notified the parties of the receipt of said bill of exceptions and of
the amount to be paid for docketing fees and for printing said bill of
exceptions.</p>
<p align="justify"> The continuation or lossof the jurisdiction of a
Court of First Instance to take cognizance of a civil action in case of
appeal depends upon the perfecting of the bill of exceptions, in
accordance with the statutory provisions on the subject. As soon as the
appeal is perfected, the court trying a case loses its jurisdiction
over the subject matter of the appeal, and said jurisdiction is
acquired by the appellate court (3 Corpus Juris, page 1252, sec. 1366),
and the trial court cannot enter any further decree or order affecting
the rights of the parties, for the reason that the appellate court has
acquired jurisdiction over all questions pertaining to the subject
matter on appeal. Neither can the trial court in any manner execute an
act which will affect the jurisdiction acquired by the appellate court,
except such as may be necessary for the protection and preservation of
the subject matter of the appeal, and which do not impair or destroy
the same (3 Corpus Juris, page 1255, sec. 1369).</p>
<p align="justify"> Section 143 of Act No. 190, as amended by section 2
of Act No. 1123, prescribes the procedure to be followed in perfecting
an appeal in ordinary actions, the last judicial proceeding being the
allowance by the judge of the bill of exceptions and its transmission
to the Supreme Court which will take cognizance of the case upon said
bill of exceptions duly certified by the clerk of the Court of First
Instance <em>a quo</em>.</p>
<p align="justify"> In this case, the bill of exceptions had already
been approved by the respondent judge, transmitted to this court by the
clerk of the Court of First Instance of Manila and docketed in the
office of the clerk of this court, the latter having notified the
parties of the receipt thereof and of the amount to be paid for
docketing fees and for printing, when on February 21, 1934, the said
respondent judge reconsidered and set aside his order for the execution
of the judgment dated December 16, 1933. In the case of Rustia <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>
Judge of First Instance of Batangas (44 Phil., 62), this court laid
down the following doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "3. Civil Procedure; Jurisdiction
after Withdrawal of Bill of Exceptions ; Dismissal.—Upon the approval
of the bill of exceptions, the trial court loses its jurisdiction over
all contentious matters connected with the issues in the case, but the
parties may by agreement, and with the consent of the trial court,
withdraw the bill of exceptions before its transmission to the
appellate court and resubmit the case to the jurisdiction of the trial
court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> According to the American jurisprudence and the
doctrine of this court above cited, the respondent judge had already
lost his jurisdiction to proceed with the trial of the contentious
matter, which was the subject of the appeal, when he reconsidered and
revoked his order of execution of the judgment. The execution of a
judgment is a proceeding affecting the rights of the parties, which are
the subject matter thereof, and from which appeal is taken, and its
purpose is not to protect and preserve the subject matter of the
litigation. Therefore, the perfecting of an appeal taken from said
judgment deprives the trial court of its jurisdiction over said
judgment and said jurisdiction is transferred to the appellate court,
and the trial court cannot modify or revoke any order of execution of
the said judgment after the appeal taken therefrom is perfected (3
Corpus Juris, page 1313, sec. 1442).</p>
<p align="justify"> The respondent judge therefore acted without
jurisdiction in reconsidering and setting aside by a decree of February
21, 1934, his order of execution of the judgment dated December 16,
1933, inasmuch as at that time the appeal had already been perfected by
the approval of the bill of exceptions and its transmission thereof to
this court.</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of
the opinion and so hold that, as soon as an appeal is perfected by
means of the approval of the bill of exceptions and the transmission
thereof to the appellate court, the court <em>a quo</em> has no
jurisdiction to reconsider an order entered by it directing the
issuance of a writ of execution of its judgment, although the motion
for reconsideration has been filed before the appeal was perfected.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, the writ of certiorari applied for is
hereby granted and the orders entered hy the respondent judge, dated
February 21 and March 10, 1934, are declared null and void and of no
effect, with costs against the respondent Rafael Palma. So ordered.</p>
