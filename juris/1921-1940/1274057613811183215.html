				<H3>BENITO DE LOS REYES ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BATANGAS AND CHUA PUA HERMANOS, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an original petition for the writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>filed in this court 
by Benito de los Reyes and wife, for the purpose of quashing an order of the 
Court of First Instance of Batangas granting an attachment of property belonging 
to the plaintiffs, in an action instituted in the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Batangas, wherein the respondents Chua Pua Hermanos are plaintiffs 
and the petitioners defendants. The cause has been here submitted upon the 
answer of the defendants.</p>
<p>The question presented in this case is whether in a proceeding to foreclose 
a mortgage upon land, the court entertaining such proceeding can issue an 
attachment against other property of the defendants than such as is included in 
the mortgage, upon a showing, by affidavit, that the mortgaged property is 
insufficient to pay the mortgage debt and that the defendants are attempting to 
alienate their unmortgaged property to other persons with intent to defraud the 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the court has such authority. The affidavit 
accompanying the application for attachment shows, in conformity with the 
requirement of section 426 of the Code of Civil Procedure, that the value of the 
mortgaged property is not sufficient to satisfy the debt. In addition to this it 
is alleged in the affidavit that the defendants are attempting to dispose of 
their other property, meaning property not mortgaged to the plaintiff, with 
intent to defraud the plaintiff. This is in conformity with the requirement of 
subsection 5 of section 412 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>Under section 424 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an attachment may be 
obtained at or after the commencement of the plaintiff's "action." The word 
"action," as used in this provision, includes in our opinion a proceeding for 
the foreclosure of a mortgage. This is of course directed primarily to the 
property covered by the mortgage, but under section 260 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, the mortgage creditor is entitled to judgment for any excess 
remaining due upon the mortgage debt after the mortgaged property shall have 
been sold; and this judgment for the balance due is entered upon motion in the 
foreclosure proceeding itself. This fact, taken in connection with the statement 
of the affidavit to the effect that the mortgaged property was insufficient in 
value to cover the indebtedness due to the plaintiff, made a case where it was 
proper to grant an attachment upon the facts stated.</p>
<p>It results that the trial court did not act irregularly in excess of its 
jurisdiction, in granting the attachment which is the subject pf this 
petition.</p>
<p>The petition will therefore he dismissed, and it is so ordered, with costs 
against the petitioners.</p>

VillarReal, JJ.</i>, concur.<br></p></div>
