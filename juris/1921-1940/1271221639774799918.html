				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner and appellant claims as&nbsp; a resident Chinese merchant that he is entitled to the admission to these Islands of his wife and three minor children who were denied admission by&nbsp; a board of special inquiry of the Bureau of Customs on the&nbsp; ground that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was a merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal the Acting Collector of Customs&nbsp; confirmed the decision&nbsp; of a board&nbsp; of special inquiry.&nbsp; A&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; habeas corpus&nbsp; was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila on&nbsp; behalf of the applicant, which petition&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case&nbsp; is now brought&nbsp; here on appeal.<br><br>Petitioner showed that he had a 2&nbsp; per cent interest in a Chinese co-partnership of Seng Kee &amp; Company.&nbsp; A certified copy of the articles of the co-partnership was produced and,shows that the co-partnership is&nbsp; engaged in importing and&nbsp; exporting,&nbsp; manufacturing,&nbsp; and general commercial enterprises.&nbsp; The value of petitioner's&nbsp; interest of said co- partnership is placed at the sum, of&nbsp; P4,500.&nbsp; It is also shown that he is employed by the firm as a customs broker at a&nbsp; salary in&nbsp; the&nbsp; neighborhood&nbsp; of a&nbsp; thousand&nbsp; pesos (P1,000) per annum, but is not shown by any satisfactory proof that he is actually&nbsp; engaged in buying and&nbsp; selling merchandise&nbsp; in connection with the&nbsp; business&nbsp; of Seng Kee &amp; Company.&nbsp; It was also&nbsp; claimed by petitioner at the hearing that he formerly&nbsp; owned an independent mercantile business in the City of Manila of the value of P45,000 which had been burned&nbsp; and on which&nbsp; the insurance was unpaid.&nbsp; The nature of this business and all other&nbsp; details relative thereto&nbsp; was not shown by the&nbsp; applicant who disclaimed knowledge of its affairs&nbsp; saying that the business was in the hands of his manager.<br><br>The real question presented may&nbsp; be simply stated.&nbsp; It is;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does ownership&nbsp; in. a&nbsp; Chinese co-partnership engaged in mercantile enterprises make such a&nbsp; holder a merchant within the&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; Exclusion&nbsp; Act?&nbsp;&nbsp; Prom&nbsp; a practical standpoint, the ownership&nbsp; of one&nbsp; share of stock can&nbsp; not make a man a capitalist.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ownership of&nbsp; one&nbsp; share of stock of a mining corporation does not make a&nbsp; man a miner. If the ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp; a minor share in a mercantile&nbsp; co-partnership would make, as a matter of law, a merchant out of a&nbsp; laborer, it is easy to&nbsp; see how&nbsp; Chinese co-partnerships of the Philippines would expand and&nbsp; how&nbsp; impossible it would&nbsp; be to&nbsp; enforce the&nbsp; Chinese Exclusion&nbsp; Act. The customs officials in administering the Immigration Law must determine&nbsp; whether the applicant is or is not in fact a merchant and the mere ownership of a share in a mercantile business is not conclusive&nbsp; that a person occupies that status.&nbsp; Congress has denied&nbsp; a&nbsp; merchant as used&nbsp; in the Chinese Exclusion Act as:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; a person engaged in buying and selling merchandise, at a fixed place&nbsp; of business,&nbsp; which business is conducted in his name, and who during the time he&nbsp; claims to be engaged as a merchant,&nbsp; does not engage in the performance of any manual labor, except such as is necessary in the conduct of his business&nbsp; as such merchant."&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. C. A. tit.&nbsp; 8, sec. 289.)<br><br>The contention of petitioner&nbsp; and appellant is disposed of by the decision of the Supreme&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tulsidas&nbsp; vs. Collector of Customs&nbsp; (262 U. S., 258, 264.)<br><br>"A merchant is the&nbsp; owner of the business; a salesman or manager, a servant of it;&nbsp; and especially so under the Immigration Law.&nbsp; The policy of the law must be kept in mind.&nbsp; It is careful to distinguish between the status of a merchant and those below that status.&nbsp; A merchant is fixed in it and made constant to it by&nbsp; his financial interest; a salesman or manager is but an employee, however else he may be denominated, and may withdraw from his employment at any moment of time and become a competitor in the ranks of labor, using the word in the sense the law implies."</blockquote>After&nbsp; reviewing the record of the board&nbsp; of special inquiry and the action of the Insular Collector&nbsp; of Customs it can not be said that they have abused the authority and discretion&nbsp; vested in&nbsp; them by law.&nbsp; The judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Street,&nbsp; Villamor,&nbsp; Villa-Real,&nbsp;&nbsp; Abad Santos, Vickers, Imperial,</i> and <i>Butte, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
