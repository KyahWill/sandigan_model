<p align="center">STATEMENT</p>
<p>It is alleged that on January 30, 1920, the plaintiff, who is a resident of 
Manila, and the defendant, a domestic cor- poration, made the following 
agreement:</p>
<p>"MACONDRAY &amp; CO."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Manila, P. I."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Through G. H. Hayward.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"SIRS: Appertaining to the residence to be erected for your firm in Pasay, 
for which I have been requested by G. H. Hayward to submit a proposition, I have 
the honor to state that I have examined the plans and site and would undertake 
the work and complete the building in accordance with the plans and 
instructions, and under the supervision of the said architect for the amount of 
the actual cost plus twelve and one-half per cent (12½%).</p>
<p>"Payments to be made monthly on statements supported by vouchers, approved 
and certified to by the architect. "ft is understood that time is an important 
provision, and with due consideration therefor materials suitable for the work 
are to be purchased in such quantities and at such times as may appear to be,to 
your best interest.</p>

<p>That plaintiff commenced the construction of the building under the 
supervision of the architect, and continued the work thereon until near its 
completion, and kept and performed all the terms and provisions of the contract 
by him to be kept and performed, and that pursuant to such agreement he paid out 
for labor and materials the sum of P20,287.03, which was the actual cost; and 
that the defendant is indebted to him in the further sum of P2,535.83, being 12½ 
per cent of the actual cost of such labor and materials, and for and on account 
of his services and superintendence of the building, and he prays judgment for 
P22,822.86, with interest from the filing of the complaint and costs.</p>
<p>In its second amended answer, after admitting the making of the contract and 
the formal allegations of the complaint, the defendant denies all other material 
allegations, and, as a special defense, alleges that, through plaintiff's 
negligence in the construction of the building and the purchase of materials, 
the defendant was damaged in the sum of P32,624.25, as specified in seven 
different counterclaims. It is then alleged that the plaintiff was indebted to 
the Luneta Motor Company in the sum of P702.49, and to the Insular Lumber 
Company in the sum of P9,766.23, both of which claims are assigned to the 
defendant, and it prays judgment against the plaintiff for the total of all of 
such claims amounting to P43.092.97.</p>
<p>The parties entered into a stipulation as to certain exhibits, and upon such 
issues, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for 
P12,201.99, with legal interest from the filing of the complaint and costs, from 
which the defendant appeals, contending that the court erred in allowing 
interest from the filing of the complaint, and in its computation and as to the 
duplicated item of the Tuason &amp; Sampedro bill, in refusing to receive 
evidence of the rental value of the house, in failing to make special findings 
of fact, and in failing to find that the delay caused in the completion of the 
house was caused by plaintiff's negligence, in finding for the plaintiff on 
defendant's second counterclaim for damages in the sum of P797, in finding for 
the plaintiff on defendant's third counterclaim for damages in the sum of 
P5,440.11, and in finding for the plaintiff on defendant's fourth counterclaim 
for damages in the sum of P13,407.25, the amount of the alleged increase in the 
cost of labor caused by plaintiff's negligence.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Plaintiff's cause of action is founded upon the contract above quoted, the 
making of which defendant admits. By its express terms, plaintiff says that he 
"would undertake the work and complete the building in accordance with the plans 
and instructions, and under the supervision of the said architect for the amount 
of the actual cost plus twelve and one-half per cent (12½%)." Payments are to be 
made on monthly statements accompanied by vouchers to be approved and certified 
by the architect. It then recites:</p>
<p>"It is understood that time is an important provision, and with due 
consideration therefor materials suitable for the work are to be purchased in 
such quantities and at such times as may appear to be to your best 
interest."</p>
<p>To say the least, the contract was very loosely drawn. No date is specified 
in which the building is to be completed, and time is not made the essence of 
the contract. It is true that the materials were to be purchased in such 
quantities and at such times as may appear to be to the defendant's 
interest.</p>
<p>The defense is founded upon the theory that the labor was not furnished and 
that the materials were not purchased for its best interest. There is no claim 
or pretense of fraud, or that the plaintiff was dishonest. In its final 
analysis, defendant's counterclaims are founded upon plaintiff's mistakes and. 
errors of judgment in the employment of labor and the purchase of materials.</p>
<p>Assuming that there were mistakes and errors of judgment only, the plaintiff 
would not be liable for them under the contract. The fact that the price of 
lumber or of labor went up or down, or was cheaper at a certain time, would not 
make the plaintiff liable for a breach of contract, so long as he was exercising 
his best judgment and acting in good faith.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the materials were to be purchased "in such quantities 
and at such times as may appear to be to your best interest." That vested in the 
plaintiff a discretionary power as to the time and manner for the purchase of 
materials, for which he would not be liable for honest mistakes or errors of 
judgment. The same thing is true as to the employment of labor. It is true that 
the contract recites "that time is an important provision." But it does not say 
when the building is to be completed, or that time is of the essence of the 
contract. In other words, under the terms of the contract, the employment of 
labor, the purchase of materials and the completion and construction of the 
building were all matters which were largely left to the discretion of the 
plaintiff, for which he would not be liable for honest mistakes or errors of 
judgment.</p>
<p>Pending the trial the judge of the lower court made a personal inspection of 
the building and of the labor and materials used in its construction, and upon 
all of such questions, we agree with the trial court.</p>
<p>Although this action is founded upon contract, the amount of plaintiff's 
claim was vigorously disputed. In fact the defendant claimed judgment against 
the plaintiff for a much larger amount. Upon such a state of facts, and under 
recent decisions of this court, plaintiff is only entitled to interest from the 
date of the judgment, and defendant's first assignment of error must be 
sustained. It also appears that a clerical error was made in computing 12½ per 
cent on P1,772.14, and that the amount which should be deducted was P221.52 and 
not P22.15, as found by the trial court. Correcting this error, the amount of 
plaintiff's judgment should be P12,002.63.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court will be modified, and instead of P12,201.99, 
the amount of plaintiff's judgment will be P12,002.63, which will draw interest 
at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the first day of August, 1923, the date 
of the judgment in the lower court. In all other respects, the judgment is 
affirmed, with costs in favor of the appellant in this court. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Araullo, C. J., Street, Avancena, Ostrand,</em> and<em> Romualdez, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
