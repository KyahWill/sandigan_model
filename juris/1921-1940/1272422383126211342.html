				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Two
informations were filed in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo
against the appellant. In the first he was charged with homicide
committed on March 5, 1925, by striking with a bolo one Alitancio
Falsario, inflicting a wound on him which caused his death. In the
second, which charged him with physical injuries, it is alleged that on
that same day he assaulted Pedro Noalla with a bolo inflicting a wound
on his head which necessitated medical attendance for more than seven
days and less than thirty and rendered him unable to engage in his
ordinary work during the said time. By agreement of the parties both
causes were heard jointly. After two witnesses for the prosecution had
testified, the court, holding that the crime was committed at least
with premeditation, dismissed the information for homicide and ordered
the fiscal to file another for murder. Complying with said order, the
provincial fiscal filed an information charging the herein appellant
with the crime of murder, alleging that in the commission of the act he
acted with premeditation and treachery. By agreement of the parties the
evidence already presented under the information for homicide was
considered as introduced under the new information for murder and the
trial of the two cases proceeded.
  <p> In the murder case the
court, considering premeditation as a qualifying circumstance and the
aggravating circumstance of treachery offset by the mitigating
circumstance of lack of instruction, sentenced the appellant to the
penalty of life imprisonment, with the accessories of the law, to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P1,000, and to pay
the costs.</p>
  <p>    In the case for physical injuries the court sentenced the appellant to one year and one day of<em> prision correccional</em>,
with the accessories of the law, and to indemnify the offended party in
the amount of P86, with the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in
case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>
  <p> According to the
evidence of the prosecution, the facts are: That on the night of March
5, 1925, in the municipality of Miagao, Iloilo, at the time when Sabina
Muynuyan, wife of Alitancio Falsario, was in her house working on a
spinning wheel the appellant arrived and lay down on the floor, placing
his head on the thigh of Sabina. The woman told the appellant to go to
his house if he wanted to sleep and not to make any scandalous show in
another house; to which the accused answered that he would kill
everybody for having let Sabina's sister, with whom he was in love, to
leave for another town; that Alitancio Falsario then arrived and
dismissed the appellant, threatening him by saying that if he did not
get out, something wrong would happen to him; to which the appellant
replied, "you shall pay me for this," and immediately left the house;
that Sabina then requested her husband Alitancio Falsario to go and get
some water from the bamboo container that they had downstairs; that
when Alitancio Falsario went down for this purpose, Sabina looked out
from the window and saw the appellant standing beside the fence of the
house; that Alitancio Falsario had hardly set foot on the ground when
the appellant gave him a bolo blow on the left side of the neck; that
Pedro Noalla, half-brother of the appellant by their mother, who was
coming home from the fields and who passed by the place at the very
moment that the appellant was assaulting Alitancio, intervened and
asked the appellant why he was assaulting Alitancio, and the appellant
turning to him said, "and you too," thereupon striking him with a bolo
on the head.</p>
  <p> Alitancio Falsario died as a consequence of the
wound inflicted upon him by the appellant, and Pedro Noalla
necessitated medical attendance and was unable to engage in his
habitual labor for forty-six days as a consequence of the wound he
received.</p>
  <p> According to the accused, when he went to the
house of the deceased that night, feeling very tired, he lay down on
the floor and fell asleep for a short time until the arrival of the
deceased who told him to go home if he did not want anything1 bad to
happen to him; that after leaving and once in his own house he
perceived that there was a quarrel in the deceased's house; that after
a while he noticed that the deceased, who was on the ground floor of
the appellant's house, was inviting him to come down; that when he came
down, seeing the deceased was armed with a bolo, he did not dare
approach him; hence the deceased rushed toward the appellant and
assaulted him; that having dodged the blow and disarmed the deceased,
the latter took hold of a stick and continued assaulting him, one of
the blows having hit him on the frontal region; that since the deceased
resumed striking him, he brandished the bolo and unconsciously wounded
the deceased; that thereupon he dropped the bolo and ran to the town,
presenting himself the next day to the authorities. The other evidence
of the defense tends to establish the fact that it was the deceased who
inflicted the wound on the head of Pedro Noalla.</p>
  <p> The lower
court rejected the defendant's version of the case and accepted the
facts as stated by the prosecution, and we find that this holding is
supported by the evidence. The testimony of Pedro Noalla, one of the
witnesses for the prosecution and the offended party in the case for
physical injuries, is of special merit in view of the fact that he is a
brother of the appellant and there is nothing in the record to show any
motive on his part to ascribe to his brother the facts to which he has
testified. On the contrary, being a brother of the appellant, he would
naturally have tried to help the latter, and as an offended party he
would have been actuated by the desire to punish the culprit.</p>
  <p>
Relating to the murder case, the defense alleges that since the first
information for homicide was dismissed, the appellant was placed in
jeopardy and could not have been prosecuted nor convicted under the
second information for murder. It should be noted that the dismissal of
the first information was ordered so that the defendant might be
prosecuted for the graver crime of murder, as shown by the evidence, in
accordance with section 37 of General Orders No. 58, and the dismissal
under these circumstances does not constitute jeopardy, nor any bar to
the prosecution for the graver offense of murder. (People <i>vs.</i> Mirasol, 43 Phil., 860.)</p>
  <p>
The trial court has found that the commission of the crime was attended
by the circumstance of premeditation. We do not believe that there is
sufficient evidence in the record to establish this circumstance. The
only proof to this effect that we can find in the record is the fact
that the appellant was courting the deceased's sister-in-law and that
on the night of the crime the accused made known his resentment for the
deceased having allowed said sister-in-law to move to another town.
This alone is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that the accused
acted with evident premeditation.</p>
  <p> The circumstance of
treachery, however, is present and this qualifies the act as murder.
The appellant stood by the fence and instantly attacked the deceased
when the latter was not aware of his presence there and did not expect
the assault.</p>
  <p> As to the case for physical injuries, although
the court has found that the offended party Pedro Noalla was
incapacitated for his habitual work for forty-six days, the information
only alleges that the incapacity was for thirty days. Consequently the
appellant can be convicted in this case only under the provisions of
article 418 of the Penal Code.</p>
  <p> The accused is held guilty of
the crime of murder committed upon the person of Alitancio Falsario,
qualified by the circumstance of treachery, with the mitigating
circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, as amended and as applied
by the trial court, and he is sentenced to seventeen years, four months
and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessories of
the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of
P1,000, Philippine currency, and to pay the costs.</p>
  <p> The
appellant is also held guilty of the crime of slight physical injuries,
under article 418 of the Penal Code, committed upon the person of Pedro
Noalla, with the aggravating circumstance of relationship, compensated
by the mitigating circumstance of article 11 of the Penal Code, and he
is sentenced to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>, to
indemnify the offended party Pedro Noalla in the amount of P86, with
the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and
with the costs. So ordered.</p>
