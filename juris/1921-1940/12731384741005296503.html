				<H3>PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. TAN ONG ZSE, VDA. DE TAN TOCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In  this instance the plaintiff  Philippine  National Bank appeals from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dismissing said plaintiff's complaint against the defendant Tan  Ong Zse Vda.  de Tan Toco  for the sum of P357,075.80, plus interest on the capital ofP300,000 at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from November 15, 1924 until fully paid, and an additional sum equivalent to 10 per cent of said  amount as attorney's fees, with the  costs of  the action.  It was further prayed that, should the defendant fail to pay the amount of the judgment within the period of three months from the date thereof, the mortgaged property  be ordered sold at public auction; and furthermore, should the proceeds from the mortgaged property be insufficient to cover the amount of the judgment that a writ of attachment be issued against whatever other property the defendant may have not exempt from execution.<br><br>In support of its appeal,  the appellant bank assigns the following alleged  errors as  committed  by the trial court in its decision, to wit: (1) In striking out from the record all of the testimony of witness Ramon Mendoza;  (2)  in finding  that the defendant Tan Ong Zse's  attorneys had asked, during the hearing, that all of Ramon Mendoza's testimony  be stricken out;  (3)  in refusing  to admit  as plaintiff's evidence, the documents marked Exhibits  A,  B, C, D, E and F; (4)  in not finding that the evidence shows that  Tan Bunco or  Mariano de la Rama Tan Bunco was empowered to administer and mortgage the  property  of the defendant Tan Ong Zse Vda. de Tan Toco; (5) in not finding that  the promissory note Exhibit B  and the  mortgage deed Exhibit E are  obligations contracted by the defendant Tan Ong Zse to the  Philippine  National  Bank through M. de la Rama Tan Bunco, her attorney in fact; (6)  in  not finding that on  May  23, 1922,  the defendant Tan Ong Zse Vda, de Tan Toco obtained a loan of P300,000 from the Philippine National Bank, with interest at 8 per cent  per annum; (7) in not holding that on May 28, 1927, the defendant Tan Ong Zse Vda.  de Tan Toco owed the Philippine National  Bank, for  the loan secured by Exhibit E, the sum of P414,333.35 and that the Philippine National Bank is entitled to recover said sum from the defendant; (8) in not sentencing the defendant Tan Ong Zse Vda. de Tan  Toco  to  pay  the plaintiff  bank  the said  sum of P414,333.35 with interest at 8  per cent per annum from March 29,  1927 until fully  paid,  plus 10 per cent of the total  debt by way of attorney's fees, and the  costs of the action; (9)  in not ordering that, if after the lapse  of three months from the date of the judgment,  the defendant has not paid to the plaintiff the said sum of P414,333.35  with interest at 8 per cent per annum from March 29, 1927, plus 10 per cent of the total debt, and  the costs of the action, the sheriff  of the Province  of Iloilo should sell at public auction the mortgaged property described in Exhibit E; and (10) in dismissing the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.<br><br>The principal question to determine in the present appeal,  and on which depends  the  solution  of the other questions  raised by the remaining assignments of error, is that contained in the fourth assignment of error, with reference to the sufficiency of the evidence to establish the existence of a power of attorney from the  defendant Tan Ong Zse Vda.  de  Tan Toco to Mariano de la Rama Tan Bunco to administer  and mortgage property belonging to her.<br><br>The only evidence presented by  the plaintiff's entity to prove the existence of such  power  of attorney is the original certificate of title, Exhibit  F, issued to Tan Ong Zse Vda. de  Tan Toco,  on the  back  of which, among other things, there is  a memorandum which reads:<br><br><blockquote><i>Memorandum of the incumbrances affecting the property  described in the original certificate of title No. 329, issued in favor of Tan Ong Zse, a widow</i><br><br><table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="center">Doc.

It cites, in support of its claim, section 47 of Act No. 496, which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec.  47. The  original certificate in the registration book, any copy thereof duly certified under  the  signature of the clerk, or of the register of deeds of  the province or city where the land is situate, and the seal of the court, and also  the  owner's duplicate certificate, shall be received as evidence in all the courts  of the Philippine Islands  and shall  be conclusive as to  all matters contained therein except so far  as otherwise provided in this Act."</blockquote><br>From a careful examination of the  section just quoted, it will be seen that it is the original certificate in the registration book,  a copy thereof  certified under the signature of the clerk  of court  or  of the registrar of deeds of the province or city in which the land is  situated, the duplicate of the same for the owner, and the seal of the  court that must be  received as conclusive evidence of all the matters contained therein.<br><br>Section 41 of the same Act defines a "certificate of title" as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 41. Immediately  upon the entry of the decree of registration the clerk shall send a certified copy thereof, under the seal  of  the court,  to the  register of  deeds for the province,  or provinces, or city in  which the land  lies, and  the register of deeds shall transcribe  the decree in a book to be called  the 'Registration Book,' in which a leaf, or leaves, in consecutive order, shall  be devoted  exclusively to each title.   The entry made by the register of deeds in this book in  each  case shall  be the  original certificate of title, and shall be  signed by him and  sealed with the seal of the court.   *   *  *"</blockquote><br>According to this  legal definition, the certificate  of the title is the transcript  of the decree of  registration made by the  registrar of deeds in the  registry.<br><br>And, according to section  40 of the same Act, the  decree of registration must  contain the following data:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 40.  Every  decree  of  registration shall bear the day  of  the year, hour, and  minute of its entry, and shall be signed by the  clerk.  It  shall  state whether the  owner is married or unmarried, and if married, the name  of the husband or wife.  If the owner is under disability, it shall state the nature  of  the  disability, and  if a  minor, shall state his age.   It shall contain a description of the land as finally determined by  the court, and shall set forth the estate of the owner,  and also,  in  such manner as to show their relative  priority, all  particular estates, mortgages, easements, liens, attachments, and other incumbrances, including rights  of husband or  wife, if  any,  to which the land or owner's estate is subject, and  may  contain any other matter properly to be determined in  pursuance of this  Act.   The decree shall be stated in a convenient form for transcription  upon the certificates of title hereinafter mentioned."<br></blockquote><br>If, according to the above cited section 47, only the orig- inal  certificate  in the registry of  deeds, a certified copy of the same, or  the seal of the court, will be admitted as conclusive proof of its contents and if, according to section 41, also  above quoted, the original  certificate  of title  is  no other than the transcript of the decree of registration made in the registration book, then the notations or memoranda on the back of the certificate of title are not admissible as proof of  the contents of the  documents  to which they refer, inasmuch as they do not form a part of the contents of the decree of registration.  The said notations or memoranda are, at most, proof of  the existence of the  transactions  and judicial  orders  noted, which affect the  registered land, of its presentation to the registrar, of its entry in the registry, and a notice to the whole world of such facts, as provided for in section 51 of said Act No. 496, which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec.  51.  Every conveyance, mortgage,  lease, lien, attachment,  order,  decree,  instrument,  or  entry affecting registered land which would under existing laws, if recorded, filed, or entered in the office of the register of deeds, affect the real estate to which it relates shall, if registered, filed, or entered in the office of the register of deeds in the province or city where the real estate to which such instrument relates lies, be notice to all persons from the time of such registering, filing, or entering."</blockquote><br>It could  not  have been the  Legislature's intention  to make the original  certificate  of title,  or a certified copy thereof, or a duplicate of the same for the owner, conclusive proof not only of its contents  but also of the contents of the documents and judicial  orders  noted since, unlike the original certificates of title  or  certified copies thereof, said notation do not contain the full text of the  documents or judicial orders noted, but only  a memorandum, or extract  of the same,  consisting of  the  designation  of the kind of the  document,  the name of the person to whom it was issued, the date of its execution and the date and hour of its registration.   It would  be extremely  hazardous to accept such notations or memoranda as conclusive proof of the contents of the documents or judicial orders noted, because then the document itself which is an unquestionable and indubitable evidence  of  its contents  would be  supplanted by an extract of its contents made by the registrar, which extract might be erroneous  and might not give the true sense of the conditions stipulated therein.   And even if such an extract were as  exact as could be desired, still, it cannot be a guarantee  of the authenticity and due execution of the document from which the extract is made. Moreover, it would  be contrary to the fundamental  rule that the document  itself is the  best proof  of its contents and that only in case of destruction or loss can secondary or suppletory proof of the same be admitted.   (Sec. 321, Act No. 190.)<br><br>In the case of Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Martinez and Martinez (44 Phil., 817), this court, speaking of the probatory  value of the registration in the public registry, said the following:<br><br><blockquote>"1. Evidence;  Primary  and  Secondary.â€”While it is true that the record  of any document in a public registry is a public document, yet  before the record or a certified copy of the recital made in a public registry of the contents of a deed of sale,  may be admitted as evidence of the contents of said deed, it  is indispensable to establish first that said deed really existed, was duly executed and was lost; for while it may be true that  said document was really presented to the registry, as stated in  the entry or the books of the registry, yet the document actually presented  may have been falsified or simulated, and may not have really been executed  by the parties appearing thereon to have signed the same.  And  if  it really existed, it  should be presented  unless it is proven to have been  lost, in which case, and only then, secondary evidence may be introduced."</blockquote><br>By analogy,  we may  say that the memorandum of a power  of attorney noted on the back of an original certificate of title is not admissible as proof of the contents of said power of attorney, but only of the fact of its execution, of its presentation for notation and  of its notation for the purposes of public notification in connection with the creation of  preferential  rights to the registered land covered by the title.<br><br>The  non-presentation of the power of attorney  as evidence of the authority conferred by the defendant Tan Ong Zse Vda. de Tan Toco upon Mariano  de la Rama Tan Bunco to administer and mortgage her property,  deprives us of the best means  of determining whether the acts performed by the  alleged attorney in fact are included in the  powers conferred by said power of attorney.<br><br>In  view of the importance of the  case, in the interest of equity and justice it is ordered  that it be reopened and the record be  remanded to the  court of  origin for the presentation of the power of attorney together with such evidence  connected therewith  as  the  parties might  deem fit to  present, without the necessity of again submitting that already presented at the original trial, and that a new judgment be  rendered in accordance with all the evidence in the record, without special pronouncement as to costs.  So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">AvanceÃ±a,  C.J.,  Johnson,  Street,  Malcolm,  Villamor, Ostrand, </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Johns, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
