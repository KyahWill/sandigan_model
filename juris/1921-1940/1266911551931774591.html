				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; October&nbsp; 30, 1929, the appellant&nbsp; Moro Makabangan was sentenced, for the crime of homicide, to twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P500, and to pay the costs. It was provided in said sentence to suspend the execution thereof on condition that the accused behave well and not again&nbsp; be accused of any crime in the courts of justice of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands.&nbsp; Section 106 of the Administrative Code for the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, among other things, authorizes the judge, at his discretion at any time before the expiration of the period allowed for appeal, to suspend the execution of any penalty or part thereof imposed upon the accused, subject&nbsp; to such&nbsp; conditions as he may prescribe.&nbsp; This is the law by virtue of which the court suspended&nbsp; the execution of the sentence imposed upon the appellant.<br><br>On July 22,1935, charges for the crime of abduction with consent were filed against the appellant in the&nbsp; justice of the peace court of Dulawan, Province of Cotabato. On the 30th of&nbsp; said month, the provincial&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; petitioned&nbsp; the court to&nbsp; order the execution of said sentence, alleging that the appellant, having been accused of the crime of abduction, violated the conditions&nbsp; imposed by the court upon suspending the sentence against&nbsp; him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court&nbsp; acted favorably upon the petition and it is&nbsp; from said&nbsp; resolution that the&nbsp; appeal was taken whereby the&nbsp; case is now before this&nbsp; court<br><br>The&nbsp; question involved&nbsp; in this appeal&nbsp; is simply whether or not the appellant, having been&nbsp; accused of a crime, violated the conditions imposed by the court in suspending the execution of the sentence rendered against him.&nbsp; Applying literally that part of the&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; imposing upon the appellant the condition not to&nbsp; be accused of any crime, the question should be decided in the affirmative.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; this&nbsp; literal interpretation,&nbsp; which would&nbsp; make said condition&nbsp; unreasonable,&nbsp; cannot be given to it because it does&nbsp; not&nbsp; depend upon the appellant,&nbsp; being&nbsp; innocent,&nbsp; to avoid being accused of a crime by anybody.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to impose&nbsp; upon&nbsp; him&nbsp; a condition the fulfillment&nbsp; of which may depend&nbsp; upon another,&nbsp; not upon&nbsp; him.<br><br>It should be understood&nbsp; that the true meaning of this condition&nbsp; is&nbsp; for the appellant not to&nbsp; commit,&nbsp; or be convicted of any crime, in which case it might be said that he has given proof that he is in no condition&nbsp; for the realization of the purpose of the law which is his reformation.<br><br>Therefore, the condition imposed upon the&nbsp; appellant for his release cannot be considered violated by the mere fact that he had been accused of a crime, but when he be convicted thereof by final judgment.<br><br>The resolution of the court, ordering the execution&nbsp; of the sentence imposed upon the&nbsp; appellant, is reversed, with the costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br><i>Villa-Real,&nbsp; Abad Santos,&nbsp; Imperial,&nbsp; Diaz, Recto,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
