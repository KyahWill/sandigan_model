				<H3>THE CITY OF MANILA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ASUNCION MITCHEL, VDA. DE SY QUIA, AND MANILA RAILROAD CO., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Two fundamental questions raised in the demurrers to the 
complaint are at issue in this appeal, to wit: The sufficiency of the 
allegations of the complaint, and the inclusion of the Manila Railroad Company 
as defendant. 
<p align="justify">Considering the defendants, Asuncion Mitchel Vda. de Sy Quia, 
as administratrix of the estate of Pedro Sy Quia, and the Manila Railroad 
Company, to be jointly and severally liable, the City of Manila demanded of them 
the payment of the land tax upon property belonging to the estate located at No. 
973-985 Calle Azcarraga, known as lot 1, block No. 14, District of Tondo, for 
the year 1927, which, together with the penalties amounted to P3,053.47. </p>
<p align="justify">It appears from the complaint that in February 1927, the Manila 
Railroad Company acquired said real property by expropriation proceeding. In the 
face of this fact, the defendant administratrix does not believe herself bound 
to pay the tax demanded by the plaintiff, because she alleges that at the time 
the ownership of the property of said estate passed to the Manila Railroad 
Company, said tax was as yet neither due nor payable, but was to become payable 
some five months later, that is on June 30th, as provided by section 2493 of the 
Administrative Code.</p>
<p align="justify">The Manila Railroad Company in turn argues that the obligation 
that would at all events fall upon it would be the one arising from a real 
action against the property itself and not the personal obligation to pay the 
tax as demanded in the complaint, because it would be bound, in due time, only 
by the preferential lien on the realty pursuant to the provisions of section 
2497 of the same Code. For this reason it maintains that the complaint does not 
allege facts sufficient to constitute this personal action brought against it. 
</p>
<p align="justify">It further alleges that it should be excluded from the 
complaint because as its only obligation was to secure the payment of the tax 
with the lien in case the taxpayer failed to do so, and as the complaint does 
not allege that the latter is insolvent and cannot pay it, its inclusion as 
defendant is improper and premature. </p>
<p align="justify">Being of opinion that the tax in question was not yet payable 
at the date when the realty passed from the ownership of the defendant estate to 
that of the Manila Railroad Company, and as said estate no longer owned the 
realty when the tax became demandable, the trial court held that said estate was 
not bound to pay the tax; neither was the new owner, the Manila Railroad 
Company, called upon to pay it, being exempted therefrom by Act No. 1510. Upon 
these grounds the lower court found merit in the demurrers and dismissed the 
complaint. </p>
<p align="justify">However, the City of Manila has the right to bring this action 
against both Pedro Sy Quia's estate and the Manila Railroad Company. </p>
<p align="justify">The former was properly made party defendant, because although 
the law grants an option to pay the land tax in two installments, this does not 
prevent the tax from existing from the first day of the year; and thus it is, 
that from said first day of the year; the realty is subject to the lien, the 
preferential incumbrance, in favor of the State, as conclusively provided in 
section 2497 of the Administrative Code. </p>
<p align="justify">Notwithstanding the fact that the law (2493 of the same Code) 
gives the taxpayer the benefit of the installments, the State is not thereby 
deprived of its right to receive the tax from the first day of year, should the 
taxpayer pay it. What the State relinquishes in granting such periods, is solely 
the right to enforce the payment while the periods still run. </p>
<p align="justify">For this reason whenever, as in the present case, the realty 
subject to the tax changes ownership after the year has begun but before the 
periods allowed by law for its payment have elapsed, the personal responsibility 
for the tax remains in him who was the owner at the beginning of the year; and 
while it is true that before such periods lapse no penalty is imposed for 
failure to pay the tax, it is not so when the periods lapse, for then not only 
the tax but also the penalty is demandable, not from the owner of the property 
at the expiration of the term, but from the owner of the property at the 
beginning of the year, inasmuch as it was from that time incumbent upon the 
owner to answer for the tax. </p>
<p align="justify">In that case the lien, the preferential incumbrance, in favor 
of the State remains on the property in spite of the transfer. It is thus 
provided in section 2497 of the Administrative Code cited above. And this is the 
ground of the action here brought against the Manila Railroad Company. Said 
company is here made defendant as the owner and possessor of the property thus 
subject to the lien in favor of the Treasury in order to submit and deliver said 
property to the enforcement of the lien, should the defendant estate fail to 
satisfy the tax due and the penalties. For this reason its inclusion as 
defendant is not improper or premature. However, the Manila Railroad Company 
does not answer for the personal obligation to pay such tax and penalties, not 
because the law in general exempts it, since we are here concerned with taxes 
corresponding to a year in which the property was still subject to taxation, but 
because it does not appear that said company assumed the obligation to pay it. 
</p>
<p align="justify">This fact, however, does not appear from the allegations of the 
complaint, in accordance with which, for the reasons stated, an action lies 
against both defendants. </p>
<p align="justify">The appealed order is reversed, the demurrers overruled and it 
is hereby ordered that the record be remanded to the court of origin in order 
that the defendants may answer the complaint within the legal period, and let 
the case proceed to its termination. Without costs. So ordered. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ostrand, JJ.</span>, concur.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>MALCOLM, J., WITH WHOM CONCURS VILLA-REAL, J.: 
</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In contrast to section 364 of the Revised Administrative Code 
which is of general application, section 2493 of the Manila Charter provides as 
to the annual tax and penalties that "All taxes shall be due and payable on or 
before the thirtieth day of June of each year, and if any taxpayer shall fail to 
pay the taxes assessed against him on or before the thirtieth day of June of the 
year for which such taxes are due, he shall be delinquent in such payment * * 
*." Section 2497 of the City Charter further provides that "Taxes and penalties 
assessed against realty shall constitute a lien thereon, which shall be superior 
to all other liens, mortgages, or incumbrances of any kind whatsoever; shall be 
enforceable against the property whether in the possession of the <span style="font-style: italic;">delinquent or 
any subsequent owner</span>, and can only be removed by the payment of the tax and 
penalty. A lien upon real estate for taxes levied for each year shall attach on 
the first day of January of such year." Accordingly, applying the law directly 
to the admitted facts, the lien attached to the property of Asuncion Mitchel 
Vda. de Sy Quia on January 1, 1927. However, the land passed out of her 
possession by transfer to the Manila Railroad Company in February, 1927. 
Consequently, Mrs. Sy Quia was not a "delinquent," within the meaning of the 
law, because on June 30, 1927, when the taxes became due and payable she was not 
a taxpayer. As to the "subsequent owner," within the meaning of the law, the 
Manila Railroad Company was not a taxpayer on June 30, 1927, because its 
charter, Act No. 1510, exempted it from all municipal taxes. </p>
<p align="justify">There are points which cannot be reasoned away, and so I think 
that the order of Judge Opisso sustaining the demurrer should be sustained. </p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Order reversed, demurrers overruled and case remanded with 
instructions</span>. </div>
