				<H3>MARIANO MOLO,  PETITIONER, VS. A. L.  YATCO,  COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, ANGEL S. GAMBOA AND  JOSE V.  CABRERA, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for&nbsp; mandamus filed by Mariano Molo against&nbsp; A.&nbsp; L. Yatco, Collector of Internal Revenue, Angel S. Gamboa and Jose V. Cabrera, praying, for the reasons alleged therein, for the issuance of a writ addressed to the above-named respondents&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; them to return&nbsp; and deliver the documents stated in the&nbsp; petition to the&nbsp; herein petitioner immediately, as well as any other orders which the court may&nbsp; deem just and&nbsp; equitable.<br><br>The pertinent facts necessary for the resolution&nbsp; of the legal&nbsp; question raised in this petition are as follows:<br><blockquote>By virtue&nbsp; of a search warrant issued by the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Rizal for an alleged violation of the Usury Law, the&nbsp; special agent of the Anti-Usury&nbsp; Board, Jose V. Cabrera,&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 15, 1935, seized a trunk containing various documents, note books, lists,&nbsp; contracts and other papers&nbsp; belonging to the petitioner&nbsp; Mariano Molo, issuing the corresponding receipt in favor of the latter (Exhibit A). After the necessary investigation,&nbsp; said board, not having found sufficient evidence to warrant the prosecution of said petitioner, dismissed the&nbsp; case.&nbsp; On November&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1935, the petitioner Mariano Molo wrote a letter to said board requesting the&nbsp; return of the documents seized by it,&nbsp; but, it having been&nbsp; discovered during the examination of the documents in question that the petitioner was engaged in the money lending business without the&nbsp; necessary privilege tax receipts required by sections 1453 and 1464 (x) of the Administrative&nbsp; Code, notice thereof was sent to the Collector of Internal Revenue who assigned one of his agents to examine the documents and papers in question.&nbsp; It was found during the examination that the petitioner&nbsp; had engaged in the&nbsp; money lending business in&nbsp; the&nbsp; years&nbsp; 1929, 1931, 1932&nbsp; and 1934, without being provided with the necessary privilege&nbsp; tax receipts.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of this the&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue imposed upon said petitioner a privilege tax in the sum of P350 corresponding to the first quarter of the year 1931, the first, second, third and last quarters of the year 1932, and the third quarter of the year 1934, which sum was&nbsp; paid under protest&nbsp; by the&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; In as much as the act committed by the petitioner constitutes, in the opinion of the Collector of Internal Revenue, a violation of section 2722, in connection with sections 1453 and 1464&nbsp; (x) of the Administrative Code,&nbsp; which makes him amenable to criminal action, said Collector of Internal Revenue, availing himself of the authority conferred upon him by section 1582&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Administrative Code, offered the petitioner the privilege of settling the case extra-judicially by&nbsp; payment of P10.&nbsp; As the petitioner&nbsp; had refused to make a compromise,&nbsp; said collector,&nbsp; in the exercise of the authority granted him by section 1434 of the Administrative Code, in connection with the Bookkeeping Law,&nbsp; Act No. 3292, and section 12 of Rules No.&nbsp; 58 of the Department of Finance, asked the chairman&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Anti-Usury&nbsp; Board to retain possession of the documents and&nbsp; papers&nbsp; seized by his office from the petitioner until the latter's case with the Bureau of Internal Revenue is&nbsp; finally settled.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the above-stated facts the question&nbsp; arises whether or not the writ of mandamus herein applied for should be issued.<br><br>Section 515, in connection with section 222, of the Code of Civil Procedure, authorizes this court to "render a judgment granting a peremptory order against the defendant, commanding him, immediately after the&nbsp; receipt of such order, or at some other specified time, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the plaintiff&nbsp; who has been&nbsp; unlawfully excluded from the&nbsp; use and enjoyment of said rights."</blockquote>According to&nbsp; section 95 of General Orders, No. 58, "a search warrant is an order in writing, issued in the name of the People of the Philippine Islands, signed by a judge or a justice of the peace,&nbsp; and directed to a peace officer, commanding him to&nbsp; search&nbsp; for personal property and bring it before the court,"&nbsp; and the&nbsp; last part of the form of the&nbsp; search&nbsp; warrant prescribed&nbsp; in section 99 of said General&nbsp; Orders, No.&nbsp; 58 reads: "you are, therefore, commanded&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; to&nbsp; bring&nbsp; it forthwith&nbsp; before&nbsp; me *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; It is clear that, under the above-cited sections of General&nbsp; Orders,&nbsp; No. 58, the&nbsp; officer charged with the execution of a search warrant must&nbsp; make a return thereof to the&nbsp; court or&nbsp; judge who, issued&nbsp; it, delivering to said court the personal property seized&nbsp; under the warrant in question.<br><br>It appears from the present case that the documents and other papers&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; the petitioner Mariano Molo, which were seized by a special agent&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Anti-Usury Board by virtue of a warrant issued by the Court of First Instance of Rizal, came into the possession of said board, and&nbsp; while it does not appear how&nbsp; said board came to have them in its possession, it is presumed that it was by virtue of an authority given by said court&nbsp; (sec. 334, No. 31, Act No.&nbsp; 190).&nbsp; By virtue of said authority the board became an agent of the Court of First Instance of Rizal in the custody of the documents in question, with the obligation to return them to said court upon the&nbsp; termination of the investigation for which&nbsp; the board needed them.&nbsp; As the Anti-Usury Board had&nbsp; found&nbsp; no&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; evidence to warrant a criminal action against the&nbsp; petitioner for&nbsp; violation of the Usury Law, and as said board had dismissed the case under investigation, it was duty bound to return said&nbsp; documents and papers to the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Rizal so that the latter might order the return thereof to their owner.<br><br>Although the Collector of Internal Revenue is authorized by section 1434 of the Administrative Code to make seizures for the violation of any penal&nbsp; law or regulation administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, inasmuch as the documents and papers in question are in the custody of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal, through its agent the Anti-Usury Board; said Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue could not seize said documents and papers without authority of said court because it&nbsp; would amount to an undue interference by an administrative&nbsp; official in the affairs of a judicial&nbsp; official.&nbsp; Neither could the&nbsp; Anti-Usury Board keep said documents for itself because, being a mere agent of said court,&nbsp; it was not authorized by its&nbsp; principal to dispose of them.<br><br>Therefore, while the retention of the documents in question by the Anti-Usury Board, upon petition of the Collector of Internal Revenue, is illegal, it not being authorized by the Court of First Instance of Rizal in whose legal custody the&nbsp; documents&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; are, neither the Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue nor the Anti-Usuary Board can be ordered to return said&nbsp; documents&nbsp; to the petitioner on the ground that the one having the legal custody thereof is the Court of First Instance of Rizal&nbsp; which had ordered their seizure and which is the only one authorized by law to return them to their owner.<br><br>Wherefore, without prejudice to the right of the petitioner to ask the Court of First Instance of Rizal for the return&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; documents&nbsp; in&nbsp; question, the petition for a writ of mandamus is denied&nbsp; and it is dismissed, without special pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><i><br>&nbsp;Avanceila, C.&nbsp; J.,</i> and <i>Diaz, J.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <center><b>CONCURRING</b></center><br>ABAD SANTOS, J.:<br><br>My views as to the law&nbsp; governing the issuance and use of search warrants have been set forth quite fully in my dissenting opinion&nbsp; in the case of People&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Rubio (57 Phil., 384, 395).&nbsp; Applying the principles therein discussed to the case now under consideration, it seems&nbsp; clear that the petitioner's documents&nbsp; and papers were&nbsp; illegally seized, and&nbsp; he is therefore entitled to&nbsp; have the same returned to him.&nbsp; The principle announced and&nbsp; followed by the Supreme Court of the United States is that which declares as illegal searches&nbsp; and seizures,&nbsp; whether made with or without a search warrant, when the purpose of making search was&nbsp; solely to secure evidence to be used in a criminal or penal proceeding against the person in whose house or office the articles searched for and seized were found.<br><br>I, however, agree that the petition in this case must be denied, because mandamus&nbsp; is not the proper remedy.&nbsp; The rule&nbsp; is that mandamus will not ordinarily issue if the petitioner has another adequate&nbsp; remedy.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; pointed out in the dissenting opinion of Justice Laurel, the petitioner could have resorted to any one of the various remedies suggested, the usual one being the filing of a motion in the court from which the warrant was issued for the return of the documents and papers illegally seized.&nbsp; In Nicolas vs. Judge of First Instance of Ilocos&nbsp; Norte and Formantes&nbsp; (42 Phil, 943), this court held that the writ of mandamus will not be issued where the&nbsp; petitioner has a complete remedy in the Court of First Instance by motion.<br><br>Much as I condemn the violation of&nbsp; constitutional rights, I see no compelling reason justifying a departure from the usual&nbsp; and orderly course of judicial proceedings&nbsp; in the present case.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br>LAUREL, J.:<br><br>I dissent.&nbsp; In my opinion the remedy&nbsp; should be granted. <br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; According to section 515&nbsp; of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure, this court has concurrent jurisdiction with&nbsp; Courts of First&nbsp; Instance to issue writs&nbsp; of mandamus in all cases where an&nbsp; inferior&nbsp; tribunal, corporation, board or&nbsp; person unlawfully excludes the plaintiff from the use and enjoyment of&nbsp; a right&nbsp; to&nbsp; which he is entitled.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, every&nbsp; person, whether&nbsp; a citizen or&nbsp; an alien&nbsp; resident, is entitled to possess, use&nbsp; and enjoy his private papers which are,&nbsp; as Lord Camden&nbsp; has said&nbsp; in the celebrated case of Entinck&nbsp; vs. Carrington (19 How. St. Tr., 1029),&nbsp; among his&nbsp; dearest possessions.&nbsp; No person or body of persons or court, acting as&nbsp; a governmental organ and under the guise of law, by virtue of a search&nbsp; warrant, can deprive him of this&nbsp; right.&nbsp; (<i>See</i> Vy Kheytin vs. Villareal, 42 Phil.,&nbsp; 886, 898; Regidor vs. Araullo, 5&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 955, 961, 962; U. S. vs. De los Reyes and Esguerra, 20 Phil.,&nbsp; 467.)<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Ordinarily, the practice is to file&nbsp; a timely&nbsp; and&nbsp; seasonable application in the form&nbsp; of a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; in&nbsp; the court which&nbsp; issued the search warrant asking for&nbsp; the&nbsp; determination of the legality or propriety of the search and seizure made and petitioning for the return of those&nbsp; papers and effects the fraudulent or illegal&nbsp; character of&nbsp; which have not been fully established (People vs. Carlos, 47 Phil., 626, 631; Weeks vs. United States, 232 U. S., 383; 58 Law. ed., 652; Silverthorne Lumber Co. vs. United States, 251 U. S., 385; 64 Law. ed., 319; Wagner vs. Upshur, 90 Md., 519). But this remedy is not&nbsp; exclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United States, various remedies are afforded.&nbsp; When the properties involved have been seized by virtue of a search warrant and are in the possession of an officer&nbsp; of the court or one acting under its order, and no&nbsp; action is pending, the application may be made&nbsp; by means&nbsp; of an&nbsp; independent summary&nbsp; proceeding (56 C.&nbsp; J., sec. 189, p. 1253).&nbsp; Libel on the seizure is usually brought (56 C. J.,&nbsp; sec.&nbsp; 184, p. 1252, citing In re Troy Pure Food Products Co., 14 F.&nbsp; [2d], 677) and replevin suits&nbsp; are allowed (Duboff vs.&nbsp; Haslan,&nbsp; 182 N.&nbsp; Y. S.,&nbsp; 896, aff. 195&nbsp; App.&nbsp; Div., 177; 186 N.&nbsp; Y. S., 481);&nbsp; and where property&nbsp; is seized&nbsp; under color&nbsp; of judicial process&nbsp; and brought&nbsp; under&nbsp; the control of the court, thus being placed beyond&nbsp; the reach of replevin or&nbsp;&nbsp; other independent or plenary remedy, a petition for&nbsp; the restoration&nbsp; of property unlawfully seized may be presented&nbsp; (56 C. J., sec.&nbsp; 185, p. 1252,&nbsp; citing&nbsp; U. S. vs.&nbsp; McHie, 194 Fed., 894).&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact then,&nbsp; that one remedy is usually&nbsp; resorted to&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; preclude recourse&nbsp; to other&nbsp; remedies;&nbsp; and I believe&nbsp; that, in meritorious cases, the extraordinary legal remedy of mandamus should be granted as this remedy is more speedy and adequate, being more or&nbsp; less&nbsp; summary in character.<br><br>(3)&nbsp; Under section 515 of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure also, the remedy of mandamus may be availed of where the inferior court&nbsp; or judge thereof&nbsp; unlawfully&nbsp; neglects the performance of a duty specifically or specially&nbsp; enjoined by law.&nbsp; Under section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,&nbsp; it is the&nbsp; duty of the officer serving the search warrant to deliver the things seized thereunder to the court whose duty it is, in turn, to deal with and dispose of the same&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; law.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; admitted that the Anti-Usury Board&nbsp; conducted an investigation&nbsp; of the papers seized and, finding no sufficient evidence, dismissed the case against the&nbsp; petitioner herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; further&nbsp; retention&nbsp; of his papers, after the lapse&nbsp; of more than one year, without either the officer who served&nbsp; the warrant or the&nbsp; court which issued it taking any action with reference thereto, is nothing short of an infringement of the right to personal security and private property of the citizen.<br><br>(4) The&nbsp; unreasonable delay&nbsp; in returning the&nbsp; private papers of the petitioner has no explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The illegality of the retention having been shown, it&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; the duty&nbsp; of this&nbsp; court to grant the writ of mandamus prayed for and to command the respondents to return the papers to the petitioner without the necessity of resorting to the court of origin for an order to that effect.</blockquote>Otherwise, the elaborate constitutional and statutory provisions which guaranty the sacred and indefeasible right of the people to be secure in their houses, papers and effects from the unjust encroachment of&nbsp; governmental&nbsp; power would be&nbsp; but an empty medley of words—without meaning, without purpose.. We should be ever vigilant in the protection and&nbsp; maintenance of basic&nbsp; individual rights.<br><br>IMPERIAL, J.: <br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I concur in&nbsp; the preceding dissenting opinion of Justice Laurel.</div></div>
