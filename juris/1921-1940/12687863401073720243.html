				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of prohibition to&nbsp; compel the respondent to desist from further proceedings in civil case No. 6489&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, in which case Isabelo and Emilia Alburo are the plaintiffs and Paulino Gullas, the defendant.<br><br>Case No. 6489&nbsp; was&nbsp; instituted in&nbsp; the&nbsp; beginning of&nbsp; the month of April of the present year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The distribution of cases among the various judges of the Cebu court is regulated by Administrative Order No.&nbsp; 16, issued by the Secretary of Justice February 27, 1925.&nbsp; In accordance with this order the filing number of the case in question required its assignment to the second branch of the court, presided over by&nbsp; Judge De la Kama,&nbsp; who, being&nbsp; unable to try it before the court vacation,&nbsp; continued it to the&nbsp; July&nbsp; term of the court.&nbsp; During the court vacation both Judge De la Rama and the Auxiliary Judge of the district were absent, the former on leave and the other on duty in Leyte,&nbsp; leaving the Honorable Adolph Wislizenus, the judge of Branch I, as the&nbsp; only judge on duty in Cebu.&nbsp; On May 3d, Judge Wislizenus, in view of the fact that the defendant in the aforesaid case No. 6489 was a member of the Legislature and was anxious to have the case disposed of before the opening&nbsp; of the legislative&nbsp; session,&nbsp; assigned the case for trial in his branch of the court on May 24, 1926.&nbsp; A motion for continuance presented by the plaintiff was denied, and these proceedings were thereupon instituted.<br><br>The petitioner argues that the respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction in taking cognizance of a case pertaining to another branch of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, There is, as far as we can see, no merit in this contention. Paragraph 4 of Administrative Order No. 16, supra, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Where&nbsp; any&nbsp; of the&nbsp; District Judges or&nbsp; the&nbsp; Auxiliary Judge having&nbsp; official&nbsp; station at Cebu&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; been granted leave of absence or shall be&nbsp; otherwise incapacitated to perform his official&nbsp; duties for a considerable period of time,&nbsp; the remaining judges shall forthwith proceed to the equitable distribution of the court business assigned to the judge&nbsp; so absent or incapacitated,&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with the above rules."<br></blockquote>In view&nbsp; of the provision&nbsp; quoted, it seems&nbsp; clear that the respondent&nbsp; being&nbsp; the&nbsp; only&nbsp; judge on duty in the district and the&nbsp; other&nbsp; judges&nbsp; being absent&nbsp; for undetermined periods,&nbsp; he had full power to try&nbsp; any of the cases at that time pending in the court and did not&nbsp; exceed his jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the case in question.&nbsp; In these circumstances a writ of&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; will not issue.<br><br>The petition is denied, and the present proceedings dismissed, with the costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Street, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez, </i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
