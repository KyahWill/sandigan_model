				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Pedro Soriano y Sison was charged in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila with&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of frustrated theft&nbsp; committed as follows, to wit:<br><blockquote>"That on&nbsp; or&nbsp; about the 6th day of March, 1931, in the City of Manila,&nbsp; Philippine Islands, the said accused&nbsp; willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, with intent of gain and without the consent of the owner thereof, took and was in the act of&nbsp; carrying away the&nbsp; fighting rooster valued at P15 belonging to&nbsp; Antonio Borja, thus performing all the acts of execution which&nbsp; should produce the crime&nbsp; of theft as a consequence, but which, nevertheless, did not&nbsp; produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the accused, that is, the timely arrival of the said Antonio Borja,&nbsp; who having surprised the said accused in the criminal act caused the accused to let&nbsp; loose&nbsp; the&nbsp; said rooster and to leave the same in the premises&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said owner.<br><br>"That the said accused is a habitual criminal within the purview of Act&nbsp; No. 3586, he having&nbsp; previously been&nbsp; convicted by final&nbsp; judgments of competent courts seven&nbsp; (7) times of the said crime of theft and once (1) of attempted robbery within a period of ten&nbsp; (10) years&nbsp; from the date of his last conviction on June 9, 1924."</blockquote>After the hearing,&nbsp; during which £he defendant had the benefit of counsel,&nbsp; he was found&nbsp; guilty of the&nbsp; crime of attempted theft, and was sentenced to pay a fine&nbsp; of 325 <i>pesetas</i>&nbsp; or P65, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs ; he was further sentenced to the additional penalty of twenty-one years' imprisonment as an habitual criminal in accordance with subsection (d) of Act No.&nbsp; 3586.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant appealed.<br><br>The record shows that in the&nbsp; early morning of&nbsp; March 6, 1931, the&nbsp; aforementioned appellant went to the veranda of the complainant,&nbsp; Antonio Borja, and tried to carry away his&nbsp; game&nbsp; cock; he was&nbsp; untying&nbsp; the cock with the evident intent of taking it away, when&nbsp; Borja approached and foiled his&nbsp; attempt to steal it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the appellant became aware of&nbsp; Borja's presence, he let go of the cock and ran away, with Borja and one Aquino in pursuit; he was finally caught and arrested by policeman Arcadio Rivero who had also appeared upon the scene&nbsp; and assisted in the capture of the appellant.<br><br>The appellant has been seven times convicted of the crime of theft and once of attempted robbery, his last two convictions having taken place on June 9, 1924, within ten years immediately preceding his conviction in the instant case.<br><br>The defense&nbsp; raises two&nbsp; questions, one of fact and the other of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is that the evidence is not&nbsp; sufficient to sustain a conviction of the crime of which&nbsp; he has been&nbsp; found&nbsp; guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts, as established by the evidence, fully support the finding of the defendant's guilt. The second&nbsp; question&nbsp; is that the Law&nbsp; on Habitual Delinquency is&nbsp; unconstitutional as being <i>ex&nbsp; post facto</i>, discriminatory, and imposes a double penalty for the same offense. Not one of these contentions is supported by the law.&nbsp; We have&nbsp; already held in People vs.&nbsp; Sierra (G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; 28516, April&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1928)1; People vs.&nbsp; Ortezuela (51 Phil.,&nbsp; 857); People vs.&nbsp; Madrano (53 Phil., 860) ; and People vs. Montera (55 Phil.,&nbsp; 933),&nbsp; that the&nbsp; law&nbsp; in&nbsp; question is&nbsp; valid and constitutional and suffers from none of the defects attributed to&nbsp; it by the defense; and&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; People vs. Abuyen&nbsp; (52 Phil., 722), it&nbsp; was further held that the said law is applicable to both consummated and frustrated&nbsp; or attempted&nbsp; crimes.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from being in accordance with the law, it is hereby&nbsp; affirmed&nbsp; in&nbsp; its entirety,&nbsp; with costs against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
