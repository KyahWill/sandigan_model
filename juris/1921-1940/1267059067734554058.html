				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The herein petitioner instituted civil case No. 106255 and filed the complaint dated September 11, 1935, in the municipal court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Manila, to&nbsp; recover from the defendants, the respondent spouses Cirilo Hipolito and Martina Torres, an indebtedness in the sum&nbsp; of P156&nbsp; and to foreclose the mortgage constituted&nbsp; by them on a piano and a cash register to secure the obligation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In their answer, the&nbsp; respondent defendants charged&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner with usury, alleging that they had not received the entire original loan from&nbsp; her.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; trial, and having&nbsp; examined all the&nbsp; evidence presented by the parties, the municipal court, on October 5, 1935, rendered judgment dismissing the action, without&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; The judgment became final because the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; failed to appeal.<br><br>Later the petitioner brought civil case No. 106679 against said respondents in the said municipal court, the complaint filed by her being dated October 17, 1935.&nbsp; The action was the same and it had the same purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; The relief sought was&nbsp; identical.&nbsp; The only difference between the two&nbsp; cases was&nbsp; that in the latter the petitioner asked for the issuance of a writ of attachment upon filing a bond of&nbsp; P400 which she&nbsp; was willing to do.&nbsp; In their answer, the&nbsp; respondent defendant set up the same defenses and furthermore alleged that the latter action brought by the petitioner&nbsp; was already <i>res judicata</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the trial, the municipal court, on November. 19, 1935, rendered judgment&nbsp; dismissing the action on the ground that it already constitutes <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner appealed.&nbsp; Inasmuch as she had filed a&nbsp; bond, the writ of attachment was issued and the sheriff attached the&nbsp; piano&nbsp; and cash&nbsp; register and&nbsp; delivered them to the petitioner.&nbsp; On appeal and after due trial, the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; on&nbsp; March 31, 1936, rendered judgment holding that the case already constituted <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, and dismissed the petitioner's complaint,&nbsp; with costs.&nbsp; Subsequently,&nbsp; it ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; return of the&nbsp; piano and&nbsp; cash register to the respondents.&nbsp; The petitioner filed a motion for a new trial, upon the denial of which she gave notice of her intention to perfect her&nbsp; appeal, duly presenting&nbsp; her bill&nbsp; of exceptions.&nbsp; It does&nbsp; not appear whether the bill of exceptions has&nbsp; already been approved or not. Upon petition&nbsp; of the respondents,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court, in its&nbsp; order of June 9, 1936, provided for the execution of the judgment so rendered notwithstanding the petitioner's notice of appeal, unless she filed a bond of P400&nbsp; to secure compliance with the&nbsp; judgment, in case it should be&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner asked for the reconsideration of the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; order and&nbsp; excepted to the resolution denying it.&nbsp; She&nbsp; however filed the bond required of her, which was subscribed by two sureties.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court disapproved it because&nbsp; it did not appear satisfactorily that the sureties were solvent.&nbsp; The petitioner was given a certain period to prove the solvency of the sureties and, as she failed to file the certificate of the municipal treasurer on time, the&nbsp; court ordered the execution of the judgment and the delivery of&nbsp; the&nbsp; chattels to the respondents.&nbsp; The&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; executed&nbsp; it and found only the piano which he delivered to the respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cash register&nbsp; is still&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of the petitioner.<br><br>In her petition for certiorari,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner now contends that the&nbsp; court's order of&nbsp; June 9, 1936, requiring her to file an additional bond of P400 if she wished to have the execution of the judgment suspended, pending the appeal, is illegal and has been issued with abuse of discretion.<br><br>Without&nbsp; expressly deciding whether or&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; court acted with abuse of discretion in requiring the petitioner to file an additional bond in order to suspend the execution of the judgment to which she had excepted, this court holds that the petitioner is&nbsp; not entitled to&nbsp; the&nbsp; extraordinary remedy now sought by her&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; she is estopped therefrom, having consented and submitted to the conditions&nbsp; of the order of June 9, 1936,&nbsp; by voluntarily filing the additional bond of P400.&nbsp; It is not a good policy to permit a party to question an order which he has voluntarily complied&nbsp; with, when it&nbsp; has been issued by a court which had&nbsp; full jurisdiction over the case (11 C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; pages 138, 139,&nbsp; sec.&nbsp; 103).&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner wished&nbsp; the order, which she claimed to have been issued irregularly or with abuse of discretion, reviewed, she should have filed this petition immediately after excepting thereto and should have applied for the&nbsp; issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in order to maintain the <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span>.&nbsp; But after having complied therewith, she cannot successfully question&nbsp; it in certiorari proceedings&nbsp; because it would be&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to repudiating her&nbsp; own acts.<br><br>For&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing reasons,&nbsp; the remedy&nbsp; applied for is denied, with costs to the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
