				<BR><BR><div><div align="JUSTIFY"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><div align="JUSTIFY"><div align="JUSTIFY">The complaint in this case has been &nbsp;dismissed upon motion of &nbsp;the defendant after the evidence for &nbsp;the &nbsp;plaintiff-appellant &nbsp;had &nbsp;been presented. &nbsp; It was prayed in the amended complaint (1) That the court declare the defendant &nbsp;indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of P2,372.34 as a loan with interest at 10 &nbsp;per &nbsp;cent per annum, from September 30, 1933, and &nbsp;(2) &nbsp;that the defendant be ordered to execute a document acknowledging the debt &nbsp;in question, together with all the stipulated conditions. &nbsp;The opinion of the court dismissing the &nbsp;complaint was &nbsp;based on the following &nbsp;consideration:</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>"After examining the &nbsp;evidence in this &nbsp;case, the court really finds thit there is no written obligation signed by the defendant in favor of the plaintiff, neither is there &nbsp;any other document that justifies the claim of the plaintiff in this case. &nbsp; * &nbsp;* &nbsp;* &nbsp; Such being the case, &nbsp;the &nbsp;court is of the opinion that the contention of the defendant is well founded in accordance with the provisions &nbsp;of &nbsp;article 1280 of the Civil Code and section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure."</blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Upon appeal &nbsp;from the court's &nbsp;decision, the only &nbsp;real question of law to be decided by this court &nbsp;is the demurrer filed by the defendant to the evidence for the plaintiff-appellant.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The record shows that immediately after the attorney for the defendant had presented his oral motion &nbsp;to &nbsp;dismiss, he signified his intention to &nbsp;call &nbsp;his client &nbsp;as a witness in the event that his motion to dismiss should be denied. &nbsp; The court, &nbsp;in such a situation, should &nbsp;not have rendered its decision, but in order to avoid any possible delay of the case and enable it to &nbsp;render its &nbsp;decision with &nbsp;all the &nbsp;disputed questions in'view, it should have required the defendant to present his evidence. &nbsp; In the case of Moody, Aronson &amp; Co. vs. Hotel Bilbao (50 Phil., 198, 200), &nbsp;this court said:</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>"* &nbsp; * &nbsp;* &nbsp; The defendant who, after &nbsp;the plaintiff &nbsp;has submitted his evidence, makes a motion to dismiss which the trial court in a decision grants, and who, on &nbsp;appeal of the plaintiff, has the judgment reversed, cannot then be permitted to produce evidence in defense. &nbsp;The defendant in offering a motion to dismiss in effect elects to stand on the insufficiency of the plaintiff's case. &nbsp; Otherwise, the result will be to invite unnecessary litigation. &nbsp;* &nbsp; * &nbsp;*</blockquote><blockquote>"The efforts of the courts should be concentrated on providing rules which &nbsp;will avoid lengthy and expensive litigation and which &nbsp;will assist &nbsp;in the speedy disposition of cases."</blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, after examining the evidence for the plaintiff-appellant, this court is of the opinion that it is sufficient to warrant the granting of the two remedies sought in the complaint, or &nbsp;another &nbsp;more &nbsp;appropriate one, for which reason, by applying the ruling of this court in the decision above-cited, the appealed judgment should &nbsp;not only be reversed but there should also adjudicate to the plaintiff what is due her under the law, were it &nbsp;not for the fact that the defendant, in formulating his &nbsp;motion to dismiss &nbsp;the complaint after the presentation of the evidence for the plaintiff, reserved for himself the right to present his evidence. &nbsp;This is the reason why this court is of the opinion that in cases like this the defendant should be required to. present &nbsp;his evidence &nbsp;instead of acting upon his motion to dismiss, so that should the court find the decision &nbsp;to be &nbsp;erroneous, it would not have to remand the case to the court of origin for further proceedings, by virtue of the defendant's &nbsp;reservation, which he should not have &nbsp;been permitted toi make, upon presenting his motion to dismiss.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The appealed judgment is reversed and the court is ordered &nbsp;to &nbsp;take the evidence for the defendant and render judgment after fully trying the case. &nbsp; So ordered.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Avance√±a, C.
