				<H3>FULGENCIO  M. DEL CASTILLO, PLAINTIFF  AND  APPELLEE,  <I>VS.</I> RUPINO MADRILESA, AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF J. PABLO GARCIA, DECEASED, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of this action&nbsp; was to recover the sum of P1,795.20 together with 47 cavans of palay or their equivalent in the sum of P5 per cavan,&nbsp; and costs.&nbsp; The said sum&nbsp; of P1,795.20,&nbsp; as&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; by the plaintiff,&nbsp; was&nbsp; the Amount due for merchandise&nbsp; sold by&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; to J. Pablo Garcia and his wife during his lifetime together with certain sums&nbsp; of money loaned&nbsp; to them&nbsp; from time to time. The 47 cavans of palay was the balance of a larger number sold by the plaintiff to the defendant.&nbsp; The defendant interposed a general and special&nbsp; defense together with&nbsp; a counterclaim.<br><br>After hearing the evidence upon the issue presented by the petition and answer, the Honorable M. L. de la&nbsp; Rosa, auxiliary judge, denied the contention of the plaintiff in re said 47 cavans&nbsp; of palay and&nbsp; also the special&nbsp; defense and counterclaim of the defendant as well as a part of the claim of the plaintiff for the said sum of P1,795.20, and rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P1,774.55.&nbsp; From&nbsp; that judgment the defendant appealed,&nbsp; and presents several assignments&nbsp; of error.<br><br>From an examination of the record it appears that during the trial of the&nbsp; cause the plaintiff, in support of his contention that the defendant owed him the said sum&nbsp; of P1,795.20, presented a number oi vales as&nbsp; proof of said indebtedness. Objection was made to the&nbsp; admissibility of said <i>vales</i> upon the ground that an internal&nbsp; revenue, stamp, as required by paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>), section&nbsp; 1449, in relation&nbsp; with section&nbsp; 1452&nbsp; of the Administrative Code, had not been placed thereon in order to make&nbsp; them admissible in evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court found that some of the chits and proof presented by&nbsp; the plaintiff did not sustain his contention, and refused to allow&nbsp; them as evidence of the claim of indebtedness&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; After the elimination of said chits&nbsp; the lower court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant for the amount due&nbsp; upon" the <span style="font-style: italic;">vales </span>admitted in evidence amounting to P1,774.55.&nbsp; The lower court further&nbsp; ordered that the plaintiff,&nbsp; in order to conform with the law, should place the revenue&nbsp; stamps Required by law upon the <i>vales</i> admitted in evidence, and that&nbsp; no execution should be issued upon the judgment rendered until the&nbsp; plaintiff had complied with that order.&nbsp; From that&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; the defendant appealed.<br><br>In his first assignment of error&nbsp; the appellant alleges that the lower court committed an error in admitting said <i>vales</i> as evidence, without the same having been stamped with the internal&nbsp; revenue stamps in accordance with&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>)&nbsp; of section 1449 in&nbsp; relation&nbsp; with&nbsp; section 1452 of the Administrative Code.&nbsp; An examination of said vales will show that they&nbsp; are&nbsp; in&nbsp; fact promises to pay&nbsp; money; that they are signed by the defendant; that said <i>vales</i> contain&nbsp; all of the elements required by the Negotiable Instruments Law for promissory notes and therefore must be stamped in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of the&nbsp; law. By reference to&nbsp; sections 40 and&nbsp; 41 of the&nbsp; revised rules relating to documentary stamps, it will be seen by section 41&nbsp; that all <i>vales</i> containing the necessary elements of a promissory note must be stamped with the internal revenue stamps.&nbsp; That being true, the lower court committed&nbsp; an error in admitting&nbsp; said vales as evidence until they were stamped in accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of the law.<br><br>That error, however, of the lower court was cured&nbsp; by his refusal to allow an execution upon the judgment rendered until said <i>vales</i> had been stamped.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule requiring said vales to be&nbsp; stamped&nbsp; does not contain any provision as to the time when&nbsp; they shall be stamped.&nbsp; The result is, therefore, that they may be stamped at the time they are executed and delivered or&nbsp; at&nbsp; the time they&nbsp; are presented in evidence. The lower&nbsp; court evidently recognized&nbsp; that fact&nbsp; and admitted them in&nbsp; evidence without being stamped, erroneously, but&nbsp; gave the plaintiff an&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to stamp them&nbsp; in order to obtain&nbsp; an&nbsp; execution upon his judgment.&nbsp; Section 1459 provides that the tax shall be paid by the person making said <i>vales</i>, by the person signing them, by the person issuing them, or by the&nbsp; person&nbsp; accepting them or transferring them,&nbsp; and shall be paid at&nbsp; the time such act is done or transaction had.&nbsp; However, the rule is well established that this tax may be said at any time either before or at the time said documents are presented in&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court committed no&nbsp; error, therefore, by requiring the plaintiff, in&nbsp; order to secure an execution of his judgment,&nbsp; to place the necessary&nbsp; stamps&nbsp; upon said <i>vales</i>.<br><br>Attention is called, however, to the provisions of section 2721 of the Administrative Code, as amended by section&nbsp; 16 of Act No. 2835, which provides a penalty for the failure to affix the necessary stamps.&nbsp; Said section 16&nbsp; of Act No. 2835 provides: "Any person who fails to affix and cancel the requisite&nbsp; stamp&nbsp; or stamps to any document&nbsp; at the time required by law shall be subject to a fine of not more than three hundred pesos."<br><br>The appellant further contends that the lower court committed an error&nbsp; in admitting a large&nbsp; number of said <i>vales</i> in evidence,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that they had&nbsp; either,&nbsp; been changed or altered without the consent of&nbsp; the appellant. With reference to the said&nbsp; assignment of error, an examination of the evidence adduced during the trial of the cause clearly sustains the conclusions of the lower&nbsp; court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant further contends in his fifth assignment of error that the lower court should have admitted his counterclaim. An examination of the record&nbsp; in relation with&nbsp; said assignment of error clearly justifies the conclusion of the lower court in denying said counterclaim.<br><br>From all of the foregoing, and&nbsp; after a careful examination of the record, we find no reason for changing or modifying&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court.&nbsp; The same is therefore hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Street,&nbsp; Malcolm, Ostrand, Johns,&nbsp; Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
