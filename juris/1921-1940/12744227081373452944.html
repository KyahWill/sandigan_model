				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The combined appeals in these two cases are concerned with two rival claims 
to lots 959, 960, 961, 973, 997, 1001, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1034 and 4304 in 
cadastral expedientes Nos. 23 and 24, G. L. R. O. record Nos. 657 and 660. The 
individuals representing the two conflicting interests are numerous; and the 
land in contention is located in the municipality of Umingan, in the Province of 
Pangasinan. For cadastral purposes it has been divided into the lots enumerated 
above, forming what was formerly part of a larger mass. The appellees are the 
successors in interest of Adriano Reguyal, son of Basilio Reguyal. The 
appellants are also descendants of Basilio Reguyal. The question raised by the 
appellants is, briefly, whether the land now in question formerly belonged 
exclusively to Adriano Reguyal or to him and his other brothers and sisters in 
common.
<p>The chain of title of the appellees begins in Adriano Reguyal, who, in 1894, 
procured and caused to be properly registered a possessory information covering 
all of the land now in controversy. This information was extended in the name of 
Adriano Reguyal as possessor, and it is in due form of law, having been duly 
registered in 1894 in the office of the register of property of the province. In 
1909 Adriano Reguyal sold said property for a valuable consideration to one 
Domingo Belisario (Exhibit D), who entered into possession promptly after the 
purchase of the property was effected by him. Later Belisario at various times 
sold the land, in small parcels, to the present possessors, over seventy in 
number, who are the appellees in this case.</p>
<p>It is proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Adriano Reguyal held 
peaceful possession of this property from about the year 1890 until he sold it 
to Belisario, and that the produce of the land, while it was in his possession, 
was enjoyed by himself, to the exclusion of all other persons. It is further 
proved that from the time Belisario acquired the property in 1909 the produce 
has been, enjoyed by himself and his successors in interest without disturbance 
from any one, though in 1920 an action of reivindicacion was instituted by 
Paulina Casimina, one of the present appellants, and others, to recover the 
property from the occupants (the appellees).</p>
<p>The appellants' ease supposes that the land in question, having an area of 
nearly 300 hectares, formerly belonged to Basilio Reguyal, who died about 1889, 
leaving six children, who inherited said land as property in common. It is 
furthermore claimed that this property has never been divided, with the result 
that at least a five-sixths undivided interest therein belongs to the 
plaintiffs. Iii this connection it is asserted that the possessory information 
was extended in the name of Adriano Reguyal because he was, the oldest son of 
Basilio Reguyal, and because it was not convenient for the other persons in 
interest to attend at the office of the official before whom the information was 
drawn up and promulgated. It is claimed furthermore that there was an agreement 
among the heirs to the effect that the taking of the possessory information in 
the name of Adriano should not prejudice the right of the other heirs.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the trial court was right in awarding the property 
to the appellees, who derive title from Adriano Reguyal, through Domingo 
Belisario. The latter was clearly a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser for value from 
the apparent owner, Adriano Reguyal, without notice of the alleged rights of the 
appellants. Furthermore the appellees, the actual occupants of the property, are 
purchasers for value under Domingo Belisario, and the duration of their 
successive possession extends over at least forty years. Any right on the part 
of the appellants has therefore been extinguished by adverse possession even 
supposing that the property originally pertained to Basilio Reguyal and not 
exclusively to his son Adriano.</p>
<p>An attempt is made to avoid the effects of the long continued adverse 
possession of the appellees and their predecessors in interest by means of the 
minority of one of the appellants, Paulina Casimina, who is said to have been 
born in 1900, and who accordingly must have attained majority in 1921. It should 
be borne in mind, however, that the possession of Adriano Reguyal began before 
the birth of this claimant, and it is a rule that before the statutory saving in 
favor of a minor can be effective, it must appear that the right of action 
originated in the life of such minor. In other words, if the statute of 
limitations once begins to run against a parent, before a child is born, there 
is no saving in favor of the child. Otherwise stated, the rule is that, adverse 
possession beginning during the life of the ancestor will be effective against 
his infant heirs. The protection afforded by the statute is for those against 
whom adverse possession is first asserted and who may at that time be under 
disability. (Armstrong <em>vs.</em> Wilcox, 57 Fla., 30; 131 A. S. R., 1080; 
Jackson <em>vs.</em> Moore, IS Johns. [N. Y.], 513; 7 Am. Dec, 398; Scallon<em> 
vs.</em> Manhattan R. Co., 185 N. Y., 359; 7 Ann. Cas., 168; Garner vs. Wingrove 
[1905], 2 Ch., 233; 3 Ann. Cas., 837; 3 British R. Cas., 737.) It results that, 
in the case before us, the title of the appellees is perfect, and was such when 
the appellants filed their claim to the land in this case.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of the case which is equally decisive against the 
claim of the appellants, and it is this: When the appellants or their ancestors 
consented for the possessory information to be taken exclusively in the name of 
Adriano Reguyal, the latter became a trustee in effect f or the others, 
supposing these to be owners of the property in common with Adriano, as they 
claim; and Adriano necessarily acquired a power of disposition adequate to 
convey the possessory right to any <em>bona fide</em> purchaser from him.</p>
<p>The right of the appellants was thereby reduced to a mere equity, which is 
ineffective against Domingo Belisario and purchasers under him.</p>
<p>What has been said goes on the assumption that the land with which we are 
here concerned belonged in life to Basilio Reguyal and that the title descended 
at his death to all of his children in common. This fact mainly rests, however, 
on the testimony of one of the appellants, and the correctness of the assumption 
is open to grave question.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from will be affirmed, and it is so ordered, with costs 
against the appellants.</p>
