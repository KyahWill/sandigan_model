				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was commenced in the Court of First Instance of the 
Province of Rizal on October 11, 1922. Its purpose was (1) to recover from all 
of the defendants several sums of money aggregating P50,550 as damages for 
alleged noncompliance by the defendants with the provisions of certain contracts 
of lease and sublease of a fishery situated in the municipality of Lubao, 
Province of Pampanga, and for repairs made on said fishery by the plaintiffs; 
and (2) to recover from the defendants Ambrosia Salao, Juan Salao and Josefa 
Evangelista the sum of P7,833.90 as the unaccrued portion of the rental for said 
fishery paid to them in advance by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs prayed for a 
judgment in their favor and against the defendants for said amounts, and costs. 
They also prayed that the contract of sublease, under which they held possession 
of the fishery be rescinded.
<p align="justify">The defendants Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug denied 
generally and specifically each and every allegation of the complaint.
</p><p align="justify">The defendants Ambrosia Salao, Juan Salao and Josefa 
Evangelista, in their amended answer of May 20, 1927, denied generally and 
specifically each and every allegation of the complaint and set up a 
counterclaim for the sum of P2,000.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the issue presented by the above pleadings the cause was 
brought on for trial. On the 31st day of May, 1927, the Honorable Antonio M. 
Opisso, judge, after a careful consideration of the evidence adduced during the 
trial of the cause, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against 
the defendants Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug in the following sums: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) 
P8,550 for reimbursement of expenses for repairs made by the plaintiffs on the 
fishery; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) P12,000, the value of fish which escaped from the fishery for the 
failure of the defendants Montemayor and Vitug to make necessary repairs thereon 
and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) P4,000, the value of fish contained in the portion of said fishery taken 
by one Simeon Bias, pursuant to the judgment rendered in a litigation between 
him and the defendants Montemayor and Vitug. The lower court further rendered a 
judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the three defendants Ambrosia 
Salao, Juan Salao and Josef a Evangelista in the sum of P7,833.90, representing 
the unaccrued portion of the rental which had been paid to them in advance by 
the plaintiffs. The court allowed interest at o per cent on all of said sums 
from the 11th day of October, 1922, the date of the commencement of this 
action.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the rescission of the contract prayed for by the 
plaintiffs and the alleged damages resulting from said rescission, the lower 
court said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"En cuanto al quinto motivo de accion, <span style="font-style: italic;">no ha lugar</span> a acceder a 
lo alii pedido, por no haber presentado pruebas respecto al mismo y por haber 
las partes, de mutuo acuerdo, rescindido el contrato y entregado la posesion de 
la pesquera el 1. de mayo de 1923."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">From said judgment plaintiffs and defendants appealed.</p>
<p align="justify">In this appeal the plaintiffs-appellants contend that the lower 
court committed an error:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(1) In not sentencing all the defendants Ambrosia Salao, Juan 
Salao, Josefa Evangelista, Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug, to pay the 
sums of P8,550, P12,000, P4,000 and P7,833.90 found and adjudicated as due to 
herein plaintiffs;</p>
<p align="justify">"(2) In not awarding to the plaintiffs damages for the value of 
fish which escaped out by reason of the acts of Simeon Bias; and</p>
<p align="justify">"(3) In not awarding to the plaintiffs damages resulting from 
the rescission of the contract."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendants-appellants Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug 
contend that the lower court erred in ordering them to pay to the plaintiffs the 
following sums: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) P8,550 for repairs of the fishery; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) P12,000 for damages, 
representing the value of fish that escaped out; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) P4,000 as indemnity for 
the value of fish included in the portion of the fishery taken by Simeon 
Bias.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendants-appellants Salao and Evangelista contend that 
the lower court committed an error in rendering a judgment against them and in 
favor of the plaintiffs in the sum of P7,833.90, representing the unaccrued 
portion of the rental paid to them in advance by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">The following facts are not disputed:</p>
<p align="justify">The spouses Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug were the 
owners of a fishery located in the barrio of Bancal Sinubli, municipality of 
Lubao, Pampanga, with an area of about 80 hectares, more particularly described 
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Linda por el norte con el Rio Magtapat; por el este con la 
pesquera de D. Romulo Mercado; por el sur con el Rio Bancal Sinubli; y por el 
oeste con la propiedad de Dna. Irene Santos. Esta pesquera mide (80) ochenta 
hectareas, (80) ochenta y seis areas y (81) ochenta y una centiareas. Esta 
medicion es la que se encuentra en el piano hecho por el agrimensor D. Francisco 
Licuanan aprobado en el Buro de Terrenos de fecha 3 de septiembre de 
1917."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On September 27, 1917, Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug 
executed and delivered a contract of lease of said fishery in favor of Ambrosia 
Salao and Josefa Evangelista for a period of three years, from September 30, 
1917, to September 30, 1920 for the sum of P9,000, which was paid at the time of 
the execution of the contract (Exhibit T). Later the owners leased said fishery 
to Ambrosia Salao for one year, from October 1, 1920 to October 1, 1921. On 
March 3, 1920, the owners executed and delivered another contract of lease of 
said fishery in favor of Ambrosia Salao, Juan Salao and Josefa Evangelista for a 
period of two years, to wit, from October 2, 1921 to October 2, 1923, for the 
sum of P10,000, which amount was paid in advance at the time of the execution of 
the contract (Exhibit A). The rights and obligations of the lessors and lessees, 
as expressly stipulated in said contract Exhibit A are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) Que como condicion accesoria del mismo, se hace saber 
ademas, que esta pesquera se halla en Iitigio con D. Simeon Bias, de Malabon, 
Rizal, y en el caso que por una orden judicial se segregare parte de esta 
pesquera reclamada por Simeon Bias y se le adjudique a su propiedad, el precio 
de cada ano de este arrendamiento sera reducido a una parte proporcional, 
tomarido por base el precio anual de cada hectarea del arriendo, hasta que las 
cantidades tomadas y aplicadas al arrendamiento primitivo sean completamente 
saldadas por el canon de la pesquera bajo bases arriba convenidas.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) Que los propietarios arrendadores se hacen responsables 
del saneamiento y eviccion en toda la extension marcada por la ley, asi como de 
los perjuicios que Simeon Bias pueda irrogar contra los derechos de posesidn y 
disfrute de la pesquera objeto de este contrato, a los arrendatarios o segunda 
parte de este contrato.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) Que la descrita pesquera serd entregada al terminar el 
plazo de arriendo en la misma condicion como se la hallare al hacer la entrega a 
los arrendatarios.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>) Que todos los desperfectos por el uso de esta pesquera han 
de ser a cargo de los duenos."</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">On June 25, 1920, the lessees Ambrosia Salao, Juan Salao and 
Josefa Evangelista executed and delivered a so-called contract of sublease 
(Exhibit B) of said fishery in favor of the plaintiffs Sy Juco and Jeuqueco for 
a period of three years, from October 1, 1920 to October 1, 1923, for a rental 
of P17,700. Of this amount, P7,700 was paid at the time of the execution of the 
contract and the balance of P10,000 on September 30, 1920.</p>
<p align="justify">The rights and obligations of the parties, under the terms of 
the contract Exhibit B, are expressly stipulated as follows:</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Que los Sres. Joso del R. Jeuqueco y Santiago Sy Juco 
seran conocidos por medio de la presente como subarrendatarios de la finca, y 
como tales, a falta de este convenio las disposiciones de Ley sobre este 
contrato seran las que deben suplir para su debida resolucidn de cualquier 
desarreglo de las partes.<p></p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) Que el plazo de este subarrendamiento es de tres anos 
comenzando desde el 1.° de octubre de 1920 hasta el 1.° de octubre de 1923. 
Entendiendose, sin embargo, que los derechos de los arrendatarios Sres. Juan 
Salao, Ambrosia Salao y Josefa Evangelista, sobre la disminucidn del precio del 
arriendo en el caso que Simeon Bias ganare el pleito contra los propietarios, se 
entenderan trasmitidos, asi como cualesquier derechos y obligaciones de los 
citados Juan Salao y Co., a favor de los tiltimos o Sres. Jose Jeuqueco y 
Santiago Sy Juco y a sus herederos.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) Que las condiciones establecidas en el contrato de 
arrendamiento se entenderan trasmitidas a los subarrendatarios con los derechos 
y obligaciones que reciprocamente tienen las primitivas 
partes."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Pursuant to said Exhibit B the plaintiffs took possession of 
the fishery on October 1, 1920.</p>
<p align="justify">During the trial the plaintiffs and the defendants Montemayor 
and Vitug entered into the following stipulation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Las partes hacen constar que en virtud del convenio habido 
entre las mismas y que aparece en el documento marcado como Exhibit Q, la 
posesion de la parte de la pesquera no ocupada por Simeon Bias ha sido entregada 
a Donata Montemayor y su marido."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Exhibit Q shows that the fishery was returned by the plaintiffs 
to Montemayor and Vitug on May 1, 1923, with the following reservation on the 
part of the plaintiffs:
&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Esto se debe entender sin perjuicio de cualquiera accion que 
ya tengamos o pudieramos tener en relacion con dicha 
pesqueria."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">A preponderance of the evidence shows the following facts:</p>
<p align="justify">When the plaintiffs took possession of the fishery on October 
1, 1920, they found the dikes in bad condition, requiring immediate repairs. 
This fact was immediately communicated by Sy Juco to the defendant Ambrosia 
Salao. The latter, invoking the terms of the contract Exhibit B, stated that all 
her rights and obligations as lessee of the fishery had been transferred to the 
plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs should directly take up the matter of 
repairs with the owner Donata Montemayor. Sy Juco went to see Montemayor about 
the question of repairs, and it was agreed between them that, inasmuch as 
Montemayor did not have money at that time, Sy Juco would advance the expenses 
for the necessary repairs and that Montemayor would reimburse him later. 
Pursuant to this understanding repairs were made on the fishery in October and 
November, 1920, at the expense of Sy Juco in the sum of P6,752.67.</p>
<p align="justify">In July or August, 1921, the fishery was again in bad 
condition, and with the consent of the defendant Donata Montemayor repairs were 
again made by Sy Juco for her account, amounting to P1,797.00. Thus the total 
expenses for repairs made on the fishery by the plaintiffs for the account of 
the defendants Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug, amounted to P8,550.27, or 
P8,550 in round numbers, as found by the lower court.</p>
<p align="justify">On or about July 2, 1922, the fishery being again in a 
dilapidated state, the plaintiffs addressed a letter (Exhibit L) to the 
defendants Montemayor and Vitug, requesting them to make repairs on the dikes. 
Six days later, or on July 8, 1922, the plaintiffs again addressed to said 
defendants another letter (Exhibit M) the pertinent part of which reads as 
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Aside from damages from Mr. Simeon Bias we have been damaged 
because of the weakness of the earthen fence around the fishpond which too weak 
to resist longer. It is not convenient for us any more to pay for the repairs. 
If for instance the fishpond may be broken and its contents thrown out it is you 
who must have the blame for we have, time and time again told the matter to you. 
We don't like to go further in paying rent. We have before shoulder up the 
expenses alone. We are begging you to pay the amount which we have paid 
according to clause 'F' of the legal papers signed before the person of Pedro 
Pascual, a notary public of this province.</p>
<p align="justify">"After all these things and after we have not yet receive any 
letter from or if you fail yet to make repairing on the fishpond, we will be 
forced to ask for the rescission or return the fishpond to you and ask therewith 
all the payments for rent that we made and also we shall be obliged to do all so 
that you may pay for damages on the thrown fish and on the fish still in the 
fishpond we, being unable to catch them in face of Mrs. Simeon Bias rejection to 
permit us to catch them."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Said letter (Exhibit M) was followed by another (Exhibit I) 
addressed to all of the defendants. In this letter the plaintiffs expressed 
their intention to return the fishery and to have the contract rescinded, in 
view of the defendant's failure to make repairs. No answer was made to either of 
said letters.</p>
<p align="justify">On September 18, 1922, on account of heavy rains and flood, and 
due to lack of necessary repairs, the dikes broke down in four sections of the 
fishery, and the fish escaped out. The damage suffered by the plaintiffs, 
representing the value of fish thus lost, was estimated by the lower court, from 
data furnished during the trial, at P12,000.</p>
<p align="justify">Pursuant to the judgment rendered in favor of one Simeon Bias 
in a litigation between him and Donata Montemayor, the former took possession of 
a section of the fishery in question, including all of the fish contained 
therein. From data furnished during the trial the court estimated the value of 
the fish so taken by Simeon Bias at P4,000.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three questions to be decided in this appeal, to 
wit:</p>
<p align="justify">(1) Are the defendants liable for the cost of repairs made by 
the plaintiffs and for damages suffered by them?</p>
<p align="justify">(2) Are the plaintiffs entitled to recover from the defendants 
Salao and Evangelista the unaccrued portion of the rental amounting to 
P7,833.90?</p>
<p align="justify">(3) Are the plaintiffs entitled to recover damages resulting 
from the rescission of the contract (Exhibit B)? </p>
<p align="justify">As above stated, the plaintiffs took possession of the fishery 
on October 1, 1920, under the terms of the so-called contract of sublease 
(Exhibit B), executed in their favor by the defendants Salao and Evangelista. A 
careful reading of said contract, particularly of the clauses above quoted, 
shows that under the terms thereof the defendants Salao and Evangelista, as 
lessees of the fishery in question, sold and transferred to the plaintiffs, for 
a consideration of P17,700, all of their rights and obligations as such lessees. 
The defendants Salao and Evangelista substituted the plaintiffs in their place 
and stead with reference to their relation as lessees to their lessors lsonata 
Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug. In other words, they made an absolute and 
complete assignment to the plaintiffs of their lease on the fishery, including 
all of their rights and obligations as such lessees. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> clauses [<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>] and [<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>] of 
Exhibit B quoted above.)</p>
<p align="justify">It is true that contract Exhibit B is called by the parties 
"contrato de subarrendamiento" and the plaintiffs are designated therein as 
"subarrendatarios." However a careful examination of said contract shows that 
its real nature, purpose and effect is to make a complete assignment to the 
plaintiffs of the lease held by Salao and Evangelista. Such assignment has the 
effect of creating the relation of lessees and lessors between the plaintiffs 
and the owners of the fishery, Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug, with the 
same identical rights and obligations specified in the original contract of 
lease (Exhibit A) between Salao and Evangelista as lessees and said owners as 
lessors. Furthermore, the contract of assignment (Exhibit B) specifically so 
provided, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) Que las condiciones establecidas en el contrato de 
arrendamiento (Exhibit A) se entenderan trasmitidas a los subarrendatarios con 
los derechos y obligaciones que reciprocamente tienen las primitivas 
partes."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Manresa, commenting on the effect of the assignment of a lease 
and the relation which it creates between the owner of the property and the 
assignee (in this case, the plaintiffs), says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Piensa el arrendatario que sobre la cosa arrendada le 
corresponde un derecho para ejercitar contra el arrendador a cambio de las 
obligaciones que por su parte tiene que cumplir, y este derecho, con todos sus 
accesorios, con todas las acciones que le son anejas en los distintos casos y 
momentos de su ejercicio, y con todas las obligaciones que lo condicionan, lo 
transmite de una vez, en un solo acto, sin ulteriores propositos de 
responsabilidad por razon del mantenimiento del uso y goce del cesionario.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. Que el cesionario tiene accidn directs contra el 
arrendador para exigir de e1 el cumplimiento de todas las obligaciones que oste 
estipulo' con el arrendatario, de igual modo que e1 esta tambien directamente 
obligado con el propio arrendador por razon de todo lo que se deriva del 
contrato." (Vol. 10, Manresa, pp. 498, 499.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It follows from the foregoing that the plaintiffs and the 
defendants Donata Montemayor and Clodualdo Vitug stand in the relation of 
lessees and lessors, respectively, with the rights and obligations specified in 
contracts Exhibits A and B. Therefore, (1) the cost of repairs made by the 
plaintiffs on the fishery to keep it in serviceable condition; (2) the damages 
suffered by them by reason of the failure of the owners to make necessary 
repairs on the dikes; and (3) the damages suffered by said plaintiffs by reason 
of the segregation of the portion of said fishery taken by Simeon Bias, should 
be paid by the owners of said fishery pursuant to the specific terms of the 
contracts Exhibits A and B and the provisions of the Civil Code.</p>
<p align="justify">The fact that the assignment of the lease was made without the 
consent of the owners, as alleged by them, does not vitiate the assignment. In 
the first place, said assignment was subsequently ratified by Donate Montemayor, 
when in 1920 and 1921 she allowed the plaintiffs to make the repairs for her 
account, as above stated. In the second place, according to Manresa, the consent 
or knowledge of the owner of the property is not necessary for the validity of 
an assignment of lease. On this question he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Y nosotros creemos que el arrendamiento, se halle o no 
inscrito, constituya o no un derecho real, es un derecho transmisible, siempre y 
cuando, naturalmente, no se haya prohibido expresamente la transmision, y que no 
existiendo esta prohibicion, puede transmitirse sin la autorizacion del duefio." 
(Vol. 10, Manresa, p. 504.) In fact, we see no reason for the necessity of the 
owner's consent or knowledge. His rights and obligations as lessor are not 
increased or diminished by reason of the assignment. They remain identically and 
exactly the same, without any alteration whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The lower court committed no error therefore in rendering a 
judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants Montemayor and 
Vitug for cost of repairs and damages, and in relieving the other defendants 
from said liability.</p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiffs-appellants contend in their second assignment of 
error that they are entitled to damages for the value of fish which escaped out 
when Bias segregated the portion recovered by him from Donata Montemayor. On 
this question the lower court said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"El Juzgado estima que, aun admitiendo que Simeon Bias hubiese 
de proposito abierto las compuertas y dejado escapar parte de los peces que se 
hallaban en la seccion de la pesquera en donde se hallaba la porcion que 
correspondio a Simeon Bias en el litigio sostenido con Donata Montemayor, de 
este dano causado no puede hacerse responsable a Donata Montemayor ni a 
Clodualdo Vitug ni a alguno de los otros demandados, puesto que si el contrato 
Exhibito A contenia una disposition al efecto de que los arrendadores se hacian 
responsables de los perjuicios que se ocasionaron a los arrendatarios por Simeon 
Bias contra los derechos de posesion y disfrute de la pesquera objeto del 
contrato, dichos perjuicios deben entenderse unicamente como los que 
naturalmente pudiesen ocasionarse con motivo de los actos legales de Simeon 
Bias, pero no los que resultaron por cualquier atropello por este. De aqui que 
el Juzgado en cuanto a este tercer motivo de action de la demanda entiende que 
Donata Montemayor es solamente responsable de los peces que se hubiese apropiado 
Simeon Bias o que hubiesen quedado comprendidos dentro de la porcion de la 
pesquera de que se posesiond, pero no por aquellos que de intento dicho Simeon 
Bias hizo escapar, a menos que hubiese probado que el boquete abierto por Simeon 
Bias se hizo necesario para la construction de los diques de separacion de su 
porcion, prueba que el Juzgado no encuentra suficientemente establecida por las 
partes."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We are of the opinion that the lower court is correct in its 
reasoning and conclusion above quoted. <br></p><p align="justify">The foregoing discussion of the first two 
assignments of error of the plaintiffs-appellants, answers also the assignments 
of error of defendants-appellants Montemayor and Vitug.</p>
<p align="justify">In their third assignment of error the plaintiffs-appellants 
contend that they should have been awarded damages in the sum of P10,000 by 
reason of the rescission of the contract.</p>
<p align="justify">The proof shows that the plaintiffs had to abandon the fishery, 
due to its dilapidated condition, in September, 1922, that is a little over a 
year before the expiration of the contract of assignment, and that they had to 
abandon it because of the failure of the defendants Montemayor and Vitug to make 
necessary repairs in spite of repeated demands made upon them. The lower court 
denied this claim for damages on the ground that the contract was rescinded by 
mutual consent of the parties, and on the further ground that no evidence of 
damages was presented by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">Our examination of the record shows that no such rescission 
took place. The parties only stipulated as a fact, that the defendants 
Montemayor and Vitug took possession of the fishery on May 1, 1923 (Exhibit Q). 
Even if such stipulation and the terms of Exhibit Q be interpreted as a 
rescission of the contract by mutual consent, yet the plaintiffs have expressly 
reserved in said Exhibit Q whatever right they had or might have in connection 
with said fishery. ("Esto se debe entender sin perjuicio de cualquiera action 
que ya tengamos o pudieramos tener en relacidn con dicha pesqueria.")</p>
<p align="justify">There is no question that the plaintiffs had abandoned the 
fishery one year prior to the expiration of the contract. They are therefore 
entitled to recover from the defendants Montemayor and Vitug the benefits which 
they might have derived from the fishery during that period. The proof shows 
that in the year 1920 they made a net profit of P11,395.50 from the operation of 
the fishery (Exhibit R). Taking this as a basis, the plaintiffs are entitled to 
at least P10,000 as demanded in the complaint, and this sum should have been 
allowed in their favor and against Montemayor and Vitug.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellants Salao and Evangelista contend in their 
assignment of error that the contract between them and the plaintiffs (Exhibit 
B) is a contract of assignment of lease, and that they are not liable for any 
portion of the price paid to them by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">As we have demonstrated above, said contract Exhibit B is an 
assignment of the lease held by the defendants Salao and Evangelista. They sold 
and transferred said lease to the plaintiffs for the sum of P17,700, and the 
plaintiffs became the lessees by substitution. The defendants Salao and 
Evangelista have executed fully and faithfully their part of the contract, which 
was to deliver the fishery to the plaintiffs and to transfer to them all of 
their rights and obligations as original lessees of the property. They have not 
failed in any of their obligations as assignors. The sum of P17,700 which they 
received from the plaintiffs was in full payment for the rights and obligations 
they had assigned to the plaintiffs. Having thus discharged fully and faithfully 
their part of the contract, they cannot be made liable to the assignees for 
whatever damage the latter may subsequently suffer in the possession of the 
fishery. The fact that the plaintiffs abandoned the property one year prior to 
the expiration of the contract was not due to the fault of Salao and 
Evangelista, and they cannot be made to pay for damages occasioned by the fault 
of others. Furthermore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover any unaccrued 
portion of the rental. In lieu thereof, they get damages growing out of the 
rescission of the contract in the sum of P10,000 as above stated. Therefore, the 
lower court erred in holding the defendants Salao and Evangelista liable to the 
plaintiffs in the sum of P7,833.90, representing the unaccrued portion of the 
rental.</p>
<p align="justify">In harmony with all of the foregoing, the judgment of the lower 
court should be modified, and a judgment should be and is hereby rendered in 
favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants Montemayor and Vitug for the 
following sums:</p>
<p align="justify">P8,850 for cost of repairs made on the fishery in 1920 and 
1921;</p>
<p align="justify">P12,000 as damages representing the value of fish that escaped 
out due to defendants' failure to make necessary repairs;</p><p align="justify">P4,000 as damages 
representing the value of fish contained in the portion of the fishery taken by 
Simeon Bias; and</p>
<p align="justify">P10,000 as damages resulting from the rescission of the 
contract, due to fault and negligence of defendants Montemayor and Vitug.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendants Ambrosia Salao, Juan Salao and Josefa 
Evangelista are hereby relieved from all liability under the complaint. And 
without any finding as to costs, it is so ordered.</p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Avanceña, C. J., Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</span> and
