<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The complaint is upon two causes of action. The first is for the collection 
of a mortgage credit of P46,000, plus P2,500 for expenses of litigation and 
attorney's fees; and the second, for the recovery of the sum of P500, alleged to 
have been borrowed by the defendants from Messrs. Ledesma Brothers for the 
account of the plaintiff. The plaintiff prays that judgment be rendered against 
the defendants:</p>
<p><em>(a) </em>For the payment of their mortgage debt with interest thereon, 
after deducting the P1,000 paid on July 30,1921, and the P3,501.83 paid on the 
29th day of August, 1922.</p>
<p><em>(b)</em> For the payment of theP2,500 fixed for expenses of litigation 
and attorney's fees, and the sum of P500 alleged in paragraph VI of the 
complaint, and the costs of the action.</p>
<p><em>(c)</em> Ordering the sale of the property mortgaged, with the 
improvements thereon, should the amount of the judgment not be satisfied within 
the period prescribed by the law, the proceeds of the sale to be applied upon 
the payment of the amounts claimed, with interest thereon and the costs.</p>
<p><em>(d)</em> Directing the defendants, in the event that the proceeds of said 
sale are not sufficient to cover the amounts claimed in the complaint, to pay 
the plaintiff such balance as, according to the record, they may be personally 
liable for. </p>
<p>The defendants admit the execution of the deeds of mortgage Exhibits A and B, 
as well as the payments made on account of the debt, namely, P1,000 on July 30, 
1921, and P3,501.83 on August 29, 1922; but they allege as a defense that the 
contract entered into with the plaintiff is usurious, on account of the latter 
having collected an interest equivalent to 24 per centum; and as a counterclaim 
they pray that the plaintiff be compelled to return to them the sum of P13,872, 
which he had collected from them as interest, plus P3,000 for expenses of 
litigation and attorney's fees. </p>
<p>His Honor, the judge who tried this case, in a well reasoned decision, 
disposed of the first cause of action <em>(a)</em> ordering the defendants 
Albina Alvayda and Buenaventura Vicencio to pay to plaintiff Isidro S. Villaruel 
jointly the sum of P44,642.93 with interest thereon at 12 per centum from 
December 26, 1922, the date of the complaint, until full payment; <em>(b)</em> 
sentencing them also to pay the plaintiff the sum of P2,500 as attorney's fees 
and expenses of litigation; <em>(c)</em> ordering that these payments be made 
within the period of three (3) months, and that, if after said period the amount 
of the judgment was not paid, the property mortgaged described in the deed 
Exhibit A be sold at public auction, the proceeds of the sale to be applied upon 
the payment already mentioned. Upon the second cause of action, the defendants 
were sentenced to pay the plaintiff the sum of P500 with legal interest thereon 
from the filing of the complaint until full payment. As to the cross-complaint, 
the plaintiff was absolved therefrom. As to the counterclaim, the plaintiff was 
likewise absolved from the same. The defendants were sentenced to pay the 
costs.</p>
<p>The appellants complain of the trial court not having held the contract in 
question to be usurious, nor ordered the return to the defendants of the 
interest paid to the plaintiff, or the payment of the expenses of litigation and 
attorney's fees.</p>
<p>An explanation of the items stated in Exhibits A and B is found in the 
following part of the judgment: "It appears from the testimony of the plaintiff 
and his Exhibit F (which the defendant Buenaventura Vicencio admits having 
written personally, and which appears to have been delivered by him to the 
plaintiff), that the amount paid on May 11, 1920, was P30,000, as was also 
testified to by the defendant Vicencio himself; and in this sum of P30,000 was 
included the interest for one year at 12 per cent, which is P3,600. It also 
appears that in August, 1920, the P6,000 was paid by the plaintiff to the 
defendant, and thus the P39,600 stated in the deed Exhibit A was completed.</p>
<p>"Subsequent to the deed Exhibit A the defendant Vicencio became indebted to 
the plaintiff in several amounts, which are set out in detail in Exhibit F as 
follows: </p>

<p>"At the maturity of the deed Exhibit A in May, 1921, as the defendants asked 
for an extension of one year and an increase of the credit, a liquidation was 
made between the plaintiff and the defendant, and capitalizing all the sums due 
on the date, the following result was obtained:</p>

<p>which is the amount stated in the document Exhibit B, renewing the document 
Exhibit A.</p>
<p>"With respect to the P220.71, the plaintiff advanced to the defendant the sum 
of P218, as stated in Exhibit F, and the plaintiff testified, without 
contradiction, that he paid the remaining P2.71 to the defendant Vicencio.</p>
<p>"As to the sum of P46,000 stated in the deed of mortgage Exhibit B after 
charging the proper interest and deducting the amounts paid by the said 
defendant, namely, P1,000 on July 31, 1921, and P3,501.83 on August 29, 1922 (as 
appears in Exhibits F and C, in paragraph V of the complaint, in the amended 
answer of the defendants and in Exhibit E), with the reciprocal interest 
accruing upon these sums, it results that in December 26, 1922, the date of the 
complaint, there was a debit balance of P44,642.93. This constitutes the first 
cause of action of the complaint.</p>
<p>"With reference to the second cause of action, it appears from Exhibit C that 
on September 1, 1922, the defendant took the sum of P500 on account, the 
interest of which does not appear to have been the subject of any 
stipulation.</p>
<p>"It also appears proven that in clause C of Exhibit B the sum of F2,500 was 
fixed as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should proceeding be 
instituted for the foreclosure of the mortgage."</p>
<p>After studying the record, we are convinced that the findings of the trial 
court are supported by the evidence. The contention of the appellants that the 
appellee has collected from them double interest upon the principal sum of 
P30,000 is groundless. According to the contract Exhibit A, the principal of 
P30,000 should draw interest at the rate of 12 per centum per annum (from May 
11,1920, to the same date of May, 1921), that is, P3,600, which amount was by 
agreement of the parties included in Exhibit A, like the P6,000 that the 
defendants may have subsequently received, which they in fact received in the 
month of August, 1920. But it does not appear that upon the original principal 
of P30,000 a new interest was ever charged at the time of the liquidation of 
accounts that the contracting parties made on May 11, 1921, for the extension of 
the period and the renewal of the mortgage Exhibit B, where the sum of P46,000 
is stated.</p>
<p>To obtain this last amount, the sum of P3,600 was taken into account, which 
is the interest of the original principal of P30,000 at 12 per centum and which 
instead of being paid by the debtors was made a part of the principal debt then 
due. And we do not believe that there has been any illegality in it, for, as was 
held in Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Schenkel and Gonzales (43 
Phil., 616), the interest due constitutes, from the moment it is due, a new 
principal by agreement of the parties and the interest it earned should not be 
considered as accruing upon the original debt.</p>
<p>In support of the contention of the appellants, Exhibit 1 was introduced, 
dated May 31, 1921, written and signed by the appellee, regarding the sum of 
P5,520, the amount of the interest of the principal of P46,000 stated in Exhibit 
B.</p>
<p>The trial court found it proven that the plaintiff executed and signed 
Exhibit 1 in order to prevent the defendants from again being charged with the 
interest of the principal of P46,000 in the event of the death of said plaintiff 
and of his heirs, ignorant of the transaction, trying to enforce the stipulation 
in the deed Exhibit B. We see in this no error whatsoever justifying the 
reversal of the judgment appealed from. If it were true that the defendants paid 
the plaintiff on May 31, 1921, the sum of P5,520, as interest on the principal 
of P46,000, it cannot be conceived how the defendant Vicencio, who drew the 
document Exhibit F containing the liquidation, on July 31, 1921, that is to say, 
two months after Exhibit 1, has failed to include therein the respectable sum of 
P5,520. </p>
<p>The judgment appealed from, being in accordance with law, must be, as is 
hereby, affirmed with the costs against the appellants. So ordered.</p>
