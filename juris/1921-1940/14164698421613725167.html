				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE,  VS. EMILIANO PORTENTO AND NICOLAS PORTENTO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The appellants pray for&nbsp; the reversal of the judgment rendered by the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Marinduque against them,&nbsp; sentencing each&nbsp; of them for the crime of homicide&nbsp; to&nbsp; fourteen years, eight months and one&nbsp; day <i>reclusion temporal</i>, and to&nbsp; indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly and severally in the sum of P500, with the costs.<br><br>The appellants assign as&nbsp; errors committed by the trial court the finding that certain&nbsp; statement attributed to the deceased Venancio Parley as a valid and admissible <i>ante mortem</i> declaration; the giving of credit&nbsp; to the witnesses for the prosecution, Alejandra Murillo and&nbsp; Dalmacio Prado; and its failure to give the appellants the benefit of the reasonable doubt, convicting them of the crime&nbsp; of homicide. The question presented by the first assignment&nbsp; of error was raised for the first time in this court.&nbsp; The testimony of the mother of the deceased as to the latter's statements at the point of death was not opposed or objected to during the&nbsp; first hearing of the case.&nbsp; At any rate,&nbsp; taking&nbsp; into account the&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; of the case and specially the fact that said statements were made immediately after the aggression, they can, as&nbsp; the Attorney-General says, be considered as a part of the&nbsp; <i>res gestse.</i><br><br>We find in the&nbsp; record no sufficient reason for discrediting the testimony of Alejandra Murillo and Dalmacio Prado whom the trial judge saw when testifying and gave credit to.<br><br>We find sufficiently proven beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the&nbsp; defendants as&nbsp; responsible for the&nbsp; death of Venancio Parley,&nbsp; whom they killed, according to the&nbsp; evidence, in a joint aggression with their brother Gabino Portento, who has pleaded guilty and was convicted in another case for the same crime.<br> <iase for="" the="" same="" crime.<br=""><br>The&nbsp; circumstantial evidence&nbsp; as&nbsp; to abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; superior strength&nbsp; is not sufficient, in our opinion, to establish it as an aggravating circumstance, and cannot be taken into consideration in the imposition of the penalty as recommended by the Attorney-General.<br><br>For the foregoing, the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is affirmed in all its parts, with the costs against the appellants. So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, </i> and <i>Ostrand,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</iase></div>
