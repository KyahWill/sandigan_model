				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The judgment  appealed from allowed the  will of Florencia Mateo  dated February 6, 1923, composed of two used sheets to probate.  The will appears to  be  signed by the  testatrix and  three witnesses on the left  margin of each of the sheets, by the testatrix alone at the bottom, and  by the three  witnesses after the attestation clause.  The testatrix died on August 13, 1925.  Opposition to such probate was filed by Rita Mateo, the testatrix's  sister, and by other relatives.<br><br>The three  attesting witnesses to this will, testifying in this case, declared  that the signatures of the testatrix were written in their presence and that they signed their names in the presence of the testatrix and of each other.  The testatrix from girlhood knew how to sign her name and did  so with her right hand;  but, as the  right side of her body later became paralyzed,  she learned to sign with her  left hand and for many years  thereafter,  up  to the time of her death, she used to sign with that hand.   Opponents allege that Florencia Mateo did not sign this will.<br><br>There are three salient arguments among those adduced by the opponents in support of their opposition.<br><br>The attesting witnesses testified that the testatrix signed before they did.  The signatures of  the  testatrix on the left margin of the two sheets of the will  are between the signatures of the two witnesses Vidal Ranoa and Julio Gabriel, and below her surname is the signature of the other witness Felicisimo Gabriel.  The signatures of Vidal Rafioa and Julio Gabriel are on a level with each other, while that of Felicisimo Gabriel is found  a little  lower down. The testatrix's signatures start on the line with Felicisimo Gabriel's signature, but  tend to  rise  and  her  surname reaches a level with Julio Gabriel's signature.<br><br>It is said that this direction of the testatrix's signature was due to the fact that when it was written Felicisimo Gabriel's  signature was  already there, and so she had to write her surname upwards  in order to ayoid interfering with that of Felicisimo Gabriel, which would have been the case had  she  continued  on the horizontal line  on  which she had  written her first name.  From this  detail it is pretended  to  draw the inference that the attesting witnesses signed  before the testatrix, contrary to their  testimony that  she  signed before they did. This  deduction,however, is unnecessary.  It may be  inferred with equal, if not greater, logic that the  testatrix signed before him, and when it came to the witness Gabriel's turn, he, finding the space below the testatrix's signature free, signed his name there.  On the other hand, it may be noted that the testatrix's other signature at the bottom of the will also shows a more or less  marked tendency to rise, notwith-standing the fact that there was no  signature with which she might interfere if she continued  to write in a straight horizontal line.   Furthermore, if, as  the opposition alleges, the testatrix's signature is  not  genuine  and was placed there by another person, it is strange that the latter should have  done so in such a way as to write it above Gabriel's signature while  following the horizontal, line,  when this could have been avoided by simply putting it a little higher. And this may be attributed to carelessness in the first case, but it cannot be  so explained in the second.<br><br>Attention is also called to the apparently  different kinds of ink used  by the testatrix  in her  signature and by the attesting witnesses.  Really an  examination of these signatures reveals a somewhat deeper intensity of ink in the signature of the testatrix than in those of the attesting witnesses.   It is alleged that this circumstance cannot be reconciled with  the declaration of the attesting witnesses that they used the same pen and ink as the testatrix.  But, only one of these witnesses declared this.   The other one was not sure of it and said  that he did not perfectly remember this detail.  The  third  scarcely made reference  to this particular.  At all events, this apparent difference in ink may be merely due—supposing that the same ink and pen  were used—to the difference in pressure employed  in writing these signatures, as is reasonable to  suppose when we consider that the testatrix was a paralytic and wrote with her left hand; or it may have been due to the fact that the at- testing witnesses dipped lightly in the ink while the testatrix dipped the pen so as to take up the ink from the bottom of the well.  To  bring out this irregularity, the opposition presented the  expert Del  Rosario  who  asserted,  among other things, that  the  signature of  the testatrix  is more recent than that of the attesting witnesses.   If this opinion Is correct and if,  as  alleged,  the testatrix's signature is forged, it would  mean  that the forgers, after having prepared the will  and made the witnesses sign, allowed some time to elapsed before forging the  testatrix's signature, which supposition is  not  at all probable, nor has it been explained.<br><br>At all events, even admitting that there is a certain question as to whether the attesting witnesses signed before or after the testatrix, or whether or not they signed with the same pen and ink, these are details of such trivial importance, considering that this will was signed two years before the  date  on which  these  witnesses gave their testimony, that it is not  proper  to set aside the will for this  reason alone.<br><br>The attesting witnesses  to this will, who testified also as witnesses at the trial of  this case, showed themselves to be intelligent and honest,  one of them  being a lawyer of twelve  years'  practice, and there is  no reason  to reject their testimony, and to suppose that they were untruthful in testifying, and that they falsified  the will in question.<br><br>Lastly,  attention is called to the unreasonableness of  the testatrix in  not leaving anything to the principal opponent, her sister Rita Mateo, and to her nephews and nieces, to whom she had been so affectionate during life.  But as to the affectionate relations between the  deceased and the  opponents, only the opponent Rita Mateo testified,  and  she only stated that she was on good terms with her sister during the latter's lifetime; that the said sister used to give her a sack or  some gantas of rice, and, at times, a little money; that she held all her nephews and nieces  in equal regard.  But  even supposing that this  were  so,  there  is nothing strange in the testatrix having left nothing to the opponents, or in her having left all  of her estate to the only heir instituted in  her  will, Tomasa Mateo, who is also one of her nieces.  And not only is it not strange,  but it seems  reasonable, since, according to the evidence of the opposition itself, Tomasa Mateo had been taken in by the testatrix when the former was but 3  years old, and from then on up to the time of  her  death had never been separated from her.<br><br>The opposition presented Doctor Banks as expert.  He testified that the signatures of the testatrix in the will are not genuine.  The petitioner, on the other hand, presented another expert, Pedro Serrano Laktao, who  affirmed that these signatures are genuine.  But, over the testimony of these experts,  we have the categorical and positive declaration of veracious witnesses who affirm that these signatures were written by the testatrix herself.<br><br>The judgment appealed  from  is  affirmed,  with costs against the appellants.  So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson,  Villamor, Romualdez</i>, and <i>Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br>JOHNS, J., with whom concur STREET, MALCOLM, and  OSTRAND,<i> JJ.,</i> dissenting:<br><br>Appellants assign the  following errors:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"FIRST ERROR<br></div><br>"The Honorable  Court  <i>a quo</i> erred  in  imputing  as theory of the  oppositors 'that the deceased did not know how to  write except with her right hand and that due to sickness of paralysis during the last few years of her  life she became physically unable to hold the pen and to write her name and surname.'<br><br><center>"SECOND ERROR<br></center><br>"The  Honorable Court a quo  erred in  finding that  the three disputed signatures on the two pages of Exhibit A are signatures of  Florencia R. Mateo based on mere 'possibility,' and in  not holding them spurious as shown by specific, unrebutted findings of Drs. Charles S. Banks and Jose I. del Rosario.<br><br><center>"THIRD ERROR<br></center><br>"The  Honorable Court <i>a  quo</i>  erred in  giving credit to the testimonies of the so-called instrumental witnesses in Exhibit A.<br><br><center>"FOURTH ERROR<br></center><br>"The Court <i>a quo</i> erred in admitting Exhibit A to probate."<br><br>Hence, the only questions presented are questions of fact. Time and experience has  taught us that but little, if anything, is ever accomplished by writing a dissenting opinion on  such questions.  Be that as it may, this is one case in which we feel that it is our duty to dissent and to state the reasons why.<br><br>The decisive  question in this case is whether or not the signatures  of Florencia R. Mateo both to the body of the will and on the margin of the pages  are true and genuine. It must be admitted that if it be a fact that her signature to the body of  the  will is true and genuine, and that her signatures  on the margin of the pages are not true and genuine, then the will  in  question is  null and void. <br><br>In the trial  of the  case in the court below, much evidence was  introduced  for the oppositors tending to show that neither one of the signatures of Florencia R. Mateo appearing  on the  will were true  and genuine, and  both Drs. Charles S. Banks and Jose I. del Rosario so testified and gave their reasons why.  Enlarged photographs of her signatures  were introduced in evidence which were admitted to  be true  and genuine, and  of her signatures to the will, and a comparison and detailed analysis was made of the differences between them, both as to the character and formation of the letters of her name, the length and height of the letters, and the  space between them, and the length and the slant of the signatures, from  which  Doctor Banks, in particular, testified  that the signatures of Floreneia R. Mateo  to the will were forgeries, and that her three respective signatures on  the will were not made at the same time or with the same pen or ink.  In that  particular, his testimony was corroborated by that of Jose I. del Rosario. <br><br>We have been taught that mathematics, chemistry and photography  are exact sciences.   It appears from an ocular inspection and without the aid  of even a magnifying glass that there is a very marked difference between the signature of Florencia R. Mateo to the body of the will and as it appears on the margin of the pages of the will, both as to the character and  formation of the letters and the space between them, and the height, length and slant of the signatures, all of which can be seen and detected with the naked eye without the aid of an expert or a photographic enlargement of the letters.  It is also apparent to the naked eye that the three respective signatures of Florencia R. Mateo appearing on the will "were each  made  with different ink,  and that they were  all made with different ink  than that used by the witnesses to  the will.  It is also apparent to the naked eye that each of her signatures as they appear on the margin of the will were made  over and  above and, hence, after the signature of the witness J. Gabriel. It is true that the will upon its face appears to have been executed with all of the required legal formalities, and that the witnesses  to the will testified that the signatures of the  deceased were  true and genuine.   Be that as it may,  both chemistry  and  photography  are an  exact science, and  all  of that oral evidence is flatly contradicted by that of both  chemistry and photography,  in addition to all which, it is apparent to  the naked  eye and without the aid of either science, that the signatures in  question were not made at the same  time,  and  that  the two  signatures appearing on the margin  of the will were made  after,  over and above the name of  the witness J.  Gabriel.<br><br>The will recites that  Florencia  R. Mateo is "sixty-eight years of age," and it purports to have been executed on February 6,  1923,  and the record is  conclusive that she was born February 22, 1850, and that at the time of the alleged execution of the will,  she  was  nearly 73 years of age.   It also appears that  the will in question was  prepared by  attorney  Perfecto Gabriel,  was executed in his office, and  that  by its  terms, he  was  named as the  sole executor, and that although he was called as a witness on a minor point, he was  not questioned and did not testify as to how and when the will was executed, or by whom it was  signed or as  to  the genuineness of  either  of the signatures of Florencia R. Mateo, all of which are the very storm center of this contest.  Perfecto Gabriel having prepared the will which was executed in his own office, it is strange, indeed, and to say the least very  suspicious, that he was not  called as a witness to testify about the questioned signatures and as to whether or not they were true and  genuine.<br><br>We are not prepared to say  as to whether all  of the signatures of Florencia  R.  Mateo as they appear on the will  are forgeries, but we are clearly of the opinion that her signatures as they  appear on the  margin of the pages of the will are  not true  and genuine, and that they were not made at the same time or place  or by the  same person as her  signature which appears to  the body of the will.   In either event  the will in question was never legally executed by Florencia R. Mateo, and  is, therefore, null and void.<br><br>For such reasons, we are forced to dissent.</div>
