				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Court of First Instance of Manila wherein an information was filed against the appelant for the crime of rape with serious physical injuries. Upon being arraigned, he entered&nbsp; a plea of not guilty. After due trial he was convicted of the crime charged in the information and sentenced to suffer imprisonment of not less than fourteen&nbsp; years, eight months and one&nbsp; day and not more than&nbsp; seventeen&nbsp; years, four&nbsp; months&nbsp; and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>; to indemnify&nbsp; the offended party in the sum of P100, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the judgment thus&nbsp; rendered this&nbsp; appeal was taken.<br><br>Due to the&nbsp; appellant's inability to employ a lawyer, he was provided with an attorney <i>de oficio</i>. In the brief filed by&nbsp; the latter, the guilt of the appellant is admitted,&nbsp; and the only question raised relates to the correctness of the penalty imposed by the court below.&nbsp; In view of the fact that the brief thus filed by the attorney <i>de oficio</i> raised a question of law only, the case was submitted to this court for decision.&nbsp; In the meantime, however, the attention of the court was called to a letter&nbsp; written by the appellant to one of the&nbsp; members thereof, wherein the former claims that he is innocent of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of which he was found guilty by the lower court.&nbsp; We have thus a situation in which a client disagrees with his lawyer as to the questions which should&nbsp; be raised in a case on appeal.&nbsp; While there is no provision of law&nbsp; exactly applicable&nbsp; in the premises, we believe that the ends of justice require that, under the circumstances&nbsp; obtaining in this&nbsp; case, a review of the evidence should&nbsp; be had in&nbsp; order to determine&nbsp; the&nbsp; guilt or innocence of the accused.<br><br>It results that this&nbsp; case involves both questions of law and fact, and, therefore, comes within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; it is ordered that&nbsp; the clerk of this&nbsp; court certify the case to the clerk of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; in accordance with section&nbsp; 145-O of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code, as amended by section 3&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act No. 3.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Villa-Real, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
