				<H3>THE BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ALFRED BERWIN & COMPANY, DEFENDANT. ANSELMO DIAZ, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff bank invoking the provisions of sections 431, 
436, 450, 476, 481, 482, and 486 of the Code of Civil Procedure, prayed the 
Court of First Instance of Iloilo to summon the herein appellant Anselmo Diaz in 
order to testify concerning the credit of the defendant firm Alfred Berwin &amp; 
Co, against him, for the purpose of carrying into effect the execution of the 
judgment rendered in this case. 
<p align="justify">The court ordered Anselmo Diaz to appear, and he personally 
appeared in that court on September 30, 1927, and acknowledged that he was 
indebted to Alfred Berwin &amp; Co., in the sum of P20,000, the balance of 
credit for a greater amount.</p>
<p align="justify">Said remaining debt is evidenced by two promissory notes issued 
by Anselmo Diaz in favor of the herein defendant Alfred Berwin &amp; Co. It does 
not appear, however, from the record whether such promissory notes are still in 
the hands of Alfred Berwin &amp; Co., or whether they have been negotiated by 
the latter, according to the appellant's belief as expressed in his testimony. 
</p>
<p align="justify">As it does not appear from the record that the promissory notes 
in question are still at the disposal of Alfred Berwin &amp; Co., so that they 
may return them to the maker Anselmo Diaz upon the latter's making the payment 
thereof (sec. 74, Negotiable Instruments Law, Act No. 2031), said Diaz cannot be 
compelled to pay the sum of the said promissory notes to any person save the 
holder of such documents in due course, for said person is the one entitled to 
receive it. (Sec. 57, Act cited.) </p>
<p align="justify">In the present state of the proceedings it is not known whether 
the judgment debtor Alfred Berwin &amp; Co., is still the holder in due course 
of such promissory notes or not, that is to say, that it is not known whether 
they still have their credit of P20,000 represented by such promissory notes, or 
whether the same has already been alienated, and as the latter possibility 
exists, that is, that Alfred Berwin &amp; Co., is no longer entitled to the 
amount of the promissory notes on account of having negotiated them, it is not 
just to compel the maker Anselmo Diaz to satisfy the credit of Alfred Berwin 
&amp; Co., or to the sheriff as a credit in favor of this firm if the latter is 
no longer entitled to such credit. To compel Diaz to pay Alfred Berwin &amp; 
Co., or the sheriff as a credit in favor of this corporation, which is contrary 
to the law, under the circumstances of the case, would be to expose Anselmo Diaz 
to the situation in which, having paid the amount of the promissory notes 
without settling the same, a holder in due course may appear and within all 
reason demand its full payment. </p>
<p align="justify">Nor does the question change by the fact that Diaz was given 
notice, when the preliminary attachment was ordered, not to deliver the payment 
of his debt to Alfred Berwin &amp; Co. The debt was secured by negotiable 
instruments, and notwithstanding such notice it was beyond Anselmo Diaz's power 
to prevent Alfred Berwin &amp; Co., from negotiating the promissory notes. </p>
<p align="justify">We hold the lower court's judgment premature inasmuch as it 
orders the appellant to pay to the plaintiff bank said sum of P20,000 which is 
the amount of the promissory notes in question, with nothing to show, in 
accordance with the law, who has actually the right to receive such amount.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the appealed order is revoked, and let this case be 
remanded to the lower court with directions to proceed to further investigation 
and inquiry in accordance with the foregoing, without express pronouncement as 
to costs. So ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, 
concur.</div>
