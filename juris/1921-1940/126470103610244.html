				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In criminal case No. 9730 of the Court of First Instance of Laguna Pascual Fajardo was  convicted of the crime of damage to property through reckless imprudence and sentenced to pay a fine of P270.10 and the costs.   He appealed to this  court, but his appeal was dismissed for the  reason that  no brief  was submitted  within the reglementary period.  Judgment was entered against him and the  record was returned to the lower court.  When the judgment was to be executed, it was found that the accused was insolvent, for which reason the sheriff returned the writ unsatisfied. The clerk of court informed the provincial fiscal to this effect and the latter replied that the accused should suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment although he was not so sentenced in the judgment.  The clerk of court reported the case to the court which, by order of March 13, 1935, held that the accused could not be compelled to suffer subsidiary imprisonment because he was not so sentenced in the judgment, and ordered his release, which was carried out.  The fiscal appealed from said order.</p>
  <p>  The legal question confronting us is whether an accused who has been sentenced only to pay a fine may be compelled to undergo  subsidiary  imprisonment, in the  manner prescribed by law, in case he is found insolvent because he has no  property with  which to pay.  The Solicitor-General strongly maintains the affirmative and, in a nutshell, argues that, under  article 39 of the Revised  Penal  Code, the subsidiary imprisonment need not be imposed in the judgment and may be  automatically served if the offender is found to be insolvent.  We do  not agree with this contention.</p>
  <p>  The first  paragraph  of article 39 of the Revised  Penal Code reads as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Art. 39. <em>Subsidiary penalty</em>.—If the convict has no property with  which to  meet the pecuniary liabilities mentioned in paragraphs 1st, 2nd and 3rd of the next preceding article, he shall be subject  to a subsidiary personal liability at the rate of one  day for each  2 pesos and  60 centavos, subject to the  following  rules: </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  Article  78 of Chapter V of the same Code, in  its pertinent part, which deals with the execution and  service of penalties, provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Art. 78.  <em>When and how a  penalty is to be executed.</em>—No penalty shall be executed except by virtue  of a final  judgment.</p>
    <p>"A penalty shall not be executed in any other form than that prescribed by  law, nor with any other circumstances or incidents  than those expressly authorized thereby."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    It is a fundamental principle  consecrated in section 3 of the Jones Law, the Act of Congress of the United States of America approved on August 29, 1916, which was still in force when the order appealed from was made,  that no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law.  This constitutional provision was in a sense incorporated in article 78  of the Revised Penal Code prescribing that no penalty shall  be executed, except by virtue of a final judgment.  As the facts show that there is no judgment sentencing the accused to suffer  subsidiary imprisonment in case of  insolvency to pay  the fine  imposed  upon  him, because the said subsidiary imprisonment is not stated in the judgment finding him guilty, it is clear that the court could  not legally  compel him to serve  said subsidiary imprisonment.  A contrary holding would be a violation of the laws aforementioned.  That subsidiary imprisonment is a penalty, there can be no doubt, for, according to article 39  of the Revised Penal Code,  it is imposed upon the accused and served by him in lieu of the fine which  he fails to pay on account of  insolvency.  There is not a single provision  in the Code from which it may be logically inferred that an accused  may automatically be made to serve subsidiary imprisonment in a case where he  has been sentenced merely to pay a fine and has  been found to  be insolvent.  Such would be contrary to the legal provisions above-cited and to the doctrine  laid down in United States <i>vs.</i> Miranda (2 Phil., 606, 610), in which it was said: "The judgment of the lower  court  fails  to impose subsidiary imprisonment in  case of insolvency for indemnification to the owner of the banca, but only imposes subsidiary punishment  as to costs.  In  this  respect the judgment is erroneous and should be modified."</p>
  <p>    We, therefore,  conclude that an  accused  who has  been sentenced by final judgment to pay a fine only and is found to be  insolvent and could not pay the fine for this reason, cannot be compelled to  serve the subsidiary imprisonment provided for in article 39 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we affirm the order appealed from, without costs.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Villa-Real,  Abad Santos, Diaz,  Laure</em>l,  and <em>Concepcion, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
