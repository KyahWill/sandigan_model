				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action is brought to foreclose a mortgage for&nbsp; the sum of P40,000, with interest, on a parcel of land situated in the District of&nbsp; Santa&nbsp; Ana, City of&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Summons was served&nbsp; upon the defendant on July 1,&nbsp; 1925, and&nbsp; her appearance was filed on the 20th of the same month.&nbsp; On July 30, counsel for&nbsp; the plaintiffs moved that the defendant be declared in default on&nbsp; the ground that no copy of the appearance had&nbsp; been served on the plaintiffs or&nbsp; the latter's counsel, and on the following day&nbsp; the defendant was declared in default for not having presented her&nbsp; answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp; same&nbsp; day, the defendant&nbsp; filed an answer denying generally and specifically all the allegations of&nbsp; the complaint, but as&nbsp; far as the record shows, again&nbsp; failed to serve&nbsp; copy upon the adverse party, and upon hearing, without notice to the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; judgment was rendered on August 7, 1925 in favor of the plaintiffs&nbsp; and in accordance with the prayer of the complaint.<br><br>On September 4, the defendant's counsel&nbsp; filed a motion for reconsideration&nbsp; in which he&nbsp; alleged that he mailed copies, both of the appearance and of the answer, to&nbsp; the attorney for the plaintiffs before filing the documents; that said attorney consequently must be presumed to&nbsp; have&nbsp; received due notice in the ordinary&nbsp; course of the mails; that the defendant had no notice of the trial, and that, therefore the judgment rendered by default should be set aside and the case reopened.<br><br>The motion&nbsp; for reconsideration was&nbsp; not accompanied by an affidavit of merit nor was there any intimation that the defendant had a&nbsp; valid defense, and for this reason&nbsp; the motion was denied&nbsp; by the court below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon appeal by the defendant to this court, the appellant presents five assignments of error, the sum and substance&nbsp; of which is that the trial court erred in denying the motion for reconsideration and in not reopening the case.<br><br>The failure of the appellant to have&nbsp; her motion for the setting aside of the default accompanied by an affidavit of merit is fatal to her contentions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule that a motion for the&nbsp; setting aside of&nbsp; a judgment by default must be accompanied by an affidavit of merit or its equivalent, is so well established as to require no discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wahl and Wahl <i>vs.</i> Donaldson, Sims &amp; Co., 2 Phil., 301; Daipan <i>vs.</i> Sigabu, 25 Phil., 184; Coombs&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Santos, 24 Phil.,&nbsp; 446; Real Monasterio de Santa Clara <i>vs.</i> Villamar, 33 Phil., 411.) There is an exception to this rule when the judgment has been rendered without jurisdiction or before the defendant was in default,&nbsp; but&nbsp; such is not&nbsp; the case here.&nbsp; As far as the record shows, no copies neither of the appearance nor of the answer, were served upon the plaintiffs;&nbsp; the documents were therefore not filed in accordance with the rules of the court and the defendant was in default&nbsp; when the case was tried and the judgment rendered.<br><br>The judgment of the court below and the order denying the motion for setting aside the default are affirmed with the costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J.,&nbsp; Johnson, Street,&nbsp; Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
