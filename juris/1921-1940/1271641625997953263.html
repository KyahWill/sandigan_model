				<H3>GEORGE R. SAUL, CLAIMANT AND APPELLEE, VS. MAGDALENA HICETA, WIDOW OF ESCAY, ADMINISTRATRIX AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 5, 1922, Emilio Escay purchased carabao, bovine 
cattle, farming implements, bamboo, coconuts and coffee plants from George Ramos 
Saul obligating himself to pay by installments, as appears from the instrument 
transcribed on pages 4-9 of the record on appeal.<br><p align="justify">Emilio Escay died 
without having fully paid said purchase price, and when an administration 
proceeding was instituted for the settlement of his estate, George Ramos Saul 
presented his claim to the proper committee on claims, with the result that on 
June 4, 1925 said committee submitted a report favorable to the creditor in the 
sum of P12,000 to the proper court.<br><br>An agreement was thereupon entered 
into between the said administratrix of the estate and the creditor Saul, by 
virtue of which said administratrix acknowledged the remaining debt of P11,000 
in favor of Saul, and promised to pay P2,000 annually with 12 per cent yearly 
interest, securing such payment with a mortgage on some real estate belonging to 
the deceased. This agreement was approved by the court on November 11, 1925. 
</p>
<p align="justify">In July 1926, the creditor Saul sued said administratrix in the 
Court of First Instance of Iloilo (civil case No. 6518), demanding payment of 
P11,000 plus the interest thereon, which was already demandable in full, 
pursuant to the agreement referred to, in view of said administratrix' default 
in the payment of the first two agreed installments.</p>
<p align="justify">On August 31, 1926, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo 
rendered judgment by default against the defendant in said civil case No. 6518, 
ordering her to pay to the plaintiff P10,400 plus interest thereon at the rate 
of 12 per cent per annum computed from June 30, 1925; and the sum of P70.20 as 
interest at the same rate on the P600 paid on account of the debt, said interest 
being computed from June 30, 1925 to June 9, 1926. This judgment also ordered 
the defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P2,600 for attorney's fees, plus the 
costs. </p>
<p align="justify">At first this judgment of the court of Iloilo was not accepted 
by the court of Occidental Negros as binding upon Emilio Escay's estate, but 
upon finally reconsidering the case on petition of the creditor, after several 
pleadings had been presented by both parties, on September 8, 1927, the Court of 
First Instance of Occidental Negros issued an order directing the defendant 
administratrix to pay to plaintiff the sum of the said judgment rendered by the 
Court of First Instance of Iloilo.<br><br>This is the order from which an appeal 
was taken to this court. For a better understanding of the questions raised in 
this appeal, we copy below a portion of said order: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"This motion,in effect, is a petition for the reconsideration 
of the resolutions passed by the court on other motions presented by the said 
Saul, denying his petition, because the court, having taken into consideration 
only the letter of the judgment rendered by the Hon. Fernando Salas, Judge of 
the second branch of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, held that said 
judgment was rendered against Magdalena H. Escay, and not against Magdalena H. 
Escay as administratrix of the estate of Emilio Escay. </p>
<p align="justify">"Now counsel for the movant attaches to his motion the exhibits 
presented in civil case No. 6518, as well as a copy of the order issued by the 
Hon. Fernando Salas, Judge, ordering the issuance of a new execution, identical 
with the former against the estate of the deceased Emilio Escay. In a certain 
part of said order it was said: </p>
<p align="justify">" 'Whereas the court finds said motion to be well grounded, 
inasmuch as all the proceedings in the case as well as the documents adduced at 
the trial sufficiently show that the liability arising out of the decision 
rendered in this case is against Emilio Escay's estate and not against the widow 
of said decedent, personally, but in any case as administratrix of said estate,' 
and, on the other hand, it having been stated by attorney Hill in a pleading 
confirming his statements made in open court on the day of the hearing of his 
motion, that the debt sought to be collected in civil case No. 6518 of the Court 
of First Instance of Iloilo is the same sum approved by the committee on claims 
and appraisal of this estate, and that the payment of the sum appearing in the 
judgment rendered in said case No. 6518, would in fact cancel the debt of 
P12,000 approved by the committee on claims and appraisal of this estate; 
<br><br>"The court being satisfied, in view of all the evidence introduced and 
of the statements made by attorney Hill in his last memorandum filed in 
compliance with an oral order of the court, that what the movant sought to 
collect in case No. 6518 of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo is really a 
debt of the estate; </p>
<p align="justify">"The court reconsiders its former orders and directs the 
administratrix to pay the claimant George Ramos Saul the total sum of the 
execution of the judgment rendered in civil case No. 6518 of the Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo, entitled George Ramos Saul vs. Magdalena H. Escay, as 
administratrix of the estate of the deceased Emilio Escay. </p>
<p align="justify">"Considering that, according to the last account presented by 
the administratrix, she has not at present sufficient funds to make payment, 
said administratrix is hereby granted a <span style="font-style: italic;">period of sixty days</span>, within which to 
take the necessary steps to obtain sufficient funds from the estate and to make 
this payment"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The appellant assigns four errors as committed by the trial 
court in the order in questions, to wit:&nbsp;
</p><ol><li>In giving credit and validity to the order of the Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo dated June 14, 1927, issued in the said civil case;<br><br> 
</li><li>In not finding that the judgment rendered in said civil case 
was "a personal action against Magdalena H. Vda. de Escay."<br><br> </li><li>In not holding that the claimant Saul is estopped on account 
of having led the appellant, the Philippine National Bank, the Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo, and the trial court to believe that the civil case referred 
to was a personal action against the debtor for the five promissory notes copied 
in the bill of exceptions.<br><br> </li><li>In not taking into account the opposition filed by the 
guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> of the minor children of the deceased Emilio Escay, in issuing 
its orders of September 8 and October 31, 1927. </li></ol>



<p align="justify">The appellant contends that the order of the court of Iloilo of 
June 14, 1927 deciding a motion filed by the plaintiff herein by declaring that 
the liability of the defendant in said civil case No. 6518 was against the 
estate of the deceased Emilio Escay and not his widow, personally, is invalid. 
We do not think so. That order neither modified nor broadened the judgment 
rendered in said case; it only construed it correctly in accordance with the 
facts found In the record. </p>
<p align="justify">As to the second assignment of error, said judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of Iloilo was duly understood in the order appealed 
from. Said judgment decided a complaint filed against the defendant herein, not 
personally, but as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband Emilio 
Escay, as clearly alleged in the complaint presented in said case. </p>
<p align="justify">For the reasons given, there is no such estoppel as the 
appellant invokes against the appellee, nor do we find any ratrit in the last 
assignment of error. </p>
<p align="justify">The order appealed from is hereby affirmed with costs against 
the appellant. So ordered. </p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</span> 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur.
