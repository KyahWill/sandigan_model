				<H3>PEDRO SALDAÑA, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. CRISPULO CONSUNJI ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal was taken by the protestant Pedro Saldaña from an 
order of the Court of First Instance of Bataan dismissing the protest upon 
motion of protestee Crispulo Consunji on the ground of not having acquired 
jurisdiction to try the case, because it was not alleged in the motion of 
protest that there was any proclamation of an elected candidate.
<p align="justify">Appellant assigns the following alleged errors as committed by 
the lower court in its order, to wit: "The lower court erred in dismissing the 
protest; in refusing to admit the petitioner's amendment to his motion of 
protest, dated June 18, 1928; and in sentencing the protestant-appellant to pay 
the costs." </p>
<p align="justify">The pertinent facts necessary to decide the questions raised in 
the present appeal, are as follows: </p>
<p align="justify">On June 18, 1928, the protestant and appellant Pedro Saldaña 
filed the following motion of protest: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Comes now the protestant, and as causes of protest against the 
election of protestee Crispulo Consunji to the court respectfully shows: </p>
<p align="justify">"1. Crispulo Consunji, Pedro Saldaña, Dionisio Tolentino and 
Diosdado Valenzuela presented their certificates of candidacy, in accordance 
with the law, for the office of municipal president of the municipality of 
Samal, Bataan, and were voted for at the elections held on June 5, 1928, as 
follows:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"2. In election precincts Nos. 1, 2, and 3, of the municipality 
of Samal, Bataan, over fifty (50) ballots bearing the name of the protestant 
were rejected and not counted by the election inspectors in his favor. </p>
<p align="justify">"3. In every election precinct of the municipality of Samal, 
Bataan, ballots bearing the protestant's name in a number sufficient to change 
the results of the election, were rejected and not counted in his favor. </p>
<p align="justify">"4. The election inspectors read and counted in favor of the 
protestee enough ballots to change the results of the election, which bore the 
protestant's name.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. The protestee's leaders electioneered during the voting 
both inside and outside of the polling place. </p>
<p align="justify">"<span style="font-style: italic;">Wherefore</span> the protestant respectfully prays this Honorable 
Court to immediately order the ballot boxes of the municipality of Samal, 
Bataan, to be forwarded to it, and after the necessary proceedings, to direct 
the profer board of canvassers to correct the election returns and proclaim the 
protestant elected to the municipal presidency of the municipality of Samal, 
Bataan, with costs against the protestee. </p>
<p align="justify">"He also prays for such other remedy as may be just. </p>
<p align="justify">"Samal, Bataan, this 18th day of June of 1928. </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">"PEDRO SALDAÑA<br> </p>
<p align="justify">"I, Pedro Saldaña, do hereby declare that I am the protestant 
in the present motion of protest, and that I have read and acquainted myself 
fully with its contents, and I state that they are true and correct to the best 
of my knowledge and belief. </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">"PEDRO SALDAÑA </p>
<p align="justify">"Subscribed and sworn to before me this 18th day of June 1928; 
the declarant exhibited me his cedula No. F2192709, issued at Samal, Bataan, on 
April 28, 1928. </p>

<p style="text-align: right;">"C. M. BITUIN<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Clerk of Court</span>" </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On July 2, 1928, the protestee and appellee Crispulo Consunji 
entered a special appearance and moved for the dismissal of the protest on the 
ground that the Court of First Instance of Bataan, in which the motion of 
protest had been filed, had not acquired jurisdiction to try and decide it, 
because the same did not allege that there had been any proclamation of an 
elected candidate.</p>
<p align="justify">On July 12, 1928, said protestant and appellant filed a motion 
praying that he be permitted to amend his original motion of protest dated June 
18, 1928, so as to add the following: "On June 6, 1928, the municipal council of 
Samal, Bataan, acting as municipal board of canvassers, declared and proclaimed 
the protestee Crispulo Consunji elected as municipal president of said 
municipality of Samal, Bataan, P. I."</p>
<p align="justify">The protestee and appellee objected to the foregoing motion to 
amend on the ground that the profosed amendment dealt with the introduction of 
an essential allegation and its admission would be equivalent to permitting a 
new protest to be filed beyond the time fixed by law. </p>
<p align="justify">The trial court passing upon both the motion to dismiss and the 
motion to amend, entered the appealed order already referred to.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 479 of the Administrative Code, as lastly amended by 
Act No. 3387, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 479. <span style="font-style: italic;">Contested election to office in general</span>.—Contests 
in all elections for the determination of which provision has not been made 
otherwise shall be heard by the Court of First Instance having jurisdiction in 
the judicial district in which the election was held, upon motion by any 
candidate voted for at such election and who has duly filed his certificate of 
candidacy. The contest shall be filed with the court within two weeks after the 
proclamation.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It will be seen that said legal provision requires that the 
protest be filed within two weeks after the proclamation. It is therefore 
indispensable to have a previous proclamation of an elected candidate in order 
that an election protest may be filed against said candidate, not only because 
without such an act there can be no legally elected candidate, but also because 
it cannot be known at what time the period for Hie presentation of said protest 
begins to run. </p>
<p align="justify">In order that a Court of First Instance may exercise 
jurisdiction over an election contest, it is necessary that it first determine 
whether or not it acquired jurisdiction over it. To do so, it must examine the 
motion of protest for the purpose of finding out whether it contains all the 
essential and formal requisites provided by law for acquiring jurisdiction. The 
mere presentation of a motion to that effect is not sufficient. It is imperative 
that the same contain the essential facts to confer jurisdiction upon it, so 
that in view .thereof the court may determine whether or not it acquired it. 
Since it is indispensable for the filing of a motion of protest, that there 
should be a proclamation of an elected candidate such fact must appear in said 
motion.</p>
<p align="justify">In the election contest of Ferrer vs. Gutierrez David and Lucot 
(43 Phil., 795), cited also in the election contest of Yumul vs. Palma, G. R. 
No. 30174,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> recently decided, this court laid down the following doctrine: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"2. ID.; FACTS ESSENTIAL TO CONFER ON A COURT JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF AN ELECTION CONTEST.—Sections 44 and 45 of Act No. 3030, 
amending sections 479 and 481 of the Election Law, and referring to contested 
elections for any office in general and the procedure for such cases in court, 
show the essential facts that confer jurisdiction upon the court to hear and 
determine such kinds of causes, to wit: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the protestant has duly 
registered his candidacy and received votes in the election (Tengco vs. Jocson, 
43 Phil., 715); (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that the protestee has been proclaimed elected in said 
election (Manalo vs. Sevilla, 24 Phil., 609); (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) that the motion of protest be 
filed within two weeks after such proclamation (Navarro vs. Veloso, 23 Phil., 
625; Manalo vs. Sevilla, supra; Hontiveros vs. Altavas, 39 Phil., 226); (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) that 
all the candidates registered and voted in the election were proferly notified 
of the protest within twenty days following its filing; (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) that the notice be 
served by the sheriff or his deputy in the manner prescribed by the law, failing 
which, that the notice be published in a paper of general circulation in the 
locality or by notices posted in conspicuous places of the town as may have been 
ordered by the court.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. ID.; SUFFICIENCY OF PROTEST.—As regards the Protestant, an 
election protest is sufficient if the facts enumerated in clauses (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>), (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>), and 
(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) of the preceding paragraph are alleged." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">While it is true that from the motion of protest quoted above 
it appears that the general election wherein both the protestant and protestee 
were candidates for the office of municipal president of Samal, Bataan, was held 
on June 5, 1928, and that said motion of protest was presented on June 18, 1928, 
or thirteen days thereafter, since it does not appear from said motion of 
protest that there was a proclamation of an elected candidate after said 
election, the trial court could not, with only the aforesaid motion to judge 
from, know whether or not it had acquired jurisdiction to try it. Inasmuch as 
the facts which confer special jurisdiction are not presumed but must clearly 
appear in the motion, the trial court could not have acquired jurisdiction. 
(Tengco vs. Jocson, 43 Phil., 715; Viola vs. Court of First Instance of 
Camarines Sur and Adolfo, 47 Phil., 849.) </p>
<p align="justify">It is true that a motion to amend was presented for the purpose 
of remedying the defect, but it was done 36 days after the proclamation, which 
took place, according to said motion, on June 6, 1928, outside the period of two 
weeks fixed by the law for the filing of an election protest. As the trial court 
did not acquire jurisdiction by virtue of the original motion of protest, due to 
the lack of allegation therein of a proclamation of an elected candidate, which 
is one of the essential facts to confer jurisdiction on the court, the amendment 
remedying said jurisdictional defect, made after the period fixed by the law for 
the filing of an election protest, cannot confer jurisdiction on said court, 
inasmuch as the latter acquires jurisdiction only by the filing of said protest 
within said time with the allegation of all the essential facts of a 
jurisdictional character.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Tengco vs. Jocson (43 Phil., 715), this court 
laid down the following doctrine: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"AMENDMENT OF 'MOTION OF PROTEST,' ALLEGING JURISDICTIONAL FACTS AFTER EXPIRATION OF TIME FOR PRESENTATION OF ORIGINAL MOTION.—Amendments 
to a 'motion of protest' in election contest cases, to enable the proceedings to 
be considered, may be made, provided such amendments do not essentially change 
the grounds of the contest, or set forth grounds where none were originally 
stated; but where the amendments are so radical as to virtually initiate a 
contest where really no grounds at all had been alleged in the original motion 
of protest, they will not be permitted after the time allowed by law for the 
presentation of the original motion of protest. A dissatisfied candidate must be 
diligent A motion of protest in election contest which fails to allege 
protestant's qualifications to maintain the proceedings, cannot be amended to 
supply the omission after the lapse of the time which the statute allows for the 
commencement of the proceedings. The requirements of section 44 of Act No. 3030 
are jurisdictional."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing and of the repeated decisions of this 
court, we are of opinion, and so hold, that since the existence of a 
proclamation of an elected candidate is an essential fact of a jurisdictional 
character, the same must appear in the motion of protest, otherwise the court in 
which the motion is filed does not acquire jurisdiction to try the case and such 
defect cannot be cured by a motion of amendment filed after the lapse of the 
period fixed by the law for the filing of an election protest. </p>
<p align="justify">By virtue whereof, the order appealed from is affirmed, with 
costs against the appellant. So ordered. </p>
