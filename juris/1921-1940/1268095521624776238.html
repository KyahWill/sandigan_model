				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This certiorari proceeding was instituted by the Director of Lands, represented by the Attorney-General, to annul and set&nbsp; aside the order of March 28, 1931, and the partial decision of May 18th of the same year, rendered by the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance, cancelling the decision rendered on December&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1922 in&nbsp; cadastral case No. 13 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, G. L. R. O. cadastral record No. 282,&nbsp; declaring lot No. 1368 to be public land, in&nbsp; pursuance whereof the respondent Ambrosio Manuel's answer was admitted, and the lot aforesaid adjudicated to him.<br><br>On December 21, 1922, a decision was rendered in cadas- tral case No. 13 of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, G. L. R. O. cadastral record No. 282,&nbsp; entitled "The Government of the Philippine Islands, petitioner, vs. Artemio Abaya et al., claimants," declaring cadastral lot No. 1368 to be public land.&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 7,&nbsp; 1930, the Philippine Legislature passed Act No. 3672, entitled "An&nbsp; Act to authorize the filing in the proper court, under certain conditions, of certain claims of title to parcels of land that have been declared public land, within the period of one year from the date of the promulgation of this Act."&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 2 of said&nbsp; law provides that said Act shall&nbsp; take&nbsp; effect&nbsp; on the date when the Governor-General shall by means of a proclamation, announces that&nbsp; it has&nbsp; been expressly&nbsp; or&nbsp; tacitly approved by the President of the United States as provided in the Act of Congress of August 29, 1916.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to this provision, on February 28,&nbsp; 1930, the Governor-General issued&nbsp; proclamation No.&nbsp; 299, published&nbsp; on March 8, 1930, in Vol. 28, No. 29, page 817 of the Official Gazette, announcing that the President of the United States had approved Act No. 3672 on February 7, 1930.&nbsp;&nbsp; On March&nbsp; 26, 1930, the Governor-General issued proclamation No. 307, which was published on April 5th of that year in Vol. 28, No. 11, page 1252 of the Official Gazette, stating that Act No. 3672 was actually&nbsp; approved by&nbsp; the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of the United States on February 17, 1930, and not on the 7th of&nbsp; that month, as erroneously transmitted by radio, and that the former&nbsp; proclamation&nbsp; was&nbsp; thereby amended&nbsp; accordingly. On March 12, 1931, the respondent Manuel filed a motion in cadastral case No. 13 praying that the order of general default entered in the case, as well as the decision with reference to cadastral lot No.&nbsp; 1368&nbsp; be set&nbsp; aside, and&nbsp; that after admitting his answer and the supporting evidence, the parcel of land be adjudicated to him.&nbsp; On March 28th of that year, the respondent judge entered an order cancelling the decision declaring lot No. 1368 to be public land, and admitting Manuel's answer.&nbsp; On April 13th of the same year, the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration praying for the revocation of the order of March 28th, alleging that the motion of&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; Manuel had&nbsp; been&nbsp; filed after the one-year period granted by law.&nbsp; The motion for reconsideration was denied&nbsp; by the respondent judge on the 18th of that month.&nbsp; And on May 18,1931, said respondent judge, after hearing the&nbsp; evidence, rendered a partial decision in said cadastral proceeding adjudicating lot No. 1368 to Ambrosio Manuel.<br><br>On July 25,1931, the petitioner filed his amended petition, which was admitted through a resolution of this Supreme Court dated the 30th of the month.&nbsp; On August 10th, the respondents also filed&nbsp; an amended&nbsp; answer, which must be admitted&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purposes of&nbsp; this&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; In&nbsp; said amended answer the respondents set up as a special defense the promulgation of proclamation No. 307 by the Governor-General.<br><br>The only question arising from the facts set forth in the pleadings is whether&nbsp; the motion filed by the respondent Manuel on March 12, 1931, was filed within the one-year period fixed in section 1 of Act No. 3672, and this point involves, in turn,&nbsp; the computation&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; period.&nbsp; The Attorney-General argues that the period should be counted from February 28, 1930, the date of proclamation No. 299. The respondents contend that said period should be computed from the date of the publication of Act&nbsp; No. 3672 in the Official Gazette, which took place on March 18, 1930.<br><br>Proclamation No. 307, verbatim, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>"BY THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL&nbsp; OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS—A PROCLAMATION</center><br><center><i>"No. 307.—Amending Proclamation&nbsp; No. 299,&nbsp; series of 1930</i></center><br><br>"The original of Act Numbered Three thousand six hundred and seventy-two having been received from the Bureau of Insular Affairs at Washington, D. C, and it appearing thereon that the said Act&nbsp; was formally and actually approved by the President of the United States on&nbsp; February seventeenth, instead of February seventh, nineteen hundred and thirty, as this office was erroneously informed by radio on February nineteenth, Proclamation Numbered Two hundred and ninety-nine, dated February twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred&nbsp; and thirty,&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>" 'Pursuant to the provisions of section two of Act Numbered Three thousand six hundred and seventy-two, I hereby give public notice of the approval by the President&nbsp; of the United States&nbsp; on February seventeenth, nineteen hundred and thirty, as&nbsp; provided&nbsp; in section nine&nbsp; of the Act of Congress of&nbsp; August twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred and six- teen, of Act of the Philippine Legislature Numbered Three thousand six hundred and seventy-two, entitled "An Act to authorize the filing in the proper court, under certain conditions, of certain claims of title to parcels of land that have been declared&nbsp; public land,&nbsp; within the period of&nbsp; one year from the date of the&nbsp; promulgation of this Act. "</blockquote>"In witness&nbsp; whereof,&nbsp; I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the Government of the Philippine Islands to be affixed.<br><br>Director of Lands vs. Ocampo and Manuel<br><br>"Done at the City of Manila, this&nbsp; twenty-sixth day of March,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the year of our&nbsp; Lord nineteen hundred&nbsp; and thirty.<br><br>"[SEAL]<br><div style="margin-left: 400px;">"DWIGHT F. DAVIS<br></div><div style="margin-left: 400px;">"<i>Governor-General</i>"</div></blockquote>It will be observed that the prime and sole object of this proclamation was to correct the error incurred in proclama- tion No. 299 by the statement that the law had&nbsp; been approved on the 7th of February, 1930, by the President of the United States, instead of the&nbsp; 17th of that month and year. The amendment was substantial in so far as it&nbsp; had&nbsp; reference to the date&nbsp; of the President's approval of&nbsp; said&nbsp; law, and that date was a basis for the issuance of the proclamation of the Governor-General, which&nbsp; date, in&nbsp; turn, would determine&nbsp; when the aforesaid law took effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; this reason, proclamation No. 307&nbsp; must be understood to have abrogated,&nbsp; by&nbsp; amendment, proclamation No. 299,&nbsp; and this being so, the commencement of said period must be the date, not of the&nbsp; first proclamation, nor of the publication of the law in the&nbsp; Official&nbsp; Gazette, but of the&nbsp; second&nbsp; proclamation or,&nbsp; March 26,&nbsp; 1930.&nbsp; As a corollary of this, it follows&nbsp; that the motion of the&nbsp; respondent Ambrosio Manuel was&nbsp; filed within the one-year period provided&nbsp; by law, and hence, the order of March 28, 1931, and the partial decision of May 18th,&nbsp; rendered by the respondent judge are valid and lawful, and in rendering them, he did&nbsp; not exceed his jurisdiction or abuse his discretion.<br><br>Admitting, then, the amended answer&nbsp; filed by the respondents&nbsp; on&nbsp; August 10,&nbsp; 1931,&nbsp; the writ&nbsp; of certiorari&nbsp; is denied, without special pronouncement of costs.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J.,&nbsp; Johnson, Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
