				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CLARO P. AQUINO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The information filed herein alleges that the defendant, being 
a subagent of C. S. Salmon, general agent of the Insular Assurance Co., Ltd., 
collected and received from Graciano G. Magno, the sum of P125 as the first 
payment on the yearly premium on an insurance policy issued by said company, and 
said accused being bound as said subagent to deliver to the general agent, C. S. 
Salmon, the whole amount collected by him, that is, the P125, failed to do so 
appropriating to his own personal use a part of said sum, or P69.60, equivalent 
to 348 <span style="font-style: italic;">pesetas</span>. The defendant was found guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> and sentenced to four 
months and one day <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, with the accessories of law, to indemnify the 
offended party in the sum of P69.60, with the corresponding subsidiary 
imprisonment, and to pay the costs of the action. 
<p align="justify">It appears from the record that the defendant was duly 
appointed by the complainant C. S. Salmon as an insurance subagent of the 
Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd.; that in order to guaranty the fulfillment of 
his obligations as agent, the defendant gave a bond at the requirement of Mr. 
Salmon, for the sum of P4,000 in order to reimburse the general agent for any 
loss and damage the latter might sustain by reason of the non-performance of any 
of the obligations and undertakings contracted by the defendant by virtue of the 
contract of agency entered into with the offended party; that at the time when 
the defendant solicited the insurance and obtained of the assured Graciano G. 
Magno the sum of P125 as the first annual premium on the policy, that is, on 
October 16, 1925, he was duly authorized to do so; that the defendant was under 
the obligation to turn over to Mr. Salmon all of his collections made as 
subagent, although he was also authorized by the general agent to deduct 
therefrom his commission as subagent pursuant to the contract of agency, ajid it 
so appears from the accounts prepared by Mr. Salmon, which may be seen on pages 
112-124 of the record, and from Mr. Salmon's own testimony on page 24 of the 
stenographic notes, that the part pertaining to the Insular Life Assurance Co., 
Ltd., for the premium of the first semester of the insurance policy of Mr. Magno 
has been duly delivered to the company, and that corresponding to the second 
semester has likewise been turned over by Mr. Salmon to the company, though with 
some delay; that before the information in this case was filed, or on October 
13, 1927, there had been a civil case No. 30633 pending decision in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila ever since October 1926, for the liquidation of the 
accounts between the defendant Aquino and Mr. Salmon, in which complaint the 
plaintiff, among other things, alleged that he had employed the defendant as a 
life insurance agent for the period from August 1, 1925 until the month of May 
1926, during which time he had insured several people, whose premiums were 
payable quarterly, semiannually, or annually, and he had the right to charge 55 
per cent of said premiums as his commission, while the defendant prayed, among 
ether things, that the defendant and his bondsmen be sentenced jointly and 
severally to pay the balance due from agent Aquino amounting to P634.25, with 
interest at 10 per cent; and that agent Aquino's current account Exhibit 4-A, 
where the debit balance of P634.25 appears, the following two items are included 
as of August 16 and 31, 1926.<br></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Prem. on Pol. No. 20162, G. 
Magno.............................................. P78.71 <br></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Com. on Pol. No. 
20162................................................................ 36.01 <br></div><p align="justify">In 
view of the foregoing proven facts, the legal question to be decided is whether 
or not the defendant is guilty of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, for having appropriated a 
part of the sum collected from the insured Graciano G. Magno. The attorney for 
the defense contends that he is not, and in support of his contention discusses 
in his brief the four errors which he alleges were committed by the trial court. 
On his part, the Attorney-General is of opinion that the act committed by the 
defendant does not constitute<span style="font-style: italic;"> estafa</span>, and recommends that the appealed judgment 
be reversed and the defendant acquitted, maintaining that "from the time the 
defendant, at the requirement of Mr. Salmon, executed a bond to answer for the 
sums he might collect and fail to turn over as agreed upon, the relation created 
between the two was changed to that of debtor and creditor, and the fact that 
Mr. Salmon required the defendant to execute a bond in his favor is evidence of 
his intention merely to require civil liability of him." </p>
<p align="justify">In this case, Graciano G. Magno and C. S. Salmon testified for 
the prosecution, and Mr. Salmon himself for the defense. The rest of the 
evidence is documentary. Having considered the evidence before us, we are of 
opinion that the two essential elements of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> herein involved 
have not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, that is, deceit, and the fraud 
or prejudice caused by deceit. If, as the record shows, the defendant was 
authorized to retain his commission out of the amounts he collected; if in 
consequence of said authorization agent Aquino had a current account with the 
general agent, Mr. Salmon, wherein the sums collected by the defendant appear, 
which he was bound to deliver to the general agent or to the Insular Life 
Assurance Co., Ltd., and the commissions corresponding to him; if a civil case 
concerning the liquidation of accounts between the defendant and the general 
agent is pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila, we believe that the 
fact that the defendant retained the amount claimed to have been embezzled, does 
not prove the deceit which constitutes one of the essential elements of the 
crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. And there was no fraud or prejudice caused by the deceit, for 
it appears from the record that the insurance company received everything 
corresponding to it in payment of the policy for one year collected by the 
defendant, and the general agent Mr. Salmon, has the security of the bond given 
by the defendant in the sum of P4,000. And as to the insured Graciano, there is 
no proof in the record that his insurance policy was impaired by agent Aquino's 
omission to deliver to the general agent the whole amount which he collected for 
the premiums on that policy. </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of United States vs. Santiago (27 Phil., 408), 
which is similar to the instant case, the court said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"With no evidence before us tending to prove that the accused 
was not justified in relying upon the instructions and authority of the 
company's agent in this regard we do not think that he can be held <span style="font-style: italic;">criminally</span> 
liable for the retention of any amount which, in good faith, he believed the 
company was indebted to him.</p>
<p align="justify">"The real question for determination in this case is, 
therefore, whether the accused in good faith, believed the company to be 
indebted to him in the amount which it is charged and admitted he collected and 
failed to turn over. Upon this point we are of opinion that the evidence is not 
sufficiently conclusive to sustain a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. It is 
quite evident that there were differences between the accused and the company's 
local and general agents as to whom the commissions on various policies should 
be paid; and giving the accused the benefit of the doubt, we do not think that 
the evidence of record is sufficient to maintain a finding that his claim of 
indebtedness against the company was not made in good faith, in the honest 
belief that he was entitled to the commissions claimed by him." 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In virtue of the foregoing, the appealed judgment is reversed, 
and the defendant Claro P. Aquino must be, as he hereby is, acquitted, with the 
costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de officio</span>. So ordered. </p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Romualdez,</span> 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur. </div>
