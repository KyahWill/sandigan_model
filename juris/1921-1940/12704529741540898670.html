				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is what is known in judicial and administrative circles as 
the Ana Refresca Case.
<p align="justify">On June 18, 1920, Ana Refresca, a girl 19 years of age, resided 
in the barrio of La Huerta, municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna. On the 
date mentioned, she went to the house of her aunt in the barrio of Putol of the 
same municipality to work in the rice fields. The next day, Ana decided to 
return home and, at the request of her aunt, Hilarion Sanqui agreed to accompany 
her. The two, Ana and Sanqui, left at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. After 
they had gone some distance, they were joined by Macario Manguiat. On coming to 
an uninhabited place on the way, Manguiat, assisted by Sanqui, forcibly abducted 
the girl against her strong protest and resistance. She was taken to the woods 
in Silang, Cavite, and later to other places where she was brutally raped by 
Manguiat several times while her hands were being held by Sanqui. By means of 
threats and intimidation, Ana was afterwards compelled to place her signature on 
a marriage certificate. Her brother, Domingo Refresca, found Ana crying in the 
house of Cirilo Reyes in Silang, Cavite, and escorted her back to Calamba, 
Laguna.</p>
<p align="justify">The foregoing are the principal points in the narrative of Ana 
Refresca. Notwithstanding the many occasions during the protracted trials that 
she was called to testify, her story remains consistently the same. She is 
corroborated by other witnesses. The marriage of Ana Refresca and Macario 
Manguiat not being voluntary and valid, cannot be permitted to extinguish 
criminal liability.</p>
<p align="justify">But that is not all there is to the case. The crimes were 
committed in June, 1920. An abortive start was made in the Laguna courts. Then 
the matter was permitted to lag. So Ana Refresca petitioned the Wood-Forbes 
Mission and the Governor-General for protection and for the punishment of the 
guilty. In 1922, new informations were presented in the Cavite courts. The 
trials dragged for five years. Three Judges of First Instance presided. The 
number of times that Ana Refresca came from her home in Calamba, Laguna, to 
Cavite, Cavite, to testify, and the number of times that she was required to 
tell her pitiful story are appalling. Eventually, in the coercion and 
falsification of public document cases, the accused were acquitted. During the 
trial of the abduction with rape case, Manguiat escaped from jail, and was later 
killed by members of the Philippine Constabulary. Only now is Sanqui's 
conviction determined.</p>
<p align="justify">Nearly eight years have elapsed since a young orphan girl who 
had been abducted and raped, and who had gone through harrowing experiences too 
terrible to describe, came to the courts asking for redress. And did she receive 
that prompt attention to which all complainants and litigants are entitled? Was 
there meted out that speedy and impartial justice which is one's by right? This 
is a glaring example of the breakdown of the administration of the law in the 
Philippines.</p>
<p align="justify">The charge is forcible abduction with rape. The penalty is that 
for the more serious crime applied in its maximum degree. At least two 
aggravating circumstances offset by no mitigating circumstance are to be 
considered. The maximum of the maximum penalty provided by law is none too 
severe.</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from will be modified by sentencing the 
defendant and appellant to suffer twenty years imprisonment, <em>reclusion 
temporal</em>, with the accessory penalties, to endow the offended woman in the 
sum of one thousand pesos (P1,000), and to pay one-half of the costs of the 
first instance, and all of the costs of this instance.</p> <em>Johnson, Street, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</em> and 
<em>Villa-Real, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
