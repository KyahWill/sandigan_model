				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">STATEMENT<br></div><br>October 14,&nbsp; 1910,&nbsp; Gregorio Yulo y Regalado, then&nbsp; 37 years&nbsp; of&nbsp; age,&nbsp; executed&nbsp; a mortgage to and in favor&nbsp; of the commercial house of Francisco Manzano Yap Tico, through its attorney-in-f act, Yap Eng Chong, on his sugar plantation, in consideration of which and at that time, the firm advanced Yulo the sum of P15,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was stipulated in the mortgage that the&nbsp; debt&nbsp; should draw interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, and that the original debt, "as well as such obligations as are herein contained,"&nbsp; should become due and payable about the month of May, 1911. It was contemplated by&nbsp; both parties that the debt&nbsp; should be paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; Yulo by the delivery and sale&nbsp; of sugar produced on his plantation.&nbsp; This was followed by another like instrument of date November 24, 1911, including some other property, in which it&nbsp; is&nbsp; recited&nbsp; that "on&nbsp; account&nbsp; of the fact that the&nbsp; fields of said haciendas&nbsp; were burned," and "for the&nbsp; purpose of obtaining an extension of that debt up to June&nbsp; 30, 1912, and to increase the credit of P15,000 by the amount of P8,000, Philippine currency, to attend to the necessities of the <i>haciendas Tongo</i> and <i>Napay</i>," that the amount of the original&nbsp; debt should be increased to P23,000, P8,000 of which was&nbsp; then advanced,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; total amount should draw&nbsp; interest at&nbsp; the rate of 10 per cent per annum.<br><br>It further appears that on October 22, 1922, there was a settlement between&nbsp; the parties in which it was&nbsp; agreed that there was then due and&nbsp; owing the firm, the sum of P20,065.20.&nbsp; It also appears that the firm from time to time and in different amounts&nbsp; continued to advance&nbsp; money to Yulo,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that Yulo&nbsp; continued&nbsp; and&nbsp; at&nbsp; different times delivered sugar to the plaintiff;&nbsp; that the last&nbsp; money advanced to Yulo was on July 30, 1918; and that Yulo made his last delivery of sugar on May 30, 1915, amounting to P1,181.43. Apparently,&nbsp; such items are the last debits and credits between the parties.<br><br>Yulo, having died,&nbsp; Jose Lopez&nbsp; Vito&nbsp; was appointed as administrator&nbsp; of his&nbsp; estate.&nbsp; In the ordinary course of business, commissioners on claims were appointed to whom the firm&nbsp; duly&nbsp; presented its claim, and, for some unknown reason, no part of it was allowed.<br><br>From&nbsp; that decision the firm&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance where it sought to establish its claim against the estate for P72,496.48.<br><br>At the trial before the court, the parties entered into the following stipulation:<br><blockquote>"The parties agree that&nbsp; the&nbsp; chits signed by&nbsp; Gregorio Yulo&nbsp; and Meliton Fernandez represent the&nbsp; amounts and goods&nbsp; taken by said Gregorio&nbsp; Yulo on&nbsp; the date&nbsp; shown therein;&nbsp; that the defendant does not admit nor recognize such items&nbsp; set forth&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; statement of&nbsp; accounts which the plaintiff presents as Exhibit C, as are not evidenced by receipts&nbsp; or&nbsp; chits signed by&nbsp; Gregorio Yulo&nbsp; or Meliton Fernandez or Jose Yulo.<br><br>"That&nbsp; the defendant alleges as special&nbsp; defense in this case that plaintiff's action has already prescribed&nbsp; as to the amounts&nbsp; shown in the statement of accounts in Exhibit C taken up to October 14, 1914; that the value of the sugar delivered after October 14, 1914, must be applied&nbsp; upon the payment&nbsp; of the amounts taken by Gregorio Yulo, evidenced by chits&nbsp; or&nbsp; receipts subsequent&nbsp; to October 14, 1914; that the document marked Exhibit A is one signed by&nbsp; Gregorio Yulo on the&nbsp; date shown therein;&nbsp; that the document marked Exhibit D is one signed by Gregorio Yulo on the&nbsp; date shown therein;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; receipts and chits marked Exhibits B-l to B-39 are the vouchers of the&nbsp; items shown in Exhibit C referred&nbsp; to in said receipts and chits; that Exhibit C is an abstract&nbsp; of the debit&nbsp; and credit of the account of the deceased Gregorio Yulo in the books of the&nbsp; plaintiff written in Chinese.<br><br>"That&nbsp; Exhibits E-1 to&nbsp; E-4 are the report of the commissioners of appraisal; the claim of the plaintiff filed with the commissioners; the notice of the hearing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; claim; and a&nbsp; receipt of the commissioners of the copies of chits B-l to B-39.<br><br>"That&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; has made&nbsp; demand on the defendant for the payment of the amount&nbsp; claimed in the complaint, and said&nbsp; defendant has not paid&nbsp; the same.<br><br>"That the plaintiff corporation is the successor of F. M. Yap Tico.<br><br>"That with the facts herein agreed upon and the defense of the defendant, the parties submit&nbsp; the&nbsp; case to the court for judgment."<br></blockquote>The lower court held&nbsp; that, as to all of that portion of plaintiff's claim filed before the commissioners which was contracted prior to October 14, 1914,&nbsp; had prescribed under the provisions of paragraph 1, of section 43, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and upon that theory&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; the proceeding in so far as&nbsp; it&nbsp; is founded&nbsp; upon Exhibits B-1 to B-24, inclusive,&nbsp; is barred by the statute&nbsp; of limitations, and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the estate of&nbsp; Gregorio Yulo&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sum of P11,860.72, plus P10,222.84, with legal interest upon P10,222.84 from October 15, 1924, until the date of payment, together with the costs. .<br><br>Plaintiff appeals and assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote> "1. The court&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; considering that the statute of limitations is applicable to this case,&nbsp; and that the right of action of plaintiff against the defendant for a certain portion of the indebtedness set out&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; has prescribed.<br><br>"2. The court erred in not allowing interest at the rate of 10 per cent per annum on the principal&nbsp; after the date on which the decision was written in this case.<br><br>"3. The court erred in not rendering judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the&nbsp; full amount of the principal demanded .in the complaint."<br></blockquote><br>JOHNS, J.:<br><br>The first question is whether or not, as the trial court held,&nbsp; all of plaintiff's claim prior to October 14, 1914, is barred under&nbsp; the provisions of section 43 of the Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure.<br><br>It&nbsp; is admitted&nbsp; that on&nbsp; October 22, 1912, the&nbsp; parties then had a settlement of all of their previous mutual dealings,&nbsp; in which it was agreed that Yulo was indebted to the plaintiff in the&nbsp; sum of P20,065.20, and for which he gave the firm a chit on that date.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; evidence of any other settlement.&nbsp; Be that as it may, on October&nbsp; 24, 1912, Yulo signed&nbsp; a&nbsp; chit to and&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff for P1,000, and from time to time signed the following chits on the specified&nbsp; dates for the following amounts:<br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="61%">November 14, 1912</td> <td width="20%"> <div align="right">P1,000.00</div></td> <td width="19%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>December 27, 1912,</td> <td><div align="right">38.75</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January 3, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">896.05</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January 20, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">154.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 4, 1913</td> <td> <div align="right">200.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 6, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">300.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 19, 1913.</td> <td><div align="right">200.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 24, 1913</td> <td> <div align="right">80.50</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 28, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">17.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 8, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">200.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 15, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">500.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 26, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">80.50</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 2, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">500.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 7, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">300.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 22, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">250.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 29, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">120.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>May 2, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">150.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>May 14, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">450.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>July 28, 1913</td> <td><div align="right">300.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 31, 1914</td> <td><div align="right">194.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 1, 1914</td> <td><div align="right">1,000.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>December 3, 1914</td> <td><div align="right">1,000.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January 9, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">100.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January 21, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">280.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January 22, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">115.27</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>January 27, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">500.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 15, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">88.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>February 23, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">100.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 1, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">77.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 13,1915</td> <td> <div align="right">200.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 15, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">2,500.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 16, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">90.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>March 30, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">500.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 15, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">500.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 24, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">194.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>April 30, 1915</td> <td><div align="right">50.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>July 30, 1918</td> <td><div align="right">6,600.00</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>All of these items are evidenced by Mr. Yulo's own chits in the record, and, hence, as to them, there cannot be any dispute as to either dates or amounts.<br><br>It will thus be seen that from their inception, on October 14, 1910, Yulo's dealings with the plaintiff were continuous from month to month and from year to year.&nbsp;&nbsp; By&nbsp; their stipulation of facts "the parties agree that the chits signed by Gregorio&nbsp; Yulo and&nbsp; Meliton Fernandez represent the amounts and goods taken by said Gregorio Yulo&nbsp; on the dates shown therein."<br><br>It is further stipulated "that Exhibit C is an abstract of the&nbsp; debit&nbsp; and credit&nbsp; of the account of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased Gregorio Yulo in the books&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff written&nbsp; in Chinese."&nbsp; That is to say, Exhibit C is a true and correct copy&nbsp; of all the different entries pro and con in plaintiff's book&nbsp; of accounts.&nbsp; But it will be noted that there is no stipulation,&nbsp; neither is there any evidence&nbsp; that the&nbsp; books in question were' accurate&nbsp; or authentic, or that the entries therein made&nbsp; were based&nbsp; on debits and credits, or the mutual dealings between the parties.&nbsp; Neither does it appear that the entries&nbsp; were "repeated in the regular&nbsp; course of business," or&nbsp; that they were "copied from another&nbsp; at&nbsp; or near the time of the&nbsp; transaction."&nbsp; Without some evidence as to how and in what manner the books were kept and by whom they were kept, and the authenticity of the entries, and&nbsp; standing alone, the&nbsp; books themselves would not be competent evidence for any purpose.&nbsp; In this connection, except as to the entries based&nbsp; upon the chits&nbsp; in question, they cannot be used to prove plaintiff's case. It would be a very dangerous thing to admit account books, standing alone, as competent evidence without something to show that they were authentic and were kept in the ordinary course of business.&nbsp; Without some reasonable safeguards, it would be very&nbsp; easy to establish a&nbsp; fictitious claim on manufactured account books against any person.<br><br>It&nbsp; is very&nbsp; probable&nbsp; that in this particular&nbsp; case, the account books are authentic and were kept as they should have been kept.&nbsp; But there is no evidence of that fact. For such reasons, Exhibit C is not competent evidence for the plaintiff, except in so far as it is corroborated by the chits, the stipulation of facts or the original documents.<br><br>Again, referring to the stipulation of facts and Exhibit C, the abstract of the entries made in plaintiff's books, we find that from&nbsp; month to month and from year to&nbsp; year, after the inception of the transaction, Yulo delivered sugar to the plaintiff on February 5, 1913, March 8, March 11, March 26, April&nbsp; 2, May&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; June 15, 1914, January&nbsp; 9, 1915, January 21, January 25, March 1, March 16, March 29, April 30, and May ,30, amounting in value to P14,857.24, for all of which Yulo received credit on plaintiff's books on the corresponding dates of delivery, and his estate now relies upon and&nbsp; claims the amount&nbsp; of such credits as payments on his account.<br><br>Hence, we have an open, mutual, current account between the plaintiff and the defendant commencing on&nbsp; October 14, 1910, in which debits and credits were made&nbsp; from month to month and from year to year down to and including May 30, 1915, the date of the last credit, and July 30, 1918, which was the date of the last debit, all of which was in the lifetime of Yulo.<br><br>It will be noted&nbsp; that plaintiff's claim is&nbsp; based&nbsp; upon an open, mutual, and current account.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; could have&nbsp; legally&nbsp; treated and&nbsp; relied upon the settlement of October&nbsp; 22, 1912,&nbsp; as a stated&nbsp; account,&nbsp; and if it had&nbsp; done so,&nbsp; that portion of its claim would have been barred by the&nbsp; statute of&nbsp; limitations.&nbsp; Therein lies the&nbsp; error&nbsp; of the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff relies upon&nbsp; and sought to prove an open,&nbsp; current, mutual account dating from the original&nbsp; mortgage.&nbsp; Yulo had a legal&nbsp; right to say to the plaintiff&nbsp; that I want all&nbsp; of my future&nbsp; deliveries&nbsp; of sugar applied to my indebtedness accruing after October 22,1912, the date of the&nbsp; settlement.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is no evidence that he ever gave plaintiff any such instructions, in the absence of which, plaintiff&nbsp; had a&nbsp; legal&nbsp;&nbsp; right&nbsp; to apply any&nbsp; such payments on the open, current, mutual account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, it&nbsp; is very probable that if Yulo had ever given any such instructions, the plaintiff would then have insisted upon the payment of the debt evidenced&nbsp; by the settlement, and would&nbsp; not have permitted it to run for&nbsp; a period of ten years without a payment of some&nbsp; kind on that account. The fact that there is no proof that Yulo in his&nbsp; lifetime gave any instructions as to the appropriation of payments creates a strong presumption that he and the plaintiff continued in their respective dealings with each other on the assumption that the transactions between them were continuous from the date of their&nbsp; inception.<br><br>Upon the question&nbsp; of mutual,&nbsp; current&nbsp; account, Corpus Juris, volume 37, says:<br><br>Page 865:<br><blockquote>"Where there is a mutual, open, and&nbsp; current&nbsp; account consisting of reciprocal demands, the general rule is that the cause of action to&nbsp; recover the&nbsp; balance is deemed to accrue at the&nbsp; date of the last&nbsp; item proved,&nbsp; and that the statute of limitations&nbsp; runs from that time, so that, if the last item&nbsp; on either side of the account is not barred, it draws to itself all the other&nbsp; items'&nbsp; which will&nbsp; become barred only when&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute has&nbsp; run against the last no matter how far back the account commenced.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * "<br></blockquote>Page 867:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; " *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; It is commonly stated that the main ground upon which the rule as to mutual accounts rests, independent of express statutory provision, is that every new item and credit in an account given by one party to the other is an admission that there are some&nbsp; unsettled accounts between them, each item within the statutory period being regarded as equivalent to evidence of a promise which takes all the prior items out of the statute.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * "<br></blockquote>Page 868:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"The distinction between&nbsp; a mutual open account</span> and a simple open account is that in the former case the bar of the statute of limitations does&nbsp; not&nbsp; begin to run until the date of the last item, while in the latter the statute begins to run from the date of&nbsp; each particular item."<br></blockquote><br>Page 869:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; "Mutual accounts being made up of matters of set-off, to make an account mutual within the meaning of the rule under discussion the items on&nbsp; the&nbsp; different&nbsp; sides of the account must&nbsp; be&nbsp; capable of being set off&nbsp; against&nbsp; each other, and one time alone does not comply with that requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The account on both sides must be between plaintiff and&nbsp; defendant and&nbsp; must&nbsp; have&nbsp; originated between&nbsp; them, and the parties must have&nbsp; dealt with&nbsp; each other in the&nbsp; same capacity or relation.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"<br></blockquote>Page 879:<br><blockquote> " *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Where accounts are settled by carrying the balance forward instead of paying it in cash,&nbsp; they are not to be considered as&nbsp; open&nbsp; and running accounts&nbsp; from the beginning within the rule as to mutual accounts; but the balance carried forward may form&nbsp; a&nbsp; part of a&nbsp; new mutual&nbsp; account so as to&nbsp; be&nbsp; saved from&nbsp; the statute by subsequent items within the&nbsp; statutory period."<br></blockquote>Ruling Case Law,&nbsp; volume 17,&nbsp; page 730, says:<br><blockquote> "91. <span style="font-style: italic;">Actions on accounts.</span>âWhere&nbsp; there is a mutual open account between two parties&nbsp; it is said that it implies that they&nbsp; have&nbsp; mutually consented&nbsp; that each item shall not constitute&nbsp; an&nbsp; independent debt due&nbsp; immediately, to&nbsp; be paid or enforced&nbsp; at&nbsp; once, but&nbsp; that the&nbsp; items occurring from time to time, in favor of the respective&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; shall operate as&nbsp; mutual set-offs, and&nbsp; that the shifting balance, when either or both shall call&nbsp; for&nbsp; it, shall&nbsp; be the&nbsp; debt, and for this reason the statute of limitations does not run during such a state of mutual dealings, but only&nbsp; from the date of the last item.&nbsp; Where there has been a delay for the statutory period in making&nbsp; or adding any new items to an old mutual account, it&nbsp; may operate as&nbsp; a bar, but if the hiatus is less than the period of&nbsp; limitations, it will not have this effect, and if the last item is within the statutory period, it draws after it items beyond that time.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * "<br></blockquote>Tested by this rule,&nbsp; we are clearly of the opinion&nbsp; that no part of plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations.<br><br>Although, standing alone&nbsp; and within&nbsp; itself, Exhibit C does not tend&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove plaintiff's case,&nbsp; yet having&nbsp; been offered in evidence,&nbsp; the defendant has a legal&nbsp; right to use and rely upon&nbsp; the exhibit to prove his case and show the amount of&nbsp; defendant's credit, this upon the theory that the exhibit is&nbsp; an admission by the&nbsp; plaintiff against&nbsp; his&nbsp; own interest.<br><br>It is equally clear that under&nbsp; the terms and provisions of their&nbsp; original contract, the plaintiff is entitled to interest on the amount of each yearly balance&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate of ten per&nbsp; cent per annum.&nbsp; But there&nbsp; is no legal principle upon&nbsp; which it should have&nbsp; compound interest.&nbsp; That is to say, the plaintiff has no legal right to add the amount of the annual&nbsp; interest to the amount due&nbsp; him for&nbsp; each succeeding year, bring the interest forward, and make it a part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal,&nbsp; and thus obtain&nbsp; interest upon interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; contract will not&nbsp; bear&nbsp; that construction.<br><br>The question then as, to the amount due and owing the plaintiff&nbsp; is one of mathematics only.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; that on&nbsp; October 22, 1912, the amount due&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; was P20,065.20.&nbsp; The chits&nbsp; show that during&nbsp; the remainder of that year,&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff advanced Yulo the further sum of P2,039.00,&nbsp; making a total of P22,104.20 due and owing on January&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1913.&nbsp; During that year, as appears from the chits, the plaintiff advanced the further sum of P6,752.39, and Yulo paid&nbsp; on&nbsp; account P8,188.75,&nbsp; leaving a balance on January&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1914, of P20,667.84,&nbsp; the annual interest upon which would be P2,066.78.&nbsp; For the year 1914, Yulo received P4,417.86, and paid the plaintiff P672.69, leaving a balance&nbsp; due and owing plaintiff on&nbsp; January&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1915, of P24,413.01, the&nbsp; annual&nbsp; interest upon which would&nbsp; be P2,441.30.&nbsp; It appears from the chits that during the year 1915, the plaintiff&nbsp; advanced Yulo P7,836.76, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he paid the plaintiff P5,995.80, leaving a balance on January 1, 1916, of P26,243.97,&nbsp; the annual interest on which is P2,624.39.&nbsp; It does not&nbsp; appear that there are any other credits, and the last debit was on July 30, 1918, at which time the plaintiff paid Yulo P6,600, thus&nbsp; leaving due and owing the plaintiff on January 1, 1919, the&nbsp; principal sum of P32,843.97, the&nbsp; annual interest on which is P3,284.39. Since that time there have been no other dealings between the parties.<br><br>Plaintiff's&nbsp; complaint was filed on March&nbsp; 26, 1925.&nbsp; At that time, the amount of its claim, exclusive&nbsp; of any charge for interest, was P32,843.97.&nbsp;&nbsp; In round numbers, the interest on this amount from January 1, 1925, to March 26, 1925, would be about P800.<br><br>On this basis, for the year&nbsp; 1914,&nbsp; plaintiff would&nbsp; be entitled to interest amounting&nbsp; to P2,066.78.&nbsp; For 1915 P2,441.30, and for the years 1916 to 1919, inclusive, annual interest in the sum of P2,624.39, and for the years 1920 to 1924, inclusive,&nbsp; to the annual interest of P3,284.39,&nbsp; to which should be added the P800 for the&nbsp; accrued&nbsp; interest from January 1, 1925 to March 26, 1925, inclusive, making a&nbsp; total&nbsp; of P32,227.59, for interest which&nbsp; had accrued on plaintiff's&nbsp; claim&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; its complaint was&nbsp; filed on March 26,1925,&nbsp; or a total amount due and owing the plaintiff from&nbsp; the estate on March 26, 1925, of&nbsp; principal and all accrued interest, of P65,071.56.<br><br>It will&nbsp; be noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; our conclusion&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; amount due the plaintiff is based upon Mr. Yulo's&nbsp; own&nbsp; personal chits, about which&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no dispute,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; we have given the&nbsp; defendant credit for every&nbsp; item in Yulo's favor on Exhibit C, and&nbsp; that there&nbsp; is no evidence&nbsp; of any other payments&nbsp; having been made to the plaintiff.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; of the lower court is reversed,&nbsp; and one will be entered here in favor of the plaintiff and against the&nbsp; estate of Yulo for P65,071.56, with&nbsp; interest thereon from March 26, 1925, at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, and for costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">AvanceÃ±a, C.
