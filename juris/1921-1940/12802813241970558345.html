				[ G. R. Nos. 40543, 40544, August 16, 1934</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. IMAM AMPAN, SAKILI, MADJABO, SALI AND KANDONG, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">In a place situated within the municipal district, 
of Maluso, Province of Zamboanga, the Moros Imam Bok-koh, Imam Licod and
 Neo were attacked by the Moros Imam Ampan, Sakili, Madjabo, Sali and 
Kandong. Imam Bokkoh received wounds which caused his death, while Imam 
Licod and Neo received wounds which required medical attendance for more
 than thirty days.&nbsp; Against Imam Ampan, Sakili, Madjabo, Sali and 
Kandong, two informations were filed, one for homicide for the 
aggression on Bok-koh and the other for physical injuries for the 
assault against Imam Licod and Neo. In the case for homicide, the 
accused were sentenced to fourteen years and one day of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em> and to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of Imam 
Bok-koh in the sum of P500, with costs. In the case for physical 
injuries, they were sentenced to two years, four months and one day of <em>prision
 correccional</em> for the physical injuries inflicted upon Imam Licod 
and to the same penalty for those inflicted on Neo. From these judgments
 they appealed. During the pendency of this appeal, the accused Sali 
died, for which reason the case against him was dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify"> The evidence shows that, prior to the incident in 
question, there was a controversy over the ownership of a piece of land 
between the brothers Imam Bok-koh, Imam Licod and Neo, on one side, and 
the relatives Mora Minga and the accused, on the other. The controversy,
 which was submitted to the councillor of the district, was decided in 
favor of the accused. The brothers Bok-koh, Licod and Neo did hot agree 
with this decision and on June 29, 1933, they went to said land, 
accompanied by Neo's daughter Amsina. While they were gathering 
therefrom the fruits of a mango tree, the accused, armed with bolos, 
appeared and attacked them. Sakili assaulted Licod and, as the latter 
fled, he was attacked by Madjabo. Imam Ampan attacked Bok-koh while the 
other accused attacked Neo.</p>
<p align="justify"> The accused Sakili, testifying as witness, assumed 
all liability for the death of Bok-koh and the physical injuries 
inflicted upon Licod and Neo, stating that he alone attacked them. The 
other accused set up an alibi as a defense. The evidence, however, has 
not sufficiently established these defenses.</p>
<p align="justify"> In this instance, counsel for the appellants prays 
that Sakili be declared guilty of the offense of physical injuries 
committed upon Licod, and that Madjabo and Kandong be acquitted of both 
charges.</p>
<p align="justify"> There was conspiracy among all the accused and all 
of them are equally liable for all the consequences of the aggression. 
The fact that all the appellants were interested in the controversy over
 the ownership of the land and were for this reason united in the motive
 of the aggression, and the circumstance that they all went to the scene
 of the crime, equally armed with deadly weapons sufficient to produce 
the effects which resulted from the aggression, and all attacked the 
three offended brothers, prove the conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p align="justify"> With respect to Madjabo, the evidence shows that he 
in fact attacked Licod. As to Kandong, although the person whom he 
attacked has not been specified, the evidence likewise shows that, armed
 like his co-accused, he accompanied them and took part in the 
aggression, for which reason his liability is the same as that of the 
others for the consequences of the aggression.</p>
<p align="justify"> This court, however, takes into consideration the 
fact that the appellants committed the aggression because they believed 
themselves to be the owners of the land which was the subject matter of 
the controversy with the offended parties and that, notwithstanding the 
councillor's resolution in their favor, the offended parties still went 
to the land and gathered therefrom the fruits of the mango tree.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, all the appellants, with the exception of
 S'ali who is now dead, are declared guilty of the crimes charged and, 
taking into consideration Act No. 4103, they are sentenced, in the case 
for homicide, to the penalty of from six years of <em>prision 
correccional,</em> as minimum, to twelve years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>,
 as maximum, and, in the case for physical injuries, to six months of <em>arresto
 mayor, </em>affirming the appealed sentence in all other respects, with
 costs. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Abad Santos, Hull, Vickers,</em> and <em>Diaz, JJ.,</em> concur.
