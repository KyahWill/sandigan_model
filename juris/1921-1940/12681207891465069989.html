				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The appellant&nbsp; Esteban Cabajar&nbsp; (together with Simeon Sabal, who&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquitted)&nbsp; was tried for&nbsp; homicide&nbsp; as charged in the information by the Court of First Instance of Cebu, found guilty,&nbsp; and sentenced to twelve years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, the accessories of law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P1,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay one-half of the costs.<br><br>From&nbsp; this judgment the accused Esteban Cabajar&nbsp; appealed,&nbsp; alleging that the trial&nbsp; court erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; not finding that he acted in self-defense when&nbsp; he wounded the deceased which caused his death, and in not acquitting him on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>The record shows that ill-feeling&nbsp; existed&nbsp; between the deceased and the appellant, caused by the betrothal of the deceased Mariano&nbsp; Taborada's son and Esteban&nbsp; Cabajar's daughter.&nbsp; When the&nbsp; latter's hand&nbsp; was asked for, her father demanded that, the prospective groom give&nbsp; him a P150 in cash, a carabao, and a house, by way of dowry, or what was formerly called "<i>bugay</i>" in&nbsp; Visayan,&nbsp; "<i>bigay kaya</i>"&nbsp; in Tagalog,&nbsp; and "<i>sab-ong</i>" in the Ilocano&nbsp; dialect. The young man and his father were agreeable, but Esteban&nbsp; Cabajar then asked for P160 more.&nbsp; As&nbsp; Mariano Taborada and his son could not pay the additional amount, they consulted a lawyer in&nbsp; Cebu, who&nbsp; advised&nbsp; them to try&nbsp; to&nbsp; arrange matters amicably with&nbsp; Cabajar.&nbsp; After another interview with Cabajar, they obtained his consent, and he told them they could apply for the marriage license. They did so,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; wedding&nbsp; took&nbsp; place on October&nbsp; 1, 1930, after which the couple called upon Esteban Cabajar to ask his blessing.&nbsp; But he refused, saying&nbsp; it was not a custom in his family. This, however,&nbsp; did&nbsp; not prevent them from holding a marriage&nbsp; feast,&nbsp; which&nbsp; Esteban Cabajar himself attended.<br><br>The trouble between&nbsp; the two fathers-in-law thus seemed to have been patched up by their children's marriage.&nbsp; But Cabajar heard that Taborada,&nbsp; his&nbsp; daughter's&nbsp; father-in-law, went about saying that he (Cabajar) had&nbsp; asked too much&nbsp; for&nbsp; his daughter's&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; and this&nbsp; soured their relations.<br><br>One afternoon in the month of October, 1930, Mariano Taborada was in the barrio of Himaomaoan, municipality of Cebu, Province&nbsp; of Cebu,&nbsp; in a coconut grove where one Simeon Sabal was distilling <i>tuba</i>.&nbsp; Besides Simeon Sabal, there were <his four="" sons,="" two="" others,="" severo="" gabucan="" and="" arcadio="" labrador,="" apparently="" drinking=""><i>tuba</i>.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is not&nbsp; known&nbsp; whether it was&nbsp; intentional&nbsp; or a mere coincidence,&nbsp; but&nbsp; Esteban Cabajar came upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; scene.&nbsp; According&nbsp; to the witnesses for the defense,&nbsp; when Mariano Taborada caught sight of him,&nbsp; he exclaimed: "I'm glad you&nbsp; have come, <i>Compadre</i>, now we can settle our little difference," and&nbsp; drew&nbsp; his bolo&nbsp; or dagger; Esteban Cabajar also pulled out a long, pointed bolo.&nbsp; According to witnesses Simeon Sabal,&nbsp; his son,&nbsp; Simeon Sabal,&nbsp; jr., Arcadio Labrador, and&nbsp; Severo Gabucan, the barrio lieutenant, all ran&nbsp; away upon&nbsp; seeing Tabprada&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cabajar&nbsp; draw their bolos and left&nbsp; them facing each other, battling with the bolos in their hands.<br><br>Pedro&nbsp; Padayao, witness for the prosecution, testifies that he was present at the scene and remained until&nbsp; Cabajar had struck at Mariano Taborada twice, when Simeon Sabal stepped&nbsp; in and&nbsp; stabbed Mariano Taborada twice in the back with a sickle or curved bolo used in extracting tuba. But&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court refused to believe&nbsp; this witness, not only because the witnesses for the&nbsp; defense are unanimous in declaring that Padayao was not present, but also, and perhaps&nbsp; mainly, because he did not report Simeon&nbsp; Sabal's alleged part in the crime to the authorities until he was called to Cebu a week later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pedro Padayao affirms that he told Mariano&nbsp; Taburada's son of Simeon Sabal's part in the fight, but if this were&nbsp; true, says the trial court, we cannot understand how the&nbsp; son of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; did not report this fact to the authorities&nbsp; when Esteban Cabajar was&nbsp; prosecuted.<br><br>The trial court, as we have&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; believe witness Padayao&nbsp; of&nbsp; the prosecution, and we do not feel justified in departing from this finding.&nbsp; Upon the strength of the testimony&nbsp; adduced by the defense,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court found that the accused and Mariano Taborada fought face to face and, in consequence, the latter died on the sixth day.<br><br>The appellant contends that he wounded&nbsp; the deceased in self-defense.&nbsp; But since&nbsp; the&nbsp; fight&nbsp; occurred, as the trial court found, with both combatants&nbsp; ready to settle&nbsp; the differences&nbsp; between them by force, and considering the eleven wounds in&nbsp; the face, back, and&nbsp; other parts of the corpse, whereas it&nbsp; does&nbsp; not appear that the accused&nbsp; sustained a single wound,&nbsp; and considering,&nbsp; furthermore, the&nbsp; defendant's own testimony of record, he cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; said to have acted in self-defense.<br><br>In applying the minimum period of the penalty, the trial court took&nbsp; into account the&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; education as a mitigating circumstance, which was quite within&nbsp; his discretion.&nbsp; Since the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; law, it&nbsp; must&nbsp; be affirmed with&nbsp; costs against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Romualdez, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.</his></div>
