				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DEMETRIO FRANCISCO Y GAAC, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">There is no question of fact involved in the present case, for the defense 
counsel admits that all the allegations of the information have been 
established, and that the sentence imposed upon the defendant is justified.
<p>Counsel insinuates, however, though without insistence, that the case should 
be remanded to the trial court, because the judgment contains no finding of 
facts, citing United States <em>vs.</em> Avillar (28 Phil., 131). That ruling is 
not applicable to the present case where the penalty imposed by the trial court 
is clear and definite. While the judgment is brief, it contains the finding that 
the accused is guilty of the offense charged. Moreover, failure to make findings 
upon the facts does not necessarily require a reversal, if the facts found are 
sufficient to support the judgment. (Pastor <em>vs</em>. Gaspar, 2 Phil., 
592.)</p>
<p>Although both the principal and the additional penalty for habitual 
delinquency are less severe under the Revised Penal Code than under the laws in 
force when the crime was committed (<em>vide</em> art. 309, No. 4, Revised Penal 
Code as against art. 518, No. 4, Penal Code; and art. 62, rule 5, subdivision 
(<em>a</em>), Revised Penal, Code as against Act No. 3586), still, inasmuch as 
the defendant is an habitual criminal and therefore does not come under the 
favorable provisions of article 22 of the new Penal Code, there must be applied 
to the defendant the penal laws in force when he committed the crime.</p>
<p>We agree with the Attorney-General's recommendation as to the proper penalty 
to be imposed upon the appellant.</p>
<p>For the crime here prosecuted, which is defined and penalized in article 518, 
No. 4 of the Penal Code in force at the time it was committed, as it was amended 
by Act No. 3244, in connection with article 520 of said Code, the appellant 
deserves the medium degree of the corresponding penalty, in view of the absence 
of any modifying circumstance.</p>
<p>And for the habitual criminality, consisting in two rather than three prior 
convictions, considering two of them as one in the light of the ruling set forth 
in People <em>vs. </em>De la Cruz (G. R. No. 33786), there must be imposed upon 
the appellant the additional penalty of three to nine years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is modified, the appellant being 
sentenced to four years, two months, and one day of <em>prision 
correccional,</em> and three years' additional imprisonment for his habitual 
delinquency, together with the costs of both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, 
Villa-Real,</em> and <em>Imperial, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
