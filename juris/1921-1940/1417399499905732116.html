				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The complaint which initiated these proceedings is as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about January&nbsp; 16, 1924, and in the municipal district&nbsp; of Siraway of the Province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Zamboanga, Philippine Islands, the said accused who was then and there a teacher in the public school named 'Siokon&nbsp; Settlement Farm School' and as such in charge of the education and instruction of&nbsp; the Mora Ubbang, 11&nbsp; years of&nbsp; age, voluntarily, illegally and criminally lay with said Ubbang girl against her will. Contrary to law and within the jurisdiction of&nbsp; this court."<br></blockquote>After trial,&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Zamboanga found the accused guilty of the crime of rape and sentenced him to seventeen years and four months <i>reclusion temporal,</i> to endow&nbsp; the offended party in the sum of P00, to recognize and support the offspring, if any, and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accused appeals from this judgment and makes two assignments of error committed by the trial court: (1) In giving weight to the testimony of the&nbsp; alleged offended party and in not taking into consideration that of the five witnesses for the defense; and&nbsp; (2) in not acquitting him and ordering his release.<br><br>After examining&nbsp; the evidence we find it proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused had carnal relations with&nbsp; the&nbsp; offended&nbsp; party&nbsp; on the occasion referred&nbsp; to in the complaint.<br><br>It has&nbsp; not been&nbsp; sufficiently&nbsp; proved&nbsp; that&nbsp; the offended party at that time was less than 12 years of age, nor that the act consummated was against her will.&nbsp; And, giving the accused the benefit of the reasonable doubt which we entertain&nbsp; on these&nbsp; two points,&nbsp; there are no grounds for declaring him guilty of the crime of rape.<br><br>He,&nbsp; however, according to the allegations of the&nbsp; complaint, was then "a teacher in the public school&nbsp; named 'Siokon Settlement&nbsp; Farm School/ and&nbsp; as such was in charge of the education and instruction&nbsp; of the Mora&nbsp; Ubbang;" and said accused,&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; testimony of Cristino Buendia, a witness for the defense, "was in charge of the field work of the school and, at the same time, taught the second grade of said school"&nbsp; (p. 40, s. t. n.).&nbsp; And, according to the offended party's testimony, at that time she was a pupil&nbsp; of the third grade in said school&nbsp; and&nbsp; was working in the field known&nbsp; as&nbsp; the school garden (p. 6, Ibid).<br><br>Although the&nbsp; accused was not the teacher of the third grade class which the offended party attended and which the trial court referred to in remarking that he "was&nbsp; not, however, in charge of the class which the offended party attended&nbsp; on the day in question,"&nbsp; nevertheless,&nbsp; he&nbsp; was in charge&nbsp; of the education of the&nbsp; offended party in agricultural matters, because he was in charge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; field work&nbsp; of the&nbsp; school, according to the witness for the defense,&nbsp; Cristino Buendia.<br><br>And we hold that this relation of the accused to the offended party is&nbsp; sufficient to make&nbsp; the seduction, which we understand was voluntary, punishable under the provisions of article 443 of the Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The term "teacher," employed in this article, includes not only teachers who give academic instruction, but also those of trade schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of December 15,1883; vide 3 Viada, Codigo Penal, pp. 136, 137.)<br><br>Under the terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint and upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts proved, the accused may and must be held guilty of the crime defined and&nbsp; penalized in said article 443 of the Penal Code.<br><br>Therefore, the judgment appealed&nbsp; from finding the appellant guilty of the crime of rape is reversed and he is found guilty of the crime of qualified seduction as denned and punished&nbsp; in the first paragraph&nbsp; of article 443 of the Penal Code, and he is sentenced to&nbsp; one year, eight months and twenty-one days<i> prision correctional,</i> to the accessories provided in article&nbsp; 61&nbsp; of the Penal&nbsp; Code, to endow the offended party in the sum of P300, to recognize and support the offspring, if any, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of insolvency&nbsp; of the endowment and support of the offspring, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty here imposed, with&nbsp; the costs of both instances against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Street, Avance√±a, Villamor,&nbsp; Ostrand,</i> and<i> Johns, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><br><div align="center">D I S S E N T I N G :<br></div><br><br><b>MALCOLM<i>, J.,</i> </b><br><br>There&nbsp; are&nbsp; two&nbsp; courses, and two courses only, for the court to follow in the decision of this&nbsp; case on appeal.&nbsp; The first course is to accept the findings&nbsp; of fact as made by Judge Horrilleno and the testimony of the aggrieved party, and to hold the accused, a public school teacher, guilty of the detestable crime of rape committed&nbsp; on the person of a Mora girl 11 years of age.&nbsp; The remaining course is not to accept the findings of the trial Judge and not to believe the story told on the witness stand by the girl, and then to acquit the accused.&nbsp; But when the court tries to compromise on questions of law and of fact, when it tries to pick out points here and there in the testimony of the girl and believe them, while paying no attention to other points and&nbsp; facts, just&nbsp; as&nbsp; reasonable, and when it&nbsp; convicts&nbsp; the accused of another&nbsp; crime by building up a case on a series of presumptions, it follows a nearly impossible&nbsp; course of procedure.<br><br>The testimony of the girl,&nbsp; practically uncorroborated in any respect,&nbsp; was to the effect that she was raped by&nbsp; the accused, about&nbsp; 9 o'clock in the&nbsp; morning, in a spot but a short distance from the school by his use of force and intimidation.&nbsp;&nbsp; She, and&nbsp; likewise her father, also&nbsp; said that her age was 11 years.&nbsp; The court considers that&nbsp; she is telling the truth when she states that she was raped, but considers that she is not telling the truth when she states that the act was committed with force or&nbsp; intimidation, and when she states that she is under 12 years of age.&nbsp; Against her testimony stands the testimony of all the teachers of the school, who stated positively that&nbsp; at the time when the crime was alleged to have been committed, the accused was&nbsp; in the company of the supervising teacher and&nbsp; the girl was in the schoolhouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctor who examined her gave as his opinion that she had not been raped, although admitting that the physical examination, disclosed two lacerations and a rupture of the hymen.<br><br>In order to convict the accused of a violation&nbsp; of article 443 of the Penal Code, it is necessary to&nbsp; find that the girl is over 12 and under 18 years of age, and there is not a scintilla of evidence to this effect in the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is next incumbent upon the court to find that&nbsp; the accused is a teacher who&nbsp; had charge of the education of the girl&nbsp; seduced.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the accused was neither&nbsp; the principal of the school nor the teacher of the class in which the girl was&nbsp; enrolled.&nbsp; On this point the&nbsp; trial judge made the following finding:<br><blockquote>"Alegase en la querella que el acusado era el encargado de la education e instruction de la of endida al tiempo de la comision del delito, pero las pruebas demuestran que si bien el acusado era uno de los maestros de la&nbsp; escuela publica de Siokon no era, sin embargo, el encargado de la clase a que la ofendida asistia en el dia de autos."<br></blockquote>It is my opinion and I have read all of&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence carefully, that the accused has not been proved guilty beyond a reasonable&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; either of the&nbsp; crime of rape or of the crime of seduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the method followed by the members of the&nbsp; court in arriving at a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; discloses this same doubt in&nbsp; their&nbsp; minds,&nbsp; if&nbsp; they would&nbsp; only be consistent enough to give it expression.</div>
