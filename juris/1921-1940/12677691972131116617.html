				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an&nbsp; appeal taken by Gabriel&nbsp; Tejedor and others from the order of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila, dated May 22, 1930, in cadastral case No. 63, G.

Francisca Palet de Yedra, the herein deponent Jose Oliver&nbsp; y Bauza, does hereby adjudicate to Gabriel&nbsp; Tejedor y&nbsp; Palet in undivided fourths the naked ownership of the following real estate:<br><blockquote>"A house of two stories built of strong materials with a galvanized&nbsp; iron roof,&nbsp; with&nbsp; a total area of 994.53&nbsp; square meters, of which the house and its appurtenances&nbsp; occupy 256.37 square meters;&nbsp; said house is situate&nbsp; in&nbsp; the City of Manila (Philippine Islands) at No. 694 A. Mabini Street, and&nbsp; comprises lot 1&nbsp; of block No. 379 of&nbsp; cadastral proceeding No, 318 of&nbsp; said City of Manila, bounded on the north by lots Nos.&nbsp; 2&nbsp; and 3&nbsp; of said block; on the east by lot No. 3 thereof; on&nbsp; the south by Herran Street; and on the west by A. Mabini; and two of said block, bounded on the north by lots 4 and 5 thereof; on the east by lot 3; and on the south by lot 1; and&nbsp; on&nbsp; the west by A. Mabini Street.<br><br>"The house was purchased by&nbsp; D. Agustin Palet y Roca from Don Francisco&nbsp; de&nbsp; Paula Ossorio y Cembrano through the deed of May 1, 1896 executed before notary&nbsp; public D. Calixto Reyes&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; in&nbsp; substitution of his partner D. Abraham Garcia; and the deponents agree to evaluate it at one hundred&nbsp; eighteen thousand, one hundred twenty- four <i>pesetas</i> and sixty-two centavos.<br><br>"Said property&nbsp; is&nbsp; recorded in&nbsp; the registry of deeds of Manila on folio four&nbsp; (reverse), volume three of the Ayuntamiento of&nbsp; Manila, South Registry, Section of&nbsp; Malate No. 23, third inscription.<br><br>"By virtue of the foregoing, the undersigned,&nbsp; acting as aforesaid, does hereby&nbsp; divest&nbsp; himself and those&nbsp; whom he represents, of all joint&nbsp; ownership of said property, transmitting it&nbsp; in its entirety to the&nbsp; assignee, in the capacity mentioned&nbsp; heretofore, whom he empowers to take posses- sion thereof, binding himself and his agents&nbsp; to warrant them&nbsp; according&nbsp; to law.</blockquote>"D.&nbsp; Gabriel Tejedor, in his capacity above set forth, does hereby accept the adjudication, declaring himself and all his children and those whom he represents, fully paid and satisfied in the inheritance of D. Agustin Palet y Roca and Da. Francisca Palet de Yedra, ceding and transferring in favor&nbsp; of his coheirs, this coownership&nbsp; of the remainder of the estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; said inheritance, promising that neither he nor his children shall henceforth claim anything thereon."</blockquote>If the house adjudicated&nbsp; to the&nbsp; respondents Gabriel Tejedor and others in the deed of partition and adjudication, Exhibit&nbsp; I,&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; one purchased&nbsp; by&nbsp; Agustin&nbsp; Palet&nbsp; y Roca&nbsp;&nbsp; from Francisco de&nbsp; Paula&nbsp; Ossorio y&nbsp; Cembrano as evidenced by the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; executed&nbsp; on May 1, 1896, and if, according to the agreed statement of facts, said&nbsp; house is the one numbered 694 which, in the&nbsp; cadastral survey was numbered 1 of block 379, the respondents are only entitled to this lot by virtue of said deed of partition and adjudication, excluding lot No. 2 of said cadastral survey,&nbsp; which comprises the property&nbsp; numbered 678 and derived from Roman Martinez y Andueza,&nbsp; not adjudicated&nbsp; to&nbsp; them by said deed.<br><br>When, therefore, the respondents asked for the adjudi- cation to them of lot No. 2, together with lot No. 1 of cadastral case No. 63, G. L. R. O. record No. 318, knowing that they were only entitled to said lot No. 1, this being the only property adjudicated to them&nbsp; by the&nbsp; deed of partition and adjudication, Exhibit I,&nbsp; they&nbsp; acted in bad faith, and the year not having elapsed&nbsp; from the issuance of the&nbsp; decree of registration, which took place on October 8, 1929, until the filing of the motion for review on December 5, 1929, such review was proper on the ground of fraud, in accordance with the provisions of section 38 of Act No. 496.<br><br>Even if there&nbsp; had not been fraud in obtaining the&nbsp; decree with respect to&nbsp; lot No.&nbsp; 2, or&nbsp; the year had elapsed after the issuance of said decree, the petitioners would be entitled to recover of the respondents the ownership of said lot No. 2 by virtue of the said deed of partition and adjudication, Exhibit I, so long as the property remained registered&nbsp; in their name&nbsp; and&nbsp; no third person had acquired it in good faith for a valuable consideration.&nbsp; (Philippine Land Improvement Co. vs. Bias, p. 540, <i>ante</i>, and citations.)<br><br>In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of opinion and so hold: (1)&nbsp; That a co-owner of land who applies for and obtains&nbsp; the adjudication and registration&nbsp; in his name of a lot which he knows has not been allotted to him in the&nbsp; partition, acts in bad&nbsp; faith, and the decree&nbsp; issued may be reviewed within the year following such issuance,&nbsp; in accordance with section&nbsp; 38&nbsp; of Act No. 496; and&nbsp; (2) that even in the absence of fraud&nbsp; in obtaining said decree, or after the lapse of one year after the issuance thereof to said co-owner, he may be compelled to convey said lot to whoever received it in the apportionment, so long as it remains registered in his name, and a third party has not acquired it in good faith for a valuable consideration.<br><br>Wherefore, finding no error in the order appealed from, the same&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed in its entirety,&nbsp; with costs against the appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
