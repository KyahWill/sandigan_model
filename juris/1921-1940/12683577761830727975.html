				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED ROBERT HENRY WOOD. J. T. KNOWLES, ADMINISTRATOR AND APPELLANT, VS. THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, CLAIMANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>
</p><div align="justify"> In the testamentary proceedings of Robert
Henry Wood, after the committee on claims had approved the only claim
filed therein and the court had ordered its payment, the Collector of
Internal Revenue, through the Solicitor-General, filed a motion
claiming from the estate the sum of P27,106.93 as deficiency income
taxes for the years from 1918 to 1923, inclusive, and 1929, which said
deceased had failed to pay and had not included in his income tax
returns filed by him. <p> The claim was opposed by the administrator of the estate
alleging that the court lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance or pass
upon the same; that the claim should have been presented to the
committee which has already ceased to exist; that the claim has already
prescribed, inasmuch as more than three (3) years have .elapsed and
that the estate does not owe the amount of the taxes claimed.</p>
<p> The court decided the question of jurisdiction against the
administrator and the latter excepted. Subsequently, the Collector of
Internal Revenue filed an amended motion reducing the same claim to
P19,680.42. The motion was supported by an affidavit of the Collector
of Internal Revenue known as amended proof of debt, containing the
income omitted by the deceased and discovered, upon investigation, by
an official of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The administrator filed
no amended opposition but his original written opposition subsisted.</p>
<p> At the hearing of the amended claim, the attorney for the
administrator filed a motion for postponement of the hearing in order
to give him an opportunity to file an itemized opposition. The court
postponed the hearing. At the second hearing, the administrator failed
to file the itemized opposition which he had promised but reiterated
his objections stated in his written opposition. The Collector of
Internal Revenue supported his claim by his affidavit, already attached
to the record, and refrained from presenting further evidence. After
the hearing, the court, in an order of August 26, 1933, sustained the
amended claim and ordered the administrator to pay to the Collector of
Internal Revenue the sum of P19,680.42, from available funds of the
estate. The administrator filed a motion for reconsideration and a new
trial after the denial of which he appealed, properly filing the
necessary record on appeal.</p>
<p> In this instance, the administrator vigorously contends that the
court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the claim and that the Collector
of Internal Revenue had not presented satisfactory or conclusive
evidence to establish the certainty of the same in the amount lastly
specified, and in this respect argues that the affidavit of said
official is insufficient and incompetent evidence and, with the
admission thereof, he was deprived of the right to cross-examine.</p>
<p> We do not give much weight to the first contention because it has
been uniformly held in this jurisdiction that such claims may properly
be presented in the intestate or testate proceedings of the deceased
who owes the deficiency tax, without the necessity of presenting it to
the committee which had been created. (Pineda <em>vs.</em> Court of First Instance of Tayabas and Collector of Internal Revenue, 52 Phil., 803, and Whitney <em>vs.</em> Collector of Internal Revenue, G. R. No. 32361<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup>.)</p>
<p> The second point is decisive and resolves the appeal in favor of
the administrator. We are of the opinion that it was incumbent upon the
Collector of Internal Revenue to prove the certainty of the items
constituting his claim, particularly the alleged net income said to
have been omitted</p>
<p> in the returns filed by the deceased and subsequently discovered,
according to the affidavit of the Collector of Internal Revenue, upon
investigation by an official of his bureau. This allegedly omitted net
income, for the same reason that it did not appear in any book or
document forming part of the tiles of the Bureau of Internal Revenue,
necessarily had to be proved by means of the testimony of said
official. Inasmuch as the latter was not presented or did not testify
at the trial, it is clear that the administrator was deprived of his
substantial right to cross-examine him. The foregoing conclusion of
course, is based upon the premise that the affidavit presented in
support of the claim is competent evidence, a quality which we doubt in
view of the opposition originally filed by the administrator. When the
administrator filed his opposition to the claim and generally and
specifically denied its allegations, the character of <em>prima facie</em>
evidence of the affidavit attached to the claim was destroyed and it
became incumbent upon the claimant to prove his claim by means of
material and competent evidence. This duty has not been complied with
in view of the fact that no other evidence had been presented and the
claim was based solely on said affidavit.</p>
<p> In arriving at the foregoing conclusion, this court particularly
took into consideration the circumstance that the claim is for a gross
amount the exactness of which is not evident, inasmuch as the Collector
of Internal Revenue, in his amended claim, notoriously reduced the
amount previously claimed. If he has committed this substantial error
in presenting his first claim, it is possible that the figures given in
the amended claim may, likewise, be not exact and may be subject to
further reduction after a careful analysis of the evidence which the
claimant might have.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the appealed order is set aside and the case is remanded
to the trial court with instructions that it hold a new trial of the
claim and require the parties to present the evidence by means of which
they intend to support their respective contentions, without special
pronouncement as to the costs of this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Butte,</em> and <em>Goddard, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
