				<H3>BARTOLOME VENUS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JUAN POSADAS, JR., AS COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This action was instituted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Capiz on July 27, 1928, by Bartolome Venus, for the purpose of recovering from 
the Collector of Internal Revenue the sum of P1,641.60 paid to him, under 
protest, on March 19, 1924, in the character of internal revenue tax. Upon 
hearing the cause the trial judge gave judgment in favor of the plaintiff 
requiring the Collector of Internal Revenue to refund to the plaintiff the 
amount so paid by him under protest, without pronouncement as to costs. From 
this judgment the Collector of Internal Revenue appealed.</p>
<p>The only defense relied upon by the appellant and necessary to be considered 
upon this appeal is that of prescription. From the agreed statement of facts it 
is apparent that more than four years elapsed from the time the tax, for the 
recovery of which this action was instituted, was paid under protest until the 
date when the action to recover the money was instituted. In section 1579 of the 
Administrative Code the period of only two years is allowed after the payment of 
an internal revenue tax under protest within which action may be brought for its 
recovery. The lower court held that the provision referred to is not absolute 
but only permissive, and the case of Zaragoza <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Alfonso (46 Phil., 159), is 
cited as a case in which the prescriptive provision was ignored. It is true that 
in the case mentioned recovery of a tax involuntarily paid was permitted after 
more than two years had elapsed. But the tax involved in the case cited was not 
an internal revenue tax, and the provision upon which reliance is here placed by 
the defendant is found in the provisions of the Administrative Code relative to 
the collection of internal revenue taxes. Also, in Zaragoza vs. Alfonso, supra, 
the question of prescription was not raised, and the decision there made is not 
pertinent to the point now under consideration.</p>
<p>The period of two years allowed in section 1579 of the Administrative Code is 
taken from the United States Revised Statutes, and the courts of the United 
States have not hesitated to apply said provision to cases arising under the 
statute (Maryland Casualty Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. U. S., 251 U. S., 342). There is no good 
reason why it should not be given effect in this jurisdiction. We accordingly 
hold that the right to recover the tax which is the subject of this action has 
prescribed.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from must be reversed and the defendant, Juan Posadas, Jr. as Collector of Internal Revenue, will be absolved from the complaint. So 
ordered, without costs.</p>
