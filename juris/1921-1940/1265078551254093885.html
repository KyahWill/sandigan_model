				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The herein accused-appellant Anacleto
Follantes was sentenced by the Court of First Instance of Isabela for
the crime of murder to the penalty of <em>cadena perpetua</em>, to
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay
one-third of the costs of the trial, with the accessory penalties of
the law.
<p> By reason of his appeal, the appellant assigns four alleged errors claimed by him to have been committed by the court <em>a quo </em>in
its judgment in question, which errors may be reduced to the sole
proposition that the facts proven during the trial do not Establish his
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p> The prosecution attempted to prove that in the morning of October
16, 1935, Julian Manauis and his son Victor went to a forest in the <em>sitio</em>
named Dalena-Tugtug, municipality of Echague, Isabela, within the
lumber concession of the Echague Lumber Co., to cut timber. While
father and son were felling a tree called <em>cariwat</em>, they were
surprised by Anacleto Follantes and Eugenio Jacinto who were
accompanied by the boy Julian Pinto. Follantes told them1 to stop
cutting the tree because the land on which it stood formed part of the
lumber concession of the Echague Lumber Co. of which he was the <em>encargado</em>.
Julian Manauis begged Follantes to allow him and his son to continue
cutting the tree so that their labor would not be in vain and they kept
cutting it. In view of such attitude, Follantes told Julian Manauis and
his son that if they did not heed his warning they wouldsome day pay
for it, leaving immediately with his companions. Julian Manauis and his
son Victor succeeded in cutting and felling the tree but did not finish
cleaning it and they decided to return on the following day, October
17, 1935. As the tree was big they could not finish their work and in
the afternoon of said date Julian Manauis told his son Victor that he
would return alone to the forest on the following day to finish cutting
the tree to pieces. Early the following morning, October 18,1935, and
before Julian Manauis left for the forest, he told his son Victor to
attend the <em>novena</em>, of his deceased grandfather Agustin
Escano, and that he himself would try to return before the prayers
began or after dinner. As Julian failed to return by noon, Victor
became uneasy but he waited until the afternoon to see whether his
father would arrive. After having waited in vain, Victor went to the
place where they had felled the tree, arriving there at about 9 o'clock
in the evening. By means of a lantern he began to search for his father
and found his lifeless body lying on the ground near the tree felled by
them, with the head completely severed from the body and a few paces
away. He noticed several wounds on the body and the axe, which had been
used in cutting the tree, lying nearby. He also saw his father's shirt,
hat and bolo hanging from the branch of a tree. Without touching
anything, Victor hurriedly returned to the barrio and notified the
barrio liutenantof what he had seen. Said barrio, lieutenant, in turn,
advised the justice of the peace thereof. Early in the morning of
October 19, 1935, Lieutenant Benjamin Molina of the Constabulary, upon
being advised by a policeman that the body of a dead person had been
found in the <em>sitio</em> of Datena-Tugtug, he called upon the
justice of the peace and the chief of police and, accompanied by
constabulary soldiers and two policemen, they immediately went to said
place and found the body of Julian Manauis as it had been discovered by
his son Victor in the morning of October 18th of said year. About three
meters from the body they found the basket Exhibit B, containing
tobacco and lime; the shirt of the deceased hanging from a branch of
the fallen tree, and the axe lying on the ground near the log. After
the body had been removed and brought to the municipal building by
order of the justice of the peace, it was examined by Dr. Guillermo
Blanco, who found the following wounds (Exhibit A):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(<em>a</em>) An incised mortal wound 14 inches long
and 1 inch wide on the right cheek, extending from the comissure of the
mouth, along the inferior maxillary bone upwards to the right temporal
bone, cutting the principal vessels of the region in addition to the
above-stated bones, with a depth reaching to the cavity of the mouth; (<em>b</em>)
an incised mortal wound 4 inches long, 2 inches deep and 1 inch wide in
the left precordial region under the nipple, extending transversally,
cutting the left 4th rib in two and piercing the principal vessels of
said region; (<em>c</em>) an incised mortal wound extending
longitudinally from above the navel to the sternum on the same level as
the xiphoid process, causing the opening of the abdominal and part of
the thoracic cavity and freely exposing the visceral organs of which
the small and large intestines were cut; (<em>d</em>) an incised mortal
wound 12 inches long, 2 inches wide and 3 inches deep in the lumbar
region, extending transversely and cutting the vertebral column.</p>
  <p>
"It is likewise stated that at the time of the autopsy of the body, the
head was found to be completely severed from the body, the neck being
the point of severance. It was also found that the right hand was
completely severed from the corresponding arm, the wrist being the
point of severance."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the meantime, the constabulary conducted a search for the
persons who might have been the authors of the hideous crime and to
that effect it organized two patrols, one led by Lieutenant Molina and
the other by Sergeant Villanueva, the latter bringing with him the
basket Exhibit B. Said sergeant arrested Eugenio Jacinto in the hut of
the latter who told him that the basket in question belonged to
Anacleto Follantes. Questioned about the crime, Eugenio Jacinto denied
participation in the commission thereof and pointed to one Agonos who,
according to him, lived in the town of Santiago. The sergeant took
Eugenio Jacinto to said town in search of Agonos but they failed to
find him. Jacinto admitted later that Agonos was a fictitious person
and that he was the only one responsible for the death of Julian
Manauis. He was then taken to the Constabulary barracks in Echague
where he was questioned by Lieutenant Molina. Lieutenant Molina later
took Jacinto to the justice of the peace who, in turn, investigated him
and put in writing his statement reiterating, among other things, that
he was the only one who had killed Julian Manauis. In view of this
confession, a complaint was filed against Eugenio Jacinto in the
justice of the peace court, charging him with the crime of murder.
Subsequently, while he was still in confinement and upon being
questioned further by Lieutenant Piccio, who had relieved Lieutenant
Molina as such in said province, the accused Eugenio Jacinto partly
repudiated his former confession and implicated Anacleto Follantes. A
new complaint was then filed before the justice of the peace charging
Eugenio Jacinto, Anacleto Follantes and Julian Pinto with the crime of
murder. The accused waived their right to a preliminary investigation
and the case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance. The
provincial fiscal filed the corresponding information charging Eugenio
Jacinto and Anacleto Follantes with the crime of murder and asked for
the dismissal of the case against Julian Pinto for lack of evidence.
Upon arraignment, the accused Eugenio Jacinto pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from six years and one
day of <em>prision mayor</em> to twelve years and one day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>,
with the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased in the sum of P1,000, and to pay one-third of the costs of the
trial. The accused Anacleto Follantes pleaded not guilty and the court
proceeded with the trial of the case against him.</p>
<p> In view of the plea of guilty entered by the accused Eugenio
Jacinto and hi&amp; former statement implicating Anacleto Follantes,
the provincial fiscal used him as a witness for the prosecution.
Eugenio Jacinto testified that sometime before and up to the date of
the crime, he was in the employ of Anacleto Follantes as lumberman and
carrier and lived in a hut belonging to said Follanites; that in the
morning of Wednesday, October 16, 1935, he, Anacleto Follantes and
Julian Pinto went to the <em>sitio</em> of Dalena-Tugtug to visit the
timber within the lumber concession of the Echague Lumber Co. of which
the appellant was the caretaker (<em>encargado</em>); that there they found Julian Manauis and his son Victor cutting a tree called <em>cariwat</em>;
that upon seeing them, Follantes said: "You cannot continue cutting
timber because this is within the concession of the Echague Lumber Co.
of which I am the caretaker (<em>encargado</em>)"; that Julian Manauis answered saying: <em>"Compadre</em>,
please allow us to cut it because it would be a pity to waste all our
work"; that Follantes replied: "If you continue to do so, you will
later suffer for ft"; that after this dialogue, and as it was already 9
o'clock in the morning of said day, Anacleto Follantes and his
companions left and the deceased and his son continued to work until
nightfallwhen they succeeded in felling the tree which they were
cutting; that on the following day, Thursday, October 17, 1935,
Anacleto Follantes and Eugenio Jacinto went together to deliver lumber
to the Echague Lumber Co.; that on the succeeding day, Friday, October
18, 1935, Follantes and Jacinto returned to Dalena-Tugtug and on the
way Follantes told Jacinto that he intended to kill Julian Manauis;
that upon arriving at Dalena-Tugtug they found Julian Manauis alone
cleaning the tree which he and his son Victor had cut and felled on
October 16, 1935; that upon seeing him, Follantes went to him and said
to him: "I told you to stop and you did not stop"; that Julian Manauis
answered: "We have continued, <em>compadre</em>, because it would be a
pity to waste all our work"; that Follantes replied: "That can not be
and, leaving Jacinto who was by his side and in front of Manauis, he
went behind Manauis, stealthily unsheathed his bolo which hung from his
belt, and said: "I told you to stop that work and you have not
stopped"; that upon hearing this, the deceased stopped cleaning the
tree and, facing Follantes, said: "Please, <em>compadre</em>, we are'
just going to finish it, it would be a pity to waste all our work";
that at this juncture Follantes inflicted the first blow with his bolo
on the back of Manauis who fell to the ground in a sitting position;
that while Manauis was in this position with his hands raised to ward
off another blow, Follantes struck him with his bolo for the second
time, hitting him on the wrist of the right hand, severing it
completely; that Follantes then pushed Manauis, who fell to the ground,
and said to his companion: "Help me"; that upon hearing this, Jacinto
struck Manauis with his bolo, Exhibit E, which he carried in his left
hand, inflicting a diagonal wound in the sternum of the deceased; that
Follantes immediately struck Manauis on the neck, completely severing
his head which rolled to the ground, and causing his death; that
Follantes later picked up the head, placed it, at first, with the face
towards the right but, on second thought, he made it face towards the
opposite side and gave it the last blow on the right cheek, cutting it
from the ear to the mouth; that Jacinto and Follantes later went to the
river to wash their bolos, leaving, in their haste, the basket Exhibit
B, with its contents Exhibits C and D, consisting of tobacco and lime,
all belonging to the appellant; that the appellant hid his bolo in a
toolbox in his hut; that the reason why he (Jacinto) had testified that
he was the only one responsible for the death of Julian Manauis was
because Follantes told him not to reveal what had happened to anybody
and that if he alone assumed all the responsibility without implicating
Follantes, the latter would provide him with an attorney to defend him
and give him P50 besides.</p>
<p> Anacleto Follantes denied everything that the witnesses for the
prosecution had testified against him and attempted to prove that from
the morning of October 16, 1935, until the afternoon of the following
day, he was in Echague where he had gone to deliver, as in fact he
delivered, lumber to the Echague Lumber Co.; that at about 11 o'clock
in the morning of said date, October 16, 1935, he had a business
transaction with the public school supervisor, Vicente Mesa, concerning
the delivery of the lumber specified in the requisition voucher Exhibit
1; that on the following day Follantes also had a transaction with
Silvestre Pintang to supply lumber to the Echague Lumber Co.; that in
the afternoon of October 17, 1935, he returned to his house in Garit;
that early in the morning of the following day, October 18, 1935, the
appellant, accompanied by his wife and child left for the town of
Santiago for the purpose of visiting some relatives; that they crossed
the river in their own <em>banca</em> at the ford at Suyong, Echague;
that from said place they took a bus of the Rural Transit for Santiago;
that upon arriving at the barrio of Calao, they went to the house of a
niece of his whom they found quarreling with her husband; that as they
could not reconcile the spouses, he (Follantes), his niece and her
father went to the office of the chief of police of Santiago to ask for
his intervention; that as they were told that said officer was in his
house they went there, but said chief of police told them to see him
again at his office in the afternoon which they did; that on that same
day he and his family went to the house of his mother-in-law; that
while in Santiago, he met Sergeant Villanueva, accompanied by a soldier
and Eugenio Jacinto, looking for one Agonos; that he was then informed
that a man had been killed in Dalena-Tugtug; that he left Santiago on
October 21, 1935; that on October 22, 1935, while he was in his hut in
Dalena-Tugtug, Sergeant Villanueva arrived telling him that he was
under arrest because Eugenio Jacinto had implicated him in the
commission of the crime; that he informed Sergeant Villanueva that he
had nothing to do with the death of Julian Manauis, and that he
reiterated his statement when he was investigated at the Constabulary
barracks in Echague.</p>
<p> In rebuttal, the prosecution attempted to prove that on October 20
or 21, 1935, Lieutenant Benjamin Molina investigated at the barracks
Jose Walat, who was the boatman at the ford, and the latter said that
he did not remember having seen Follantes in the vicinity of the ford;
that while Follantes was detained at the Constabulary barracks, one
Feliciano Castro went to see Attorney Macario Guevara to inform him
that Follantes needed his services ; that said attorney went to the
barracks and conferred with Follantes who told him that he needed his
services for himself and for Eugenio Jacinto; that Follantes asked him
how much he would charge for his services and Guevara answered that he
had to pay him P400, to which Follantes agreed; that when Guevara told
Eugenio Jacinto that Follantes had contracted his services for them
both, Jacinto told him that he had no objection; that Guevara then
filed his appearance as well as his clients' waiver of their right to a
preliminary investigation; that Eugenio Gaffud, who knew Follantes
because he was Gaffud's subagent in the cutting and sale of logs in the
latter's lumber concession, testified that Follantes used to carry a
basket similar to Exhibit B; that at about 12.30 o'clock in the
afternoon of October 18, 1935, while Gaffud was on his way home from
the office of the municipal secretary of Echague, he saw Follantes
accompanied by Eugenio Jacinto and Julian Pinto near the fence of the
Constabulary barracks; that Follantes and his companions were on their
way to the <em>poblacion</em> from the Echague Lumber Co.; that upon seeing them, Gaffud greeted them saying: "So you are here, <em>pare</em>";
that Follantes did not go to Santiago in the morning of October 18,
1935, inasmuch as he and Jacinto went to the forest at about 7 o'clock
in the morning of said day; that Eugenio Jacinto was not in the habit
of chewing tobacco and that the basket Exhibit B did not belong to him
but to Follantes; that when Follantes and his family boarded a truck
for Santiago in front of the municipal building, he told Jacinto not to
say anything of what had happened; that Eugenio Jacinto had not been
reprimanded by Follantes and that he did not know what e ukulele was
nor how to play it or any other instrument; that it was not true that
Jacinto and Follantes made deliveries of lumber to the Echague Lumber
Co. in the morning of October 16, 1935, because they went to the
forest; that the transaction which Follantes had with Vicente Mesa took
place at about 5.40 o'clock in the afternoon of said day.<br>
    <br>
There are, therefore, two series of evidence, one for the prosecution
and another for the defense, each contradicting the other. The evidence
for the prosecution consists principally in the testimony of Eugenio
Jacinto, confessed coparticipant in the commission of the crime and, as
such, his testimony should be considered with the greatest caution and
care. At the beginning Eugenio Jacinto admitted being the only one
responsible for the death of Julian Manauis, but later on, while he was
confined in the Constabulary barracks, upon being urged by the
constabulary soldiers therein to tell the truth, he implicated the
appellant Follantes, for which reason the latter was included in the
information as his co-accused. During the trial, Eugenio Jacinto,
testifying as a witness for the prosecution, stated that at first he
assumed full responsibility for the killing of Julian Manauis because
Follantes had cautioned him not to reveal to anybody what had happened
between the appellant and the deceased and that if Jacinto did not
implicate him he would furnish him with an attorney to defend him and
would give him 1N50 besides. This testimony of Eugenio Jacinto is
partly corroborated by said Attorney Macario Guevara, who had been
contracted by Follantes to defend him and Jacinto. Eugenio Jaciuto's
testimony relative to his going to the forest together with Anacleto
Follantes and Julian Pinto in the morning of October 16, 1935, and the
warning given by Follantes to the deceased that if he continued to cut
the tree he would have to suffer for it, is likewise corroborated by
that of Victor Manauis, son of the deceased. Therefore, the fact (that
Eugenio Jacinto is a coparticipant in the commission of the crime does
not render his testimony incredible nor inadmissible inasmuch as he has
been corroborated in material points thereof. Furthermore, when Jacinto
testified as &amp; witness for the prosecution, he had already been
convicted of the crime with which he had been charged and of which he
had pleaded guilty. Consequently, he could no longer expect to be
discharged nor be treated with leniency. It does not appear that he has
been made any promise in the sense of shortening his term of
imprisonment and of rendering it less arduous so that, stifling the
voice of his conscience, he would implicate an innocent person. It has
been insinuated that the spirit of vengeance was their motive that had
induced Jacinto to testify against his former employer in whose house
he was living, the motive of suchvengeance being made to consist in the
alleged fact that he had been severely reprimanded by Follantes for
selling lumber and bartering it for guitars, and that he was not
provided with an attorney to defend him after Attorney Guevara's
withdrawal from the case. In addition of having been categorically
denied by Eugenio Jacinto, such facts are not in themselves sufficient
for a witness to implicate his former employer in so serious a crime
with so grave consequences, if the latter were really innocent.</p>
<p> The defense of alibi presented by Anacleto Follantes loses its
force and value if it were taken into consideration that his alleged
going to Echague in the morning of October 16, 1935, to make delivery
of lumber to the Echague Lumber Co. is rebutted by the testimony of
Eugenio Jacinto and Victor Manauis to the effect that in the morning in
question said Follantes went with Eugenio Jacinto and Julian Pinto to
the <em>sitio</em> of Dalena-Tugtug where the deceased and his son Victor were cutting a tree called <em>cariwat</em>,
and by that of the superintendent of public schools, Vicente Mesa, that
his conversation with Follantes took place at 5.40 o'clock in the
afternoon and not at 11 o'clock in the morning of October 16, 1935, as
stated by the appellant. The defense of alibi to the effect that early
in the morning of October 18, 1935, Anacleto Follantes left for
Santiago with his wife and child, crossing the river in his own <em>banca</em>, is likewise disproved by the testimony of Eugenio Jacinto that in that morning he and Follantes were in the <em>sitio</em>
of Dalena-Tugtug where the crime was committed. But even if it were
true that Anacleto Follantes went to Santiago with his family on said
day, having been seen in said town at about noon, his presence there is
not incompatible with his presence in Dalena-Tugtug in the morning of
the same day, inasmuch as he could have left for Santiago with his
family after he and Jacinto had washed their bolos in the river and
returned to his hut in Garit.</p>
<p> As to the motive of the crime, it is not venturesome to believe
that the insistent, though entreating, refusal of the deceased to heed
the warning given him by Follantes that if he continued to cut the tree
something would happen to him, offended the latter's dignity as
caretaker (encargado) of that part of the lumber concession and he was
exasperated when, in the morning of the crime, he saw that Julian
Manauis had carried out his disobedience as a challenge to his
authority.</p>
<p> Taking into account all the facts of the case, this court is
convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the accusedappellant Anacleto
Follantes was one of the principal authors, if not the principal
author, of the murder of Julian Manauis.</p>
<p> Wherefore, with the sole modification that the penalty of imprisonment imposed upon the accused-appellant be denominated <em>reclusion perpetua</em> instead of <em>cadena perpetua</em>, the appealed judgment is affirmed in all other respects, with the costs to the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, </em>and <em>Concepcion, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em> Judgment modified,.</em></p><hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p align="center"> RESOLUTION ON MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL</p><p align="right"><em>September 24, 1937</em>
</p><p>
  <strong>VILLA-REAL,</strong> <em>J.;</em></p>
<p> This k a motion filed by the accused-appellant Anacleto Follantes,
praying for a new trial of his case on the ground of newly discovered
evidence material and essential to his defense, which, in spite of due
diligence, had not been discovered by him prior to the trial of said
case in the lower court, the newly discovered evidence in question
consisting in the recantation of Eugenio Jacinto, his co-accused
therein, who testified at the trial as a witness for the prosecution.</p>
<p> Eugenio Jacinto's recantation made on October 19, 1936, that is,
seven and a half months from the date the judgment of conviction
against the accused-appellant Anacleto Follantes was rendered, consists
in a sworn statement in the Ilocano dialect and translated into English
(Exhibits A and B), made in the City of Manila before notary public
Modesto R. Ramolete, which briefly states as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In the morning of October 18, 1935, while I was alone in the <em>sitio</em>
of Dalena-Tugtug, Echague, Isabela, gathering buri shoots for our food,
I found the deceased Julian Manama cutting a log. Upon seeing him, 1
told him to stop cutting the log. He answered me saying: 'Get out of
here, you have nothing to do with this.' I then told him that I had
something to do with the log he was cutting, but as he did not heed me,
I told him: 'You do not heed me because I am only a boy.' He then
answered: 'Get out of here, "<em>Uki ni inam</em>", you have nothing to
do with this,' and forthwith threw a piece of wood at me, which I was
able to evade. Faced with such situation, I unsheathed my bolo and
wanted to fight with him, but seeing that I was no match for him
because he was bigger, I ran away. As I had a grudge against the
deceased by reason of said incident, I returned to where he was and,
approaching him stealthily from behind without his seeing me, I struck
him on his right side with my bolo. He fell to the ground in a sitting
position and tried to defend himself with his hands. Then, with my bolo
I again struck his hand, his stomach, his neck and, lastly, his face.
At noon on the following Sunday, Sergeant Villanueva of the
Constabulary and two soldiers arrested me in Garit and took me to
Santiago to see Anacleto Follantes. They later brought me to their
barracks in Echague where I confessed that I was the author of the
death of Julian Manauis. I was later investigated by the justice of the
peace of Echague to whom I likewise stated that I had killed Julian
Manauis. There afterwards transferred me to the Constabulary barracks
in Ilagan where the sergeant who investigated me told me to implicate
Anacleto Follantes in the crime. When I refused, they struck me with
the butt of a gun, boxed me in the face, slapped and kicked me, and
inserted a fine wire into the canal of my genital organ four times. As
I could not endure so much torture, I acceded to their desire and upon
being brought before the court in Ilagan, I testified that it was
Anacleto Follantes and I who killed' Julian Manauis and that Follantes
was the principal author. They likewise forced me to testify that the
basket found at the scene of the crime belonged to Follantes and,
although it was mine, I had to say that it belonged to Follantes
because the constabulary soldiers told me that it would be worse for me
if I did not so state. Eugenio Gaffud nether met Follantes, Pinto and
me in front of the Constabulary barracks at noon on October 18th, after
the commission of the crime, nor spoke to us on that occasion, as he
testified. We met him only the day before, October 17th, at said place
when we were on our way to a restaurant in the poblarion of Echague,
coming from Garit. At noon on October 18, 1935, I was in our barrio and
Follantes went to Santiago with his wife and Pinto. Victor Manauis did
not see Follantes, Pinto and me in the morning of October 16, 1935,
because on that day we went to deliver lumber to the Echague Lumber Co.
The log which the deceased was hewing had been cut and felled by Pinto
and me in the month of August last. I did not complain later of the
maltreatment I had received from the constabulary soldiers because the
latter threatened to shoot me and they promised me my freedom if I
testified as witness for the prosecution. They also gave me leather
shoes, two military shirts, two undershirts and money first in the sum
of P5 and later P3, all of which were deposited in the storeroom of the
Bilibid Prisons where they may be seen for verification. The warden of
the provincial jail at Ilagan also threatened me saying that if I did
not incriminate Follantes he would poison me while in jail. I make this
recantation to relieve my conscience of a burden for having falsely
implicated Follantes."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the first sworn statement (Exhibits 3 and 3-A) made on October
21, 1935, before the justice of the peace of Echague, Isabela, Eugenio
Jacinto briefly stated that after he had taken his breakfast on Friday,
October 18, 1935, he left his house and went to the forest; that upon
his arrival there he heard somebody hewing timber; that upon reaching
the place where the noise came from, he saw a person who was unknown to
him and asked him: "Why are you hewing timber?"; that said person, who
turned out to be the deceased Julian Manauis, answered him saying: "Who
are you to trouble and bother me?"; that Jacinto then said to him: "Why
did you not ask permission from the owner of the timber? Are you the
owner of this timber?"; that said unknown person again answered him
saying: "You better go home, <em>uki ni inam</em>, and do not come to
bother me" and later picked up a piece of wood with which he attempted
to strike Jacinto but the latter was able to parry it with his hand;
that Jacinto thereupon unsheathed his bolo and they fought but Jacinto
had to run away because he was afraid he would lose in the fight, his
opponent being bigger than he; that said person continued to hew the
timber; that Jacinto was hurt by what had happened to him and he
decided to take revenge; that he, in fact, returned to where Julian
Manauis was working and, approaching him stealthily from behind with
his bolo in his right hand, he struck Manauis on the back, felling him
to the ground in a sitting position; that he later gave him other two
blows, one landing on the right hand and cutting it, and the other
severing the left hand; that while the deceased sat helpless, Jacinto
cut off his head; that Jacinto later struck him on the stomach and on
the waist and afterwards slashed him twice on the face; that the log
which the deceased was hewing had been cut by Jacinto and Follantes,
the herein appellant; that the constabulary soldiers spoke kindly to
him and nether maltreated him nor made him any promise so that he might
declare what he had just declared; that the basket, Exhibit B, and the
contents thereof, Exhibits G and D, were his.</p>
<p> Eugenio Jacinto's testimony given at the trial by him as a witness
for the prosecution, during the direct examination as well as during
the rebuttal, which he now recants, is briefly as follows; That he was
working as lumberman in the employ of the appellant Anacleto Follantes;
that in the morning of Wednesday, October 16, 1935, he, the appellant
Anacleto Follantes and one Julian Pinto went to the <em>sitio </em>of Dalena-Tugtug to visit the timber within the concession of the Echague Lumber Co. of which said appellant was the <em>encargado</em>
(caretaker); that there they found; the deceased Julian Manauis and his
son Victor, who were cutting a tree called cariwat; that upon seeing
them, Follantes told them: "You cannot continue cutting timber because
this is within the concession of the Etehague Lumber Co. of which I am
the <em>encargado</em> (caretaker)"; that the deceased then pleaded to him saying: "<em>Compadre</em>,
please allow us to cut it because it would be a pity to waste all our
work"; that Follantes replied: "If you continue to do so, you will
later suffer for it"; that at about 9 o'clock in the morning of said
day, Follantes and his companions left the place and the deceased and
his son continued their work until nightfall when they finally
succeeded in felling the tree which they were cutting; that on the
following day, Thursday, October 17, 1935, he and Follantes went to the
Echague Lumber Co. to deliver lumber; that in the following morning,
Friday, October 18, 1935, he and Follantes returned to Dalena-Tugtug
and on the way Follantes told Jacinto that he intended to kill Julian
Manauis; that upon arriving at said place they found Julian Manauis
alone hewing the trunk of the tree which he and his son Victor were
felling on the 16th, and Follantes approached the deceased saying: "I
told you to stop and you did not stop"; that Julian Manauis answered
him saying: "We have continued, <em>compadre</em>, because it would be
a pity to waste all our work"; that the appellant replied saying: "That
cannot be," and leaving Jacinto who was by his side and facing the
deceased, he went behind the latter, stealthily unsheathed his bolo
which hung from his belt and said: "I told you to stop that work and
you have not stopped"; that upon hearing this, the deceased stopped
hewing the trunk and, facing Follantes, said: "Please, <em>compadre</em>,
we are just going to finish it, it would be a pity to waste all our
work," and again turned his back towards the appellant to resume his
work; that at that instant the appellant inflicted the first blow with
his bolo on Manauis' back, felling him to the ground in a sitting
position; that while Manauis was1 in this position with both hands
raised to ward off another blow, the appellant gave him another blow
with his bolo, hitting him on the wrist of the right hand, severing it
completely; that the deceased then fell to the ground, pushed by the
appellant, who said to his companion Jacinto: "Help me"; that upon
hearing this, Jacinto struck Manauis with his bolo, Exhibit E, which he
carried in his left hand, inflicting a diagonal wound in the sternum of
the deceased; that Follantes forthwith struck Manauis on the neck,
completely severing his head which rolled to the ground, and causing
his death; that the appellant then picked up the head, placed it, at
first, with the face towards the right but, on second thought he made
it face towards the opposite side and afterwards gave it the last blow
on the right cheek, cutting it from the ear to the mouth; that Jacinto
and Follantes later went to the river to wash their bolos; that on the
way Follantes warned Jacinto not to tell anybody what had happened;
that in their haste they forgot the basket Exhibit B, with its contents
Exhibits C and D, all belonging to the appellant; that the appellant
hid his bolo in a toolbox in his hut; that Jacinto was arrested by
three constabulary soldiers and brought to a private house in the
poblacionof Santiago to look for one Agonos who, according to him, was
the one responsible for the crime, but who turned out to be a
fictitious person; that he was later taken to the .barracks at Echague
where he was confined for three days; that from there he was brought
before the justice of the peace of Echague to whom he confessed that he
was the only one responsible for the crime; that he made this
confession because Follantes had told him at the barracks in Echague
not tp reveal what had happened to anybody and that if he assumed all
responsibility Follantes would provide him with an attorney to defend
him and give him T50 besides; that his said statement (Exhibit 3),
however, was not true; that Jacinto was later taken to jail in Echague
where he was confined for three days; that Jacinto furthermore stated
that it was not true that he had a grudge against the appellant because
the latter had reprimanded him upon catching him selling lumber or
bartering it for guitars, as he never sold lumber nor bartered it for
guitars; that he struck the deceased with his bolo because Follantes
ha4 threatened to kill him if he did not do so; that he did not ask the
appellant to provide him with an attorney, nor did said appellant
reprimand him telling him to suffer the consequences; that the deceased
did not insult him when he caught the former cutting timber.</p>
<p> In rebuttal, Eugenio Jacinto testified that on October 18, 1935,
Follantes told him to return with him to the forest to see whether the
deceased and his son kept cutting the tree; that the appellant then
carried his bolo and the basket Exhibit B; that after committing the
crime in question he and the appellant returned to the tatter's house
in Garit and from there they left at about noon for Echague together
with the appellant's wife and Julian Pinto, riding in a banco,
belonging to Follantes; that they disembarked in front of the Echague
Lumber Co. because Follantes' wife had to ask for money of the company;
that from there they went to the provincial road; that on their way to
Echague, they left Follantes' wife in the house of one Argonza, the
three proceeding to the <em>poblacion</em>; that while they were in
front of the constabulary barracks, they met Eugenio Gaffud; that
later, they went in search of an autobus which the appellant boarded to
pick up his wife from Argonza's house, which was on the route of the
autobus to Santiago, and both spouses continued their journey to said
town; that Jacinto returned to Garit alone on foot, ahead of Pinto,
who, together with one Mateo Castro, returned in the <em>banca</em>
used by them, arriving at Garit at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon;
that before they separated Follantes said to Jacinto: "Do not say
anything;" that Follantes returned to Garit with his wife by truck on
the following Monday; that all that Follantes testified about him was
untrue; that he does not chew <em>buyo</em>, and that the basket Exhibit B was seen by him in the possession of the appellant since he went to live with the latter.</p>
<p> The witness Victor Manauis, son of the deceased Julian Manauis,
testifying as witness for the prosecution, briefly stated as follows:
That on October 16, 1935, he and his father Julian Manauis went to the <em>sitio</em>
of Dalena-Tugtug, within the concession of the Echague Lumber Co., to
cut timber; that they did not know that they were within the concession
of the company in question and they began to cut a tree; that thereupon
Anacleto Follantes, Eugenio Jacinto and Julian Pinto arrived and
Follantes said to them: "You cannot continue cutting timber because
this is within the concession of the Echague Lumber Co. of. which I am
the <em>encargado</em> (caretaker)"; that Julian Manauis answered saying: "<em>Compadre</em>,
please allow us to cut it because it would be a pity to waste all our
work"; that Follantes replied: "If you continue to do so, you will
later suffer for it"; that Follantes and his companions left after said
conversation; that Julian Manauis and his son continued their' work
until they succeeded in felling the tree; that in the morning of
October 18, 1935, the deceased Julian Manauis told the members of his
family to go ahead to the house of a deceased relative to attend the
funeral <em>novena</em> because he was first going to the forest in the <em>sitio</em>
of Dalena-Tugtug to hew the tree felled by him and his son Victor two
days before, that is, on the 16th, and that he would follow them and be
with them before the prayers began or before dinner time; that as
Julian failed to show up at the <em>novena</em>, his son Victor went
that same afternoon to the forest where his father had gone and, upon
arriving at the place where they had cut the tree, at about 9 o'clock
at night, he saw with the aid of a lantern his father's dismembered
body with the head severed and about two meters away, a hand completely
cut off and separated, and several mortal wounds in the body; that his
shirt, hat and sheathed bob were hanging from the branch of a tree, and
the ax with which he was hewing the log lay beside the latter. Without
touching anything, Victor Manauis ran to the barrio and informed the
barrio lieutenant Andres Palayog of his discovery. Andres Palayog
advised the justice of the peace thereof and the authorities later went
to the scene of the crime.</p>
<p> In rebuttal, Eugenio Gaffud testified as follows: That as he was
the grantee of the forest concession at Adaoam, Jones, Isabela, he had
appointed the appellant as his subagent to cut lumber therein; that on
said occasion he used to see the appellant in said concession with a
basket similar to Exhibit B, which is usually carried by lumbermen for
their matches, <em>buyo</em> and tobacco; that on October 18, 1935,
Gaffud, who was the municipal secretary of Echague, on his way home
from his office at about 12.30 o'clock in the afternoon, saw the
appellant with Jacinto and Pinto near the gate of the fence of the
constabulary barracks, on their way to the <em>poblacion</em> from the
Echague Lumber Co. which is about 500 meters away from said barracks;
that upon seeing them, Gaffud greeted them saying: "So you are here, <em>pare</em>";
that he remembers said date well because on the following day a party
was to be held on the occasion of his nephew's marriage.</p>
<p> Attorney Macario Guevara also testified in rebuttal that in the
month of October, 1935, while he was in the municipality of Santiago to
attend to a case of his, he was informed by one Feliciano Castro that
the appellant was under arrest and needed him; that in the constabulary
barracks in Echague, the appellant told him that he wished to contract
his professional services for himself and for Eugenio Jacinto; that
they agreed that he would be paid f*400 as fees; that Guevara later saw
Jacinto to inform him of said agreement and Jacinto told him that he
had no objection and was glad to be represented by Guevara; that in
view thereof, Guevara entered his appearance (Exhibit F) in the justice
of the peace court; that with the consent of the accused, he filed a
pleading waiving the preliminary investigation (Exhibit G); that
subsequently, however, about February 10, 1936, the appellant told him
that he had no money and became indifferent to him, whereupon Guevara
withdrew his appearance and thereafter ceased to be the appellant's
attorney; that be received nothing on account of his fees.</p>
<p> Regarding the value of a recantation by a witness who has testified
at the trial of a criminal case, American Jurisprudence has established
the following rule, which is stated in 16 Corpus Juris, 1188, section
2715 (<em>g</em>):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "* * * But recantation by witnesses called on
behalf of the prosecution does not necessarily entitle defendant to a
new trial. The question whether a new trial shall be granted on this
ground depends on all the circumstances of the case, including the
testimony of the witnesses submitted on the motion for the new trial.
Moreover, recanting testimony is exceedingly unreliable, and it is the
duty of the court to deny a new trial where it is not satisfied that
such testimony is true. Especially is this true where the recantation
involves a confession of perjury. And <em>a fortiori</em>, under the
rule that a new trial will not be granted on account of newly
discovered evidence which tends merely to impeach the witnesses for the
prosecution, the falsity of testimony given on the trial cannot, as a
rule, be established by proof of statements, made by the witness out of
court, at variance with his testimony on the trial, whether such
statements were made prior to the trial or thereafter. * * *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It appears that Eugenio Jacinto made three statements under oath on
three different dates: the first, in the form of an affidavit,' when he
was arrested a few days after the discovery of the crime, confessing
that he was the only author of the death of Julian Manauis; the second,
during the trial, implicating Anacleto Follantes as the principal
author of the crime, and alleging that his only participation therein
was that of having helped the appellant, by order of the latter, as
workman under him; and the third, also in the form of an affidavit and
is the ground of the present motion for a new trial, made seven and a
half months after the judgment of conviction against Anacleto Follantes
had been rendered, wherein he repudiates his testimony given during the
trial and reaffirms his statement in his first affidavit to the effect
that he alone was the author of the death of Julian Manauis. In the
affidavit attached to the motion for a new trial Eugenio Jacinto states
that his testimony given during the trial of the case, accusing
Anacleto Follantes of having been the principal author of the crime,
was due to the fact that while he was confined in the constabulary
barracks in Ilagan, Isabela, after he had already confessed that he was
the only author of said crime, the sergeant who investigated him told
him to implicate Anacleto Follantes and, as he refused to do so at
first, said sergeant hit him with the butt of his gun, boxed him on the
face, slapped him, kicked him and inserted a fine wire in his urethra
four times, thereby compelling him, by reason of the unbearable
torture, to accede to his desire, after which he was brought before the
justice of the peace of Ilagan in whose presence he stated that it was
Anacleto Follantes and he who killed Julian Manauis, the former being
the principal author of the crime; that they likewise forced him to
declare that the basket found at the scene of the crime belonged to
Follantes. This witness, upon making his first statement under oath
before the justice of the peace of Echague, Isabela, and upon being
asked by said judicial officer whether he had been maltreated or he had
been given any promise in order to make him confess that he was the
author of the crime, or whether he had any complaint to make against
Lieutenant Molina or any of his soldiers, answered in the negative and
said that they spoke kindly to him and that he had no complaint against
the constabulary soldiers. It should be noted that Eugenio Jacinto did
not confess his guilt upon being arrested. At the beginning he imputed
the commission of the crime to one Agonos, who turned out to be a
fictitious., person, and it was only after he had been confined for
three days in the constabulary barracks in Echague that he voluntarily
confessed that he alone was responsible for the crime. If the
constabulary soldiers did not employ ether force or torture to obtain
from Eugenio Jacinto his own confession of guilt, it is unbelievable
that they had to resort to said means to compel him to impute the
commission of the crime to his employer and to testify against him, it
not having been proven that said constabulary soldiers had any motive
to implicate Anacleto Follantes. It was after Eiugenio Jacinto had
pleaded guilty and when he was already under the jurisdiction of the
court, shielded from all maltreatment or vexation which he might
receive from the constabulary soldiers, that he testified against
Anacleto Follantes. He no longer had anything to fear froam the alleged
threats of torture and poisoning. His conscience, which reproached and
compelled him to confess his crime, could not have permitted him to
commit an injustice by implicating an innocent person and making him a
coparticipant in the commission of a crime which he repented, had not
Follantes really been his coparticipant. Repentance for having
committed a crime and calumny are two psychic acts so repugnant to one
another that they cannot dwell together in the heart. Repentance is
moral compunction felt for an act reproved by the conscience and
calumny is a challenge to it. If an individual ever appears to approve
on one hand what he reproves on the other hand, he does so not because
he is dictated thus by his conscience but because a moral force, which
subjugates his said conscience, compels him to do so. By his
recantation Eugenio Jacinto would have us believe that his conscience
was subjugated and overwhelmed from the time the constabulary soldiers
tortured him in order to compel, him to implicate Anacleto Follantes
and did not regain his freedom and independence until seven and a half
months after the judgment of conviction had been rendered against the
appellant, notwithstanding the fact that he was beyond the influence of
his alleged tormentors from the time the action was brought against him
and Anacleto Follantes, which is psychologically absurd.</p>
<p> Eugenio Jacinto would also make us believe that one of the means of
torture employed by the constabulary soldiers to compel him to
implicate Follantes was the introduction of a fine wire four times into
his urethra. The simple mention of this means of torture proves its
falsity because had a fine wire been introduced four times into
Jacinto's urinary tract, it would have produced some lesion which would
have been infected upon the passage of the urine, thereby causing
inflammation.</p>
<p> Aside from the intrinsic and psychological falsity of Eugenio
Jacinto's recantation, there is the testimony of Victor Manauis, son of
Julian Manauis, who was with the deceased on the morning of October 16,
1935, in the <em>sitio</em> of Dalena-Tugtug, felling a tree when
Anacleto Follantes and Eugenio Jacinto arrived, Follantes telling them
to desist from cutting the tree otherwise something bad would happen to
them, thereby corroborating the testimony given by Etugenio Jacinto
himself on this point during the trial. There is also the testimony of
Attorney Macario Guevara corroborating that of Eugenio Jacinto to the
effect that while Jacinto and Follantes were on their way to the river
to wash their bolos after killing Julian Manauis, Follantes told
Jacinto not to say anything to anybody and that if Jacinto pleaded
guilty, Follantes would provide him with an attorney and furthermore
give him P50, it being true that Follantes had sent for said attorney
and told him that he desired to contract his professional services for
him and Eugenio Jacinto. There is likewise the testimony of Eugenio
Gaffud in rebuttal corroborating that of Eugenio Jacinto during the
trial that the basket found at the scene of the crime was similar to
the1 one usually carried by Anacleto Follantes when the latter used to
meet him as his subagent to cut trees in Adaoam. Inasmuch as some
material parts of Eugenio Jacinto's testimony are corroborated, such as
his going to Dalena-Tugtug together with Anacleto Follantes, the threat
made by Follantes to Julian Manauis that something serious would happen
to him if he did not desist from cutting the tree on October 16, 1935,
the appellant's warning to Eugenio Jacinto not to tell anything to
anybody and his promise to provide Eugenio Jacinto with his defense,
there is no reason to disbelieve the rest of his testimony that it was
Anacleto Follantes who had hacked Julian Manauis to death with his
bolo, and his mere extrajudicial recantation is insufficient to
discredit his testimony given in open court. Furthermore, the manner in
which Eugenio Jacinto, according to his. recantation, fought with the
deceased is improbable on the ground that if he was afraid to fight
with said deceased because the latter was stronger than he, he would
have sought the help of his employer Anacleto Follantes. On the other
hand, if Julian Manauis was disposed to fight with him and was the
first to attack him, he (Julian Manauis) would have been on. the alert
and would not have permitted said Eugenio Jacinto to approach him
stealthily from behind in order to attack him treacherously as he so
did.</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing considerations, this court is of the
opinion and so holds that Eugenio Jacinto's recantation is insufficient
to destroy his testimony, which is corroborated on material points and
given in open court, and therefore the motion for new trial filed by
the accusedappellant Anacleto Follantes is denied. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz, Laurel, </em>and <em>Concepcion, JJ., </em>concur.<br>
</p>
<hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
 
<div align="center"><em>DISSENTING
</em></div>
<p><strong>AVENCENA,</strong> <em>C. J., </em></p>
<p> I vote for the granting of the motion for new trial.</p>
<p> The only evidence presented in this case on the guilt of the
appellant is the testimony of the witness Eugenio Jacinfco. The latter,
prior to the trial, declared in an affidavit that he alone killed the
deceased. However, when he was presented as a witness at the trial, he
testified that it was he and the appellant who caused the death of the
deceased. Now this same witness recants his testimony given during the
trial and claims that he alone killed the deceased. He alleges that he
testified as he did during the trial because he had been compelled to
do so by means of cruel punishment and promise of leniency.</p>
<p> The fact that, according to Victor Manauis, the appellant prevented
the deceased from cutting the tree two days before, which act later
motivated the aggression upon said deceased, and the other fact that
the appellant had been with the witness Eugenio Jacinto a few hours
before the crime, but in a different place, do not constitute
corroborations sufficient to neutralize the doubt produced by the
recantation of said witness. If it is not shown by means of a new trial
of the case on what occasion Eugenio Jacinto did not tell the truth,
there is the possibility that it is precisely upon the false testimony
of said witness that this court convicted the appellant. At least it
will appear that this court convicted the appellant to the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua </em>only
upon the testimony of said witness who is not only a perjurer but also
an accomplice in the crime anvd a co-accused in the case who has not
been discharged before being presented as a witness (Act No. 2709). I
am of the opinion that under the circumstances of the case every means
of investigation regarding the veracity of this only witness should be
exhausted before finally basing so serious a conviction upon his
testimony.
