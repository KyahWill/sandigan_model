				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MORO QUINTA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p align="justify">Moro Quinta appeals to this court from three judgments of the 
Court of First Instance of Cotabato in the first of which he was found guilty of 
parricide, defined and penalized in article 402 of the Penal Code, and in the 
other two he was held liable for serious physical injuries; and taking into 
consideration the provision of section 106 of the Administrative Code of the 
Department of Mindanao and Sulu, he was sentenced to fourteen years, eight 
months and one day <em>reclusion temporal</em> for the crime of parricide, with 
the accessories of the law, and to indemnify the deceased's heirs in the sum of 
P500, and for each of the crimes of serious physical injuries, to four months 
and one day <em>arresto mayor</em> and six months and one day <em>prision 
correccional</em>, taking into account the extenuating circumstance of lack of 
instruction, and to pay the costs of each action, deducting one-half of the 
preventive imprisonment suffered.</p>
<p align="justify">The three cases were jointly heard, and the defendant was 
convicted and sentenced in all. The defendant appealed from the judgment in the 
three cases, making the following assignments of error: (1) The trial court 
erred in convicting the defendant in these three cases, basing its findings only 
on his statement before the court admitting that the facts alleged in the 
information are true; (2) the trial court erred in considering said statement of 
the accused in open court, not having been given under oath, as equivalent to a 
free and spontaneous plea of guilty; (3) even admitting the statement of the 
accused as a confession of guilt, nevertheless, the trial court erred in not 
permitting the accused, in spite of his sworn petition of February 13, 1928, to 
withdraw said alleged plea of guilty and substitute one of not guilty; (4) the 
trial court erred in abusing its judicial discretion by not permitting defendant 
to substitute the plea of not guilty for the plea of guilty, in view of all the 
circumstances of the case.</p>
<p align="justify">The three cases were set for trial, and the accused having been 
arraigned upon the three informations successively, by interpretation in his 
dialect, he pleaded guilty. But the court, not being satisfied with this plea of 
guilty of the accused, notwithstanding the fact that the latter was accompanied 
by counsel <em>de oficio</em>, and perhaps because one of the crimes carried 
with it capital punishment, submitted him to an examination, in the course of 
which he made the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It was on a Friday when I left my house going towards Cotabato 
and after having gone some distance, I remembered that I had left my cedula at 
home, and I had to return in order to get my cedula, and when I arrived at my 
house I found my wife cohabiting with Tukal, and when I went upstairs, one 
Lumaka who came after me and before I reached the upper part of the house, 
caught hold of me, and thusit is that I could do nothing to the two and I was 
still looking for a <em>bolo</em>, and the only thing I did to my wife was to 
slap her face and she fell. After this they told me to calm myself because the 
matter would be brought to the attention of a <em>datu</em>. Then they brought 
me before Datu Dikalano, who is a relative of Tukal, and he punished me. I do 
not understand why he did that to me, since it was Tukal who committed the 
offence, and besides they gave me nothing but burnt rice to eat for three days. 
Then I told my wife's relatives of this, and they laughed at me and ridiculed me 
saying that I am a coward, and that what I ought to have done was to separate 
from my wife, because I was good for nothing. Early on Tuesday I went to the 
field and returned home at about 7 o'clock, and on arriving there I asked where 
my wife was, and they told me that she had gone to another house to cook, and I 
went in search of her and found her in a vinta going down the river, and it was 
untrue that she was cooking, and I suppose that she was going to Tukal's place, 
so what I did was to jump into the water and on coming up to the vinta, stabbed 
my wife with a dagger and then leaped from the vinta to look for Tukal, and 
coming to where he was I dealt him a blow and said to him: 'Now you may get my 
wife,' and he started to run, and when Gandalibo saw me, he came to help Tukal 
and wanted to cut me up, whereupon I cut him too, and after this, retired and 
wounded nobody else."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">After hearing the accused's explanation of the manner in which 
he came to commit the three crimes, the trial court admitted his plea of guilty 
made in open court, and ruled as set forth at the beginning hereof.</p>
<p align="justify">Four days after said judgments were rendered, that is, on 
February 11, 1928, Attorney Tomas Sison filed a motion praying the trial court 
to permit the accused to withdraw his plea of guilty, and to substitute a plea 
of not guilty. The trial court considering this motion, denied it by an order 
dated February 21, 1928.</p>
<p align="justify">The four alleged errors assigned by the accused as committed by 
the trial court may be reduced to two, namely: That the lower court erred in 
admitting the accused's plea of guilty not made under oath; and that the lower 
court erred in denying the accused's motion to substitute the plea of not guilty 
for that of guilty, filed before the judgment had become final.</p>
<p align="justify">With respect to the first assignment of error, sections 24 and 
25 of General Orders No. 58 provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 24. Should the demurrer be disallowed, the court must 
require the defendant to plead. If he refuses, a plea of not guilty shall be 
entered for him.</p>
<p align="justify">"There are four kinds of pleas to an information or complaint: 
(1) Guilty; (2) not guilty; (3) a former judgment of conviction or acquittal of 
the offence charged, which may be pleaded either with or without the plea of not 
guilty; (4) once in jeopardy, which may be pleaded with or without the plea of 
not guilty.</p>
<p align="justify">"The plea must be oral, and a minute thereof in writing filed 
with the papers in the case.</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 25. A plea of guilty can be put in only by the defendant 
himself in open court. The court may at any time before judgment upon a plea of 
guilty, permit it to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty 
substituted."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It will be seen that neither of these legal provisions requires 
that the defendant's answer to an information pleading guilty of the crime of 
which he is accused be made under oath. The reason for this is obvious. The 
instinct of selfpreservation and protection impels a man to do and say whatever 
is favorable to himself, whether it be true or not; and, on the other hand, he 
avoids saying or doing that which is injurious to himself. When an accused 
admits his guilt, he acts against his own interests, and no oath is required to 
believe his declaration, unless it is proved that he acted under the pressure of 
circumstances against his will.</p>
<p align="justify">Touching the second question raised by the second assignment of 
error, section 25 of General Orders No. 58, quoted above, leaves it to the sound 
discretion of the court either to permit or not to permit the accused to 
withdraw his plea of guilty and substitute one of not guilty, and unless the 
court has committed an abuse in the exercise of its discretion, it is unlawful 
to alter its ruling.</p>
<p align="justify">In this case, the herein accused, when arraigned upon the 
information for parricide filed against him, was assisted by an attorney <em>de 
oficio</em>, informed of its contents, the same having been read to him in his 
dialect, and he was permitted to explain how he came to commit the crime. And 
there is nothing in the record to show that in pleading guilty he was subject to 
such an influence as to control his will and deprive him o€ all knowledge of his 
action and its consequences.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court acted within its judicial discretion, and did 
not err in denying the motion for substitution of plea.</p>
<p align="justify">The instant case is identical with that of United States vs. 
Neri (8 Phil., 669), in which this court laid down the following doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE; WITHDRAWAL OF PLEA OF GUILTY.—At any 
time before judgment, it is within the discretion of the judge of the trial 
court to permit the accused to withdraw his plea of 'guilty' and substitute a 
plea of 'not guilty.' (U. S. vs. Patala, 2 Phil., 752; U. S. vs. Molo, 5 Phil., 
412.)</p>
<p align="justify">"2. ID.; ID.; DENIAL OF MOTION.—A refusal to permit such 
withdrawal and substitution is not reversible error unless there is an abuse of 
discretion. (U. S. vs. Paquit, 5 Phil., 635.)"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In consideration of the premises, and finding no error in the 
judgments appealed from, the same are hereby affirmed in all their parts, with 
costs against the appellant in said cases.</p>
<p align="justify">Let a copy of this decision be attached to each of said cases. 
So ordered.</p> <em>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, 
Ostrand,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
