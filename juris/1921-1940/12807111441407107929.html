				[ G. R. No. 42241, August 31, 1934</h4>
				<H3>C. P. FELICIANO, PETITIONER, VS. GIL CALIMBAS AND FRANCISCO ZANDUETA, AS JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BATAAN, RESPONDENTS.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">The petitioner brought this action for mandamus to 
compel the Judge .of the Court of First Instance of Bataan to approve 
and certify the record on appeal filed by him in special proceedings No.
 1370 of said court.
</p><p align="justify"> In said case, the court allowed to probate the will,
 which had been presented, made by the deceased Francisco Paguio. The 
petitioner, who was oppositor to the probate, appealed from the order 
and prayed that a bond, which should be filed by him, be fixed. The 
court fixed it at P500. On June 20, 1934, the petitioner delivered to 
the clerk of court, as bond, a check for the sum of P500, issued in 
favor of said official and drawn against the Philippine National Bank, 
which was duly certified or accepted by the cashier of said bank. On the
 29th of the same month the court approved the appeal and ordered the 
clerk of court to forward the record to this court. While the record was
 in this jurisdiction, the attorney for the petitioner prayed that the 
same be returned to the trial court, alleging that the appeal was not 
perfected as the record on appeal had not been attached or forwarded, 
nor even filed with the court for approval. The motion was granted and 
the record returned. On July 7th of the same year, the petitioner filed 
the record on appeal with the court. The respondent Gil Calimbas opposed
 its approval and the court refused to approve it on the ground that it 
was filed outside the ten (10) days from June 20, 1934, the date upon 
which the check had been presented.</p>
<p align="justify"> The respondents contend that the check, being 
accepted, was equivalent to a cash bond and required no further 
approval, and consequently the 10-day period for the filing of the 
record on appeal should be computed from June 20th, the date of its 
presentation.</p>
<p align="justify"> According to section 780 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, fche bond that should be filed in such appeal must be 
satisfactory to the court. This means that it must be examined and 
approved. Section 34 of the Revised Rules provides. that the record on 
appeal, in special proceedings, shall be filed within ten (10) days from
 the date upon which the appeal is perfected, which takes place on the 
date on which the bond is approved. Inasmuch as the court refrained from
 expressly approving the check and approved the appeal when the record 
on appeal had not yet been filed, we understand that the approval of 
said appeal was in reality equivalent to an approval of the bond or 
check. Now then, inasmuch as the record on appeal was filed within ten 
(10) days from said date, if follows that the same should have been 
approved.</p>
<p align="justify"> We seriously hesitate to agree that a check accepted
 by the bank, against which it has been drawn, is equivalent to bank 
notes, or currency, or a cash bond. Everybody knows that the payment of a
 check, under such circumstances, may yet be withheld for other reasons 
not always easy to enumerate. If, for instance, the drawer succeeds in 
withdrawing his funds before the check is presented for payment, there 
is no doubt but that the same could not be collected,</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, and it appearing that the rejected record
 on appeal was filed on time, let the writ applied for be issued, 
requiring the respondent judge, or his successor, to approve and certify
 said record on appeal, with costs against the respondent Gil Calimbas. 
So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Butte, </em>and<em> 
Goddard, JJ., </em>concur.
