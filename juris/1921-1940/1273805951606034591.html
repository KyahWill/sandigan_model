				<H3>TAN SEN GUAN, SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF TAN PENG SUE, (ALIAS TAN PENG CHO), (ALIAS CHAN BAI CHOO) , PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. GO SIU SAN, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF ANTONIO TAMPOCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The record shows that the plaintiff is the administrator of the intestate 
estate of Tan Peng Sue, just as the defendant is the administrator in the 
testamentary proceeding for the settlement of the estate of Antonio Tampoco; 
that, according to the books kept by the defendant administrator, Antonio 
Tampoco owed Tan Peng Sue, about the month of January, 1920, the sum of 
P25,802.60, which, with the interest stipulated by the two deceased Tan Peng Sue 
and Antonio Tampoco in their lifetime at the rate of 9 6/10 per cent per year, 
amounted to P30,272.89 at the end of the year 1922; that upon the death of 
Antonio Tampoco, which occurred on February 5, 1920, proceeding was instituted 
in the Court of First Instance of Manila for the settlement of his estate; that 
on December 14 of that year commissioners were appointed to hear and decide 
whatever claim might be presented against the estate; that said commissioners 
qualified as such in due time, and rendered their final report on June 27, 1921, 
which was approved by the court below on July 14 of said year; that about August 
30, 1922, after the approval by the court of the report of the committee on 
claims, the plaintiff, in his capacity as administrator of the estate of Tan 
Peng Sue, moved the court that the committee on claims be again authorized, or a 
new committee appointed, to hear and decide a claim that he had and which he was 
to present against the estate, alleging, among other grounds, that the 
administrator Go Sui San had been assuring the heirs of Tan Peng Sue that they 
would not lose their credit, were in no need of presenting their claim, and 
would be paid by the heirs of Antonio Tampoco as soon as they should ask for it, 
and that in the meantime the credit might continue in the business of the 
deceased Antonio Tampoco and thus earn interest.</p>
<p>Passing upon this motion, the Honorable Geo. R. Harvey, judge, on September 
21, 1922, appointed new commissioners, holding that the committee on claims did 
not comply with the imperative provisions of sections 687 and 693 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure in rendering its report, and that the motion of the plaintiff 
Tan Sen Guan was in accordance with the provisions of section 690 of Act No. 
190. After due proceeding the new commissioners admitted the claim of the 
plaintiff, recommending its payment by the defendant administrator, which was by 
agreement of the parties estimated at P30,272.89 at the end of the year 
1922.</p>
<p>On Decemebr 22, 1923, the court presided over by Judge Anacleto Diaz rendered 
decision, absolving the defendant administrator of the estate of Antonio Tampoco 
from the complaint, holding that the commissioners appointed on September 
21,1922, had no authority under the law to hear and decide said claim, because 
the court that had appointed them had on the said date no jurisdiction to 
appoint them in view of the fact that more than fourteen months have elapsed 
since their final report was submitted by the former committee on claims in the 
aforesaid testamentary proceeding and approved by the court. To this decision 
the plaintiff excepted on the 29th day of the same month, and moved for new 
trial on January 9, 1924, on the ground that said decision was against the law 
and the facts proven at the trial.</p>
<p>On March 27, 1924, the lower court presided over by the Honorable Geo. R. 
Harvey, judge, after considering the motion for new trial, rendered a new 
decision, setting aside that of December 22, 1923, and ordering the 
administrator of the estate of Antonio Tampoco to pay the administrator of the 
estate of Tan Peng Sue the sum of P28,802.60, with interest thereon at the rate 
of 9 6/10 per cent per annum from March 28, 1920. From this decision the 
administrator of the estate of Antonio Tampoco appealed, and his counsel in this 
court prays for the reversal of the decision appealed from, alleging that the 
lower court erred: (<em>a</em>) In setting aside its former decision and in 
entering a new decision entirely contrary to the preceding one, instead of 
granting a new trial; (<em>b</em>) in holding that the claim presented was valid 
and effective at the time it was presented, and in not holding that the same was 
extinguished at that time under the law; and (<em>c</em>) in not absolving the 
defendant from the complaint.</p>
<p>The first assignment of error raises the same question as that in issue" in 
the case of Cordovero and Alcazar vs. Villaruz and Borromeo, R. G. No. 
21586,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> recently decided by this court, 
as to the legal effect of a motion for new trial under section 145, subsection 
3, of the Code of Civil Procedure. In that case it was held that the 
discretionary power granted the judges by section 145 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure to revise or amend their judgments, before the same become final, may 
be exercised upon a motion based on section 145, subsection 3, jointly with, or 
separately from, the power to grant new trial, although the exercise of the 
power to grant new trial necessarily requires the revocation of the former 
judgment; that under section 145, a judge may correct errors in his decisions, 
and in revoking his original decision by amending it upon the motion of a party 
or his own, he has not necessarily to order a reopening of the case. Therefore 
this assignment must be overruled.</p>
<p>Disregarding this feature of the case, what is important to decide is whether 
or not this action has prescribed, as contended by the defendant.</p>
<p>The pertinent part of section 695 of the Code of Civil Procedure 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A person having a claim against a deceased person proper to be allowed by 
the committee, who does not, after publication of the required notice, exhibit 
his claim to the committee as provided in this chapter, shall be barred from 
recovering such demand or from pleading the same in offset to any action, except 
as hereinafter provided."</p></blockquote>
<p>Provisions similar to this are found in the statutes of many, if not all the, 
states of the Union, and are ordinarily alluded to as statutes relative to 
claims not presented in due time. It was enacted in order to facilitate the 
speedy liquidation of estates, and to that end, it bars all proceeding when the 
claim is one that was not presented after the publication of the notice 
required.</p>
<p>To avoid the effect of section 695, the plaintiff lays stress on two 
circumstances. In the first place, he says that his failure to present the claim 
to the committee appointed by the court on September 21, 1922, was due to the 
machinations and fraudulent and false representations of the defendant. While it 
is easy to understand that the interests of the plaintiff, in his capacity as 
administrator of the estate of Tan Peng Sue, were not duly protected, and that 
his conduct was, to a certain extent, influenced by the unfavorable 
circumstances that surrounded him, yet we hold that prescription cannot be 
avoided on the ground of fraud or undue influence. The failure of Tan Chu Lay, 
heir of Tan Peng Sue, to present his claim was an omission committed by an heir 
who had knowledge of the existence of the credit of his deceased father. The 
fact that Tan Chu Lay might have been induced by fraudulent machinations and 
unlawful influence of the defendant administrator cannot affect the legal 
consequences of said act. And even if it be admitted that the widow of Tan Peng 
Sue was in China while the committee on claims was acting in the proceeding for 
the settlement of Antonio Tampoco's estate, still the result would be the same. 
The law does not make any reservation or exception whatever, and this court 
cannot make either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Where the statute of non-claim makes no exception as to any persons or 
class of persons, the courts can make none; and hence in the absence of some 
provision to the contrary, the statutes of non-claim run against non-resident as 
well as resident, and infant as well as adult claimants, and also against insane 
persons, and the estate of a deceased creditor. According to the weight of 
authority the statutes of non-claim, unlike the general statutes of limitations, 
run against the state. * * *" (18 Cyc, 468.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondly, to-avoid the effect of section 695, the plaintiff alleges that the 
notice to the creditors was not published in the manner prescribed by section 
687 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The committee so appointed shall appoint convenient times and places for the 
examination and allowance of claims, and, within sixty days from the time of 
their appointment, shall post a notice in four public places in the province 
stating the times and places of their meeting, and the time limited for 
creditors to present their claims, and shall publish the same three weeks 
successively in a newspaper of general circulation in the province, and give 
such other notice as the court directs. The court, in the commission issued to 
the committee, shall designate the paper in which the notice shall be published, 
and the number of places in the province in which it shall be posted, and any 
other mode of notice which the court directs."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 693 requires the committee to state in their report among other 
things, "the manner in which notice was given to the claimants." The report of 
the committee was introduced as Exhibit L in the testamentary proceeding, and 
really it was not written exactly in accordance with the technicality of the 
law. There is, however, attached to said report, as a part thereof, the 
affidavit of the editor of the newspaper <em>La Nacion</em>, wherein it appears 
that the committee on claims in the aforesaid proceeding had published for three 
consecutive weeks a notice to claimants, stating that they might present their 
claims within the period of six months, the committee to hold meetings at the 
office of Attorney M. G. Goyena, room No. 1, 34, Escolta, on the last Wednesday 
of each month at 3.30 p. m. for the purpose of hearing and deciding claims. It, 
thus, appears that the committee complied with the requirements of the law as to 
publication of notice, so much so that in the stipulation of facts it is stated 
that the commissioners qualified, and under the date of December 14,1920, 
published in the newspaper <em>La Nacion</em> the notice to claimants prescribed 
by the law for three consecutive weeks. There are also attached to the report of 
the committee, the appointment issued by the court, in which the places are 
designated where the notice should be posted, and the newspaper in which it 
should be published for three weeks, giving the creditors the period of six 
months to present their claims. We think that the documents attached to the 
report of said committee, the stipulation of facts and the approval of said 
report by the trial court constitute a conclusive proof that the commissioners 
have complied with the statute, requiring the publication of the notice to the 
creditors.</p>
<p>Before a credit may be held barred by our procedural statutes relative to 
liquidation of inheritance, it must appear, among other things, that the 
committee have designated convenient hours and places for the holding of their 
meetings for the examination and admission of claims, and that they have 
published this fact in the manner provided by the law. Unless this is done, the 
right of a creditor cannot prescribe, and he who claims the benefit of 
prescription has the burden of proof.</p>
<p>In these terms does the Supreme Court of Vermont comment on the statute of 
that State from which section 695 of our Code of Civil Procedure was taken. 
(Roberts vs. Estate of Burton, 27 Vt., 396.) Under general principles, there can 
be no doubt but that, as the statutory provision in question has a tendency to 
destroy rights, it should not be extended to cases distinct from those included 
in its language; and all the authorities, without exception, hold that statutes 
of this character must be strictly construed, and the legal prescription of 
action will not be held to take effect in a particular case unless the provision 
relative to the publication of notices have been entirely complied with.</p>
<p>Under section 690, a creditor who has failed to present his claim within the 
period fixed by the committee on claims may apply to the court, within six 
months after the period previously fixed, for the renewal of the commission for 
the purpose of examining his claim. Also a creditor may make such application 
even after six months from the expiration of the period formerly fixed and 
before the final settlement of the estate, if the committee shall have failed to 
give the notice required by section 687. The record shows that the application 
of the plaintiff was presented fourteen months after the expiration of the 
period fixed for the filing of claims. And while it was presented before the 
final settlement of the estate of Antonio Tampoco, yet, it having been proved 
that the committee had published in the newspaper <em>La Nacion</em> the notice 
required by law, there was no possible ground for granting said application. 
Even considering this application under section 113 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, we believe that the lapse of fourteen months is an unsurmountable 
barrier opposing the granting of said application.</p>
<p>It matters not that the defendant did not appeal from the order of the lower 
court appointing new commissioners, if it is taken into consideration that it 
was entered beyond the authority given by section 690. And as the defendant 
objected to said appointment, we believe that he is now entitled to raise the 
point in this court.</p>
<p>For the foregoing the judgment appealed from is reversed, and it is hereby 
declared that the plaintiff appellee has lost his right to enforce his claim in 
this proceeding, without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p><em>Johnson, 
Malcolm, Avanceña, Ostrand, </em>and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>,

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION</em></p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>As stated in appellee's brief, the following appears from the stipulation of 
facts and exhibits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"During all this time, nothing, as has already been said, was done with 
regards to the estate of Tan Peng Sue. His widow was in China and no legal 
representative was appointed to look after his affair. When his widow and heirs 
learned of the death of Tampoco and inquiries were made about this credit, 
Tampoco's executor, Go Siu San, assured them that the same will be respected and 
paid when demanded; that there was no need of presenting the claim before the 
committee or the probate court as the same appeared already on the books of the 
estate; and that it was to their advantage not to segregate it from the mass as 
it was gaining interest. Certain different amounts on this account were in fact 
received by the widow and heirs of Tan Peng Sue who naturally became, more 
convinced of the advices of Go Siu San. (See affidavits of Go Biec and Tan Chiu 
Lay, <em>folios</em> 79 to 86 of record.) Consequently, the claim of Tan Peng 
Sue was not presented to the original committee on claims in the estate of 
Tampoco."</p></blockquote>
<p>Based upon such facts, the judgment of the lower court should be 
affirmed.</p>
