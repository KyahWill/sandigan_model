				G.R. No. 18957, January 16, 1923</h4>
				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PHILIPPINE STEAMSHIP CO., INC., AND FERNANDEZ HERMANOS, DEFENDANTS. PHILIPPINE STEAMSHIP CO., INC., APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this action the Government of the Philippine Islands seeks to recover the 
sum of P14,648.25, the alleged value of 911 sacks of rice which were lost at sea 
on February 11, 1920, as a result of a collision between the steamer 
<em>Antipolo</em>, owned by the defendant company, and the vessel 
<em>Isabel</em>, upon which said rice was embarked. In the Court of First 
Instance judgment was entered for the recovery by the plaintiff from the 
Philippine Steamship Company, Inc., of the full amount claimed, with interest 
from the date of the filing of the complaint. From this judgment said company 
appealed.
<p>It appears in evidence that at about 10 o'clock at night on February 10, 
1920, the coastwise vessel <em>Isabel</em>, equipped with motor and sails, left 
the port of Manila with primary destination to Balayan, Batangas, carrying, 
among its cargo, 911 sacks of rice belonging to the plaintiff and consigned to 
points in the south. After the boat had been under weigh for about four hours, 
and had passed the San Nicolas Light near the entrance into Manila Bay, the 
watch and the mate on the bridge of the <em>Isabel</em> discerned the light of 
another vessel, which proved to be the <em>Antipolo</em>, also a coastwise 
vessel, on its way to Manila and coming towards the <em>Isabel</em>. At about 
the same time both the watch and mate on the bridge of the <em>Antipolo</em> 
also saw the <em>Isabel</em>, the two vessels being then about one mile and a 
half or two miles apart. Each vessel was going approximately at the speed of 6 
miles an hour, and in about ten minutes they had together traversed the 
intervening space and were in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>When the mate of the <em>Antipolo</em>, who was then at the wheel, awoke to 
the danger of the situation and saw the <em>Isabel</em> "almost on top of him," 
to use the words of the committee on marine accidents reporting the incident, he 
put his helm hard to the starboard.</p>
<p>This maneuver was correct, and if the helmsman of the <em>Isabel</em> had 
done likewise, all would apparently have been well, as in that event the two 
vessels should have passed near to each other on the port side without 
colliding. As chance would have it, however, the mate on the <em>Isabel</em> at 
this critical juncture lost his wits and, in disregard of the regulations and of 
common prudence, at once placed his own helm hard to port, with the result that 
his boat veered around directly in the path of the other vessel and a collision 
became inevitable. Upon this the mate on the <em>Antipolo</em> fortunately 
stopped his engines, but the <em>Isabel</em> continued with full speed ahead, 
and the two vessels came together near the bows. The <em>Isabel</em> immediately 
sank, with total loss of vessel and cargo, though the members of her crew were 
picked up from the water and saved.</p>
<p>The trial judge was in our opinion entirely right in finding that negligence 
was imputable to both vessels, though differing somewhat in character and degree 
with respect to each. The mate of the <em>Antipolo</em> was clearly negligent in 
having permitted that vessel to approach directly towards the <em>Isabel</em> 
until the two were in dangerous proximity. For this there was no excuse 
whatever, since the navigable sea at this point is wide and the incoming steamer 
could easily have given the outgoing vessel a wide berth. On the other hand it 
is not clear that the <em>Isabel</em> was chargeable with negligence in keeping 
on its course; for this boat had its jib sail hoisted, and may for that reason 
be considered to have had the right of way. (G. Urrutia &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. 
Baco River Plantation Co., 26 Phil., 632.)</p>
<p>Negligence shortly preceding the moment of collision is, however, undoubtedly 
chargeable to the <em>Isabel</em>, for the incorrect and incompetent way in 
which this vessel was then handled. The explanation of this may perhaps be found 
in the fact that the mate on the <em>Isabel</em> had been on continuous duty 
during the whole preceding day and night; and being almost absolutely exhausted, 
he probably was either dozing or inattentive to duty at the time the other 
vessel approached.</p>
<p>It results, as already stated, that both vessels were at fault; and although 
the negligence on the part of the mate of the incoming vessel preceded the 
negligence on the part of the mate of the outgoing vessel by an appreciable 
interval of time, the first vessel cannot on that account be absolved from 
responsibility. Indeed, in G. Urrutia &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Baco River 
Plantation Co., <em>supra</em>, this court found reason for holding that the 
responsibility rested exclusively on a steamer which had allowed dangerous 
proximity to a sailing vessel to be brought about under somewhat similar 
conditions.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion therefore that his Honor, the trial judge, committed no 
error in holding that both vessels were to blame and in applying article 827 of 
the Code of Commerce to the situation before him. It is there declared that 
where both vessels are to blame, both shall be solidarily responsible for the 
damage occasioned to their cargoes. As the <em>Isabel</em> was a total loss and 
cannot sustain any part of this liability, the burden of responding to the 
Government of the Philippine Islands, as owner of the rice embarked on the 
<em>Isabel</em>, must fall wholly upon the owner of the other ship, that is, 
upon the defendant, the Philippine Steamship Company, Inc.</p>
<p>Only one observation will be added, in response to one of the contentions of 
the appellant’s attorneys, which is, that the application of article 827 of the 
Code of Commerce is not limited by article 828 to the case where it cannot be 
determined which of the two vessels was the cause of the collision. On the 
contrary article 828 must be considered as an extension of article 827 to an 
additional case. In other words, under the two articles combined the rule of 
liability announced in article 827 is applicable not only to the case where both 
vessels may be shown to be actually blameworthy but also to the case where it is 
obvious that only one was at fault but the proof does not show which.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from must be affirmed; and it is so ordered with costs 
against the appellant.</p><em>Araullo, C.J., Johnson, Malcolm, Avanceña, 
Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ.,</em> concur.</div>
