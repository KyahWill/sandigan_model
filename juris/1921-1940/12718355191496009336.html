</p><div align="justify"> The only question presented by this appeal is whether the appellant is guilty of the crime of "<em>estafa</em>
by means of falsification of a mercantile document," punishable under
article 301 in relation with article 300 of the Penal Code, as amended
by Act No. 2712, or of the crime of <em>estafa</em>, punishable under paragraph 2 of article 534 in relation with paragraph 1 of article 535 of the Penal Code.
  <p>
The lower court, upon the evidence presented during the trial of the
cause, reached the conclusion that the defendant was guilty of the
crime of <em>estafa</em> by means of falsification of a mercantile
document, punishable under article 301 in relation with article 300 of
the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 2712, in relation with paragraph 1
of article 535 of same Code, and sentenced him to be imprisoned for a
period of four years, two months and one day of <em>prision correccional </em>with
the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to indemnify the offended
party in the sum of P84, to pay a fine of P50, and, in case of
insolvency, to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with the
provisions of the law. From that sentence the defendant appealed to
this court.</p>
<p> The facts are not disputed. The defendant presented no proof to
refute the facts charged in the complaint and proved during the trial.
The complaint alleged: 'That between the 17th and 19th of February,
1921, or about said period, in the city of Manila, Philippine Islands,
the said accused, with intent to prejudice and defraud the firm of Go
Leco &amp; Co., of the said city of Manila, did then and there
wilfully, illegally and feloniously falsify a mercantile document, to
wit: a check No. 141992-B drawn on the Philippine National Bank for the
sum of P84, Philippine currency, making it to appear that one Abdon
Yacon Paradero was a party to said check while in fact he was not, by
forging, simulating and imitating the signature of said Abdon Yacon
Paradero, so that the document, falsified as aforesaid, appears drawn
and prepared as follows:</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>and the said accused, on the dates above-mentioned, knowing said
check to be false, did wilfully, illegally and feloniously make use of
it by inducing the firm of Go Leco &amp; Co. to accept, as said firm
did accept it, in payment of the sum of P18, Philippine currency, the
price of two sacks of rice bought from said firm, the said accused
having received from the said firm of Go Leco &amp; Co., as change of
the check, the sum of P66, Philippine currency, which was converted by
the accused to his own use and benefit, to the prejudice of the
aforesaid firm in the sum of P84, Philippine currency.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "All contrary to law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The basis of the contention of the appellant is that, inasmuch as
he did not attempt to imitate the signature of Abdon Yacon Paradero,
when he signed said name to said check, he was not guilty of <em>estafa</em> by means of the falsification of a commercial document, but only of the simple crime of <em>estafa</em>.</p>
<p> While there is no proof that the appellant, in signing the name of
Abdon Yacon Paradero to said check, attempted to imitate the signature
of said alleged maker of the check, there is undisputed proof that he
did sign, without permission or authority, the name of Abdon Yacon
Paradero and did, by means of said forged signature, obtain the money
in the manner described in the complaint above quoted. The proof shows
that the defendant represented to the offended person that the check
quoted in the complaint above was in fact a check executed and
delivered by Abdon Yacon Paradero, and that by reason of that
representation he induced the offended person to accept the check and
to deliver to him the difference between the value of the merchandise
which he purchased (P19) and the amount of the check (¦P34), or the sum
of P65. The proof shows that the representation made by the defendant
to the offended person, that Abdon Yacon Paradero had participated in
the execution and delivery of said check, was a false representation ;
that Abdon Yacon Paradero did not in fact participate in the execution
of said check, nor did he authorize the appellant to use his name in
th6 execution thereof.</p>
<p> Under the above facts the question is squarely presented whether
the appellant is guilty of a violation of paragraph 2 of article 300 of
the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 2712, or of a violation of
paragraph 2 of article 534, in relation with paragraph 1 of article
535, of the Penal Code. We have held in several cases that a person
cannot be found guilty of the crime of <em>estafa</em> by means of the
falsification of a document by using the signature of another, unless
in the execution of that document he attempted to imitate or simulate
the signature of the latter. (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Paraiso, 1 Phil., 66; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Roque, 1 Phil., 372; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Buenaventura, 1 Phil., 428.)</p>
<p> The doctrine announced in those decisions, however, has been
somewhat modified, if not revoked, by later decisions in the cases of
United States <em>vs.</em> Braga (12 Phil., 202); and United States <em>vs.</em>
Cinco and Redona, p. 839, post, especially in a case where the alleged
forgery or falsification was made with reference to a mercantile
document. In the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Braga, as well as in that of United States <em>vs.</em> Cinco and Redoña, <em>supra,</em>
the defendant was held guilty of the falsification of a mercantile
document, even though there was no attempt to imitate or simulate the
signature of the person whose name was illegally used, for the reason
that in effecting the transaction in those cases the defendant made it
to appear falsely that the alleged party to the document was a real
party thereto when, as a matter of fact, he did not participate in any
manner whatever in the transaction. The doctrine announced by those two
decisions is in harmony with the decisions of the supreme court of
Spain. (See decisions of the supreme court of Spain of November 24,
1882; January 24, 1883; January 31, 1884; April 21, 1897; January 18,
1890; and February 18, 1891.)</p>
<p> Following the doctrine announced in the two cases mentioned (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Braga, and U. S. <em>vs.</em> Cinco and Redona, <em>supra</em>), we are of the opinion and so decide that the appellant is guilty of the crime of <em>estafa</em>
committed by means of the falsification of a private commercial
document, and he is hereby sentenced to be punished, in accordance with
the provisions of article 301 of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No.
2712, with penalty of <em>prision correccional </em>in its maximum
degree, the minimum of the medium grade of which is four years, nine
months and eleven days, and a fine of P50, and sentence of the lower
court is thus modified, with costs. So ordered.</p>
