				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On September 14, 1925, the Philippine Government instituted a cadastral proceeding of a tract of land situated in the municipality&nbsp; of Barotac Nuevo, Province of Iloilo,&nbsp; in accordance with section 1856" of the Administrative Code. A large part of the tract appears to be mangrove swamps, the administration&nbsp; of which is claimed by the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Forestry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau of Lands also claimed the lots with the exception&nbsp; of lot No.&nbsp; 1081.&nbsp; The same lots are&nbsp; also claimed by private individuals.<br><br>Upon trial the Court of First Instance declared the lots to be public lands&nbsp; with the exception of certain portions which had been under cultivation, and the herein claimants appealed to this&nbsp; court.&nbsp; The names of the claimants and the numbers of the lots, as well as the numbers of the cases appealed, are as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="31%"><div align="center">Lot No</div></td><td width="46%"><div align="center">Private claimant</div></td><td width="23%"> <div align="center">G.

Under section&nbsp; 45 (b)&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act No. 2874, the possession of public land,&nbsp; without title derived&nbsp; from the Government, must have commenced before July 26, 1894, and have been continuous thereafter at least until July 1, 1919, when said Act No. 2874 became&nbsp; effective.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellants having failed to comply&nbsp; with&nbsp; the provisions of the law, the lots claimed&nbsp; cannot be registered&nbsp; in their favor&nbsp; under the aforesaid section&nbsp; 45 (6)&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act No. 2874.&nbsp;&nbsp; The statute of limitations in regard to public land does not run against the Government.<br><br>The decision of the court below in&nbsp; regard to&nbsp; all of&nbsp; the cases above enumerated&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed without costs. So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña,&nbsp; C. J., Johnson,&nbsp; Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
