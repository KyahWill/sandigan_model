				<H3>IN  RE INSOLVENCY OF CENTRAL  CAPIZ.  SMITH,  BELL &  CO. EL AL., PETITIONERS, <I>VS.</I> HONORABLE FRANCISCO  SANTA- MARIA, JUDGE OF THE  TWENTY-THIRD  JUDICIAL DISTRICT, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioners pray that a writ of&nbsp; mandamus issue to compel the respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo to approve, sign, and certify&nbsp; a record of appeal from an order dated September 24, X925, in the&nbsp; matter of the involuntary insolvency of the Central Capiz, in which said court declared the claims of&nbsp; Antonio Belo, Jose&nbsp; Altavas, and the spouses Timoteo Unson and Clara Lacson preferred,&nbsp; but denied preference to the claims of the herein petitioners.&nbsp; Exception was taken&nbsp; to said order on October 5, 1925, and&nbsp; on October 8, 1925, the petitioners filed a motion&nbsp; for new&nbsp; trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; and exception noted.&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioners gave notice of appeal on October&nbsp; 24, 1925, and the court fixed the amount of the appeal bond.<br><br>On November 21, 1925,&nbsp; a record of appeal was presented to the court, but on the 8th of the following month, the respondent judge issued an order in which he refused to approve&nbsp; and certify said&nbsp; record of appeal on the grounds (a) that no appeal would lie from the order of September 24,&nbsp; 1925, inasmuch as it was not made at the hearing of an account of the assignee in insolvency, and&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; that the record of appeal tendered contained matters irrelevant to the appeal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellants, herein petitioners,&nbsp; excepted to this order and gave notice that they would apply to the Supreme Court&nbsp; for a writ of mandamus.&nbsp; Thereupon, on January&nbsp; 2, 1926, a motion for the reconsideration of the same order was presented.&nbsp; This motion was denied on July 9, 1926, and on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1926,&nbsp; another motion for reconsideration was filed,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was denied ten days later. Thereupon the present petition&nbsp; was filed in&nbsp; this&nbsp; court on September 1, 1926.<br><br>The court below erred in holding that the&nbsp; order of September 24, 1925&nbsp; was&nbsp; not appealable.&nbsp; The question is fully&nbsp; discussed&nbsp; in&nbsp; our decision in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Urquijo, Zuloaga y Escubi <i>vs.</i> Unson (page 79,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ante</span>), and in which we&nbsp; held that orders determining the validity or priority of claims against the insolvent are appealable whether made at the hearing of an account of the assignee or not.<br><br>We also think that&nbsp; the court below erred in&nbsp; rejecting the record of appeal on the ground that it contained matters irrelevant&nbsp; to&nbsp; the appeal.&nbsp; It may be true that some of the documents included in the&nbsp; record of appeal have no direct connections with the petitioners' claims, but as the appeal relates&nbsp; to preferences among&nbsp; the various claims presented in the insolvency proceedings, matters&nbsp; which at first sight&nbsp; appear to be irrelevant, may in the course of the arguments on appeal be found to be of value in the determination of the questions at issue.&nbsp; The courts should exercise caution in ordering the exclusion from a record of appeal&nbsp; or a bill of exceptions of matters which the appellant has&nbsp; thought necessary for the proper development of his argument; he pays for the printing of the record and there is very little danger of his overburdening it&nbsp; with wholly irrelevant matter.&nbsp; On the contrary,&nbsp; he is more likely to omit matter which ought to be included.<br><br>It will be noted that no motion for the&nbsp; reconsideration of the order of December 8, 1925, denying the approval of the record of appeal, was filed until January 2,1926, twenty- five&nbsp; days&nbsp; after the&nbsp; order&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued.&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondents maintain&nbsp; that the&nbsp; order&nbsp; became final&nbsp; after&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; or twenty-one days from its&nbsp; issuance; that at the time the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration was filed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court had lost its power to revoke or modify the order; that, consequently, the motion for reconsideration was useless and presented too late,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that no motion for reconsideration having been presented in time, a writ of mandamus should not issue. Though the point is very plausibly argued, we, nevertheless, do&nbsp; not think&nbsp; it well taken. The insolvency&nbsp; proceedings were still under the control of the court at the time the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration was presented and the court undoubtedly even then had&nbsp; the power to approve the record of appeal.&nbsp; If so, it must also have had the power to revoke the former order denying the approval.<br><br>For the reasons stated, the petition for a writ of mandamus is hereby granted, ordering the respondent judge to approve and certify to this court the aforesaid record of appeal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; Unson, Belo,&nbsp; and Altavas will pay the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Villamor,&nbsp; Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
