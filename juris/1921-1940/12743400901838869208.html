				<H3>NARCISO PENGSON, ADMINISTRATOR OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF MARIA DE MANO Y BERNABE, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. MODESTO TECSON ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Narciso Pengson, plaintiff, in his capacity as administrator of the estate of 
Maria de Mano y Bernabe, appealed from the order of the Court of First Instance 
of Bulacan reading as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"When the present case came up for trial, there appeared only the defendants 
and their counsel Attorney Cirilo B. Santos, who, in view of the non-appearance 
of plaintiff and his counsel, prayed the court to dismiss this case, alleging 
that the plaintiff instituted this action as administrator but has now no 
judicial capacity to litigate, inasmuch as his management of the intestate 
estate was terminated by an order of this court dated January 16, 1929.</p>
<p>"The petition being well founded, the present case is hereby dismissed, 
without costs. So ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>This action was instituted by the appellant in the afore-mentioned capacity 
to recover the possession of a certain portion of land situated in the 
municipality of San Miguel, Province of Bulacan, P10,000 damages, and, according 
to the supplemental complaint, to recover of the appellees the sum of P1,500 as 
the market value of the said property, it having been adjudicated as lot No. 
2279 of the cadastral proceedings of that province to the coappellee Modesto 
Tecson, to whom the proper certificate of title was issued. With the filing of 
the supplemental complaint, of course, the appellant waived the recovery of 
possession.</p>
<p>As has been stated, the appellant brought the action as judicial 
administrator of the estate of Maria de Mano y Bernabe, because the pleadings 
alleged that the latter was the real owner of the land which is the subject of 
this litigation; but it happened that while this case was pending an order was 
issued by the probate court terminating the intestate proceedings, which reads 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In going over the record of this case, the court is at a loss to understand 
how and why. many proper stages indispensable in this kind of proceeding were 
not diligently observed, and such an omission is tantamount to non-compliance 
with the legal provisions which are in force in this jurisdiction; under the 
circumstances, it is but the duty of the court, called upon to administer 
justice in a proper manner, to decree the termination of the instant case, 
without prejudice to the right of the Government to Collect the inheritance tax 
assessable upon the estate left by the deceased Maria de Mano y Bernabe. It 
being more than probable that the interested parties might have partitioned 
extra-judicially the estate left by the said deceased with a view to avoid the 
payment of inheritance tax collectible from the estate of said deceased, it is 
ordered by the court that the provincial fiscal of Bulacan who is, in this 
jurisdiction, the officer primarily upon to see to it that the law is duly 
enforced, conduct a thorough investigation of the person or persons who might 
ultimately have been benefited by the properties left by the deceased Maria de 
Mano y Bernabe, and who are holding actually their shares in the estate of the 
said deceased which is the only way from he can report to the Collector of 
Internal Revenue, the actual condition, rather the status of this intestate 
proceeding, thus enabling the officer or officers of the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue to levy the inheritance tax due the Government upon the estate left by 
the deceased. Only in such a manner the Government may hold inviolate the 
paramount interests of the administration of justice, and consequently of the 
law itself.</p>
<p>"The termination of this case is, therefore, decreed, and the clerk of court 
is ordered to furnish a copy of this resolution to the provincial fiscal, as 
well as to the Collector of Internal Revenue, through the Secretary of Justice. 
</p>
<p>"It is so ordered.</p>
<p>"Given at Malolos, Bulacan, January 16, 1929.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"(Sgd.) ANASTASIO R. 
TEODORO<br><em>"Judge.</em>"<br></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>On January 20,1931, when the case came up for hearing, only the 
defendants-appellees and their counsel appeared, and the latter prayed for the 
dismissal of the action on the ground that the plaintiff-appellant no longer had 
legal personality to continue it, since a competent court had decreed the 
termination of the intestate proceedings he represented. Exhibit A was presented 
as a certified copy of the order referred to. Finding the oral motion to be well 
founded, the court dismissed the case without costs.</p>
<p>The appellant finds three alleged errors in the order appealed from; but the 
only question of law to be decided is whether the order appealed from is valid 
or not. After a careful review of the case, we hold that the dismissal is legal 
and binding. The order terminating the proceedings <em>in re estate</em> of 
Maria de Mano y Bernabe was well founded, in view of the circumstances of the 
case, and had the effect of divesting the administrator-appellant of his office. 
But assuming that, for some good reason, the proceedings were not yet in a 
condition to be finally closed, it was the duty of the administrator to apply to 
the court to have the order set aside and the proceedings reopened. Without 
deciding that the appellant cannot, for good reasons, have recourse to such a 
procedure in order to obtain what he sought through this appeal, it is held that 
he had lost his personality as legal representative of the said deceased, and 
could not therefore, under the law, continue the litigation, at least until the 
probate court reopens the intestate proceedings. </p>
<p>Wherefore, reserving to the appellant, or to the legal representative of the 
late Maria de Mano y Bernabe, the right to exercise any action for the recovery 
of the sums of money involved in this case from the defendants herein, we affirm 
the appealed order, without special pronouncement of costs.</p>
<p>So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, 
Romualdez,</em> and <em>Villa-Real, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
