				<H3>FILEMON PACIA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO SANTOS AND JOSE CUIZON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, 
ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay to the estate of the 
deceased Tomas Pacia the sum of P19,000, with legal interest on the sum of 
P6,500 from the first of July, 1921, and on the sum of P12,500 from the first of 
January, 1922. From this judgment the defendants Pedro Santos and Jose Cuizon 
appeal and make four assignments of error, all of which relate to questions of 
fact.</p>
<p>The plaintiff is the administrator of the estate mentioned and in his 
complaint alleges that by public document executed on September 29, 1920, Tomas 
Pacia sold to the defendants Pedro Santos, Pablo Panganiban and Jose Cuizon 43 
hectares of land for the sum of P25,000 payable in three installments; the first 
installment of P4,000 to be paid at the time of the execution of the document; 
the second installment of P8,500 and the third of P12,500 to be paid on July 1, 
1921, and January 1, 1922, respectively; that the said defendants had paid only 
the first installment and the sunuof P2,000 on the second installment but had 
failed to pay the balance. The plaintiff therefore prayed judgment for the sum 
of P19,000 with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum and for the 
further sum of P17,000 as damages and attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>The defendant Pedro Santos in his answer admits that the contract was 
executed as alleged in the complaint, but sets up as a special defense that 
there was an agreement among the defendants to the effect that Pablo Panganiban 
and Jose Cuizon were to pay all of the first and second installments of the 
purchase price and that, Pedro Santos., had already paid P7,082.5 for 
improvements made on the land; that, furthermore, the defendants did not obtain 
their possession of the land from the vendor Tomas Pacia but from Mateo Legaspi, 
Fortunato Carreon and Jose Termulo, who held a lease on the land and who 
assigned said lease to the defendant Pedro Santos and certain other persons who 
are not parties in the present case.</p>
<p>The defendants Pablo Panganiban and Jose Cuizon in their answer admit that 
the document of September 29, 1920, was executed as alleged in the complaint and 
that of the purchase price stated in the document only P6,000 has been paid.</p>
<p>The defendant Cuizon alleges as a special defense that he never gave his 
consent to the contract evidenced by the document mentioned and that it was made 
without his knowledge.</p>
<p>The defendant Pablo Panganiban sets up as a special defense that at the time 
of entering into the contract the vendor Tomas Pacia maliciously concealed from 
him the fact that the land in question was leased to other persons for the term 
of ten years and that if this fact had been disclosed to him he would not have 
entered into the contract. It appears from the evidence that the document in 
question (Exhibit A) was prepared by the notary public before whom it was 
acknowledged, with the assistance of the defendant Santos. Through an oversight 
the document was signed only by the vendor Tomas Pacia and was not signed by the 
purchasers, the herein defendants; but it appears from the testimony of the 
notary public that all of the defendants were present when the document was 
executed and that they gave their consent to all of the provisions of the 
contract. It further appears that the defendants made partial payments on the 
purchase price and that they took possession of the land.</p>
<p>In regard to the lease referred to in the special defenses of Santos and 
Panganiban, it appears that several years previous to the sale Tomas Pacia 
leased the latid to Mateo Legaspi, Fortunato Carreon and Jose Termulo, but that 
on the 7th of August, 1920, the defendant Santos obtained an assignment of the 
lease and succeeded to the rights of the lessees. There also appears to have 
been an understanding among the defendants to the effect that all of them were 
to participate in the rights so acquired, and the evidence is conclusive that 
they entered into possession of the land and have not been disturbed in such 
possession since the execution of the deed in their favor by Tomas Pacia. It is 
therefore clear that, the special defense of Santos and Panganiban to the effect 
that they did not obtain their possession of the land through that deed is of no 
avail. They were aware of all the circumstances before entering into the 
agreement with Pacia and, as already stated, their possession since then has 
been quiet and undisturbed.</p>
<p>Neither is there any merit in Santos' other special defense that he had an 
agreement with his codefendants that he would be relieved from his share of the 
payments of the purchase price in consideration of his paying for the 
improvements to be made on the land. Pacia was not a party to that agreement and 
was not bound thereby. Moreover, Exhibit B, a letter written by Santos to 
Panganiban and in which he asks the latter to furnish the sum of P4,000 to be 
used for repairs and improvements of the fish-pond tends to cast doubt on the 
existence of the agreement mentioned.</p>
<p>The defendant Cuizon's special defense that he was not present at the 
execution of the deed and did not give his consent thereto is not sustained by 
the evidence. Even assuming, for the sake of the argument, that the notary 
public who prepared the document was mistaken in his statement that Cuizon was 
present and agreed to its terms, the letter of July 28, 1921, written by Cuizon 
to the plaintiffs' lawyer Sofronio Hernandez (Exhibit C) shows sufficiently that 
'he was a party to the agreement and considered himself bound thereby.</p>
<p>The only question remaining for consideration is whether there was a 
sufficient part performance of the contract of sale to take the agreement for 
the payment of the purchase price out of the statute of frauds. As to this there 
can be no doubt. The vendor fully performed his part of the contract and it is 
well settled that the statute is no bar to an action for the price of land 
actually conveyed where the deed has been accepted. (27 C. J. and numerous 
authorities there cited.)</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the 
appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Avance√±a, Villamor, Johns, </em>and 
<em>Romualdez, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
