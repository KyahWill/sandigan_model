				G.R. No. 28447, September 13, 1928</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE ALVAREZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant is the stepfather of the offended party, Carlos Caponong, and 
both lived in the same house. On the night of May 19, 1927, on account of certain 
differences, the appellant took the offended party's suit case, containing the 
latter's clothes, and carried it to the orchard near a well. According to the 
offended party, when the accused arrived at that place he opened the suit case, 
took out the contents and set fire to them. Most of the clothing was burned, but 
the suitcase was entirely unharmed. The trial court found the only damage to be 
the value of the clothing which it set at P110. Moreover it appears that the 
appellant did not intend to burn the suit case also, as shown by the fact that 
he first took out the clothing in order to burn it.
<p>An information having been filed against the appellant for the crime of 
arson, he was found guilty and sentenced, in accordance with article 557 of the 
Penal Code, to four months and one day <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, with the accessories of 
law, to indemnify the offended party Carlos Caponong in the sum of P110, with 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of the 
action.</p>
<p>In accordance with article 558 of the Penal Code, as the value of the 
clothing burned does not exceed 625 <span style="font-style: italic;">pesetas</span>, and as the burning was done under 
circumstances which excluded all danger of the fire spreading, since it was done 
in the orchard by the side of a well, the act merely constitutes the crime of 
malicious mischief. And, moreover, as the accused is the stepfather of the 
offended party, and hence, an ascendant by affinity, he is exempt from criminal 
liability, in accordance with article 567 of the Penal Code, and is only civilly 
liable.</p>
<p>Wherefore, without prejudice to a civil action against him, the defendant is 
acquitted, with the costs of the action. So ordered.</p><span style="font-style: italic;"> Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, 
concur.</div>
