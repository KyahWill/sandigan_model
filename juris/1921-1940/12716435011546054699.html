				<H3>THE ZAMBOANGA MUTUAL BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. J'AMES J. RAFFERTY, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The only question presented by this appeal
is whether or not the plaintiff-appellant is a real estate broker. If
it is, then the judgment of the lower court must be affirmed; if it is
not, the judgment appealed from must be revoked.
<p> The facts upon which that question must be answered are as follows:</p>
<p> (<em>a</em>) That the plaintiff is a "mutual building and loan
association," duly organized under the laws of the Philippine Islands
(sees. 171 <em>et seq.</em>, Act No. 1459);</p>
<p> (<em>b</em>) That the purposes of said association are: (1) To
encourage industry, frugality, and home building among its members; (2)
to provide ways and means whereby its members may accumulate their
savings, whether large or small, and have the same safely and legally
invested under the direction of a competent board of directors selected
by the stockholders from among themselves; (3) to provide ways and
means whereby its stockholders, with a limited capital, and with
approved titles to lands, may become the owners of homes, either by
purchase or erection, with the money supplied therefor by the
association at an equitable rate of interest, in equal monthly
installments extending over a period sufficiently long to make possible
the repayment without burden or hardship to its members; (4) to make
possible the safe investment by its stockholders of accumulated
savings, by the purchase of paid-up or investment stock from the
corporation, upon which the association guarantees a fixed rate of
interest; (5) to have the profits or losses of its shareholders justly,
equally, and mutually divided among the members of the association; and
(6) to keep loaned at all times at the best possible advantage to the
association and its members all the money belonging to the association
and to divide the same among its members in such manner and at such
times as may be provided in the by-laws and the laws governing said
association;</p>
<p> (<em>c</em>) That said association transacts no business whatever
outside of the purposes of its charter, and with no person or persons
except with its own members;</p>
<p> (<em>d</em>) That said association does not act for, nor on behalf of, third persons;</p>
<p> (<em>e</em>) That said association does not negotiate the purchase
or sale of lands nor any interest therein, except among its own
members; that it does not negotiate loans secured by lands, buildings
or any interest therein, except among its members; that it does not
rent real estate for others nor collect rents thereon for others.</p>
<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing facts the Collector of Internal
Revenue required the appellant to pay a license as a real estate
broker. The amount required to be paid by the plaintiff was the sum of
P450, for different periods, which amount was paid by the plaintiff
under protest. The present action was instituted to recover that
amount, upon the theory that the same had been illegally collected. The
lower court denied the relief prayed for, and an appeal was taken to
this court.</p>
<p> The Collector of Internal Revenue contends that by virtue of subsection (<em>w</em>)
of section 1620 of Act No. 2657 the appellant is a real estate broker
and, as such, must have a license to do business. Said section defines
a real estate broker as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "A 'real estate broker' includes all persons whose
business it is, for themselves or others, to negotiate purchases or
sales of lands, buildings, or interest therein, or to negotiate loans
secured by lands, buildings, or interest therein, or to rent real
estate for others, or to collect rents thereon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> This statutory definition of a real estate broker is broader than
the generally accepted definition. The generally accepted definition of
a real estate broker is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "A 'real estate broker' has been variously defined.
A broker is generally defined as one who is engaged, for others, on a
commission, negotiating contracts relative to property with the custody
of which he has no concern; the negotiator between other parties, never
acting in his own name, but in the name of those who employed him; he
is strictly a middleman and for some purposes the agent of both
parties. (19 Cyc, 186; Henderson vs. State, 60 Ind., 234; Black's Law
Dictionary.) A broker is one whose occupation it is to bring parties
together to bargain or to bargain for them, in matters of trade,
commerce or navigation. (Mechem on Agency, sec. 13; Wharton on Agency,
sec. 695.) Judge Storey, in his work on Agency, defines a broker as an
agent employed to make bargains and contracts between other persons, in
matters of trade, commerce or navigation for a compensation commonly
called brokerage. (Storey on Agency, sec. 28.) A real estate broker
negotiates the purchase or sale of real property. He may also procure
loans on mortgage security, collect rents, and attend to the letting
and leasing of houses and lands. (Bouvier's Law Dictionary.) A broker
acts for another."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It will be noted that the above-quoted statutory definition not
only includes the idea of negotiating the purchase and sale of real
estate, etc., etc., for others but also "for themselves." The Collector
of Internal Revenue contends that the word "themselves" in said
definition includes the appellant in the present case.</p>
<p> It may be admitted that said statutory definition would apply to a
person who is engaged in the business of negotiating the purchase and
sale of lands, buildings, or interest therein, etc., etc., if the
negotiation was made with the ultimate object of serving some third
person. But certainly it cannot be applied to such transactions when
they are made without the idea of ultimately serving some third person.
In our discussion of the said statutory definition, we must not
overlook the fact that the Legislature was attempting to define a "real
estate broker;" that the statute attempted to define a "real estate
broker" and not a "real estate dealer." The term "real estate broker"
must not be confused with "real estate dealer." Said section of the law
defines a "real estate broker" and the definition must not be so
construed as to include a "real estate dealer."</p>
<p> For example: A has a certain amount of surplus capital in cash. He
decides to invest it in the purchase of real estate and does so. He
does so because he believes it to be a safe and profitable investment
of his fund. He does not purchase the property for the purpose of
resale. He has no idea of reselling the property. The purchase and sale
of lands, buildings, etc., is not his business. He is neither a real
estate broker nor a real estate dealer. In such transaction, it is not
his purpose to make it a business. His money, if not invested, is
subject to be taxed as cash—as capital. The lands and buildings so
purchased are subject to taxation as a part of his property, the same
as that of any other owner of property. He differs from a real estate
broker in the fact that the property seldom ever appears in the name of
the real estate broker. A real estate broker is a person who, for
commission or other compensation, generally, is engaged in the selling
of, or negotiating sales of, real estate belonging to others. A real
estate broker is required to have a license, because he is engaged in a
business the capital of which cannot be placed upon the tax duplicate,
for the reason that the only capital invested, generally, is the <em>time</em> of the broker.</p>
<p> We cannot bring ourselves to believe that it was the purpose of the
Legislature to require a license as a real estate broker from every
person who now and then happens to be a purchaser or vendor, etc.,
etc., qf real estate, unless that was his principal business, and then
only when the purchases, etc., etc., were for immediate sale, etc. In
other words, it is believed that the Legislature only intended that a
license should be required of those who, while looking for a vendor of
real estate were at the same time looking for a purchaser of the
same—those who were buying to sell, and not those who were buying to
keep as their own property, as a part of their own capital, as an
investment for themselves or those associated with them. We do not
believe that the Legislature intended to change the familiar,
well-known and accepted meaning of the term "real estate broker," which
is, that he is a mere "negotiator" between two parties, seldom acting
in his own name but generally in the name of those who employ him. He
is strictly a middleman, acting for and on behalf of others. He may be
acting for and on behalf of both parties to a particular transaction,
or, in some instances, he may be acting for himself, hoping, however,
and intending always, either at the time of the transaction or as soon
thereafter as possible, to find a third person.</p>
<p> From an examination of the charter and by-laws and purposes of the
plaintiff, it will be seen that there are no transactions in the nature
of negotiations for the purchase and sale, etc., etc., of lands,
buildings, or interest therein, except among the members themselves;
that every negotiation by the association is for the mutual benefit of
the members of the association and not for the benefit of third
persons. The association in no sense acts as a middle man. All of its
transactions are for the mutual concern of its members only. No
outsider nor third parties have any intervention in any of its
transactions.</p>
<p> We cannot bring ourselves to believe that it was the purpose of the
Legislature, in the definition above given of a "real estate broker,"
to include associations like the plaintiff herein within its terms.</p>
<p> Therefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby revoked, and it is
hereby ordered and decreed that a judgment be entered in favor of the
plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of P450, without any
finding as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p> <em>Araullo, C. J., Street, Avancena, Villamor,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ., </em>concur.
