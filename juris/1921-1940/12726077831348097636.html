				<BR><STRONG></STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">STATEMENT<br></div><br>Plaintiff  is a corporation organized  and  existing under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain, duly licensed to transact business in the Philippine Islands, with its principal office in the City of Manila.  The defendant is  the Collector of Internal Revenue.<br><br>Plaintiff  alleges that during  the  year 1922  it  exported from the Philippine Islands and sold in the United States certain quantities  of centrifugal  sugar,  manufactured tobacco, copra and coconut oil,  at a net profit of P400,324.85. That the defendant, acting  and pretending to act under the  provisions  of Act No. 2833,  as amended by Act  No. 2926, unlawfully and illegally levied and assessed against the plaintiff a tax of 3 per centum  on  the  amount of such profit during the year 1922 amounting to P12,009.75, which plaintiff paid  under written protest on the ground that the profit which it obtained from the sugar and tobacco sold by it in the United States was subject to the income tax levied by the government of that country.  That no part of plaintiff's profit was  derived  from sources within the  Philippine Islands.  That plaintiff's protest was overruled and denied, and defendant  has  refused to return the amount of such tax.  Wherefore, it prays  for a corresponding judgment,  with costs.<br><br>For answer  the defendant made a general and specific denial of all of the  material allegations of the complaint, except that which is specifically admitted.  Defendant admits paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5 of  plaintiff's complaint, except as to  the  amounts, and  alleges  that the taxes which plaintiff seeks to recover were lawfully levied, assessed and collected under the provisions of Act  No. 2833, as amended by Act No. 2926, and defendant prays that plaintiff's complaint be dismissed,  with  costs.<br><br>The case was tried  and  submitted upon  the  following "Agreed Statement of Facts:"<br><br><blockquote>"I. That plaintiff is a corporation duly organized and existing under the  laws  of the  Kingdom of  Spain, duly licensed to do business in  the Philippine Islands, and maintaining its  principal office in said Islands in the City of Manila.<br><br>"II. That defendant is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting Collector of Internal Revenue  for the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"III. That plaintiff is the owner of several 'haciendas,' sugar and oil mills and tobacco factories located in the Philippine Islands destined to  the production or manufacture of tobacco, sugar, copra, and coconut oil for sale therein and in foreign  countries; and has been and is still engaged, in the Philippine Islands, in the shipping business and in the buying and selling of tobacco, sugar, copra, and oil and in the exportation of the same, and that its business has been, and  is being done mainly in the  Philippine 'Islands.<br><br>"IV.  That the Philippine branch of the plaintiff corporation on various dates during the year 1922 exported from the Philippine Islands a quantity of  centrifugal sugar, of which ten per centum was produced and ninety purchased by it  in the Philippine Islands, and which was sold in the United States by the agency therein of the plaintiff's Philippine branch, the sale being subject to confirmation and absolute control  as to price and other terms and conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine branch; and that from such transactions  on centrifugal sugar  during said year 1922,  the plaintiff made a profit of P114,226.80, Philippine currency.<br><br>"V. That, likewise, the plaintiff's Philippine branch on various  dates during said year 1922, exported  from the Philippine Islands a certain quantity of manufactured tobacco produced by it in the Philippine Islands which was sold in  the United States by  the agency therein of the plaintiff's  Philippine branch, the sale being likewise subject to confirmation  and absolute control as to price and other terms and conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine branch, deriving from such transactions a profit of P296,341.19,  Philippine currency.<br><br>"VI. "That, likewise, the plaintiff's Philippine  branch on various  dates during the said year 1922, exported  from the  Philippine Islands a certain quantity of copra  and  a certain quantity of  coconut  oil,  produced,  purchased, or manufactured by it in the Philippine Islands, which were sold in the United States by the agency therein of the plaintiff's Philippine branch, such sales being likewise subject to confirmation and absolute control as to price and other terms and  conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine branch, and that from such transactions  on copra and coconut oil the plaintiff  suffered losses amounting to P10,243.14, Philippine currency.<br><br>"VII. That deducting the sum  of P10,243.14,  the losses mentioned, in paragraph VI of this stipulation, from the sum of P410,567.99, the aggregate of the profits mentioned in paragraphs IV and V, there remained a net profit of P400,324.85.<br><br>"VIII. That the said net profit of P400,324.85, together with other gains, profits, or income were accounted for by the plaintiff on its books of accounts kept in the Philippine Islands as earnings made by and accruing to the Philippine branch, thereby subjecting  such profits,  gains, or incomes  to further business deductions—management expenses,  losses, etc.<br><br>"IX. That the defendant Collector of Internal Revenue, acting and pretending to act under the provisions of Act No. 2833 (Philippine Income Tax Law), as amended by Act No. 2926, levied and assessed against plaintiff a tax of three (3) per centum on the amount of the aforesaid net profits (P400,324.85)  earned by plaintiff, as recited in paragraphs IV, V  and VI hereof, in the sum of P12,009.75, Philippine currency.<br><br>"X.  That on the 18th day of. October, 1923, plaintiff,  in order to avoid the infliction upon it of fines and penalties and  the distraint of its property by defendant, did pay  to defendant, under instant protest in writing, the said sum of P12,009.75,  Philippine currency.<br><br>"XI. That plaintiff's protest against the payment of the aforesaid tax was overruled and denied  by defendant on the 20th day of October,  1923, and defendant has refused, and  still continues in his refusal, to return to plaintiff, on demand, the said sum of P12,009.75, Philippine currency, or any part  thereof.<br><br>"XII. That the parties hereto  reserve the right to  introduce evidence, direct or rebuttal,  on  any point not herein stipulated and which  may be deemed material and necessary for the proper determination of  this case."<br></blockquote><br>Upon such issues and  stipulated facts, the lower  court rendered judgment  for the plaintiff as prayed for in  its complaint, without costs, to which the  defendant duly excepted and filed a motion for a new trial, which was over-ruled.   On  appeal  the  defendant assigns the  following errors:<br><br><blockquote>"I. The lower court erred in declaring that the plaintiff's income taxed by the defendant was received from sources not within the  Philippine Islands and therefore not subject to taxation.<br><br>"II. The lower court erred  in condemning the  defendant to return to the plaintiff the sum of P12,009.75, amount of the tax in question, instead of dismissing the complaint.<br><br>"III. The lower court erred in not granting a new trial."<br></blockquote><br>JOHNS,<span style="font-style: italic;"> J,</span>:<br><br>Upon the stipulation of facts, the question  involved  on this appeal is the legal construction to be placed on section 10 of Act No.  2833, as amended  by section 7 of Act No. 2926, which  provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"There shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income received in the preceding calendar year from all sources by every corporation, joint-stock company, partnership, joint-account (<i>cuenta en participation</i>),  association, or  insurance company,  organized in the Philippine Islands, no matter how created or organized, but not including duly registered general co-partnerships (<i>compañias colectivas</i>), a tax of three per centum upon such income; and a like tax shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income received in the  preceding calendar year  from all sources within the Philippine Islands by  every  corporation,  joint-stock company, partnership, joint-account (<i>cuenta en participation</i>),  association, or insurance company, organized, authorized,  or  existing under the  laws of any  foreign country, including interest on bonds, notes, or other interest bearing  obligations of residents, corporate or other-wise, and  including the income  derived from  dividends or net profits  subject to the tax established  in this sub-section."<br><br>In its final  analysis,  that  question  involves the  legal meaning and construction to be placed on the words "sources within  the Philippine Islands,' as they are used  in that section, in connection with, and  founded upon, the stipulation of facts.   It  will be noted  that the section above quoted has two separate and distinct provisions; one for a tax  of  three per  centum for  each calendar year  on the annual  total net  income derived from  all sources by a domestic  corporation, and the other for a like tax "upon the  total net income  received in the preceding calendar year from all sources within  the  Philippine Islands"  by any corporation organized  and "existing under  the laws of any  foreign country."<br></blockquote><br>It is  very  apparent that  it was  the purpose and intent of the Legislature that a foreign corporation which has a branch  office in the  Philippines  and  engaged  in business here  should pay the  same amount of income tax on that business as a domestic  corporation would have to pay; otherwise, a foreign corporation with a branch office in the  Philippines  and  doing  business here would have  an advantage of the amount of such annual income tax over a domestic corporation engaged in the same line  of business.<br><br>Under  paragraph 4 of the  agreed  statement  of facts, it is stipulated that during the year 1922, plaintiff exported from the Philippine Islands a quantity of centrifugal sugar, of which ten per  centum was produced  and ninety purchased by it in the Philippine Islands,  and which was sold in the United States  by and  through the agent of the plaintiff's Philippine  branch,  and that the  sale was subject to confirmation  and  absolute control  as  to  price and other terms and conditions by the plaintiff's Philippine branch. The  same stipulation is made  as to the tobacco, copra and coconut oil mentioned and described in the  complaint.  It is further stipulated  that the profits or incomes in question were accounted for by the plaintiff  on its books of account "kept in the Philippine Islands as  earnings made  by and accruing to the  Philippine  branch, etc.,'  That is  to say, that although the sales  of  the products  from which the incomes in question were derived  were made in the  United States, they were made there by an agent of the Philippine branch of the plaintiff, and all of them were made subject to the confirmation and absolute  control as  to price, terms and conditions  by the plaintiff's Philippine branch.  In other words, no sale was actually consummated  until after it was ratified and approved  by the local branch, and all profits or incomes from such  sales were accounted for by the plaintiff on its  books  kept in the Philippine Islands "as  earnings made by  and  accruing to  the  Philippine branch.'  It is further  stipulated that the  sugar,  tobacco, copra and coconut oil  in question, from which  the net incomes  were derived,  were  exclusively the  products of the Philippine  Islands in which and where  they were produced on the properties of the plaintiff or  by it purchased at or through its branch office in the Philippines, and from which country they were shipped to the United States and there sold  in the same form and condition as when they were  shipped from the Philippine Islands.  That is to say, the income in question  was derived and  received by the plaintiff from  the exclusive products of the Philippine Islands which were purchased  or produced by and through its  branch office  in  the Philippine Islands  and which it shipped from the Islands  to the  United States, where such products were sold in the identical condition in which they were shipped from the Philippine Islands. Hence, it must follow that the net income of the  plaintiff as to such products was from "sources within the Philippine Islands" where  the products were purchased or produced and where  the  plaintiff maintains its  branch office  for that specific purpose.<br><br>The appellee cites and relies upon the following opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States:<br><br><blockquote>"A corporation  organized under  the laws of  Scotland owns and operates two sawmills in the United States.  The mills  saw logs  into plank squares  called 'handle blanks' and also roughly  turn hammer handles.  These  products are exported to Glasgow where  they are finished at the home mill.  In addition the manager of the American plant buys logs in the United States and exports them as such to  Great Britain,  No part of the products of the mills located in this  country  or  of the logs purchased here is sold in the United  States, but the entire  output is sold in Great Britain. The plants and operations of the manager in the United States are conducted solely from  funds sent to this country from the home office in Glasgow, Scotland, and no  funds  are sent to the home office from  the American plants."<br></blockquote><br>Based upon such  facts, the Attorney-General held that the Scotland corporation was not liable to the tax in question.  Assuming that to be the law, there is a very marked distinction between  the  facts in that  case  and the stipulated facts in this case.  There the two sawmills in  the United States sawed logs into plank squares called "handle blanks" and also "roughly turn hammer handles." In that condition, they were shipped to Glasgow where "they were there finished at the home mill" and then placed on  the market.  It further appears that all of the operations in the United States "are conducted  solely  from funds sent to this country from the home office in Glasgow, Scotland, and no funds are sent to the home office frdm the American plants."  In the instant case, it is stipulated that the plain- tiff exported the products in question  from the Philippine Islands to the United  States where they  were sold by an agency of the plaintiff's Philippine branch, and that such sale was "subject  to confirmation and absolute control as to price  and  other terms  and  conditions thereof by the plaintiff's Philippine branch," and that  all of such net profits were kept  and accounted for by  the plaintiff "on its books of account kept in the Philippine Islands as earnings made by and  accruing to the  Philippine branch." That opinion is not  in point upon the stipulated facts in this case.<br><br>Appellee's contention if sustained would give a preference to a foreign corporation doing  business through a branch  office  in  the  Philippine  Islands over  a domestic corporation engaged  in the same line  of business to the amount of  the 3 per cent tax upon the income in question. That  was not the purpose and intent  of the Legislature. It is  very  apparent that  the  Legislature intended that a foreign corporation with a branch office in  the Philippine Islands  could  do  business here upon the same terms and conditions  as  a domestic corporation,  and that it never intended that  a foreign corporation with a branch office and  doing business in  the Philippines should have any preference over  a  domestic corporation engaged  in  the same  line of business.<br><br>In the instant  case, the record is conclusive that all of the sources of  plaintiff's income in question had their origin in or  were derived from its branch office in the Philippine Islands  by and through the products of the Philippine  Islands, which were  purchased or produced  by its  branch office  in the Philippine  Islands, and that all of the sales in question were  made through its  branch office, and that no sale was actually consummated  until such time as  it was  approved by the branch office both as to terms and conditions,  and that an account of all of such sales made in the United States was rendered to the branch  office,  together with the proceeds, where a full and complete record was kept and  made of all of such transactions.<br><br>Plaintiff's source of income in question  was  from the products of the  Philippine  Islands which were derived through its branch office, and it appears from the stipulation of facts that  all of  such products  when shipped  by the branch  office to the United States  were there  sold in the identical condition  in which they were shipped from the Philippine  Islands, and that an account of all of such sales was  rendered  to  the  branch office.<br><br>Upon the record, we are clearly of the opinion that upon the products in question, plaintiff's net income was derived from  "sources within the Philippine Islands."<br><br>The judgment of the lower  court is reversed and the complaint dismissed,  with costs  for the defendant.  So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C.J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand </i>and <i>Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><center><b>UPON MOTION  FOR RECONSIDERATION</b></center><br><div style="text-align: right;">February 9, 1928<br></div><br>JOHNSON, <i>J</i>., dissenting:<br><br>At the time this case  was considered and  voted  I reserved my vote for the reason that  I  did  not then  have time to look into the authorities.   Since  that time I have taken the pains to  examine the  authorities upon the  question presented by the appellant and I now dissent from the conclusions  of the majority opinion, and vote to grant the reconsideration prayed for.<br><br>The only  question presented by  the appellant, under the stipulated facts, relates to the meaning of the phrase "total net income received from all <i>sources </i>within the Philippine Islands" by the appellee, as that phrase is used in section 10 of Act No. 2833 (March 7, 1919, vol.  14, Public Laws, p. 221),  as amended by section  7 of Act No. 2926  (March 20, 1920,  vol.  15, Public Laws,  p.  260).  Said section 10 provided for a tax of <i>two</i> per cent upon net incomes while said section 7  required payment of <i>three</i> per  cent  upon net incomes; otherwise the important part of said section (10) remains the same.<br><br>This  case was  decided  upon the  following stipulated facts:<br><br><blockquote>"I. That plaintiff is  a  corporation duly organized and existing  under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain,  duly licensed  to  do  business in  the Philippine  Islands,  and maintaining its principal office in  said Islands  in the City of Manila.<br><br>"II. That defendant  is the duly appointed, qualified, and acting Collector of Internal Revenue for the  Philippine Islands.<br><br>"III. That plaintiff is  the owner of several 'haciendas,' sugar and  oil mills  and tobacco factories  located in the Philippine Islands destined to the production  or manufacture of tobacco,  sugar,  copra,  and coconut  oil for  sale therein and in foreign  countries; and has  been  and  is still engaged,  in  the Philippine  Islands, in the shipping business and in the  buying and selling of tobacco, sugar, copra,  and oil and in the exportation of the same,  and that its business has  beeny and is being done mainly in the Philippine Islands.<br><br>"IV. That the  Philippine branch of  the plaintiff  corporation on various  dates  during the year 1922 exported from the Philippine Islands a quantity of centrifugal sugar, of which ten per  centum  was produced and  ninety purchased by it in the Philippine Islands, and <i>which was sold in the United States</i> by the agency therein of the plaintiff's Philippine branch, the sale being subject to  confirmation and  absolute control  as to price and other terms and conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine  branch;  and that from such transactions on centrifugal sugar  during said year 1922, the plaintiff made a profit of  P114,226.80, Philippine currency.<br><br>"V. That, likewise, the plaintiff's Philippine branch on various dates  during said  year 1922,  exported from the Philippine Islands  a  certain quantity of manufactured tobacco produced by it in the Philippine Islands which was sold  in the United States  by the  agency therein  of the plaintiff's Philippine branch,  the sale being likewise subject  to confirmation  and  absolute control as to price  and other terms and conditions thereof, by the plaintiff's Philippine branch, deriving  from such transactions a profit of P296,341.19, Philippine currency.<br><br>"VI. That, likewise, the plaintiff's Philippine branch on various dates during the said  year 1922, exported from the  Philippine Islands a  certain  quantity of  copra and  a certain quantity of  coconut oil,  produced,  purchased,  or manufactured by it in the  Philippine Islands,  which were sold  in the  United States by  the agency therein of the plaintiff's Philippine  branch,  such sales being likewise subject to confirmation and absolute control  as to  price and  other terms  and conditions thereof, by  the plaintiff's Philippine branch and that from such transactions on copra and  coconut oil the plaintiff suffered losses  amounting  to P10,243.14,  Philippine currency.<br><br>"VII. That deducting the sum of P10,243.14, the losses mentioned in paragraph VI of this stipulation, from the sum of P410,567.99, the aggregate of the profits mentioned in paragraphs IV and V,  there  remained a net profit  of P400,324.85.<br><br>"VIII. That the said net profit of P400,324.85, together with other gains, profits,  or income were accounted for by the plaintiff on its books of accounts kept in the Philippine Islands as earnings made by and  accruing to the Philippine branch, thereby subjecting such  profits, gains, or incomes  to  further business deductions—management expenses, losses,  etc.<br><br>"IX.  That the  defendant Collector of Internal Revenue, acting and pretending to act under the provisions of Act No. 2833 (Philippine Income Tax Law), as amended by Act No. 2926, levied and assessed against plaintiff a tax of three (3)  per centum on the amount of the aforesaid net profits (P400,324.85) earned by plaintiff, as recited  in paragraphs IV,  V, and VI hereof, in the sum of P12,009.75,  Philippine currency.<br><br>"X. That on the  18th day  of October, 1923, plaintiff, in order to avoid the infliction upon it of fines and penalties and the distraint of  its property by defendant, did pay to defendant, under  instant protest in writing, the  said sum of  P12,009.75,  Philippine currency.<br><br>"XI. That plaintiff's protest against the payment of the aforesaid tax was overruled and denied by defendant  on the  20th day of October, 1923, and defendant has refused, and still continues in his  refusal, to  return  to plaintiff, on demand, the said sum of P12,009.75, Philippine currency, or any part thereof.<br><br>"XII. That the parties hereto reserve the right to introduce evidence, direct or rebuttal, on any point not herein stipulated and which may be deemed material and  necessary for the proper determination of this case."</blockquote><br>That  part  of said section 7, important for this decision, provides that:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 7.  Section ten  (a) of thersame Act (Act No. 2833) is hereby  amended to read as follows:<br><br>" 'Sec. 10.  (a)  There shall be levied, assessed, collected, and  paid  annually upon  the total net income  received in the  preceding calendar year  from  all sources by every corporation,  joint-stock  company,  partnership, joint-account (<i>cuenta  en  participation</i>), association, or insurance company, organized in the Philippine Islands,  no matter how created or organized, but not including duly registered general  co-partnerships (<i>compañias colectivas</i>),  a tax of three <i>per centum</i> upon such income; and a like tax shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid annually upon the total net income  received in  the preceding calendar year from all sources  within  the  Philippine Islands  by every corporation, joint-stock company, partnership, joint-account (<i>cuenta en participacion</i>), association,  or  insurance company, organized, authorized, or<i> existing under  the laws of any  foreign country</i>, including interest on bonds, notes or other interest bearing obligations of residents, corporate or otherwise, and  including the  income derived from dividends or net profits subject to the tax established in this subsection.'"</blockquote><br>From a careful reading of said section  7 it will be seen that a  tax "upon the  total net  income" is imposed upon all classes of entities, each class including exactly the, same kind of commercial entities.   They are (a)  domestic corporations,  etc., and  (6)  foreign corporations, etc., doing business within the Philippine Islands.  The first class  is required to pay the tax upon the total net income received "from all sources," while the second class is required to pay the  tax  upon the total net income received "from all sources within the Philippine Islands."  From the provisions of  said section it at once becomes evident that it was not the intention of the Legislature to collect taxes from foreign  corporations  on income "from  sources  without the Philippine Islands."   From the provisions of said section it is evident that the Legislature did not  intend to collect taxes upon incomes received by foreign corporations from their  business  or branches of  business-outside of the Philippine Islands.  The Legislature  of the Philippine Islands under said section did not presume  that  it had authority to  collect taxes upon the income of foreign corporations received  from sources without the Philippine Islands.<br><br>We have then the question squarely presented: What is the meaning, scope and effect of the  phrase  used in said section, "from all sources within the  Philippine Islands?" While we have been unable to find any judicial interpretation of that  phrase,  happily we have found  an interpretation of the phrase by those who are authorized to speak upon that question.<br><br>In 1916 (September 8, 1916) the Congress of the United States adopted "an Act to increase  the  revenue and  for other purposes."  (Vol.  39,  part t  U. S. Stat.  at  Large, p. 756.)   Section  10 of that Act is in exactly  the same language (except as to the rate of taxation)  as section 7 of Act No. 2926.  Said section contained the phrase "the total net income received from all sources within the United States" as applied to foreign corporations.  In the  said Act of 1916 the phrase "from all sources within the United States" was  first used by Congress.   The phrase used in the Act of Congress of 1913  was "business transacted and capital invested within the United States."  Congress,  for some reason  or other, found it advisable to  change  the phrase "business transacted and capital jtovested within  the United States" to  the phrase "from sources within  the United States."  By the Act  of  Congress of October 3, 1917 (vol. 40,  U.  S. Stat.  at Large, p. 303) the  term "net income" as applied to foreign corporations, is defined to mean, "the net income received from sources within the United States."   (<i>See also</i> the Revenue  Act of  Congress for the year 1918.)<br><br>A question arose  in  the  Revenue  Department of the United States concerning the meaning of the phrase "from sources within the United States" as used in the Act of Congress of 1916.  That question was referred to the Attorney-General of the United  States (32 Opinions of the Attorney-General of the United States, p. 336).   After a careful consideration of the meaning of said phrase the Attorney-General said:<br><br><blockquote>"No  income is derived from the mere manufacture of goods; before there can be income there must be sale; and there is no income  from sources 'within the United States' from goods  manufactured  here  (United States) unless there is, in the language of the statute, 'both manufacture and  disposition  of  goods within the United States.'   The purpose of the 1918 statute is  to tax only income that accrues within the United States.   Congress does not attempt to tax  profits arising from goods manufactured  in  this country but sold after being shipped abroad, without being disposed of by the  owner in this country  (United States). When  the corporation manufactures or partially manufactures articles in  this country (United States), but  does not sell them until they are taken  abroad, there is no income 'from sources within  the United States.'  For the reasons given it is concluded that income which  may accrue to a foreign corporation by the sale of  merchandise purchased in the  United States, but sold outside of the United States, is not income from 'sources within the  United States.' "</blockquote><br>That ruling by the Attorney-General was immediately accepted  and followed as  a  correct interpretation of the phrase  "from sources within  the  United States" by the Revenue Department of the United States Government; and not only that, but the same interpretation was followed in a  later  opinion  of  the Attorney-General  of the United States,  holding  that the interpretation  given by the  Attorney-General under the Act of 1916  was a  correct interpretation  of  the  use  of  that phrase  in  the Acts  of Congress of 1921  and 1924.   (Jan. 21,  1924, 34 Opinions of the Attorney-General of the United States, 93; 5 Treasury  Bulletin,  1-39-519; Holmes Federal  Taxes, 6th ed., p. 416.)<br><br>The opinions of the Attorney-General and the regulations issued in accordance therewith by the  Treasury Department of the United  States were followed until 1921,  when by an Act of Congress of November 23, 1921 (vol. 42, Part I, U. S.  Stat, at Large, p. 227), entitled "An Act to reduce and  equalize taxation, to provide revenues, and for  other purposes" and in subsection (e) of section 217 of that Act, an apportionment was provided of incomes derived partly within and  partly without the United States.  Said subparagraph (e) provided that "items  of  gross income,  expenses,  losses and deductions, other than those specified in subdivisions  (a)  and  (c)  of said  section  (217)  shall be allocated or apportioned to sources within  or without the United States under  rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner'with the approval  of the  Secretary (of the Treasury).  Where  items  of  gross income are  separately allocated to  'sources within the United States' there  shall be deducted the expenses, losses and other deductions properly  apportioned or allocated thereto and a  ratable part of other expenses,  losses or  other deductions which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income.  In the case  of gross income  derived from sources partly within and  partly without the United States, the net  income may first  be computed by deducting the expenses, losses or other deductions apportioned or allocated thereto and a ratable part of any expenses, losses or other deductions which  cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income; and the portion of such net income attributable to sources within the  United States may be determined by  processes or formulas of  general apportionment prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.  <i>Gains, profits </i>and <i>income</i>  from (1)  transportation or other  services  rendered partly  within and partly without the United States, or (2) from the sale of personal property produced  (in  whole or  in part) by the taxpayer within  and sold without  the  United States, or produced (in whole or in part)  by the taxpayer without and sold within the United States, shall be  treated  as derived partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United  States,  Gains, profits and income derived from the purchase  of  personal property within and its sale without the  United States or from the purchase of personal property without and its sale  within the United States <i>shall be  treated as derived entirely from the country in  which sold."</i>   (Subsection  [e],  section 217 of Act of Congress of November 23, 1921.)<br><br>It will be noted that this section provides that all "gains, profits and income derived from the purchase of personal property  within  and its sale  without the  United  States shall be  treated  as  derived  entirely from the country in which <i>sold</i>."  Thus, the opinion of the  Attorney-General, quoted above, is followed and ratified by said  Act of Congress of  1921.<br><br>Subsection (e) of section 217 of the Act of  Congress of November 23,1921 (42, Part  I, U. S. Stat. at  Large, p. 244) was carried  forward and made  subsection  (e) of section 217 of the Act of Congress of  June 2, 1924, with some changes  in the last two  lines.   (43 Part I,  U. S. Stat. at Large, p. 74.)<br><br>Said subsection (e) of section 217 of the Act of Congress of  1921 was amended in subsection  (e)  of  section 217 of the Act of Congress of 1924 in the  following manner.  In the last  two lines the language in the Act of  1921 was "shall be treated as derived  entirely from the country in which sold,"  whereas the last two lines of subsection  (e) of section 217 of the Act of 1924 read: "derived entirely from <i>sources</i> within the country in which <i>sold</i>."  Again, it will be seen that the Congress of the United  States in both  of  said subsections (e) adhered  to the  doctrine announced  by the Attorney-General in  vol. 32, Opinions of the Attorney-General of the United States, p. 336, providing expressly that "gains, profits and income derived from the purchase of personal property within and  its sale without the United States or from the purchase of personal property without and its sale within the United  States,  shall be treated as derived entirely  from  sources within the country in which <i>sold</i>."<br><br><center>THE INCOME  IN QUESTION, BY THE STIPULATED PACTS AND BY THE ADMISSION OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL IN  THIS COURT, WAS DERIVED PROM MERCHANDISE "SOLD" IN THE UNITED STATES.</center><br><br>Considering the similarity of the statute here  and the Acts  of Congress  of  1916, 1917, 1918,  1921 and 1924, and the meaning of the phrase "total net income received from all sources within the United States" (total net income received from all sources within the Philippine Islands),  as interpreted not only by the highest fiscal department in the United States and followed  by the Revenue  Department, but by the Congress of the United States, to wit: that "no income  is derived from the mere manufacture of goods; before there can be income there must be sale; and there is no income from 'sources within  the United States' from goods manufactured in the United States unless there is, in the language of the  statute, 'both manufacture  and disposition of goods within the United States.*  The  purpose of the 1916 statute  is to tax  only income that  accrues within the  United  States.  Congress does  not attempt  to tax profits arising from goods manufactured in this country but sold after being shipped abroad without being disposed of by the owner in this country  (United States).   When a foreign  corporation manufactures or  partially manufactures articles in this country (United States) but  does not sell them until they are taken abroad, there is no income 'from sources  within  the  United States. "<br><br>From the foregoing we are led to the  question, Where were the merchandise involved in this question sold?  We find the answer to that question  (1) in the stipulated facts (paragraphs 4, 5, 6 of the stipulated facts) and (2)  in the brief of the Attorney-General (p. 6).   Said paragraphs of the stipulated facts expressly  provide that the merchandise from which  the  income in  question  arose <i>"was sold in the United States."</i>  The Attorney-General in his brief, at page 6, also makes the statement that:  "It is true that the sale of the  articles was made  in the United States."  In our opinion it  would be a  great injustice to the appellee if the stipulation presented at the beginning of the trial and the admission of the Attorney-General after the trial should be construed now to the prejudice of the appellee.   We  do not believe, in view of said stipulation and admitted fact by the Attorney-General,  that any question should be raised at this time as ta the place of the sale.  The question of the place of the sale has been admitted  to be in the United States.<br><br>It is argued, however, in the  majority  opinion  that in-asmuch as the sale was by an agent in the United States, "the sale being subject to confirmation,  etc. as  to price and other terms and conditions' that the sale was not made in the United States according to the stipulated facts, but was made in  fact in  the  Philippine Islands.  We cannot give our assent to that argument.  The sale took place, by agreement of the parties, where the goods  were, in the United  States  at the time of the sale.<br><br>We must not confuse the isource of property with the source of income from property.<br><br>The taxing  power of the Philippine Islands  does not extend beyond  its territorial limits.  The  Philippine Government has no authority  to tax property  nor an  income fromx property  beyond its  territorial limits.  The Legislature evidently recognized the limitation of its powers when it provided in section  10 above quoted for a tax upon the "total net income received from all sources <i>within</i> the Philippine Islands."<br><br>The place  where the sale  of personal property takes place is always a  question of  fact,  depending upon  the facts and  circumstances of each particular case.   A few examples may serve to illustrate:<br><br><blockquote>First example: A is a manufacturer or producer of hats in the City of Manila.  He has an agent in the City of Dagupan.  He sends hats from time to time to his agent to be sold in Dagupan. The place of the sale in this example is evidently Dagupan and not Manila.<br><br>Second example: A  is a manufacturer of  hats  in  the City of Manila.  B, a citizen of Dagupan, orders a number of hats to be sold by him on his own account as a merchant in the City of  Dagupan.  The entire transaction takes place in the City of Manila.  In this case the sale of the hats takes place in the City of Manila.<br><br>Third  example: A  is a manufacturer of  hats in  the City of Manila.  B orders a number of hats from A to be delivered and  paid  for at the City  of  Dagupan.  In such a case the sale takes place at the City of Dagupan  and not in the City of Manila.<br><br>Fourth example: A,  a manufacturer of hats in the City of Manila,  entered into a contract with B to  deliver  a quantity of hats in good condition in the City of New York. The hats were damaged in transit.  The sale was not complete until the hats  were delivered in good condition in the City of New  York. The  sale was made in  the  City of New York and  not in the City  of Manila.   (E.  C. McCullough &amp; Co. vs. Berger, 43  Phil, 823; 35 Cyc, pp. 274, 275, 276.)<br><br>Fifth example: A is a manufacturer of hats in the City of Manila.   He has an agent in the City of San  Francisco to whom he sends  large quantities  of  hats  to be  sold by his agent.  A reserves the right to fix the price and conditions of the sale from time to time, as well as to confirm all sales.  The hats were sold by the agent in San Francisco in accordance with the  arrangement with A.   The sale is made in the United States.<br><br>Sixth example:  A is a foreign corporation doing business in the Philippine Islands and is a manufacturer and purchaser of hats in the City of Manila,  From time to time he ships his products to the City of San  Francisco in the United  States to be sold there.   He has a <i>bodega</i> or store in San Francisco.  From time to time he goes to the United States and  personally, as opportunity presents itself, sells said merchandise in the United States.  The sale is made in the United  States, notwithstanding the fact that his books of account concerning the purchase,  manufacture and sale of said hats are kept in the branch  office of the City of Manila.<br></blockquote><br><center>THE PACT THAT THE SALE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION  BY THE PHILIPPINE BRANCH DOES NOT MAKE THE SALE, ONE IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.<br></center><br>The fact  that the Philippine branch of the plaintiff corporation reserved the right to control  its agent  in the United  States in the sale of the  merchandise in question does not make the sale, a sale within the Philippine Islands. The sale was made in the United States as per the stipulated  facts  and  admission  of  the  Attorney-General. The control of the sale as to price, etc. does not  change the place of the sale  of the  merchandise.  The Philippine branch of the plaintiff corporation  simply took the precaution of having full control of the acts of its agents in the United States.  The condition would have been exactly the same had the principal  accompanied the merchandise to the United States and sold it.  The sale by the agent does not change the place of sale.   Corporations can only act through their agents.<br><br><center>THE PLAINTIFF  IS SUBJECTED TO DOUBLE TAXATION<br></center><br>Under the stipulated facts the plaintiff is doing business in the United States.   It has an income from said business.<br><br>Under the Acts of Congress of 1916-24 it is subject to pay an income tax upon the "gains, profits and income derived from the purchase of personal property without the United States" and under the decision of the majority opinion,  he is also required to pay a tax upon the same income in the Philippine Islands.  He is therefore subjected to a double tax on the same income.<br><br>Under the doctrine of the majority opinion the plaintiff, as a foreign corporation, bears an unequal burden to that imposed upon domestic corporations, notwithstanding the fact that it was the "purpose, and intent of the Legislature that a foreign corporation which has a branch office in the Philippine Islands and engaged in business here should pay the same amount of income tax on that business as a domestic corporation."<br><br><center>DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS SUBJECTED TO UNEQUAL BURDEN</center><br>If the doctrine of the majority  opinion is the correct interpretation  of the law, then domestic and foreign corporations are subjected to unequal burden in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 12 of Act No. 2833.   Their allowable deductions are not the same.<br><br>It is well established that a state, or territory authorized to legislate for itself, may regulate the activities of foreign corporations within the state or such territory, but it cannot regulate  or interfere with what foreign corporations may do outside.<br><br>The plaintiff was authorized, through its branch office, to do business in the Philippine Islands.  If it chose to do business outside of the Philippine Islands it had a perfect right to do so and the Philippine Legislature has no authority to  place a burden  upon the business  done outside of  the Philippine Islands.   (Allgeyer vs. Louisiana, 165 U.S., 578; St. Louis Cotton  Compress Co. vs. Arkansas, 260 U.  S.,  346; Compañia General de Tabacos  vs.  Collector of Internal Revenue, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, Nov. 21,1927, advance opinion, p. 83.)<br><br>In my opinion the motion for reconsideration should be granted and the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><center>UPON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION<br></center><br><div style="text-align: right;">February 9,  1928<br></div><br>STREET,<span style="font-style: italic;"> J.,</span> dissenting:<br><br>Although I signed the  original opinion in this case I am constrained,  upon further reflection, to record the belief that the assent thus given to the decision was ill-advised,— a mistake apparently  due to an erroneous perception of the bearing upon this case of the two opinions of the Attorney-General of the United States and certain Congressional legislation referred to in the dissenting opinion of Mr.  Justice  Johnson.  In dealing with  a statute adopted by the Philippine Legislature from an Act of Congress we should be careful  to take the law with  the interpretation placed upon it by competent authority in the United States; and  especial care should be taken about this in  dealing with the intricate matters covered by the income-tax laws. Our  endeavor should be  to cooperate, as far  as possible, with  the  Revenue  Department of the United States, in making the operation of  these laws just and uniform.<br><br>The opinions of the  Attorney-General  of  the  United States to which reference has been made sustain the proposition that when merchandise is purchased or  produced in one  country and sold in another,  the place of sale is to be taken as the place of the source of income for the purpose  of applying a law  such as is under consideration in this  case; and it will be noted that the ruling thus  made arose upon facts  where  the conclusion  reached was contrary to the interests of the Government revenue,—a circumstance which indicates that probably no strong considerations in  favor of the  Government  were  overlooked. In  addition to this subsequent legislation of Congress, while accepting said proposition as a general rule, has defined the particular cases where a different rule shall be applied.  But in the Philippine Islands we  have none of this supplemental legislation, with the  result that the rule enunciated by  the Attorney-General  is  applicable in  its full extension in this jurisdiction,  not of course as a binding rule of  law but as a competent interpretation of the statute from which our  own  law is taken.<br><br>My conclusion is in  conformity  with that  reached  by Mr. Justice  Johnson, namely,  that the decision heretofore entered in this case should  be set aside and the appealed judgment  affirmed.</div>
