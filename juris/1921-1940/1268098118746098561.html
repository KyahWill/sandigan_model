				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Prosecuted for and convicted of the crime of rape, Alfredo Santiago appeals to this court making several assignments of error.<br><br>The alleged offended party, who was 18&nbsp; years old when she testified, described the event from&nbsp; the beginning as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="13%"><div align="center">"A. </div></td><td width="87%">When I opened the door, I asked him, 'Why are you here?' He said he had come back to get his driver's license, because he had had an accident. Then he said to me: 'If you wish, we will elope.' I then said to him, 'Why should I elope with you?' After I had said that to him, he lifted me up, and then I asked him: 'Why, where are you going to take me? I'll tell Ate Tentay about you.' And I tried to break away from him. </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td>Who is this <em>Ate</em> Tentay?—A. Doctor Guidote's wife.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q.</div></td><td> And did you succeed in breaking away?—A. At first, no; but as we walked, I asked him: 'Where are you going to take me?'</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td>So you failed to break away from him, while you were at the door, and you said you would tell Ate Tentay about him?—A. I could not break away.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td>What did you do after telling him that you would tell Ate Tentay about him?—A. Nothing. He was taking me to the garage.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td><p>How far is the garage from the kitchen?—A. About 15 meters.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q. </div></td><td>Did the accused succeed in taking you to the gar- age?—A. Yes, sir." (Pages 3 and 4, t. s. n.)</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>This narration indicates a certain prior understanding and confidence between the defendant and the offended party, since the former, upon a sudden proposal of the former that they elope, she immediately permitted him to take her to his room in the garage.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; clear&nbsp; indication of a previous understanding and&nbsp; confidence&nbsp; corroborates&nbsp; his testimony as to the love affair between them.&nbsp; It is also borne out by the fact that the accused succeeded in taking her from the kitchen to said garage some 15 meters away, and&nbsp; up ten steps to his room (page 10,&nbsp; t. s.&nbsp; n.) without her making any attempt to call for&nbsp; help during that time, if she was really being taken there against her will.<br><br>After carefully examining the evidence, we find that the alleged&nbsp; force or intimidation employed by&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; to consummate the act for which he is here prosecuted, has not been established.<br><br>As we have intimated, the record contains strong indications that said act took place with the consent of the complainant Raquel Velarde.<br><br>Not finding the&nbsp; guilt of the accused to&nbsp; be sufficiently established, the&nbsp; judgment appealed&nbsp; from is reversed and the appellant&nbsp; is acquitted with costs <i>de&nbsp; officio</i> and other consequential&nbsp; pronouncements.<br><br>As the&nbsp; defendant is under detention for this cause, let judgment&nbsp; be entered at once,&nbsp; without awaiting the regular period of fifteen days, ordering that he be instantly set at liberty.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avancena, C. J., Johnson,&nbsp; Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
