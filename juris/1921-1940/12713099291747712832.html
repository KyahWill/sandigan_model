				G.R. No. 30190, November 14, 1928</h4>
				<H3>BASILIA CLEMENTE AND HER HUSBAND, ANGEL PICHAY, PETITIONERS, VS. CAYETANO LUKBAN, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TARLAC, AND FORTUNATO DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari, the petitioner, 
Basilia Clemente, alleging in substance that on July 30, 1924, in cadastral case 
No. 37 of the Province of Tarlac, the Court of First Instance adjudicated to her 
lot No. 10642; that by virtue of the judgment, a final decree for the lot was 
entered on January 8, 1927, and a certificate of title issued to her on the same 
day; that one year and four months after the entry of the final decree, the 
respondent Fortunato Domingo filed a motion in said cadastral case for the 
reopening of the decree in regard to the aforesaid lot No. 10642; that the 
respondent judge, in a resolution dated June 7, 1928, granted said motion and, 
setting aside the decision of July 30, 1924, in regard to said lot, ordered a 
new trial; that upon being informed of said resolution, the petitioner filed a 
motion in the Court of First Instance asking that the proceedings for the 
reopening of the case be annulled and set aside on the ground that the motion 
for a new trial presented by the respondent Fortunato Domingo was filed too late 
and was barred under the provisions of section 38 of the Land Registration Act, 
but that the respondent judge persisted in proceeding with the new trial. The 
petitioner therefore prays that a writ of certiorari issue and that, upon 
hearing, the resolution of the respondent judge, granting a new trial, be 
declared null and void and beyond the jurisdiction of the court. 
<p align="justify">The respondents in their answer allege that the petitioner 
obtained the decree of the registration of the aforesaid lot No. 10642 through 
fraud; that the respondent Fortunato Domingo is the real owner of the lot and is 
in possession thereof; that the petitioner brought an action in ejectment 
against him in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac and that said action was 
decided in favor of the respondent Fortunato Domingo and against the petitioner 
herein; that the petitioner well knew that the lot in question was the property 
of the respondent Fortunato Domingo and that it had been adjudicated to him 
prior to the land registration proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify">The respondents further allege that Fortunato Domingo in March, 
1924, filed a claim for lot No. 10642 in cadastral case No. 37 and that in the 
month of May of the same year made proof of his ownership of said lot before the 
deputy clerk, Guillermo Matulac Recio, who had been appointed referee by Judge 
Mariano Rosauro, the presiding judge in the cadastral case; that later on he 
found to his surprise that the certificate of title had been issued in favor of 
the herein petitioner; that upon investigation it was found that his answer or 
claim, as well as the title documents filed an the aforesaid cadastral case in 
regard to said lot, had disappeared and that in the memorandum of the judge in 
regard to the lot, the name of Fortunato Domingo did not appear. </p>
<p align="justify">Assuming that the respondents, in their answer, have told the 
whole truth and nothing but the truth, it is, nevertheless, obvious that the 
respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction in reopening the final decree one 
year and four months after it was entered; section 38 of the Land Registration 
Act provides that "such decree shall not be opened by reason of the absence, 
infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor by any 
proceeding in any court for reversing judgments or decrees; subject, however, to 
the right of any person deprived of land or of any estate or interest therein by 
decree of registration obtained by fraud to file in the Court of Land 
Registration a petition for review within one year after entry of the decree, 
provided no innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest. If there is 
any such purchaser, the decree of registration shall not be opened, but shall 
remain in full force and effect forever, subject only to the right of appeal 
herein before provided. But any person aggrieved by such decree in any case may 
pursue his remedy by action for damages against the applicant or any other 
person for fraud in procuring the decree." </p>
<p align="justify">The proper remedy of the respondent claimant of the land is to 
bring an action against the herein petitioner for a transfer or conveyance of 
the title or for damages. (Land Registration Act, sec. 55; Severino vs. 
Severino, 44 Phil., 343; Jalandoni vs. Carballo, 48 Phil., 857; Estrellado and 
Alcantara vs. Martinez, 48 Phil, 256.) </p>
<p align="justify">The petition is granted, and the proceedings for the reopening 
of the aforesaid final decree are hereby declared null and void and beyond the 
jurisdiction of the respondent judge, without prejudice to the right of the 
respondent claimant to bring an action for a transfer of the title to the land 
in question or for damages. No costs will be allowed in the present case. So 
ordered.</p>
