				<BR><STRONG>LAUREL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is an appeal&nbsp; from an order of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros&nbsp; denying the motion of the appellants to set aside&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of that court in&nbsp; Cadastral&nbsp; Case No. 22,&nbsp; G. L. R. O. Record No. 174,&nbsp; declaring lot&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 712 public land, and to reopen the case as to said lot&nbsp; in accordance with the provisions of&nbsp; Act No. 4043 of the Philippine Legislature.<br><br>The facts of this case are undisputed.&nbsp; On June 12, 1919, the Assistant Director of Lands filed&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros a petition&nbsp; praying that the titles with&nbsp; respect to&nbsp; a&nbsp; tract&nbsp; of land&nbsp; containing&nbsp; about 23,443,355 square meters, divided into lots and situated in the municipality of Hog,&nbsp; Occidental Negros, be settled and adjudicated in accordance with&nbsp; the provisions of Act No. 2259, otherwise known&nbsp; as the&nbsp; Cadastral&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; After due hearing, the lower court, in a decision dated August 15, 1925, declared lot No. 712, comprising about 1,322 square meters,&nbsp; public land because no&nbsp; one appeared to&nbsp; claim&nbsp; it. On&nbsp; January 25, 1934, a motion&nbsp; was filed in the same court by the herein appellants, Roman de Arruza and Mario Luzuriaga, through their&nbsp; attorney, praying that the aforesaid decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lower court be set aside&nbsp; in so far as lot No. 712 was concerned, that a new trial be granted and that they be allowed to present their claim under the provisions of Act No. 4043.&nbsp; On February 2,&nbsp; 1934, the provincial fiscal of Occidental Negros, on behalf of the government, filed an opposition to the appellants' motion contending that the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros had&nbsp; no jurisdiction to&nbsp; reopen&nbsp; the case with respect&nbsp; to lot No. 712 because the motion was not filed within the time limit prescribed by Act No. 4043.&nbsp; On April 20, 1934, the judge of the said court&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the motion of&nbsp; the appellants&nbsp; in&nbsp; an order the dispositive part of which is&nbsp; as follows.:<br><blockquote>"Interpretando las disposiciones de la Ley arriba acotada, el Juzgado es de opinion que la oposici6n del&nbsp; Fiscal Provincial esta bien fundada.&nbsp;&nbsp; Los&nbsp; procedimientos judiciales&nbsp; en cuanto&nbsp; al expediente catastral&nbsp; arriba especificado se han iniciado en junio 12 de&nbsp; 1919, en virtud de&nbsp; una solicitud presentada&nbsp; por el Director de&nbsp; Terrenos, bajo la Ley No. 2259, pidiendo&nbsp; que se&nbsp; fije y declare el dominio y titulo&nbsp; de los lotes de terreno comprendidos en el referido expediente catastral, entre los cuales estaba el Lote No. 712 objeto de esta moci6n.&nbsp; Desde junio 12 de 1919 hasta febrero 18&nbsp; de 1933, en que la Ley&nbsp; No. 4043 entro&nbsp; en vigor, han transcurrido trece anos,&nbsp; ocho meses y seis&nbsp; dias y, por tanto, todas aquellas personas que pretendan tener&nbsp; derecho de propiedad sobre los terrenos comprendidos dentro del expediente catastral arriba titulado ya no tienen derecho de&nbsp; acogerse a&nbsp; los beneficios de la Ley&nbsp; No. 4043 para pedir la&nbsp; reapertura&nbsp; de dicho expediente."</blockquote>The appellants assign three errors&nbsp; alleged to have been committed by the court below all of&nbsp; which raise but one legal&nbsp; question,&nbsp; namely, whether the ten-year period mentioned in Act No. 4043 should be counted from the date the decision was rendered or from the date judicial proceedings were instituted in a&nbsp; cadastral case.<br><br>In&nbsp; determining the&nbsp; intention of the lawmaker, we are permitted to look to prior laws on the same subject and to investigate the antecedents or the&nbsp; legislative history&nbsp; of the statute involved (Loewenstein vs. Page [1910], 16 Phil., 84, 92; U. &amp; vs. De Guzman&nbsp; [1915], 30&nbsp; Phil., 416, 419; Tamayo vs. Gsell [1916], 35 Phil., 953, 963; Mitsui Bussan Kaisha vs. Hongkong&nbsp; and Shanghai Banking Corporation [1917], 36 Phil., 27, 36;&nbsp; Go Chioco vs. Martinez&nbsp; [1923], 45&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 256, 270,&nbsp; 276;&nbsp; Portillo vs*.&nbsp; Salvani [1930], 54 Phil., 543, 546.&nbsp; See also Kepner vs. United States&nbsp; [1904], 195 U. S., 100; 24 Sup.Ct, 797; 49 Law. ed., 114; 11 Phil., 669, 692; Serra&nbsp; vs. Mortiga&nbsp; [1907],&nbsp; 204 U. S.,&nbsp; 470; 27 Sup. Ct, 343; 51 Law. ed,, 571; 11 Phil.,&nbsp; 762, 766; Alzua and Arnalot&nbsp; vs. Johnson&nbsp; [1912], 21 Phil., 308, 331; affd in 231 U. S.,&nbsp; 106; 34 Sup. Ct., 27; 58 Law,&nbsp; ed., 142; United States vs. Katz&nbsp; [1925], 271 U. S., 354; 46 Sup. Ct., 513; 72 Law. ed., 986).<br><br>Act No. 4043 was not the only Act passed by the Philippine Legislature to&nbsp; enable persons whose&nbsp; lands had been declared public lands by virtue of the operation of the cadastral&nbsp; system to recover said lands after&nbsp; complying with certain prescribed conditions.<br><br>In 1923, the Legislature enacted Act No. 3059 (declared in force by Executive Proclamation No. 57, dated September 25, 1923); in 1930, it approved Act No. 3672 (declared in force by Executive Proclamation No. 299,&nbsp; dated February 28, 1930), and more recently in 1934, it&nbsp; passed Act No, 4195 (declared in force by Executive Proclamation No.&nbsp; 767, dated February 7, 1935).&nbsp; A cursory scrutiny of these four Acts will show that while the titles of Acts Nos. 4043&nbsp; and 4195&nbsp; refer to "parcels of land&nbsp; that&nbsp; have been declared public land, by virtue of judicial decisions rendered etc.", those of the earlier Acts Nos. 3059 and&nbsp; 3672 fail to make any such allusion. The title of Act No. 3059 is as follows:<br><blockquote>"An Act to provide that&nbsp; certain claims to parcels of land that have been declared public land&nbsp; may be&nbsp; filed in the proper court within the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of one year, under&nbsp; certain conditions."&nbsp; The title of Act&nbsp; No. 3672 is as follows:<br><br>"An Act to authorize the filing in the proper court, under certain conditions, of certain&nbsp; claims of title to parcels of land that have been declared public land, within the period of one year from the date of the promulgation of this Act." The title of Act No. 4043&nbsp; is as follows:<br><br>"An Act to authorize the filing in the proper court, under certain&nbsp; conditions, of certain claims of title&nbsp; to parcels of land that have been declared public land, by virtue of <i>judicial decisions rendered</i> within the fifteen years next preceding the&nbsp; approval of this Act."&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And the title of Act&nbsp; No. 4195 reads:<br><br>"An Act to authorize the filing in the proper court, under certain&nbsp; conditions, of certain claims of title&nbsp; to parcels of land that have been declared public land, by virtue of <i>judicial decisions rendered</i> within the fifteen years next preceding the approval of this Act." (Underscoring ours.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the other hand,&nbsp; the bodies&nbsp; of all the four Acts just mentioned speak in clear and, unmistakable terms of parcels of land that "<i>have been, or are&nbsp; about to be,&nbsp; declared land of public domain, by virtue of judicial proceedings instituted etc,</i>"</blockquote>The discrepancy between the titles and the bodies of Acts Nos. 4043 and 4195 may be explained.&nbsp;&nbsp; Act No. 4043 was originally House Bill No.&nbsp; 949 (First Session, Ninth Philippine Legislature).&nbsp; The&nbsp; said bill as presented referred in both its title and body solely to the rendition&nbsp; of judicial decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first paragraph of the explanatory note prepared by the authors of the bill reads:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; attached bill is&nbsp; practically the same as Act&nbsp; No. 3672 approved by the Eighth Legislature with&nbsp; the exception that it authorizes the filing of claims to lots that have been declared public land <i>by virtue of judicial decisions rendered during&nbsp; the last&nbsp; ten&nbsp; years</i>,&nbsp; whereas by Act&nbsp; 3672 no such claims may be authorized if the judicial proceedings were instituted more&nbsp; than ten&nbsp; years ago."</blockquote>It is obvious that the intention of the framers of House Bill No. 949 was to alter the language and the meaning of the previous&nbsp; Acts of the Legislature on the same subject. The Legislature, however, thought it proper not to make such alteration and as finally approved, Act No. 4043 adopts the language used in&nbsp; Acts Nos.&nbsp; 3059 and 3672 and refers to the&nbsp; institution of&nbsp; judicial proceedings instead of the rendition of judicial decision as proposed by the authors of the bill.&nbsp;&nbsp; In enacting the bill into law, however, the corresponding change in&nbsp; the title was not made.&nbsp; It is pertinent to observe in this connection that the title of Act No. 4043, herein before quoted, is a <i>verbatim</i>&nbsp; copy of the title of House Bill No. 949.&nbsp; When Act No. 4195 was passed, the title of Act No. 4043 was almost&nbsp; literally retained. <br><br>The fact that in all the four Acts so far passed by the Philippine Legislature&nbsp; on the subject there has been a repeated and consistent reference to the institution of judicial proceedings has the starting point in the computation of the period of ten years (or&nbsp; fifteen years&nbsp; as&nbsp; regards Act No. 4195) therein laid down&nbsp; is, in our opinion, significant.&nbsp; It shows beyond question the desire of the Legislature to adhere to the one and only method of computation consistently followed by it since the beginning. Whether the statute is in this respect wise&nbsp; and expedient is not for us to determine (U. S. vs. Ten Yu&nbsp; [1912], 24 Phil., 1,&nbsp; 10;&nbsp; U. S. vs. Estapia [1917], 37 Phil., 17,26; Cruz vs. Youngberg [1931], 56 Phil., 234, 238).&nbsp;&nbsp; Courts must administer the law, not as they "think it ought to be but as they find it and without regard to consequences." (Velasco vs. Lopez [1903], 1 Phil., 720, 723, 724.)<br><br>It will also be observed that the body of Act&nbsp; No. 4043, like those of&nbsp; Acts Nos. 3059, 3672 and 4195, employ the phrase "<i>are about&nbsp; to be</i>, declared land&nbsp; of public domain".&nbsp;&nbsp; This phrase would be&nbsp; meaningless if&nbsp; we construe the Act to refer to the rendition of judicial decisions in cadastral cases. A judicial decision may declare lands to be&nbsp; of the public domain but to say that&nbsp; a decision is about&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare it so would be absurd.&nbsp; The fact that the&nbsp; construction placed upon the statute by the appellants would lead to an absurdity&nbsp; is&nbsp; another argument for rejecting it&nbsp; (<i>In&nbsp; re</i> Allen [1903], 2 Phil., 630, 643; Marin vs. Nacianceno [1911], 19 Phil., 238, 240; Rivera vs. Campbell [1916], 34 Phil., 348, 353; Chartered Bank of&nbsp; India, Australia and&nbsp; China&nbsp; vs. Imperial and&nbsp; National Bank [1921],&nbsp; 48 Phil.,&nbsp; 931, 948; City of Manila vs. Lyric Music House [1930], 62 Phil., 125; 25 R. C. L., 1019).<br><br>The contention&nbsp; of the appellants that the reference made in Executive Proclamation No. 549 to the rendition of judicial&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; as&nbsp; the starting point in the computation of the ten-year period mentioned in Act No. 4043 amounts to a contemporaneous&nbsp; construction placed upon the statute by the Executive Department of the Government and, therefore, is entitled to&nbsp; great weight and respect, is devoid of foundation.&nbsp; All that the proclamation did was to copy the title of the statute&nbsp; to which it referred.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, the intention of the Legislature, as disclosed by a uniform trend of legislation,&nbsp; is&nbsp; clearly expressed in the body of Act No. 4043, and it is our duty to give effect to that intention in the case before us&nbsp; (sec. 288, Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure).<br><br>The more recent Act No. 4195 repeals&nbsp; Act No. 4043. But&nbsp; the provisions of said Act No. 4195 can not be availed of by the claimants and appellants herein, because the cadastral proceedings in question were instituted on June 12, 1919, or more&nbsp; than&nbsp; fifteen years before the approval of that Act.&nbsp; It appearing, however, that the other provisions of the Act have&nbsp; been&nbsp; complied with, that is to say, (1) that at the time of the survey, the claimants were in actual possession of the&nbsp; parcel of land involved, (2) that for some justifiable reason, they were unable to file their claim in. the proper court&nbsp; during the period established by law, (3) that the land&nbsp; has not yet been alienated, reserved, teased, granted, or otherwise provisionally or permanently disposed of by the Government, and (4) that all taxes, interests and penalties thereof have&nbsp; been paid,&nbsp; the claimants&nbsp; and appellants herein may bring the matter to the attention of the proper administrative authorities for&nbsp; such action as they might deem proper and equitable.<br><br>In view of the conclusion reached by us on the principal question raised in the case at bar,&nbsp; we do not&nbsp; deem it&nbsp; necessary to pass upon the other questions&nbsp; raised by counsel for both parties in their briefs.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court is hereby affirmed, with- out costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial,</i> and <i>Diaz, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
