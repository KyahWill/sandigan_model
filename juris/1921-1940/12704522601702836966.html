				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused appeal from the judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of Leyte rendered in the present case, sentencing Antonino Cerdeña to 
ten years and one day <em>prision mayor</em> and Serapion Palcone, Felixberto 
Moreno Aguilar and Agapito de la Peña to six years, ten months and one day 
<em>presidio correccional</em>, all to the accessories of the law, to indemnify 
Melecio Lerin in the sum of P70, to return the brass knuckle Exhibit 6, to 
Perfecto Cifra and to pay the costs.
<p align="justify">The assignments of error on which they base their appeal relate 
principally to questions of fact.</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence of the prosecution shows that the accused, on the 
occasion in question, presented themselves on the boat named <em>Kasilak</em> 
manned by Melecio Lerin and his companions, and representing; themselves as 
agents of authority, armed with revolvers, made a prolonged and detailed search 
without finding anything contraband, while they appropriated a brass knuckle, 
and after threatening Melecio Lerin and his companions the accused Antonino 
Cerdeña finally demanded P100 from him, but obtained only P70, later telling the 
crew that they might leave and that nothing would come of it.</p>
<p align="justify">While they admit having made the search, the accused assert 
that it was done without Antonino Cerdeña who only came to the boat upon being 
called for by his policemen, who sent him a message in view of the finding of 
the brass knuckle called "ring fight" and twenty-six bolos. They deny that 
Antonino Cerdeña had demanded money from the crew or that he received any amount 
whatever. They also declare that they were then provided with a search warrant, 
which they claim is Exhibit 4, and that, according to them, Serapion Palcone 
showed it to Melecio and Generoso Lerin who read it before they made the 
search.</p>
<p align="justify">After carefully examining the evidence, we find it sufficiently 
proven that the accused, in spite of the demand made by Melecio Lerin, did not 
exhibit any search warrant to the latter or to his companions. It has not been 
sufficiently proven that the document Exhibit 4 was in the accused's possession 
on that occasion.</p>
<p align="justify">It has been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused 
Antonino Cerdeña led the search of the ship in question and afterwards, by means 
of intimidation and taking advantage of his authority, obtained the sum of P70 
from said crew without any justification therefor.</p>
<p align="justify">It not having been proven that there was any conspiracy between 
the accused Cerdeña and the other accused with regard to the robbery, nor 
cooperation on the part of the latter in taking the P70, nor participation in 
the said sum, we cannot hold the accused Agapito de la Peña, Felixberto Moreno 
Aguilar and Serapion Palcone guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the crime of 
robbery in band with which they are charged in the complaint as principals, not 
even as accomplices or accessories after the fact.</p>
<p align="justify">The fact of carrying revolvers and making a search of the boat, 
under orders of their chief, the accused Antonino Cerdeña, looking for possible 
contraband, in themselves alone cannot be considered as participation in the 
robbery of the P70 committed afterwards by their said chief, who, according to 
the evidence in the record, is the only one liable for said crime.</p>
<p align="justify">For these same reasons we do not find it proven by the evidence 
in the record that the robbery was committed in band as defined in article 505 
of the Penal Code.</p>
<p align="justify">We do find present in the case here in question the aggravating 
circumstance of the accused Cerdeña having taken advantage of his office as 
chief of police in perpetrating the robbery, for which reason the proper 
penalty, which is that provided for in article 503, paragraph No. 5 of the Penal 
Code, should be imposed in its maximum degree.</p>
<p align="justify">The accused Agapito de la Peña, Felixberto Moreno Aguilar and 
Serapion Palcone are hereby acquitted with their proportional part of the costs 
<em>de oficio</em> and other favorable pronouncements; and Antonino Cerdeña is 
sentenced to ten years <em>presidio mayor</em>, with the accessories of the law, 
to indemnify Melecio Lerin in the sum of P70, to return the brass knuckle, 
Exhibit 6, to Perfecto Cifra, with one-fourth of the costs in both instances. So 
ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Johns,</em> and <em>Villa-Real, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>OSTRAND, J.:</strong></p> I concur in the conviction of Antonino Cerdeña, but dissent 
from the acquittal of the other appellants.</div>
