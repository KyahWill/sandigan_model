				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Isidoro&nbsp; Sanares y&nbsp; Caerne was&nbsp; charged in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila under the following information:<br><blockquote>"That on or about March 1,1927, the said accused having been granted by His&nbsp; Excellency,&nbsp; the Governor-General, a conditional&nbsp; pardon&nbsp; remitting&nbsp; the un-executed&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the sentence&nbsp; of imprisonment of six years&nbsp;&nbsp; and one day imposed upon him in criminal&nbsp; case No. 4508 of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cavite, for the&nbsp; crime of theft, which he began&nbsp; to serve on July 9,&nbsp; 1924, and having been released&nbsp; from Bilibid Prison on March 1, 1927, upon accepting the condition&nbsp; of such pardon, to&nbsp; with that he shall not again violate any of the penal laws of the Philippine Islands; on or about February 5, 1935,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the City of Manila, Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; the said accused&nbsp; willfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and feloniously violated the condition of such pardon by then and there committing the&nbsp; crime of <i>estafa</i> for&nbsp; which he was finally sentenced to suffer three months and eleven days of imprisonment, and to pay P50 indemnity, imposed upon him by the municipal court of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City of Manila in criminal case No. H-26727."</blockquote>Upon arraignment,&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; pleaded guilty and the court forthwith ordered&nbsp; his re-commitment for the unexpired portion of his former sentence.&nbsp; The accused appealed from this judgment and prays&nbsp; that he be acquitted or that the penalty be reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp; No reason, alleged&nbsp; or&nbsp; extant in the record, appears in support of the first prayer, for the violation of the law is conceded, and the accused has pleaded guilty thereto.&nbsp; As to the&nbsp; modification of the&nbsp; judgment and the reduction of the penalty, we believe that the point is well taken, as the trial court erroneously applied section 4 of Act No. 1524, which has&nbsp; been expressly repealed by the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The&nbsp; record shows that the conditional&nbsp; pardon&nbsp; whose conditions were violated&nbsp; by the accused referred to a penalty of six years and one&nbsp; day of <i>prision</i>, of which two years, five months and twenty-two days&nbsp; had been served by the accused.&nbsp; The penalty remitted by the pardon was, therefore, three years, seven months and eight days.&nbsp; These facts&nbsp; appear in the information the&nbsp; material allegations of which have been admitted by the accused&nbsp; by virtue of his&nbsp; plea of guilty (U.&nbsp; S. vs. Burlado, 42 Phil., 72; U. S. vs. Barba, 29 Phil., 206; People vs. Cabral, G. R. No. 39200 [58 Phil., 930]).<br><br>Article&nbsp; 159 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code provides that "the penalty of <i>prision correctional</i> in its minimum period shall be imposed upon the&nbsp; convict who, having been granted conditional pardon by the&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; Executive,&nbsp; shall violate any of the&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; of such pardon.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if the penalty remitted by the granting of such pardon be higher than six years, the convict shall then suffer the unexpired portion of his original sentence."<br><br>The second part of the article just quoted is inapplicable to the case at bar&nbsp; because the unexpired portion of the penalty remitted by&nbsp; reason of the conditional pardon grant- ed the accused does not&nbsp; exceed six years.&nbsp; The first part thereof, which imposes the penalty of <i>prision correctional</i> in its minimum period upon the convict who, having been granted conditional pardon,&nbsp; shall violate any of&nbsp; its conditions, is, therefore, applicable.&nbsp; The duration of this penalty is&nbsp; from&nbsp; six&nbsp; months and one day to two years and four months.&nbsp; Inasmuch as&nbsp; the mitigating&nbsp; circumstance of having pleaded&nbsp; guilty should&nbsp; be considered in&nbsp; favor of the accused, and there being no aggravating&nbsp; circumstance, the penalty&nbsp; should be imposed in its minimum period which ranges&nbsp; from six months and one day to one year, one&nbsp; month and ten days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>.&nbsp; The benefits afforded&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Indeterminate Sentence Law are not applicable to the accused, by express provision&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>Wherefore, modifying&nbsp; the appealed judgment, we are of the opinion that we should, as we hereby sentence the appellant to eight months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>, with costs.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Abad Santos, Hull</i>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Vickers, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
