  </div><p>April
2, 1924, the defendants, as heirs of Francisca de Vera, deceased, filed
the following verified petition in the Court of First Instance of
Bulacan:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Come now the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez and, through their undersigned attorney, respectfully show:</p>
    <p>"1.
That by an order dated October 5, 1923, this Honorable Court approved
the report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims whereby, among
other things, the claim of Tomas C. Reyes against the intestate estate
of Francisca de Vera is admitted for the total sum of P8,901.78.</p>
    <p>
"2. That thereafter, to wit, on the 19th day of March, 1924, another
order was issued by this Honorable Court stating the manner in which
payment of said claim should be paid. </p>
    <p>"3. That the first
order, as well as the second, abovementioned, was issued without
opposition by any of the parties, in view of the fact that an
understanding existed at least on the part of the heirs lose Gonzalez
and Maria Gonzalez, that the aforesaid claim was true, and not, as it
is, fictitious and fraudulent.</p>
    <p> "4. That it was only last
Thursday, March 27, 1924, that the petitioners discovered the aforesaid
credit to be fraudulent and fictitious, and since then they have
endeavored to find proof confirming the discovery. </p>
    <p>"5.
That from this discovery it appears as a matter of fact that the
alleged claim for P8,901,78 of Tomas C. Reyes against the intestate
estate is completely fictitious and fraudulent, and that the three
documents of credit, appearing in the record, on pages 159, 160 and
161, presented by Tomas C. Reyes as evidence of his claim, are false
and falsified documents, and that they are done only in February, 1922,
that is to say, several months after the death of Francisca de Vera,
and the latter could not, therefore, have taken part in the execution
of said documents.</p>
    <p> "6. That said three documents of
credit, even if they purport to bear the thumbmark of Francisca de
Vera, in fact the thumbmark placed in the three documents is that of a
third person, to wit, her granddaughter, Andrea Geraldez, daughter of
the other heir, Simeona de Mendoza, according to what was discovered by
the petitioners afterwards, as may be seen from the enclosed documents
which are made a part of this petition.</p>
    <p> "7. That
notwithstanding the fact that they have endeavored to find evidence
against the claim presented by Tomas C. Reyes, which claim has already
aroused suspicion, in view of the fact that the deceased Francisca de
Vera, on account of her manner of her living and her saving habit, was
unable to spend P8,000 in so short a time, this discovery could not
have been made by the petitioners before this time, and it happened
only on account of the disclosure made by an eyewitness to the deceit,
who cannot permit that the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez be
unjustly deprived of a great portion of their inheritance. </p>
    <p>"8.
That if the orders of this Honorable Court dated October 5, 1923, and
March 19, 1924, above-mentioned, are complied with, Tomas C. Reyes and
his associates would be satisfied to see the success of their
fraudulent machination. </p>
    <p>"9. That in the interest of
justice and equity, the two orders referred to should be set aside, and
the petitioners Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez permitted to impugn
the claim of Tomas C. Reyes, to oppose the same and appeal from the
report of the commissioners on appraisal and claims, and go through all
other legal proceedings, to test the claim of Tomas C. Reyes, and the
judicial administrator be ordered to appeal from the decision of the
commissioners on appraisal and claims.</p>
    <p> "10. That 25 days
have elapsed since the report of the commissioners on appraisal and
claims was presented, and neither the judicial administrator nor the
petitioners herein can now appeal in accordance with section 775 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, in relation with sections 773, 774, 776 and
777 of the same Code. </p>
    <p>"11. That six months have not yet
expired since the issuance of the order of this Honorable Court dated
October 5, 1923, approving the report of the commissioners on appraisal
and claims. </p>
    <p>"12. That in presenting this petition, the
petitioners invoke the provisions of section 113 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, which are applicable to the instant case. * * *</p>
    <p>"For
all of the foregoing, it is respectfully prayed that the orders dated
October 5, 1923, approving the report of the commissioners on appraisal
and claims, and March 19, 1924, be set aside; that the judicial
administrator be ordered to appeal from said report of the
commissioners on appraisal and claims, insofar as it refers to the
alleged claim of Tomas C. Reyes; that the petitioners be permitted to
appeal from the same report, and that, for the time being, all
proceeding in this intestate estate, having reference to the payment of
the said claim, be suspended, on the ground of being fraudulent."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Based upon the petition the court made the following order:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Considering
the petition dated April 2, 1924, presented by counsel for the heirs
Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez, to set aside the orders dated October
5, 1923, and March 19, 1924, rendered in this case, whereby the report
of the commissioners on appraisal and claims is approved and the claim
of Tomas C. Reyes is admitted against this estate, and that the
judicial administrator be ordered to appeal from the report of the
commissioners insofar as it refers to the aforesaid claim of Tomas C.
Reyes and that the heirs be permitted to appeal from the report
referred to, suspending in the meantime all proceeding in this case
relative to the payment of said claim, for being fraudulent. It
appearing from, the sworn allegations stated in the aforesaid petition
of the heirs Jose Gonzalez and Maria Gonzalez that if they did not
object to the claim of Tomas C. Reyes or oppose to the approval of the
report of the commissioners on appraisal, it was because they did not
know that it was fraudulent, nor could they have discovered until the
present time, notwithstanding the efforts they displayed, that said
claim was and is fraudulent; and finding that the instant case is
within those specified by section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
and that, therefore, sufficient grounds exist to allow what is prayed
for;</p>
    <p>"The orders mentioned dated October 5, 1923, and March
19, 1924, are hereby set aside, insofar as they approved the report of
the commissioners on appraisal and admitted the claim of Tomas C. Reyes
against the estate; and the administrator and the heirs Jose Gonzalez
and Maria Gonzalez are authorized to appeal from said report to this
court."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The plaintiff appeals, assigning the following errors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The trial court erred in setting aside the order of October 5, 1923.</p>
    <p>"The trial court erred in setting aside the order of March 19, 1924.</p>
    <p>"The trial court erred in authorizing the appeal from the report of the committee on claims."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    <strong>JOHNS, J.: </strong></p>
  <p>There
is no dispute about any material fact. The only question presented is
whether the petition of the heirs states facts sufficient to entitle
them to relief from the order of the court of October 5, 1923,
approving the claim in question.</p>
  <p> It is conceded that the
time has expired for an appeal under sections 773, 774, 775, 776 and
777 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is contended that the facts
alleged bring the case under section 113 of that Code of Civil
Procedure, as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<em>Relief from Effect of Judgments and Orders</em>.â€”Upon
such terms as may be just the court may relieve a party or his legal
representative from a judgment, order, or other proceeding taken
against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect:<em> Provided</em>, That application therefor be made within a
reasonable time, but in no case exceeding six months after such
judgment, order, or proceeding was taken."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    This section was construed by this court in<em> Re </em>Estate of Johnson (39 Phil., 156), in which, on page 164, the opinion says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The
use of the word 'judgment, order or other proceeding' in this section
indicates an intention on the part of the Legislature to give a wide
latitude to the remedy here provided, and in our opinion its operation
is not to be restricted to judgments or orders entered in ordinary
contentious litigation where a plaintiff impleads a defendant and
brings him into court by personal service of process. In other words
the utility of the provision is not limited to actions proper but
extends to all sorts of judicial proceedings."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The facts alleged are clearly sufficient to entitle the heirs to relief
under that section. The petition shows upon its face that the heirs
acted in good faith. That in truth and in fact at the time the claim
was allowed, they thought and believed that it was a just claim, and,
for such reason, did not oppose its allowance. When it later developed
that the claim was false, fraudulent and fictitious, they immediately
filed the petition here in question, which was done a little less than
five months after the claim was allowed.</p>
  <p> The action of the
trial court in setting aside its order of October 5, 1923, is fully
sustained by the facts alleged in the petition.</p>
  <p>    In Gotamco <i>vs.</i> Chan Seng and Razon (46 Phil., 542), this court held:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"3.
WHEN CLAIM ALLOWED BY PROBATE COMMISSIONERS MAY BE ATTACKED IN ORIGINAL
PROCEEDING.â€”In such a case the allowance of an alleged claim by the
probate commissioners acting without jurisdiction is not conclusive
under sections 773, 774 and 775 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and
such allowance of a claim may be attacked for want of jurisdiction,
fraud, or mistake in an original proceeding commenced within a
reasonable time after the time for appeal has expired."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
For the purpose of this opinion, this court must assume that the facts
alleged in the petition are true. Assuming them to be true, the
petition states facts sufficient to entitle the heirs to relief even
upon the ground of fraud.</p>
  <p> The order of the lower court,
setting aside its order of October 5, is sustained, and the case is
remanded, with leave to the plaintiff to file an answer to the
petition, and to have the case tried by the court on its merits. The
appellees to have and recover costs on this appeal. So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand</i>, and <i>Romualdez, JJ</i>., concur. </p>
