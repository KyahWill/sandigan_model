				<H3>CONSULTA NO. 441 DE LOS ABOGADOS DE SMITH, BELL & CO., LTD., BLOCK, JOHNSTON & GREENBAUM, APPELLANTS, VS. THE REGISTER OF DEEDS OF LEYTE, APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JOHNS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For a&nbsp; purported consideration of P78,000,&nbsp; Teofilo Mejia and Casilda Martinez de&nbsp; Mejia signed a deed of sale to and in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cristina Martinez&nbsp; for four parcels of land in&nbsp; Ormoc, Leyte, and&nbsp; certain&nbsp; personal&nbsp; property.&nbsp; April 26, 1921, the deed&nbsp; was&nbsp; presented for registration under Act No. 2837 to&nbsp; the registrar&nbsp; of deeds of&nbsp; the Province of Leyte, and owing to&nbsp; certain defects in it, registration was refused.&nbsp; June&nbsp; 7, 1921, Teofilo Mejia made an amendatory affidavit, and on July 28, 1921, Casilda Martinez de&nbsp; Mejia ratified under oath the deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale and&nbsp; the amendatory affidavit of her husband.&nbsp; On August 12, 1921, the property was&nbsp; then registered as&nbsp; inscription&nbsp; No. 57 in the register&nbsp; of&nbsp; lands not registered under&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 496. Thereafter&nbsp; Smith,&nbsp; Bell&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Co.&nbsp;&nbsp; commenced an&nbsp;&nbsp; action, known as civil case No. 4030, in the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Cebu against Teofilo Mejia and&nbsp; Casilda Martinez de Mejia, defendants, and grantors in the deed, to&nbsp; recover the sum of P14,000, in&nbsp; which a writ&nbsp; of attachment&nbsp; was issued, and on April 18, 1923, it was levied upon the four parcels of land described in the&nbsp; deed to Cristina Martinez. A record of&nbsp; this&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of attachment&nbsp; appears under paragraph 16 of inscription No. 57 of the deed to Cristina Martinez.&nbsp; In the ordinary&nbsp; course of&nbsp; business,&nbsp; judgment was rendered against the defendants,&nbsp; and an order of sale of the four&nbsp; parcels of land, and execution was issued, and on February 15, 1924, the fourth parcel of land described in the deed was levied upon by the sheriff to&nbsp; satisfy the judgment, and that fact was also noted under paragraph 16 of inscription No. 57 of the deed.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the&nbsp; levy was made and the property advertised for Sale,&nbsp; Cristina&nbsp; Martinez, the vendee in the deed, entered a <span style="font-style: italic;">terceria&nbsp; </span>with the sheriff, claiming that the property advertised for sale was her sole property.&nbsp; The sheriff required Smith, Bell &amp; Co. to give him an indemnity bond in the sum of P150,000 as a condition precedent to the making of the sale.&nbsp; The&nbsp; bond was furnished, and the property&nbsp; sold, and in due course, the sheriff executed and presented&nbsp; a&nbsp; certificate of sale to the registrar for inscription, which was duly inscribed in the registry under inscription No. 57&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"The fourth parcel described in this inscription, together with&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; was&nbsp; sold&nbsp; at public auction by the sheriff of Leyte, by order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; (civil case&nbsp; No. 4030),&nbsp; for the amount of P20,000 in favor&nbsp; of Smith, Bell &amp; Co.,&nbsp; Ltd., as the best bidder, this property being subject to repurchase by the judgment debtor in the said case within the period of one year from May 21st of this year.&nbsp; All the aforementioned is contained in the certificate of sale dated&nbsp; May 21,&nbsp; 1924,&nbsp; issued by the sheriff of Leyte and presented to this&nbsp; registry at 7.30 a.&nbsp; m.&nbsp; of&nbsp; May 29, 1924.â€”Tacloban, June 5, 1924."<br></blockquote>Observing that this annotation was not signed&nbsp; by the registrar, and that&nbsp; the certificate of sale was not endorsed on its&nbsp; margin, the&nbsp; attorneys for&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff in&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ called&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; registrar of&nbsp; deeds,&nbsp; who then&nbsp; added in parenthesis, following the inscription,&nbsp; the words "no vale." In May,&nbsp; 1925,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; to the plaintiff his original certificate of sale endorsed as follows:<br><blockquote>"The foregoing sheriff's certificate&nbsp; of sale having&nbsp; been presented at 7.30 a. m.&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1924, its inscription is denied for the reason that the&nbsp; property, with all the improvements described in the said certificate, is registered in the name of a person other than any of the judgment debtors, Teofilo Mejia and Casilda Martinez de Mejia (<span style="font-style: italic;">see </span>the fourth parcel in the inscription No. 57, pp. 57 to&nbsp; 59, of book 1, of inscriptions under Act No. 2837).&nbsp; Tacloban, Leyte, May 7,&nbsp; 1925."<br></blockquote>A letter setting out the foregoing&nbsp; facts was then addressed&nbsp; to the Chief of the General Land Registration Office, who in turn submitted&nbsp; it to the Judge of the Fourth Branch&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila, who held,&nbsp; first, that after the filing of the affidavits, there was no error in registering the original deed, and, second, that the registrar had the legal right to refuse to inscribe the sheriff's certificate&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; for property&nbsp; sold at public auction which was not registered in the name of the judgment debtor, but in&nbsp; the name of a third party, and, third, refused&nbsp; to order&nbsp; registration of the deed to&nbsp; plaintiff in the writ, which was executed by the sheriff under sections 429 and 466 of Act No. 190.&nbsp; From this ruling, the plaintiff appeals, assigning the following errors:<br><blockquote>"The court erred:<br><br>"1. In finding that defects in an original&nbsp; conveyance presented for registration under Act No. 2837, (amending Act No. 2711, sec. 194), can be cured by affidavit&nbsp; alone.<br><br>"2. In holding that a registrar of deeds may refuse to register a sheriff's deed of&nbsp; sale, on the ground that the property sold stands inscribed in the registry book&nbsp; for unregistered real estate in the name of some person other than the judgment debtor.<br><br>"3. In failing to order the registrar of&nbsp; deeds of Leyte (1) to annul inscription No.&nbsp; 57&nbsp; in his register under Act No. 2837; or (if the inscription be held valid) (2) to require the said registrar to&nbsp; record the sheriff's certificate of sale."<br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">JOHNS, J.:</span><br><br>Upon the facts, we are clearly of the opinion that there is no merit in&nbsp; the first&nbsp; assignment of error.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the Attorney-General points out, there was no material defect in the conveyance itself, because the instrument was regular on its face, valid in substance, and had all of the requirements provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; in section 127 of&nbsp; Act No. 496, as amended.&nbsp; Nothing was&nbsp; conveyed by the affidavits which were simply furnished for the purpose&nbsp; of conforming to the requirements of the entries to be made in the registry book.<br><br>As to the second assignment of error, it will be noted that, although the deed of sale was&nbsp; duly registered on August 12, 1921, that on April 18, 1923, the land therein described was attached as the property of the grantors in the deed.&nbsp; That later judgment was obtained in the attachment proceedings, execution was issued, and that the fourth parcel of land described in the deed&nbsp; was advertised for sale when the grantees&nbsp; notified&nbsp; the sheriff that it&nbsp; was their sole&nbsp; and exclusive property.&nbsp; The&nbsp; sheriff then demanded the indemnity bond from the plaintiff in the writ, which was furnished, and the fourth&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; was then sold by the sheriff to&nbsp; Smith,&nbsp; Bell &amp;&nbsp; Co. as&nbsp; purchaser for the sum of P20,000.&nbsp; Later, a certificate of&nbsp; sale was&nbsp; issued and the sale confirmed, and the sheriff's&nbsp; deed was&nbsp; executed.<br><br>Section 429 of the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure provides:<br><br>"Real&nbsp; property, standing upon&nbsp; the records in the name of the defendant or not appearing at all upon the record, shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; attached by&nbsp; filing with the registrar of titles of land, for the province in which the land is situated, a copy of the order of attachment, together&nbsp; with a description of the property attached, and a notice that it is attached,&nbsp; and by leaving a similar&nbsp; copy of&nbsp; the&nbsp; order, description,&nbsp; and notice&nbsp; with an occupant of the property, if there is one.<br><br>"Real property or&nbsp; an interest therein, belonging to the defendant and held by any other person, or standing on the records in the name of any other person,&nbsp; shall be attached by filing with the registrar of land titles in&nbsp; the province in which the land is situated, a copy of the order of attachment, together with a description of the property, and a notice that such real property and any interest of the defendant therein, held by or standing in the name&nbsp; of such other person (naming him)&nbsp; are attached; and by leaving with&nbsp; the&nbsp; occupant,&nbsp; if any,&nbsp; and with such other&nbsp; person, or his agent, if known and within the province, a&nbsp; copy of the order, description, and&nbsp; notice.&nbsp; The&nbsp; registrar&nbsp; must index attachments filed under the first paragraph of this section, in the names, both of the plaintiff&nbsp; and of the defendant, and must index attachments filed under the second paragraph of this section, in the names of the plaintiff and of the defendant and of the person by whom the property is held or in whose name it stands on the records."<br><br>It was under the second paragraph of this section&nbsp; that the property was attached as the property of the grantors in the deed, and the attachment indexed by the registrar as therein provided.&nbsp; That&nbsp; portion of&nbsp; the section&nbsp; deals with real&nbsp; property or an interest therein belonging to the defendants in the&nbsp; attachment suit, which may be held by any other person, or which&nbsp; stands&nbsp; on the record in the name of any other&nbsp; person, and section 450&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>"All goods,&nbsp; chattels, moneys,&nbsp; and other&nbsp; property, both real and personal,&nbsp; or any&nbsp; interest therein of the judgment debtor, not exempt by law, and&nbsp; all property and rights of property seized and held&nbsp; under&nbsp; attachment in the action, shall be liable to execution.&nbsp; Shares and interests in any corporation or company, and debts,&nbsp; credits and all other property, both real and personal, or&nbsp; any interest in either real&nbsp; or personal property, and all other&nbsp; property,&nbsp; not capable of manual delivery, may be attached on execution, in like manner as upon writs of attachment."<br></blockquote>And section 463 provides:<br><blockquote>"Upon a sale&nbsp; of real property, the purchaser shall be substituted to, and acquire all the right, interest, title, and claim of the judgment debtor thereto, subject to the right of redemption&nbsp; as&nbsp; hereinafter provided.&nbsp; The officer must give to the purchaser a certificate of sale containing:<br><br>"1. A particular description of the real property sold;<br>"2. The price paid for each distinct lot or parcel;<br>"3. The whole price by him paid;<br>"4. The date when the right of redemption expires.<br><br>"When the judgment under which the sale has been made is made payable in a specified kind of money or currency, the certificate must&nbsp; also show the kind&nbsp; of money or currency in which such&nbsp; redemption must be made, which must be the same as that specified in the judgment.&nbsp; A duplicate of such certificate must be filed by the officer in the office of the registrar of land titles of the province."<br></blockquote>Under section 465, if&nbsp; the judgment debtor redeems, he is entitled to a certificate of redemption, which must be filed with the registrar of deeds, but if the property&nbsp; is not redeemed, the sheriff's deed of the property sold must also be registered,&nbsp; for, under the provisions of section&nbsp; 1 of Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2837, if&nbsp; not registered, it would only be valid as between&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; and&nbsp; hence in&nbsp; the instant case, it would not be of any value to the purchaser at the&nbsp; sheriff's sale.<br><br>Section 466 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>"If no redemption be&nbsp; made within&nbsp; twelve months after the sale, the purchaser,&nbsp; or his&nbsp; assignee, is entitled to a conveyance; or, if so redeemed,&nbsp; whenever sixty days have elapsed and&nbsp; no other redemption has&nbsp; been made, notice thereof given,&nbsp; and the time&nbsp; for redemption has&nbsp; expired, the last redemptioner, or his assignee, is entitled to a deed from the officer, but in all cases the judgment debtor shall have the entire period of twelve months from&nbsp; the date of the sale&nbsp; to redeem&nbsp; the&nbsp; property.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the judgment debtor redeem, he must&nbsp; make the same payments as are required to effect a redemption by a redemptioner.&nbsp; If the debtor redeem, the effect of the sale is terminated and he is restored to his estate.&nbsp; Upon a redemption by the debtor, the person to whom the payment&nbsp; is made must execute and deliver to him a certificate of redemption acknowledged or approved&nbsp; before an officer&nbsp; authorized to take acknowledgment of conveyances of real property.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such certificate must be filed and recorded in the office of the registrar of land titles of the province in which the property is situated, and&nbsp; the registrar&nbsp; must note the record&nbsp; thereof on&nbsp; the margin of the record of the certificate of sale.&nbsp; The payments mentioned in this section and the preceding one may be made to the purchaser or redemptioner, or for him to the officer who made the sale.&nbsp; When the judgment under which the sale has been made is payable in a specified kind of money or currency, payments must be made in the same kind of money or currency."<br></blockquote>Of course,&nbsp; if at the time the attachment was levied&nbsp; the grantors in the deed,&nbsp; the defendants in the&nbsp; attachment proceedings, did not have any right, title or interest in the property, Smith, Bell &amp; Co. did not acquire any title to the land by the&nbsp; sheriff's deed.&nbsp; But, if it&nbsp; be a fact that at the time the attachment was levied, the grantors&nbsp; in&nbsp; the deed did have an interest in the property at the time&nbsp; the attachment was levied,&nbsp; it follows that Smith,&nbsp; Bell &amp;&nbsp; Co. acquired that interest&nbsp; by and through the sheriff's deed. That is to say, that if at the time the attachment was levied Cristina Martinez&nbsp; was in good faith&nbsp; the real owner of&nbsp; the property, Smith, Bell &amp; Co. did&nbsp; not acquire any title, and Cristina Martinez&nbsp; would be and remain the owner of&nbsp; the property, the same as if it&nbsp; had never been&nbsp; sold at&nbsp; the sheriff's sale.&nbsp; But Smith, Bell &amp; Co., having attached&nbsp; the property as the property of&nbsp; the grantors in&nbsp; the deed at the time the attachment was made, and, following the claim of Cristina Martinez, having executed a good and sufficient bond to indemnify the sheriff in the making&nbsp; of the sale, and having purchased the property at the sale, and having received the&nbsp; sheriff's deed, is entitled to have the result of such proceedings made a matter of official record, so as to preserve and protect any legal rights it may have&nbsp; acquired in the land&nbsp; as a result&nbsp; of such&nbsp; proceedings, and under the provisions of section&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of Act No. 2837, those rights, if any, cannot be protected&nbsp; without the registration of the sheriff's deed.&nbsp; Such registration&nbsp; would not legally mean that Smith, Bell &amp; Co. was the owner of the property described in the sheriff's deed, or any interest therein.&nbsp; It would simply mean&nbsp; that by the sheriff's&nbsp; deed, Smith, Bell &amp; Co. had acquired any right, title or interest&nbsp; which the grantors had in the fourth parcel of land described in the deed&nbsp; at the time the attachment was levied.&nbsp; It might be a cloud on the title&nbsp; of Cristina Martinez, and it might be necessary for her to bring&nbsp; a suit to remove the cloud and to quiet&nbsp; her title.&nbsp; Be that as it may, she would be fully protected from all loss or damage by the indemnity bond which Smith, Bell &amp; Co. gave the sheriff,&nbsp; or after the deed is registered, Smith, Bell &amp; Co. could then maintain a suit to ascertain what rights,&nbsp; if any,&nbsp; it had acquired by&nbsp; the sheriff's&nbsp; deed&nbsp; in and to the fourth parcel of land.<br><br>Although in some matters, the registrar may have some quasi-judicial power, yet a suit&nbsp; to quiet a&nbsp; title or to ascertain and determine an&nbsp; interest in real&nbsp; property is a matter exclusively within&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the courts. The title, if any, which Smith,&nbsp; Bell &amp; Go.&nbsp; has in the fourth parcel of land by the sheriff's deed was acquired by and through&nbsp; a judicial proceeding, and it has a legal right to have&nbsp; that title settled and determined in the courts, and under the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 2837, without a registration of its sheriff's deed, it&nbsp; would in legal effect be&nbsp; deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; that&nbsp; right.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; registering of&nbsp; the sheriff's&nbsp; deed, care&nbsp; should be taken&nbsp; to&nbsp; recite the actual facts, the source and&nbsp; chain of title, so as&nbsp; to protect&nbsp; the rights of Smith, Bell &amp; Co., and it should&nbsp; be done so as not to prejudice, injure or impair any rights&nbsp; which Cristina Martinez may have acquired in the land by&nbsp; her deed, thus leaving the respective rights&nbsp; of&nbsp; each party to&nbsp; be settled and determined upon&nbsp; proper&nbsp; pleadings in&nbsp; a judicial proceeding.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and following&nbsp; this&nbsp; opinion,&nbsp; the writ of mandamus&nbsp; shall issue as prayed for by the petitioner.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; party to&nbsp; recover costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>AvanceÃ±a, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><center><b>CONCURRING:</b></center><br><br><b>ROMUALDEZ, J.,</b><br><br>The rights which might belong to the purchaser Cristina Martinez by reason of the previous&nbsp; registration,&nbsp; having been saved by this decision, and it being understood that while&nbsp; Act No. 2837&nbsp; authorizes the&nbsp; register&nbsp; of deeds to refuse the registration of an instrument when there is one already recorded which&nbsp; is incompatible&nbsp; therewith, yet&nbsp; it provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; any registration under&nbsp; said&nbsp; Act is understood without&nbsp; prejudice to third person&nbsp; having a better right,&nbsp; from which it follows that the&nbsp; subsequent registrations do not destroy nor affect the incompatible previous ones, although there must be taken into account such preference by priority of time as&nbsp; a previous registration may have, I concur in the result.<br></div>
