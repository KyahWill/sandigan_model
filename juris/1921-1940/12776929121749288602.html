				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Pasay
Transportation Co., Inc., prays for the review of the decision of the
Public Service Commission absolving the respondent, Toledo
Transportation Company, Inc., from the complaints filed against the
latter by the petitioner in which the respondent is charged with having
violated the conditions of its certificate of public convenience to the
great detriment of the said petitioner, Pasay Transportation Co., Inc.<p></p>
  <p>
In support of its petition for review the said petitioner assigns the
following errors alleged to have been committed by the Public Service
Commission in its decision:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"1. The Public
Service Commission erred in holding that the restrictions in question
were intended for the protection of the Manila Railroad Company and
that the enforcement of the same had already been abandoned.</p>
    <p>
"2. The Public Service Commission erred in absolving respondent from
the complaint and in not holding that the admitted picking and dropping
of passengers at respondent's station is a violation of its certificate
of public convenience.</p>
    <p> "3. The Public  Service Commission erred in not granting the motion for reconsideration and new trial. "</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Simon Toledo had filed an application for the issuance in his favor of
a certificate of public convenience for the establishment of a land
transportation service of freight and passengers by means of
auto-trucks between the municipality of Malabon, Province of Cavite,
and Manila, passing through the municipalities of Noveleta, Kawit,
Bacoor, and other intermediate points. The Manila Railroad Company
opposed said application. In view of said opposition, the applicant
amended his application by stating that his trucks would not receive
freight or passengers from any point along the line which he proposed
to establish and which was served by the railroad, to any other point
along the same line. This amendment having been made, the oppositor
withdrew its opposition. On August 19, 1920 the Public Service
Commission rendered a decision granting the application of Simon Toledo
and ordering that a certificate of public convenience be issued in his
favor as operator of a land transportation service making irregular
trips under the condition that "the applicant shall not take in said
auto-trucks passengers or freight from any of the points of the
Noveleta-Manila line and vise-versa, which includes the said line of
Malabon (now General Trias) to Manila, with destination to any other
point thereof. " (Exhibit 3.)</p>
  <p> On August 14, 1928 a
certificate of public convenience for the establishment of a land
transportation service in the territory between General Trias and
Manila was granted to Aquilino Angkiko in case No. 13176, subject to
the condition that he would not take or discharge passengers or freight
between Kawit (Cavite) and Manila, Kawit, being the last town after
Noveleta on the way to Manila. On September 19, 1929 the certificate of
public convenience issued in favor of Aquilino Angkiko was transferred
by the latter to Simon Toledo in case No. 2703. On February 6, 1930,
Simon Toledo conveyed the certificate of public convenience which he
had acquired from Aquilino Angkiko to the herein respondent Toledo
Transportation Co., Inc., in case No. 21320.</p>
  <p> In case No.
16113 the irregular trips which had been authorized in the certificate
of public convenience issued in favor of Simon Toledo were made
regular, without eliminating the restriction contained in his aforesaid
original certificate.</p>
  <p> Simon Toledo also transferred to the
herein respondent and appellee, Toledo Transportation Co., Inc., his
certificate of public convenience.</p>
  <p> From its acquisition of
the certificate of Simon Toledo and that of Aquilino Angkiko to the
present, Toledo Transportation Co., Inc., has had a waiting station in
the barrio of Salcedo, municipality of Noveleta, on the Manila-Cavite
line at which it picks up and discharges freight and passengers. This
waiting station has been maintained by the said company long before the
Pasay Transportation Co., Inc., began to operate in the Province of
Cavite.</p>
  <p> The Manila Railroad Company also keeps a waiting
station located at about 100 meters from the intersection of the line
of the company and the main Cavite-Manila line, in the same barrio of
Salcedo, which waiting station is only a few hundred yards from the
waiting station of Toledo Transportation Co., Inc.</p>
  <p> For
sixteen years, Toledo Transportation Co., Inc., has been picking up and
discharging passengers and freight at said waiting station in the
barrio of Salcedo, during which time the Manila Railroad Company has
never filed a complaint or protest against it. Pasay Transportation
Co., Inc., filed this complaint before us only after it has silently
stood by for five years observing the use by the Toledo Transportation
Co., Inc., of the aforesaid waiting station.</p>
  <p> The foregoing
evidence shows that the imposition of the restriction in the
certificate of public convenience issued in favor of Simon Toledo was
due to the opposition of the Manila Railroad Company which said Simon
Toledo doubtless believed to be reasonable because he immediately
amended his application and the Manila Railroad Company withdrew its
opposition. At that time the petitioner Pasay Transportation Co., Inc.,
still had no land transportation service in Cavite which might compete
with that which Simon Toledo wanted to establish; consequently, it can
not be said that said restriction was also made in its favor. The
Manila Railroad Company for whose benefit the said restriction was
imposed, has never complained against the respondent Toledo
Transportation Co., Inc., for taking freight and passengers in its
waiting station in the barrio of Salcedo, municipality of Noveleta.
Although the toleration by a land transportation company of the
violation of a condition beneficial to it does not justify said
violation, nevertheless, there having been no complaint on the part of
the company thus benefited by such restriction, thereby giving the
impression that it is not prejudiced by said violation, the Public
Service Commission acted justifiably and equitably in absolving, as it
did, the offender from the complaint made by another land
transportation company for whose benefit the condition violated was not
made.</p>
  <p> Furthermore, the Toledo Transportation Co., Inc., had
also acquired the certificate of public utility and convenience issued
in favor of Aquilino Angkiko, which certificate does not contain any
restriction on the loading and unloading of passengers and freight from
Noveleta to Manila and vice-versa, the restriction imposed upon him
being confined to the Kawit-Manila line and vice-versa. As Kawit
follows Noveleta on the way to Manila, the Toledo Transportation Co.,
Inc., which has acquired the certificate of Aquilino Angkiko and with
it the rights of the latter as a common carrier, has not violated the
conditions of said certificate in picking up and discharging freight
and passengers in its waiting station in the barrio of Salcedo,
municipality of Noveleta, Province of Cavite.</p>
  <p> The decision
of the Public Service Commission sought to be reviewed, being in
accordance with the evidence, equity and justice, the same is hereby
affirmed in all its parts, with costs against the petitioner. So
ordered.</p>
