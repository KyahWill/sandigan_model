				<H3>ESTATE OF THE DECEASED PAULA RIVERA. MARCELINA REYES, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. PEDRO RIVERA, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This proceeding was initiated in the Court of First Instance of the Province 
of Rizal by Marcelina Reyes, for the purpose of obtaining probate of a paper 
writing (Exhibit 1), dated May 11, 1927, purporting to be the last will and 
testament of Paula Rivera, a former octogenarian resident of Malabon, Rizal, who 
died, without forced heirs, on September 10, 1927. One Pedro Rivera appeared as 
opponent, alleging that another document (Exhibit B), bearing date of August 23, 
1927, was the true last will and testament of the same decedent, and asking in 
turn that this instrument should be probated instead of that presented by 
Marcelina Reyes. Upon hearing the cause the trial court declared Exhibit 1 to be 
the last will and testament of Paula Rivera and accordingly ordered that it be 
admitted to probate. From this order the opponent, Pedro Rivera, appealed.</p>
<p>The appellant does not dispute that the Exhibit 1, presented by Marcelina 
Reyes, was duly executed as the will of Paula Rivera on the day that it bears 
date; but the contention is that this will was superseded by the purported will 
of later date (Exhibit B). The trial court reached the conclusion that the 
last-named document is a forgery; and a careful review of the proof, both oral 
and documentary, indicates the correctness of this conclusion.</p>
<p>Several converging lines of proof point in this direction, in the first 
place, the genuine will (Exhibit 1) recognizes as chief beneficiary the 
proponent Marcelina Reyes, a grandniece of the deceased, who had been brought up 
by the latter and had lived with her for a large part of their common life; 
while the Exhibit B divides the property of the decedent among relatives in whom 
she had long ceased to take particular interest. In the second place, the 
testatrix was suffering in her last years from tuberculosis and had developed 
symptoms of edema, with the resulting swelling of her hands, which made it 
difficult in her last months for her to write at all. The signatures of the 
testatrix, admittedly genuine, to the document Exhibit 1 are scarcely legible; 
while the questioned signatures to the Exhibit B, though purporting to be made 
about three months later, are much more legible and better executed, 
notwithstanding the fact that the progress of disease and an attendant infection 
of the fingers of her pen hand were such that, in the opinion of competent 
witnesses, she could not have written those signatures on the date they purport 
to have been written. In the third place, a clear preponderance of the evidence 
shows that when the testatrix was approaching death, she still had in her 
possession the genuine will (Exhibit 1) which she took from under her pillow and 
delivered, first to her cousin Eduardo Rivera, and then to the chief 
beneficiary, Marcelina Reyes, for safekeeping. Finally, an inspection of the 
questioned signatures of the testatrix on Exhibit B indicates, to our mind, that 
the fingers which traced the genuine signatures to Exhibit 1 were different from 
those which wrote the questioned signatures on Exibit B.</p>
<p>In examining the evidence we are led to the conclusion that the witnesses 
Eduardo Rivera, Dr. Lucio Santos, and Arsenio Paez, attesting witnesses to the 
genuine will, have testified with undeniable disinterestedness and truthfulness. 
Moreover, these witnesses are of a type such as the testatrix, with regard to 
her station in life, would have naturally called upon to witness her will; while 
the purported witnesses to the questioned document, namely, Eugenio Wawangco, 
Sotero Ignacio, and Valentin Sioson, are persons of insignificant character with 
whom the deceased was not well acquainted, if she knew them at all; and they are 
not such individuals as she would have used as witnesses to her last will and 
testament. In addition to the points mentioned, numerous other facts serve as 
<span style="font-style: italic;">indicia </span>of the false and surreptitious character of the questioned document 
Exhibit B. In our opinion the trial judge committed no error in admitting the 
Exhibit 1 to probate.</p>
<p>The judgment will therefore be affirmed, and it is so ordered, with costs 
against the appellant.</p>
