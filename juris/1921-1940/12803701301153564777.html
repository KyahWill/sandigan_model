				<H3>THE MUNICIPALITY OF SAN MIGUEL, PROVINCE OP LEYTE, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF LEYTE AND THE MUNICIPALITY OF ALANGALANG, PROVINCE OF LEYTE, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GODDARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Sometime before the year 1909 the municipalities of 
San Miguel and Alangalang of the Province of Leyte were consolidated. In
 1909 the Governor-General by executive order No. 81 ordered the 
separation of these two municipalities. That order provided that the 
municipality of Alangalang should be composed of its actual territory 
less the territory of the former municipality of San Miguel and that the
 municipality of San Miguel should be reestablished with its former 
territory. A dispute arose as to the jurisdiction over four barrios, 
Cabadsan, Lucay, Garang (now Borseth) and Gibucawan. The municipality of
 San Miguel claimed that these barrios were within its former 
jurisdiction and the municipality of Alangalang claimed that they 
belonged to the jurisdiction of that municipality. On November 23, 1914,
 the provincial board of Leyte settled this dispute by adjudicating the 
abovementioned barrios to the municipality of Alangalang by its 
resolution No. 928. This action of the board was taken by virtue of Act 
No. 82, as amended by section 1 of Act No. 344. Neither of these acts 
provided for an appeal from the decision of the provincial board in such
 cases.
</p><p align="justify"> On August 31, 1932, the municipality of San Miguel 
filed this certiorari proceeding against the provincial board of Leyte 
and the municipality of Alangalang before the Court of First Instance of
 that province and prayed:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>"1. Que decrete la expedicion de un mandamiento de <em>certiorari
 </em>ordenando a la Junta Provincial recurrida para que eleve a este 
Juzgado testimonio del expediente del asunto ante dicha Junta en 1914 
por el recurrente contra el municipio recurrido sobre los barrios en 
cuestion, para su revision por este Juzgado.</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "2. Que se ordene al Municipio de Alangalang, 
Leyte, sus funcionarios, agentes y abogados para que pendiente la 
resolution de este juicio se abstengan en absoluto de ejercer 
jurisdiccion sobre dichos barrios.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "3. Que previa la tramitacion correspondiente se 
dicte sentencia declarando nula y sin ningun valor ni efecto la 
resolucion No. 928, serie de 1914, de la Junta Provincial recurrida 
dictada en dicho asunto y prohibiendo al propio tiempo a perpetuidad al 
municipio recurrido a que continuara ejerciendo jurisdiccion sobre los 
referidos1 barrios, con las costas de este juicio a cargo de los 
recurridos."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The provincial fiscal of that province in 
representation of the respondent province and municipality filed a 
demurrer in which fie alleged:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>"1. Que el tribunal no tiene jurisdiccion sobre la materia
 litigiosa;</blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "2. Que los hechos alegados en la demanda no son 
constitutivos de derecho de accion; y</p>
  <p align="justify"> "3. Que el remedio solicitado es improcedente."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The trial court sustained this demurrer and allowed 
the petitioner ten days within which to amend its petition. As the 
petition was not amended within that time, the trial court dismissed 
this case and the municipality of San Miguel appealed from that order.</p>
<p align="justify"> It will be noted that this certiorari proceeding was
 filed before the Court of First Instance of Leyte eighteen years after 
the provincial board of that province adjudicated the barrios in 
question to the municipality of Alangalang. In view of this, it is not 
necessary to go into the merits of this case.</p>
<p align="justify"> Eighteen years after the provincial board of Leyte 
adjudicated the barrios in question to the municipality of Alangalang 
is1 certainly not a reasonable time within which to file an application 
for a writ of certiorari.</p>
<p align="justify"> In the case of Cortes <em><em>vs.</em></em> Court of
 First Instance of Capiz (52 Phil, 214, 215), in which a writ of 
mandamus was applied for nearly two years after the decision in question
 in that case was handed down by the trial court, this court dismissed 
the petition and held:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>"* * * Without deciding what would constitute an 
application within a reasonable time after the refusal of a trial judge 
to sign the bill of exceptions, it is apparent that the delay in 
ordinary cases should not be more than the longest period allowed in the
 lower court for the party to take action, which is thirty days. It isr 
well settled that laches in making an application for the writ of 
mandamus affords sufficient cause for its denial. * * *"</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the case of Po Sun Tun <em>vs.</em> Mapa (59 Phil., 459), this 
court held:</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>"Furthermore, we find that said petitioner had incurred in
 an unreasonable delay by his failure to file this petition sooner and 
to take any step to that effect more than four months from the issuance 
of the latter order and more than eight months from the promulgation of 
the former, without any justifiable cause whatsoever."</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In that case the petition for a writ of certiorari was dismissed.</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>"In the absence of special statutory provisions it is well
 settled that before the court will grant the writ it must appear not 
only that the inferior tribunal has committed some error of law, but 
also that the error has caused substantial harm, and that the petitioner
 has been guilty of no laches in seeking his remedy." (5 R. C. L.f 255.)</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The order of the trial court denying the writ of certiorari is 
affirmed without costs.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Imperial, </em>and <em>Butte,
 JJ.,</em> concur.
