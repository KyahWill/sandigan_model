as appellant rests his case on this legal proposition: There is no
cause of action against the vendor of real property to make him
responsible for warranty in case of eviction unless said vendor is
given notice of the suit for eviction. Although our local jurisprudence
is silent on the subject, we think that counsel is right.
  <p> On
November 6, 1911, Dionisia Solmirano, Lucio Solmirano, and Macario
Solmirano sold to Enrique Jovellano a parcel of land situated in the
municipality of Nagcarlan, Laguna, for P150. The deed of sale contained
the usual covenant against eviction, namely: "That we, Dionisia, Lucio
and Macario Solmirano, the vendors herein, agree, to answer in case, of
eviction and to warrant the property hereby sold." In pursuance of this
agreement, Jovellano entered upon the land.</p>
  <p> On March 4,
1913, one Maxima Dorado instituted action in the justice of the peace
court of Nagcarlan against Jovellano to recover the possession of the
land. Maxima Dorado won her case against Jovellano. Instead of
appealing from the decision, Jovellano presented a new complaint in the
Court of First Instance of Laguna against the same Maxima Dorado to
determine the ownership of the property. Jovellano was defeated again,
and on appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court.
(Jovellanos <i>vs.</i> Dorado, R. G. No. 11881.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>)</p>
  <p>
The present action was initiated by Enrique Jovellano and his wife
Isabel Joyosa against Lucio Solmirano, Macario Solmirano, and Antonia
Lualhati, the daughter of Dionisio Solmirano, to recover from the
defendants the price paid for the land, together with all the expenses
incurred in improving it and in maintaining the two suits. One of the
grounds of the demurrer and one of the allegations of the defense was
that defendants had not been notified as provided by law. The lower
court decided the case in favor of the plaintiffs and against the
defendant Lucio Solmirano who was ordered to pay the plaintiffs the sum
of P462.73, with legal interest.</p>
  <p> As supplemental to the
foregoing statement of the case and the facts, it is only necessary to
add that in none of the above cited cases were the Solmiranos cited to
appear or made parties. However, Dionisia Solmirano was: a witness and
Lucio Solmirano may have been present in; the court at the time of the
trial. The trial judge argued that this was a substantial compliance
with the law.</p>
  <p> Section III of Chapter IV of Title IV of Book
IV of the Civil Code, is given up to the subject of warranty. Article
1475 of the Code provides that eviction exists when by final judgment
based upon a right prior to the sale, the vendee is deprived of the
whole or any part of the thing purchased. The vendors shall be liable
for the eviction even though the contract is silent on the subject.
Then with other articles intervening, come articles 1481 and 1482 here
applicable. They read:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Art. 1481. The
vendor shall be bound to make good the warranty whenever it is proved
that he was given notice, at the instance of the vendee, of the suit
for eviction. In the absence of such notice the vendor shall not be
bound to the warranty.</p>
    <p>"Art. 1482. The defendant vendee,
within the time fixed by the Law of Civil Procedure for answering the
complaint shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the vendor or
vendors within the shortest period possible.</p>
    <p>"This notification shall be made in the manner established in said law for the summoning of defendants.</p>
    <p>"The
time to answer granted to the vendee shall be extended until the
expiration of that granted the vendor or vendors to appear and answer
the complaint, which periods shall be the same as those granted all
defendants by the Law of Civil Procedure, counted from the notification
prescribed by the first paragraph of this article.</p>
    <p>"Should
the persons summoned to defend against the eviction fail to appear at
the proper time and in the proper manner, the period in which to answer
the complaint shall continue with regard to the vendee."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
With all the salient facts and legal provisions before us, it is well
to recall a few controlling points. The purchaser has been forced to
surrender possession of the land to a third person having a paramount
title. The purchaser now relies upon his covenant of warranty. The
purchaser has given the vendor no formal notice of the suits for
eviction. Nevertheless, the purchaser expects to recover from the
seller of the land the purchase price and an additional amount
sufficient to cover his losses.</p>
  <p> Our researches disclose that
the Spanish law on the subject of notice to the vendor in the case of
covenants of warranty, is much more rigorous than the French and Roman
law. By the Code Napoleon, as adapted in the State of Louisiana, the
warranty is lost in the absence of notification to the vendor, provided
that the vendor can prove that he had good grounds of defense which he
had lost in consequence of the vendee's failure to call him. (Delacroix
<i>vs.</i> Cenas' Heirs [1829], 10 Martin [La.], 187; Kelly <i>vs.</i> Wiseman &amp; Hinson [1859], 14 La. Ann., 661; Bonvillain <i>vs.</i> Bodenheimer [1906], 117 La., 794; VI La. Digest Ann., pp. 617 <em>et seq</em>.)
Not so by the Spanish law. That law speaks both affirmatively and
negatively. The buyer who fails to cite his vendor in warranty loses
all recourse against him.</p>
  <p>  The commentator Manresa says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"No
discussion, therefore, should be made here as to whether or not the
vendor had means of defense. All of this counts very little. There is
only one condition to be complied with by the vendee, and that is to
give notice of the complaint. Once this is proven, his right to the
warranty is perfect, and the vendor cannot set up anything against it.
This is the preparation for the exercise of the action for eviction
spoken of by us in the commentary on the preceding article; the
warranty, according to article 1480, cannot be enforced until a final
judgment is rendered, but the action for eviction is prepared, before
that judgment, by causing a notice of the complaint to be given to the
vendor." (<em>Comentarios al Codigo Civil Espa√±ol, Tomo X</em>, p. 212.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The only doubtful point relates to that part of article 1482 of the
Civil Code which refers to the Law of Civil Procedure. But as the
Spanish <em>Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil</em> has disappeared, the
article must be considered as referring to the present Code of Civil
Procedure. (Willard's Notes to the Spanish Civil Code, p. 85.) Section
114 of the Code of Civil Procedure could easily be taken advantage of
to join the vendor as codefendant. The purchaser threatened with
eviction, who wishes to preserve his right of warranty against his
vendor, should call in the vendor to defend the action which has been
instituted against the purchaser.</p>
  <p> We hold articles 1481 and
1482 of the Civil Code as in full force and effect, said articles to be
supplemented by such pertinent sections of the Code of Civil Procedure
as should be invoked in particular cases.</p>
  <p> In accordance with
the prayer of the appellant, the judgment is reversed and the complaint
dismissed without special pronouncement as to costs in either instance.
So ordered.</p>
