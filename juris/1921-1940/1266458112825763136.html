				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ALBINA MONTOYA (ALIAS ALBINA M. RAMOS), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question to be determined in this case, in view of the appeal taken by Albina Montoya (<i>alias</i> Albina M. Ramos), from the judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila, sentencing her to the penalty of one year of <i>prision correccional</i>, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of <strike>P</strike>3,012.50 and to pay the costs of the proceedings, is whether or not said penalty is in accordance with law, taking into consideration her confession of guilt and the value of the articles misappropriated.<p></p><p>The appellant was charged with the crime of <i>estafa</i>, it having been alleged in the information that she defrauded Tasiana R. Doningo of certain garments valued at <strike>P</strike>1,012.50 and that she is a recidivist, having been convicted of other four crimes of <i>estafa</i> prior to the date of her last crime.</p><p>The crime of <i>estafa</i> where the amount of the fraud is over <strike>P</strike>200 but does not exceed <strike>P</strike>6,000, is punished by the Revised Penal Code by <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision correccional</i> in its minimum period, that is, from four months and one day to two years and four months. By offsetting the aggravating circumstance of recidivism alleged in the information, which should be considered established by the admission of the appellant herself (People <i>vs.</i> Siojo, G. R. No. 36835 [57 Phil., 1005]; People <i>vs.</i> Morales, G. R. No. 42925 [61 Phil, 1032]; People <i>vs.</i> Ilanan, G. R. No. 43818 [CA], March 5, 1936), against the mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of her guilt, the penalty that should have been and ought to be imposed upon her must not be less than one year and one day nor more than one year and eight months of <i>prision correccional</i>.&nbsp; The appellant's case is perfectly within the scope of article 315, subsection 3, of the Revised Penal Code, where such penalty is prescribed for the crime committed by her.</p><p>Wherefore, taking into consideration the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law and the rule of compensation established in article 63, subsection 4, of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty that must be imposed upon the appellant is from two months and one day to one year and one day.&nbsp; Consequently, such penalty should be imposed upon the appellant, and so modified, the appealed judgment is affirmed in all other respects, with costs to said appellant. So ordered.</p><p><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Villa-Real, Imperial, Laurel, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Moran, JJ.,</i> concur.</p></div>
