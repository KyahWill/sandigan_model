				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an action concerning the registration of two lots, No. 4 of Record No. 1009, and No. 2 of Record No. 651, said proceedings having been&nbsp; instituted by Potenciano Luno and Policarpo Marquez, respectively,&nbsp; and which are adverse to each other, as to a portion&nbsp; marked in their respective plans and included in said two lots.<br><br>The Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, which tried the case,&nbsp; denies&nbsp; the application in proceeding No.&nbsp; 1009, as to the whole&nbsp; of lot No.&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; and adjudicated lot No. 2 of proceeding No.&nbsp; 651 to&nbsp; Policarpo Marquez and&nbsp; his&nbsp; wife, excluding the portion in question.<br><br>These spouses&nbsp; did not appeal&nbsp; from said judgment, but the heirs of Maximo Luno did, assigning error to the action of the lower court in holding that the possessory information Exhibit D does not include lot No. 4 sought by them to be registered.<br><br>Besides the variance between the description of lot No. 4 in the plan Exhibit&nbsp; A, and that contained in the document&nbsp; Exhibit D, there is the fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence adduced by&nbsp; the appellants in support of&nbsp; their application&nbsp; is insufficient.&nbsp; They have not shown that they&nbsp; were in possession of said&nbsp; lot&nbsp; and were cultivating the same, and admitted that the portion in question&nbsp; was held and&nbsp; being cultivated by Policarpo Marquez.<br><br>The lower court committed no error in denying&nbsp; the application of the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; as to lot No. 4 of this proceeding, for the reason&nbsp; that it had not been proven that the document Exhibit D included said lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even assuming that it did include&nbsp; said lot,&nbsp; and supposing that&nbsp; such an error was committed, it would not&nbsp; affect the&nbsp; result of the case on account of the&nbsp; insufficiency of&nbsp; the evidence of the appellants as to their possession and cultivation.&nbsp; The possessory information alone,&nbsp; without proof of actual, public and adverse possession of the land under claim of title for a sufficient time in accordance with law, is ineffective as a mode of acquiring title under Act No. 496.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed with the costs against&nbsp; the appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avance√±a,&nbsp; C. J., Street,&nbsp; Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</span> and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ., </span>concur.</div>
