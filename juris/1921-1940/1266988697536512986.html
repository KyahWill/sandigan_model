				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On April 10, 1931, Felix Sepagan applied&nbsp; for the confirmation&nbsp; and&nbsp; registration in his name in the registry of deeds, pursuant&nbsp; to the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 496, of his alleged title or right to the two parcels of land situated in the municipalities of Bula and Nabua of&nbsp; the Province of Camarines Sur, described in his application and more particularly in his plans Exhibits A and B, and in the technical description sheet&nbsp; attached thereto.<br><br>After the publication of the notices required by&nbsp; said Act, and&nbsp; also&nbsp; after the issuance of the order of December 15, 1931, declaring in default&nbsp; all those persons who,&nbsp; pretending to have an interest in the lands claimed by Felix Sepagan to belong to him, failed to&nbsp; appear&nbsp; to&nbsp; file&nbsp; their opposition to said application, the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, after due hearing, rendered its decision and judgment on March 10,&nbsp; 1932, decreeing the adjudication and registration of the parcels&nbsp; of land in question in the registry of deeds, in the name of Felix Sepagan.&nbsp; The final decree of registration in the registry was issued by the Chief of the&nbsp; General&nbsp; Land Registration Office on December 23, 1932.<br><br>Two&nbsp; years&nbsp; later,&nbsp; or on August 7, 1934,&nbsp; the applicant asked for the issuance of the corresponding writ of possession in his favor and his petition was granted in the orders of September 10th and 12th of said year.&nbsp; Before the writ authorized by said two orders could be executed, Paulino Dacillo, who claimed&nbsp; to be one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the twenty&nbsp; occupants of one of the parcels of land in question (land in Bula, parcel 1, plan Exhibit A), filed a motion in the lower court on October 22, 1934, praying: (1) That he be not ejected from the portion of the land in Bula where, according to&nbsp; him, his house is built and where he has&nbsp; been exercising acts of possession&nbsp; under claim of ownership continuously for more than twenty-seven years, and (2) that the provincial sheriff be restrained from executing the writ of possession in question to his prejudice.&nbsp; He alleged in his motion that he had not been a&nbsp; party to the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; proceedings instituted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the applicant; that said&nbsp; applicant did not notify him of the filing of his application, notwithstanding the fact that they had met several times, and that for said reasons he was informed of the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; had in this case only a few days before the filing of his motion in question.<br><br>The lower court,&nbsp; after hearing the reasons&nbsp; invoked by Paulino Dacillo and those invoked,&nbsp; in turn, by the applicant, decided&nbsp; to deny the former's&nbsp; motion in&nbsp; an order&nbsp; of November 3,&nbsp; 1934,&nbsp; issued to that&nbsp; effect, which reads&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"There has been filed by Paulino Dacillo a motion praying that the petitioner be not ejected from the&nbsp; parcel of land which is the subject matter of the application for registration,&nbsp; upon a mere&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession issued&nbsp; by this court in favor of the applicant Felix Sepagan,&nbsp; and that the provincial sheriff be restrained&nbsp; from executing said&nbsp; writ of possession against the petitioner.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; in the motion of Paulino&nbsp; Dacillo as well as in the answer of the attorney for the applicant&nbsp; Felix&nbsp; Sepagan to said motion, that the petitioner&nbsp; was in possession of the land sought to be registered long&nbsp; before the filing of the&nbsp; application and long before the issuance&nbsp; of the decree of registration.&nbsp; The record shows that&nbsp; the notices of&nbsp; the hearing of Felix Sepagan's&nbsp; application were posted&nbsp; on the&nbsp; land involved&nbsp; in these proceedings,&nbsp; and if the oppositor was&nbsp; in possession of the land he should have appeared and filed his opposition to said application, if he believed himself to&nbsp; be the owner of all or part of&nbsp; the land.<br><br>"Not having done so,&nbsp; he&nbsp; is estopped from&nbsp; opposing the writ of possession&nbsp; sought by the&nbsp; applicant, and for these reasons the&nbsp; court&nbsp; denies the petitioner's motion and the writ of possession&nbsp; issued by this&nbsp; court remains in force.</blockquote>On December&nbsp; 12, 1934,&nbsp; Paulino&nbsp; Dacillo asked for the reconsideration of the order in question, invoking therefor the&nbsp; doctrine laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; vs. Rosauro&nbsp; (56 Phil., 365).&nbsp;&nbsp; His&nbsp; petition&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied on the 15th&nbsp; of said month and year and,&nbsp; not agreeing&nbsp; to both orders,&nbsp; he appealed therefrom and now contends that the lower court erred: (1)&nbsp; In authorizing&nbsp; the issuance&nbsp; of the writ of possession applied for by the applicant, against him, for the reason that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was never a party to this case; (2) in denying his motion,&nbsp; it being in fact without jurisdiction to order his ejectment from a property&nbsp; which was his, not having been defeated in a lawsuit&nbsp; by the applicant; (3) in depriving&nbsp; him of his property without due process of law, and (4) in&nbsp; denying&nbsp; his motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The parties do&nbsp; not dispute the fact that, before the order of general default and the decision and judgment which it was attempted to carry&nbsp; out by means of the&nbsp; writ of possession in&nbsp; question were rendered, it was proven that all the requisites of the law relative to the publication in the Official&nbsp; Gazette&nbsp; and in the customary public places, particularly on&nbsp; the same parcels of land sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be registered, of the necessary notices&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that Felix Sepagan had filed his&nbsp; application giving&nbsp; rise to this case, were&nbsp; complied with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; the name of Paulino Dacillo is not expressly&nbsp; mentioned in the notices&nbsp; in&nbsp; question, there&nbsp; appears therein the injunction to the whole&nbsp; world for all those who believe themselves entitled or having cause to oppose Sepagan's application, to appear&nbsp; and oppose it,&nbsp; warning them that should they&nbsp; fail to do so on the date and at the hour therein&nbsp; specified, they would be declared&nbsp; in default and would&nbsp; not later&nbsp; be permitted to impugn the&nbsp; application of said Sepagan or&nbsp; any decree that may be issued in said case.<br><br>Knowing the foregoing facts, let us now proceed to consider the question&nbsp; raised by the appellant, which&nbsp; may be summarized as follows: Was the appellant a&nbsp; party&nbsp; to these registration&nbsp; proceedings or&nbsp; not?&nbsp; and&nbsp; if he was,&nbsp; Can he now prevent the&nbsp; carrying out of the writ&nbsp; of possession issued?<br><br>This&nbsp; question is not&nbsp; new because&nbsp; it has already been held over and over again&nbsp; that land registration proceedings are proceedings in rent, not in personam, and therefore it is not necessary to give personal notice&nbsp; to the owners or claimants&nbsp; of the land or lands sought to&nbsp; be&nbsp; registered, to give the courts jurisdiction&nbsp; or authority to pass upon the questions arising from the actions whereby said right is exercised&nbsp; (Roxas vs. Enriquez, 29 Phil., 31;&nbsp; Grey Alba vs. De la Cruz, 17 Phil.,&nbsp; 49).<br><br>In the case of Roxas vs.&nbsp; Enriquez, <i>supra</i>, it was&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"The requirement that personal notice shall&nbsp; be a pre-requisite to the validity of&nbsp; registration&nbsp; would&nbsp; absolutely prohibit the foreclosure of unknown claims, for the reason that personal notice could never be given to 'unknown claimants'.&nbsp; The great difficulty in land titles arises from&nbsp; the existence of&nbsp; possible unknown&nbsp; claimants.&nbsp; Known claimants can be dealt with.&nbsp; They furnish no valid impediment, in fact, to the transfer of titles.&nbsp; Courts have held that in actions <i>in rem</i>,&nbsp; personal notice to&nbsp; owners of a <i>res</i> is not necessary to&nbsp; give the courts jurisdiction to deal with and to dispose of the <i>res</i>.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (29 Phil., 31.)</blockquote>In the&nbsp; case of Grey&nbsp; Alba vs.&nbsp; Be&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz,&nbsp; supra, it appears that although the appellee was not expressly mentioned&nbsp; as one of those who had an interest in the&nbsp; land questioned therein, he was joined as a party to the case by virtue&nbsp; of the general notice or summons to the effect that all those who wished to oppose the application must appear at the trial in order to do so.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court, well informed of said facts, held&nbsp; in said case that the decree issued therein was conclusive against the appellee as well as all the world, considering him necessarily&nbsp; included&nbsp; in the last phrase "all the world",&nbsp; or, using the same&nbsp; language of the notice: all whom it may concern".&nbsp;&nbsp; It was said in said case:<br><blockquote>The proceedings for the registration of land, under Act No. 496, are <i>in&nbsp; rem</i>, and not <i>in&nbsp; personam</i>.&nbsp; A proceeding in rem, dealing&nbsp; with a tangible <i>res</i>, may be instituted and carried to judgment without personal service&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the claimants within the State or notice by name&nbsp; to those out- side of it.&nbsp; Jurisdiction is secured by the power&nbsp; of the court over the <i>res</i>.&nbsp; Such a proceeding would be impossible were this not so, for it would hardly do to make a distinction between the constitutional rights of claimants who were known and those who were not known to the plaintiff, when the proceeding is to bar&nbsp; all."&nbsp;&nbsp; (17&nbsp; Phil., 49.)</blockquote>In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Lopez Castelo vs.&nbsp; Director of&nbsp; Lands (48 Phil., 589),&nbsp; it was&nbsp; held:<br><blockquote>"A land registration proceeding is in the nature&nbsp; of a suit <i>in rem</i>; the decree entered therein operates directly on the land and, in the absence of fraud, is 'conclusive upon and against all persons'&nbsp; (sec.&nbsp; 1, Act No. 496) though&nbsp; they may not have received actual notice of the proceedings."</blockquote>If it is true that the appellant, as affirmed by him in his motions of October 22,&nbsp; 1934, and&nbsp; December&nbsp; 12th of said year, was occupying the land which he claims to have belonged to him for about twenty-seven years, and that he has&nbsp; been actually living&nbsp; there because&nbsp; he built a house thereon,&nbsp; he and his family must&nbsp; have necessarily seen the notices posted thereon, inasmuch as the evidence, particularly the return made by the sheriff appearing on page 20 of the record, shows that the notices in question had really been posted on the land.&nbsp; If he saw them, and yet he refused to take action by appearing, as was required of him, in order to file his&nbsp; objections to the confirmation and&nbsp; registration applied for, he now has no cause to complain against anybody.&nbsp; He is to&nbsp; blame for his carelessness and negligence.<br><br>After&nbsp; the issuance of a decree in conformity&nbsp; with the provisions of Act No. 496, which is in accordance with the Torrens&nbsp; system, and after the lapse of&nbsp; the period of one year fixed by law (sec. 38), to question the validity of said decree in a review proceeding,&nbsp; the title becomes perfect and&nbsp; unimpeachable, because if&nbsp; it were not so,&nbsp; there would be no end to litigations (Reyes and Nadres vs. Borbon and Director of Lands, 50 Phil., 791;&nbsp; Director of Lands vs. Gutierrez David, 50 Phil., 797).&nbsp; The veiled&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of the appellant's motion,&nbsp; which was denied by the&nbsp; lower court in its order from which the appeal now under consideration was taken, is no other than to&nbsp; reopen the case in order to give him a chance to prove that the land claimed by him is really his; that his own house is built thereon, and that the appellee succeeded in registering it in his name fraudulently and behind his back.<br><br>The ruling invoked&nbsp; by the appellant&nbsp; in&nbsp; support of his contention is&nbsp; not applicable to&nbsp; the case&nbsp; at bar because Pedro Manuel,&nbsp; the petitioner in&nbsp; said&nbsp; case of Manuel vs.&nbsp; Rosauro, supra,&nbsp; did not&nbsp; begin&nbsp; to exercise acts&nbsp; of possession over the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question until long after the issuance of the&nbsp; decree of adjudication and registration in favor of Jeronimo de Leon, and&nbsp; the possession of said petitioner&nbsp; thereafter continued&nbsp; uninterruptedly for&nbsp; eleven years.&nbsp; It was only after the lapse of these eleven years that when Pedro de Leon, Jeronimo de Leon's successor in interest, sought&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance of a&nbsp; writ of possession in his favor.&nbsp; From this&nbsp; it naturally follows that Pedro Manuel was really not a party to the&nbsp; registration proceeding wherein the writ of possession was issued because while said proceeding was pending he did not yet have any&nbsp; interest or right in the&nbsp; land in question.&nbsp; This case is different.&nbsp; According to&nbsp; his own allegations,&nbsp; Paulino Dacillo began to possess the land claimed by him many years before this case was instituted by the applicant.&nbsp; Under such circumstances it cannot be denied that he was a party thereto.<br><br>Having arrived at this conclusion, we hold that the errors attributed to the lower court by the appellant are not true and that his appeal is unfounded.<br><br>Wherefore, after overruling the&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; the two&nbsp; orders&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; are&nbsp; hereby affirmed, without prejudice, however, to whatever right he may have arising after the judgment of adjudication had&nbsp; been&nbsp; rendered, with the costs of this instance to the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Recto,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur</div>
