				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to reverse a judgment of the Court of First 
.Instance of the Province of Cebu, finding the appellants, Floro Tumayao, Simeon 
Tumayao, Tomas Canete, and Sergio Cafiete, guilty of the offense of homicide, 
committed upon the person of Mariano Tundag, and sentencing each of them to 
undergo imprisonment for fourteen years, eight months and one day, reclusion 
temporal, with the accessories prescribed by law, and requiring them jointly and 
severally to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P1,000, as 
well as to pay the costs of prosecution.
<p>The appellants in this case, as well as the deceased, were residents of the 
barrio of Canagahan, municipality of Liloan, Cebu. In 1928 one Isidoro Ontong, a 
resident of the same barrio, informally mortgaged a piece of land to Tomas 
Canete, one of the appellants in this case, as security for a loan of P20. It 
was agreed that the land might be redeemed by payment of the loan at the 
expiration of three years. When the time for redemption had about arrived, 
Isidoro Ontong went to the house of Tomas Canete for the purpose of redeeming 
the property. Canete refused to receive the money, asserting that the money 
loaned belonged to his neighbor, Floro Tumayao. Disconcerted by this attitude on 
the part of Canete, Isidoro Ontong proceeded to the house of Mariano Tundag for 
the purpose of obtaining advice from him. Upon being informed of the incident, 
Tundag sent for Tomas Canete and, upon his arrival, inquired the reason why he 
had refused to permit Ontong to redeem the land. Canete became angry and 
threatened Tundag with a beating, at-the same time advising him that he should 
not meddle in the business of other people. The next day, which was December 18, 
1930, Mariano Tundag, accompanied by Floro Tumayao, was proceeding across an 
open field in the direction where Simeon Tumayao, the son of Floro Tumayao, was 
standing. As the two neared the point where Simeon was at work, the latter ran 
to a group of banana trees, picked up a spear (<em>lanza</em>), and, as his 
father and Tundag approached, he raised the spear in a threatening manner as if 
to hurl it at Tundag, at the same time saying: "Now what is it? You pretend to 
be smart, and <em>teniente</em>; that money loaned to Isidoro Ontong belongs to 
us." About the same time Sergio Cafiete and Tomas Caiiete appeared on the scene, 
and Sergio threw a stone at Tundag, hitting him on the left breast. Immediately 
thereafter Floro Tumayao, who was standing somewhat behind Tundag, and 
apparently to his right, struck Tundag on the right arm with a bolo, thereby 
inflicting a serious wound. Tundag thereupon raised a sickle in his left hand 
and advanced upon Simeon Tumayao. The latter, however, retreated, while Tomas 
Cafiete struck Tundag on the left hand with a bolo, inflicting a slight cut and 
causing Tundag to drop the sickle. It is also claimed that Tomas Caiiete gave 
Tundag a second blow on the left leg, but if any such blow was delivered, it 
resulted in no flesh wound. Mariano Tundag fell to the ground, and while he was 
in this position Simeon Tumayao approached and, with his spear, stabbed Tundag 
in the abdomen. The defendants then ran away.</p>
<p>The facts above related are deduced mainly from the testimony of Crestituto 
Tundag, a boy of the age of 10 years, or more, who viewed the scene from a 
nearby point. This boy's testimony shows that he was an intelligent observer and 
alert in taking in the scene that was transacted before him. Victoria Tundag, a 
married woman of the age of 32 years, and a daughter of Tundag, was also an 
eyewitness to the trouble. But she failed to take any note of the presence of 
Sergio and Tomas Caiiete and apparently failed to see the part which Simeon 
Tumayao took in the affair. We have no hesitancy in declaring that the facts, as 
above stated and found by the trial court, correctly state the material 
incidents of the trouble.</p>
<p>Tundag died in a few days from infection and loss of blood. The doctor who 
attended upon him testified that he found three wounds upon the deceased, one 
upon the right arm, another upon the left hand, and another in, the abdomen, but 
the death evidently resulted from the more serious wound on the arm.</p>
<p>The evidence fails to show that there was any conspiracy on the part of the 
four accused to kill the deceased or to do him grave bodily harm. The fact that 
the four had, as they seem to have imagined, a cause of grievance against the 
deceased arising from his intervention in the misunderstanding that had arisen 
between Tomas Canete and Isidoro Ontong over the redemption of a piece of land, 
and that the four were somewhat incensed against Tundag on that account, does 
not prove a conspiracy to take his life or inflict upon him bodily injury. 
Furthermore, the fact that Simeon was not armed with a dangerous weapon when his 
father and Tundag approached him in the field, and that Sergio Canete used no 
weapon, indicates sufficiently that the homicide was probably the result of an 
unexpected encounter. The fatal blow was that given by Floro Tumayao.</p>
<p>Sergio Canete and Tomas Canete, in our opinion, are not guilty of 
participation in the homicide, but are more properly subject to punishment for 
assault and battery. Sergio Canete, it is true; threw a stone at Tundag and 
struck him on the left shoulder, and Tomas Canete intervened for the protection 
of Simeon Tumayao, inflicting the slight wound on Tundag's hand, already 
mentioned. There is no proof that either of these two participated in the 
criminal design of the principal, Floro Tumayao, nor that there had been any 
concert between them with respect to making the unlawful aggression.</p>
<p>As to the part taken by Simeon Tumayao, the same favorable inference cannot 
be drawn, for he was the first person to commit himself to the unlawful assault 
upon Tundag, and after the latter had been struck down he attacked the prostrate 
man with his bolo, inflicting a wound in the abdomen ; and while the wound thus 
inflicted was not of a character that would have resulted in death, it shows an 
intention to cooperate with his father in inflicting injury upon the deceased. 
His position in this matter resembles closely that of Ramon Tamayo in People vs. 
Tamayo (44 Phil., 38, 54), who was declared to be an accomplice because of acts 
done by him after a fatal injury had been inflicted upon the deceased by another 
person. We are of the opinion that in this case also, the appellant Simeon 
Tumayao is responsible as an accomplice.</p>
<p>From what has been said it results that the judgment appealed from must be 
affirmed, in so far as it finds the appellant Floro Tumayao guilty of the 
offense of homicide and sentences him to undergo imprisonment for fourteen 
years, eight months and one day, <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the 
accessories prescribed by law, and requires him to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the amount of P1,000. The judgment must be reversed as to the other 
three appellants: And as to Simeon Tumayao, judgment will be entered declaring 
him guilty of homicide, in the character of accomplice, and requiring him to 
undergo imprisonment for eight years and one day, <em>prision mayor, </em>with 
the accessories prescribed in article 61 of the Penal Code, and imposing upon 
him liability to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P500, it 
being understood that this liability shall be subsidiary to the liability of 
indemnification imposed upon Floro Tumayao. These appellants are further 
sentenced to pay one-fourth of the costs of both instances. Tomas Canete and 
Sergio Canete are adjudged guilty of assault and battery (<em>malos tratos de 
obra</em>) under No. 1 of article 589 of the Penal Code, and are sentenced to 
confinement for five days, arresto, and required to pay each one-fourth the 
costs of both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Villamor, Romualdez,</em> and <em>VillaReal, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Malcolm, Ostrand</em>, and <em>Imperial, JJ.,</em> dissenting in 
part:</p>
<p>The circumstances under which the assault was carried out by the accused, and 
particularly their concerted action, indicate the existence of a conspiracy 
between them, and accordingly we are of the opinion that the judgment should be 
affirmed.</p>
