				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">This is a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; a writ of prohibition filed by Marciano&nbsp; Romasanta et al.,&nbsp; against the Hon. Serviliano Platon, acting Judge of the Court of First Instance of Batangas, Twelfth&nbsp; Judicial&nbsp; District. <br><br>It appears that in case No. 752&nbsp; (G. L. R.&nbsp; O. Record&nbsp; No. 40170) of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Batangas,&nbsp; en</font><font size="4">titled, "Colegio de San Jose, Inc., applicant, vs. Director of Lands, Francisco Lejano et al., oppositors," for the registration&nbsp; of land, judgment was entered by&nbsp; said court&nbsp; on March 2, 1932, couched in the following language:<br></font><blockquote><font size="4">"Wherefore, the court finds that the parcels&nbsp; of land, in contention in this application, belong to the&nbsp; Colegio&nbsp; de San Jose,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; and hereby confirms its&nbsp; title thereto and orders the registration and inscription thereof in the name of the applicant, a corporation sole duly organized in accordance with the laws of the Philippine Islands, with residence in the City of Manila, Philippine Islands.<br><br>"In accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp; between the applicant, Colegio de San Jose, Inc., and the oppositor, Ayala &amp; Co., the applicant is hereby ordered, within thirty (30) days from receipt of copy of this decision, to&nbsp; present .an amended&nbsp; plan segregating&nbsp; from the parcels&nbsp; applied&nbsp; for the portion included in the&nbsp; plan decreed&nbsp; in&nbsp; case No. 4163 of the <i>Hacienda de</i> Calatagan, under the terms of the stipulation between the said parties, and let the corresponding decree issue after the&nbsp; amended plan is approved by this court and the decision has become final."</font></blockquote><font size="4">It is&nbsp; also a matter of record that after the aforesaid judgment had become final, the corresponding decree was issued on April 17, 1934, and thereafter the certificate of title in&nbsp; the name of the applicant corporation "Colegio de San Jose, Inc.," covering the lands adjudicated in its favor; that on November 26,&nbsp; 1934, the herein petitioners filed a petition with the court for the revision of the decree issued in said case, which, after proper proceedings, was denied in the court's order&nbsp; of August 27, 1935; that the herein petitioners appealed from this order and presented the corresponding bill of exceptions, which has not&nbsp; yet been acted upon by the court which tried&nbsp; the registration&nbsp; case; and that on October 10,1935, while petitioners' bill of exceptions was pending approval, the respondent judge entered&nbsp; an order in the registration case&nbsp; announcing that he would issue the corresponding writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the lands the inscription, registration, and title of which had been decreed in favor of the applicant corporation "Colegio de&nbsp; San&nbsp; Jose,&nbsp; Inc.,"&nbsp; unless&nbsp; each&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioners puts up a bond in the sum of P100 within thirty days; and that the order of the respondent judge announcing that he would issue the writ of possession was issued, not by virtue of&nbsp; the order which denied the petition for review, but by virtue of the judgment and decree entered&nbsp; and issued&nbsp; in the registration&nbsp; case.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; appears further that the allegations&nbsp; of paragraphs&nbsp; 9 to 14 of the petition, assuming that they&nbsp; are true, would imply at most errors of judgment in the findings of fact&nbsp; or in the&nbsp; application of the&nbsp; law, and&nbsp; by no means lack of&nbsp; jurisdiction or excess in its&nbsp; exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the petition at&nbsp; hand it is alleged that the respondent judge acted without jurisdiction in announcing that he would issue&nbsp; the writ of possession notwithstanding the presentation of&nbsp; petitioners' bill of&nbsp; exceptions for the purpose&nbsp; of appealing from the order of August 27,1935, which denied their petition to&nbsp; review&nbsp; the decree.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent judge&nbsp; has&nbsp; appeared&nbsp; and&nbsp; answered&nbsp; the petition, denying that he acted without jurisdiction or in excess thereof when&nbsp; he issued&nbsp; the order of October&nbsp; 10, 1935.<br><br>The judgment entered in the registration case in question became final and&nbsp; executory, and&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for review filed by the herein petitioners did not have&nbsp; the effect of setting&nbsp; aside either the aforesaid&nbsp; judgment or the decree issued thereunder, especially in view&nbsp; of the denial of&nbsp; the petition for&nbsp; review by the court which heard the said case. While section 17 of Act No.&nbsp; 496, in its original form, has been repealed by the Administrative Code, section 5 of Act No. 1108 amending the former by including in the power of the Court of Land&nbsp; Registration to compel obedience to its judgments and decrees the issuance of writs of possession, and section&nbsp; 3 of&nbsp; Act No. 1680, which has re-amended by substitution said section&nbsp; 17 of Act No. 496, have&nbsp; not been repealed and are, therefore, in force, on the principle of statutory construction that ''An amendment to a section or statute is&nbsp; not&nbsp; necessarily repealed&nbsp; by a repeal of the section or statute amended."&nbsp;&nbsp; (State vs. Young, 30&nbsp; S. C, 399; 9 S. E., 355, 358; Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction,&nbsp; vol.&nbsp; I, p.&nbsp; 574.)<br><br>Section 10 of Act No.&nbsp; 2347 has conferred upon Courts of First Instance all the jurisdiction and powers possessed by the defunct Court of&nbsp; Land Registration, and has provided, further, that the&nbsp; provisions of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure are applicable to land registration cases&nbsp; in all matters not provided in Act No. 496.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the powers of the Courts of First Instance is&nbsp; "to compel obedience to its judgments,&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *" (section 11, paragraph 3, Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure),&nbsp; and that "Independent of any statutory provision, every court has inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary&nbsp; for&nbsp; the administration&nbsp; of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Shioji vs. Harvey, 43 Phil., 333.)&nbsp; "The party in whose favor judgment is given, may,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; have a writ of execution issued for its&nbsp; enforcement,&nbsp;&nbsp; ?&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Procedure, section 443), and that "If it (the judgment is)&nbsp; be for the delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it must require the governor (now the sheriff), or his deputy, to deliver the possession of the same,&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; to the party entitled thereto" (Code of Civil Procedure, section 444, paragraph 5), which, otherwise stated, means&nbsp; the issuance of a writ of possession.&nbsp; In cases for the registration of land,&nbsp; the judgment adjudicating ownership thereof and decreeing its inscription and&nbsp; title in the name of a person, impliedly carries with it the delivery of possession, if he is deprived thereof, because the right of possession, is inherent&nbsp; in that of ownership.&nbsp; The&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession, therefore, the issuance&nbsp; of which was announced in the respondent&nbsp; judge's order of October&nbsp; 10, 1935, finds sanction both in the existing statutory provisions in this jurisdiction and in the&nbsp; generally&nbsp; accepted principles&nbsp; upon which the administration of justice rests.<br><br>While the provisions of section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure requiring, among other things, that "the filing of a bill&nbsp; of exceptions shall of itself stay&nbsp; execution until the final determination of the action," are applicable to land registration "cases, it is to be noted, however, that the writ of possession oft-referred to will not be issued by the respondent judge for the purpose of executing the order from which the petitioners have appealed&nbsp; by bill of exceptions, but&nbsp; by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment entered&nbsp; and the&nbsp; decree issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid&nbsp; land&nbsp; registration&nbsp; case.&nbsp; The respondent judge,&nbsp; on issuing the writ&nbsp; of possession, will accordingly&nbsp; act neither without&nbsp; jurisdiction nor in excess thereof.<br><br>Wherefore, we must hold, as we do hereby, that the petition be dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by&nbsp; this court be&nbsp; dissolved, with costs to the petitioners.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Abad Santos, Hull,&nbsp; Vickers,</i> and <i>Diaz, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</font></div>
