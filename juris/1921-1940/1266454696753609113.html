				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petition&nbsp; before us&nbsp; is for a writ of mandamus with preliminary injunction, filed by Jose D.&nbsp; Zenarosa against the respondent judge, to require the latter to pass upon a certain motion&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; to&nbsp; have been filed&nbsp; by the petitioner, praying that he be granted the benefits&nbsp; of the Probation Law (Act No. 4221), which took effect on August 7, 1935.<br><br>It appears that in criminal case G.&nbsp; R. No. 42937,1&nbsp; the People of the Philippine Islands vs.&nbsp; Jose D. Zenarosa, et al. (criminal case&nbsp; No. 901 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Camarines Norte), a final judgment was entered sentencing said accused, the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner, for&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; abduction, to an indeterminate penalty of from eight to seventeen years, four months, and one day; that before the petitioner began service of his sentence, he tiled a motion with the respondent judge on January 15, 1936 (Exhibit A-1), asking that the benefits&nbsp; of the Probation Law be extended to&nbsp; him, alleging that he&nbsp; is eighteen years of age&nbsp; and that the crime for which he was sentenced is not one of the exceptions or bar&nbsp; to the&nbsp; application of the&nbsp; provisions of said law; that the resolution of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; denying petitioner's motion is based not only upon respondent's belief that he has no jurisdiction to grant the motion because the provincial board of Camarines&nbsp; Norte,&nbsp; within whose jurisdiction the crime for&nbsp; which petitioner was sentenced&nbsp; was committed, has not provided for the salary of a probation officer in said province, but also upon the fact that, in his judgment,&nbsp; even&nbsp; assuming that he&nbsp; has jurisdiction,&nbsp; the grounds stated in&nbsp; the motion are not&nbsp; sufficient to justify the granting thereof, and that there is no probation officer appointed for the&nbsp; Province of&nbsp; Camarines Norte,&nbsp; and in fact the petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; under arrest because his incidental petition&nbsp; for a writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction to enjoin the respondent from&nbsp; issuing an order for his arrest, was denied in a separate resolution.<br><br>While it is true&nbsp; that the crime of abduction is not one of the exceptions provided in the Probation Law to the application of its provisions, it is no&nbsp; less true that it is discretionary with courts to suspend the execution of a final judgment and to&nbsp; extend or deny the benefits of said law to applicants therefor, inasmuch as sections&nbsp; 1 and 2 thereof use the verb "may" which&nbsp; undoubtedly&nbsp; implies the exercise of discretion.<br><br>Act No. 4221 does not require that the&nbsp; provincial fiscal should be heard before denying a petition&nbsp; for the application of the benefits thereof, but on the contrary, the said law provides&nbsp; that no such petition should be granted without first&nbsp; hearing the fiscal, as is evident *from the last part of section 1 thereof reading, "*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * No&nbsp; person, however, shall be placed on probation until an investigation and report by the probation officer shall have been made to the court&nbsp; of the circumstances of&nbsp; his offense, his&nbsp; criminal record, if any, and his social history and until the provincial fiscal shall have been given an opportunity to be heard. The court shall enter in&nbsp; the minutes&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons for its action/' which&nbsp; means that the purpose of the law is&nbsp; to restrict or&nbsp; avoid the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of abuses by indiscriminately granting&nbsp; probation to&nbsp; guilty persons whether they apply for it or not.<br><br>The respondent in&nbsp; fact resolved the petitioner's motion on the merits in denying the same as he did, exercising thereby a power&nbsp; granted&nbsp; to him by law, according to his sound judgment,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason stated in his resolution, namely, that&nbsp; said motion&nbsp; does not&nbsp; state sufficient grounds justifying the granting to the petitioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the benefits applied for by him. For all the foregoing reasons, we rule that the petition is without merit.<br><br>It is our judgment that we should deny, as we do hereby, the said petition, with costs to the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avancena,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp;&nbsp; Villa-Real,&nbsp; Abad&nbsp; Santos,&nbsp; Imperial, Recto,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.<div align="JUSTIFY"></div></div>
