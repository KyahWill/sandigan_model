				<H3>JOSE V. RAMIREZ  AND ELOISA DE MARCAIDA, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, <I>VS.</I> J. R. REDFERN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case calls for the application of article 1894 of the Civil Code to the facts.<br><br>The plaintiffs are Jose V. Ramirez and his wife, Eloisa de Marcaida. The defendant is J.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; Redfern.&nbsp; Jose V. Ramirez and J. R. Redfern are brothers-in-law.<br><br>The action is brought&nbsp; by the plaintiffs to recover from the defendant the sums of £600, £185, and P875 for alleged advances to the defendant's wife for her support and maintenance.&nbsp; The answer&nbsp; is a general denial.&nbsp; The judgment of the trial court absolves the defendant from the demands of the plaintiffs, with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; the plaintiffs.<br><br>In 1908, J. R. Redfern took his&nbsp; wife and three minor children to England and left them there.&nbsp; He returned to the Philippines the following year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning with 1910 and continuing until 1922, Mr.&nbsp; Redfern provided his wife with funds for her expenses as follows:&nbsp; 1910—£20&nbsp; to £30 per month and P1,000&nbsp; for travelling expenses to the Philippines; 1911—£20&nbsp; to&nbsp; £30 per&nbsp; month;&nbsp; 1912—£20 to £30 per month; 1913—£20 to £30 per month; 1914—£345; 1915—£425;&nbsp; 1916—£590; 1917—£650;&nbsp; 1918—£660; 1919 —£560;&nbsp; 1920—£600; 1921—£440; 1922—February&nbsp; to October,&nbsp; $8 per month when the&nbsp; wife returned&nbsp; to Manila. Mr.&nbsp; Redfern is now furnishing&nbsp; his&nbsp; wife P300&nbsp; per&nbsp; month for the support of herself and one child.&nbsp; The two&nbsp; grown sons are employed and&nbsp; are earning their own living.<br><br>In 1920, while still in&nbsp; England, Mrs. Redfern&nbsp; obtained from her sister, Mrs.&nbsp; Ramirez, the sum of £600.&nbsp; Mrs; Redfern later secured an additional £185 from her sister in England.&nbsp; Mrs. Redfern&nbsp; did not make use of&nbsp; this money until&nbsp; 1922.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight&nbsp; hundred seventy-five pesos were advanced by Mr. and Mrs. Ramirez to Mrs.&nbsp; Redfern after the latter had returned to Manila.<br><br>The foregoing skeletonized statement of the case and of the facts is taken principally from the&nbsp; decision rendered by&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Harvey,&nbsp; His Honor's findings&nbsp; are&nbsp; entirely confirmed by the&nbsp; record.&nbsp; There can be no vital difference of opinion as to any essential fact.<br><br>The result reached by the trial judge&nbsp; was this:&nbsp; "Under the facts and circumstances of this&nbsp; case, the court is of the opinion that defendant was amply providing for his wife and children in London, and that defendant is not liable to plaintiffs for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sums of money here sought to be recovered, which were&nbsp; delivered to&nbsp; defendant's wife without his knowledge or consent&nbsp; and when there was no necessity&nbsp; therefor."&nbsp; Said&nbsp; conclusion is assailed by the plaintiffs as appellants in an argument on four errors.<br><br>The case falls squarely within the provisions of the first paragraph of article 1894 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; This article provides:&nbsp; "When, without the knowledge of the person who is bound to give&nbsp; support to a dependent, a&nbsp; stranger supplies&nbsp; it,&nbsp; the latter shall be entitled to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; the same from the former, unless it appears that he gave it out of charity, and without the expectation of recovering it."&nbsp; For one to recover&nbsp; under the provisions of article 1894 of the Civil Code, it, must&nbsp; be alleged and proved, first, that support has been furnished a dependent of one&nbsp; bound to give support but who fails to do so; second, that the support was supplied by a&nbsp; stranger; and third, that&nbsp; the support was given without the knowledge of the person charged with the duty.&nbsp; The negative qualification&nbsp; is when the&nbsp; support is given without the expectation of recovering it.<br><br>With special reference to the combined facts and law, it may be conceded that Mr. and Mrs. Ramirez did not supply Mrs. Redfern with money out of charity.&nbsp; The third requisite of the law&nbsp; is also taken out of consideration since Mr. Redfern is the first to acknowledge that the money was handed to his&nbsp; wife&nbsp; by Mr.&nbsp; and Mrs. Ramirez without his knowledge.&nbsp; We think, however, that there is a failure of proof as to the first essential, and possibly the second essential, of the law.<br><br>The first requisite of the&nbsp; law has a legal introduction, but ends as a&nbsp; question of fact.&nbsp; The husband and wife are mutually bound to support each other.&nbsp; By support is understood all that&nbsp; is necessary for food,&nbsp; shelter,&nbsp; clothing and medical attendance, according to the social standing of the family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents are also required to bring up and educate their&nbsp; children. But in this connection, the point of interest is that the wife accepted assistance from another, when it is not&nbsp; shown that she had ever made any complaint to her husband or any of his agents with&nbsp; regard to her allowance.&nbsp; The testimony of the husband is uncontradicted that he had given his English agent instructions to furnish his&nbsp; wife with any reasonable sum she needed bearing in mind his financial condition, but that she never took advantage of this offer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Redfern's&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for reducing the allowance,&nbsp; he&nbsp; says, was&nbsp; his&nbsp; precarious financial situation in 1921 and 1922.&nbsp; Before one can tender succor to the wife of another with an&nbsp; expectation of recouping himself for the loan, the&nbsp; husband should be given an opportunity to render the needful assistance.<br><br>With reference also to the first requirement of the law above-mentioned, it is clear&nbsp; that there is evidence in the record which&nbsp; corroborates the finding of the&nbsp; trial judge that the defendant was amply providing for his wife and children in&nbsp; London.&nbsp; The only debatable question relates to the year 1922 when the allowance was reduced to £8 a month.&nbsp; But a&nbsp; wife's fortunes and a husband's fortunes coincide.&nbsp; For children of proper&nbsp; age to&nbsp; be made&nbsp; to look after themselves,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; always a hardship.&nbsp; As to the £600 first advanced to Mrs. Redfern, this was not primarily for support because she&nbsp; retained it for some time before using it.<br><br>What has been said makes superfluous a discussion of the novel question of&nbsp; whether a sister and her husband are "strangers" within the meaning of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; (There can be noted and compared&nbsp; Pelayo <i>vs.</i> Lauron [1909],&nbsp; 12 Phil., 453, and Gorayeb <i>vs.</i> Hashim&nbsp; [1922], R. G.&nbsp; No. 19284,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span> </sup> not reported.)<br><br>We are unable to&nbsp; say that&nbsp; reversible error was&nbsp; committed by the trial judge in rendering judgment in favor of the defendant and against the&nbsp; plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, let&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment appealed from&nbsp; be affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the&nbsp; appellants.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Street, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i> Villa-Real,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span> </sup>Promulgated October 24, 1922</div>
