				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; action was commenced in&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its purpose was to obtain the extraordinary legal writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo&nbsp; warranto</span>.&nbsp; The petition was denied&nbsp; by the trial&nbsp; court and&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff appealed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions&nbsp; presented by&nbsp; the appeal are:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Is the provision of Act No. 3107, in so far as it provides that "justices of the peace shall be appointed to serve until they have reached the age of 65 years," valid and constitutional,&nbsp; when&nbsp; applied to&nbsp; justices of the peace appointed under Act No. 2041,&nbsp; section 1, to&nbsp; serve "during&nbsp; good behavior?" And,<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) Is the present action barred by the statutes of limitations?<br><br>The facts involved in the decision of those questions are as follows:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>.) That the said Julio Agcaoili was appointed as justice of the peace of the municipality of Laoag, of the Province&nbsp; of Ilocos Norte, by His Excellency,&nbsp; Francis Burton Harrison, on the 25th day of March, 1916, with authority "to have and to hold the said office with all the powers, privileges, and&nbsp; emoluments thereunto&nbsp; of&nbsp; right appertaining unto&nbsp; him, subject to the conditions prescribed&nbsp; by law."<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The conditions&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; by law"</span> to which the&nbsp; appointee was "subject" at the time of his appointment, are found in section 1 of Act No. 2041 (vol. 8, Public Laws, 153). Said&nbsp; section is an amendment to section 67 of Act No. 136, and provides among&nbsp; other things&nbsp; for the "appointment and term of justices of the peace."&nbsp; It provides that&nbsp; one justice of the peace and one auxiliary&nbsp; justice shall be appointed by the Governor-General, etc., for each municipality organized according to the Municipal Code.&nbsp; Said section further provides that "All&nbsp; justices of the peace and auxiliary&nbsp; justices&nbsp; shall&nbsp; hold&nbsp; office&nbsp; during <span style="font-style: italic;">good&nbsp; behavior</span> *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *."&nbsp; Said Act No. 2041 took effect on the 1st day of July,&nbsp; 1911.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time Act No. 2041 was adopted,&nbsp; the Philippine Legislature was composed of the United States Commission and the House of Representatives.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That on the&nbsp; 17th day of March, 1923, the Philippine Legislature, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives, adopted Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 3107,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was "<span style="font-style: italic;">an Act to amend and repeal certain provisions of the Administrative Code&nbsp; relative&nbsp; to the judiciary</span> in order to reorganize&nbsp; the latter; increasing the number&nbsp; of judges for certain judicial districts; increasing the salaries of judges of Courts of First&nbsp; Instance; vesting the Secretary of Justice with authority to detail&nbsp; a district judge temporarily&nbsp; to a&nbsp; district or province other than his own; <span style="font-style: italic;">regulating the salaries of justices&nbsp; of the peace; </span>abolishing the municipal court and justice of the peace court of the&nbsp; City of Manila and creating in lieu thereof a municipal court with three branches; regulating the salaries of clerks of court and other subordinate employees of Courts of First Instance, and for other purposes."<br><br>Notwithstanding the fact that the title of said Act (3107), so far as the same relates to justice of the peace, provides only for "regulating the salaries of justices of the peace," said Act in section 203 provides for "the&nbsp; appointment and distribution of justices of the peace" with&nbsp; the&nbsp; proviso&nbsp; in said section "*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * <span style="font-style: italic;">That&nbsp; justices and auxiliary justices of the peace shall be appointed to serve until&nbsp; they have reached the age of sixty-five years"</span>&nbsp; Attention is here called to the fact again that there is nothing in the title of the Act, which, in the slightest degree, indicates that said Act contains provisions for "the appointment of justices&nbsp; of the peace" nor as to the <span style="font-style: italic;">period&nbsp; during</span> which they&nbsp; may serve after appointment.&nbsp; Attention is also invited to the fact that the same section (203) contains provisions for the jurisdiction of&nbsp; justices&nbsp; of the peace while section 207 contains provisions&nbsp; denning&nbsp; the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">"qualifications for justices&nbsp; of the peace."</span>&nbsp; Section 210 of said&nbsp; Act provides for the "filling&nbsp; of vacancies in the&nbsp; office of justices of the peace."&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is nothing in the title of the Act which in any way indicates that the Act contains said provisions.&nbsp; Attention is here called to the provision of the Act of Congress of the 29th day of August, 1916, and to section 3 thereof, which provides "<span style="font-style: italic;">That no bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject, and that subject shall&nbsp; be expressed in the title of the bill</span>"<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span> The&nbsp; effect of&nbsp; a&nbsp; violation of said provision of said Act of Congress will&nbsp; be discussed later.<br><br>(c)&nbsp; That on&nbsp; the 9th day of April,&nbsp; 1923, the Undersecretary of&nbsp; Justice sent the following letter to the said Julio Agcaoili, through the Judge&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of the Third Judicial District, of the&nbsp; Province of Ilocos Sur.&nbsp; Said letter is in the words and figures following:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">"MANILA, <span style="font-style: italic;">April 9, 1923</span><br></div><br>"SIR: In view of the provision of section 203&nbsp; of the Administrative Code as amended by section 1 of Act No. 3107, which, in part, provides that 'justices and auxiliary justices of the peace shall be appointed to serve&nbsp; until they have reached the age of sixty-five years,' and in view of the fact that the record shows that you are over sixty-five years of age already, I have&nbsp; the honor to hereby advise you that, upon receipt hereof,&nbsp; you cease&nbsp; to be a justice of the peace by&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; said amendment of the Administrative Code.<br><br>"Respectfully,<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: right;">(Sgd.)&nbsp;&nbsp; "Luis P. Torres<br>"Undersecretary of Justice"<br></div><br>Said letter was received by Julio Agcaoili, the justice of the peace, on the 26th day of April, 1923.&nbsp; It was handed to him by the clerk&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; It will&nbsp; be noted that in&nbsp; the letter of April 9, 1923, the Secretary&nbsp; of Justice directed or ordered Julio Agcaoili, then justice of the&nbsp; peace, "upon receipt of said letter, to cease to be a justice&nbsp; of the peace."&nbsp; Against the order contained in said letter of April 9th, Julio Agcaoili entered a protest dated&nbsp; April&nbsp; 28, 1923, in the following language: "<br><br>JUSTICE OF&nbsp; THE PEACE COURT OF LAOAG, ILOCOS NORTE "P.

Ilocos Norte, do hereby state that on this 4ay, July 7, 1923, Mr.
Buenaventura Ocampo, Provincial Fiscal of Ilocos Norte, appeared at my
office and thereupon showed me the telegram of Undersecretary&nbsp; of
Justice Torres, addressed to said provincial&nbsp; fiscal.&nbsp; After reading&nbsp;
said telegram I&nbsp; asked the provincial fiscal to furnish me a copy
thereof and he furnished&nbsp; me a copy of the telegram.<br><br>"Said&nbsp; telegram of the Undersecretary of Justice in substance orders the provincial fiscal to cause me to deliver the office and&nbsp; all the&nbsp; documents&nbsp; and records thereof to the auxiliary justice of the peace, because according&nbsp; to said Undersecretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Justice I&nbsp; must&nbsp; cease from&nbsp; the&nbsp; office under Act No. 3107, and <span style="font-style: italic;">that I be prosecuted for violation of article 370 of the Penal Code</span> should I fail to comply with the telegram sent to me&nbsp; on the 2d&nbsp; instant by&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Undersecretary of Justice.<br><br>"I do also state that I have never had any malicious intention to disobey the orders of the&nbsp; Undersecretary of Justice, Hon.&nbsp; Torres, one given by telegram and the other By letter.&nbsp; I only desired&nbsp; to study the spirit of the law and this is&nbsp; the reason why I did not&nbsp; leave the office until the present time, <span style="font-style: italic;">because I was and am of the&nbsp; opinion that I must not cease from the office of the justice of the peace</span> under the&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 2041 under which I was appointed justice of the peace of the capital, and which Act was not&nbsp; repealed by&nbsp; any&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; one, nor&nbsp; by Act No. 3107,&nbsp; which Act No. 2041 provides that the justices of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; to be appointed under it, <span style="font-style: italic;">should hold office during&nbsp; good behavior.</span>&nbsp; This Act does not say anything as to&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; of age, and therefore I believe&nbsp; myself entitled to continue in, and retain the office.<br><br>"I do also state that lest&nbsp; the Undersecretary of Justice should&nbsp; think that I do&nbsp; not duly respect the constituted authorities, I now deliver under protest the office of the justice of the&nbsp; peace of Laoag and all its documents and records, as well as the furniture therein contained, to Mr. Alberto Suguitan, auxiliary justice of the peace, in the&nbsp; presence of the provincial fiscal, in compliance with the telegram of the Undersecretary of Justice,&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; Torres, received by me through the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; of Ilocos&nbsp; Norte.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">I make under protest&nbsp; the delivery of&nbsp; the office</span>&nbsp; and its documents and records because I think, as I have stated, that I must not cease from the office of justice of the&nbsp; peace, and in order that my right may be&nbsp; defined, I&nbsp; shall institute an action&nbsp; in the proper court of&nbsp; justice to decide&nbsp; the case.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; "JULIO AGCAOILI<br></div><br>"I received the things of the office.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Sgd.)&nbsp;&nbsp; "ALBERTO SUGUITAN <br></div><br>"In the presence of:<br><br>(Sgd.)&nbsp;&nbsp; "BUENAV. OCAMPO<br><div style="margin-left: 80px; font-style: italic;">"Provincial Fiscal"<br></div></blockquote>Julio Agcaoili patiently waited in vain for a resolution by the&nbsp; Secretary of Justice of the protest which&nbsp; he presented on the 28th day of April and on the 7th day&nbsp; of July, 1923;&nbsp; and not having&nbsp; received any&nbsp; reply&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> to his&nbsp; protest,</span> filed a petition for a writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> in the Court of First Instance of the Province of Ilocos Norte on&nbsp; the 23d day&nbsp; of April,&nbsp; 1925, which petition was amended by the filing of another petition in the same court on the 8th day of September,&nbsp; 1925.<br><br>A careful reading of the two protests (April 28, 1923, and&nbsp; July&nbsp; 7, 1923) shows that they contain arguments&nbsp; in support thereof which,&nbsp; in all equity and justice, demanded a reply, but no reply was forthcoming.&nbsp;&nbsp; The arguments in support of his protests find a counterpart and are fully supported in the&nbsp; decision of this court in the case of&nbsp; Segovia vs.&nbsp; Noel,&nbsp; of March 4,&nbsp; 1925 (47 Phil., 543), wherein the Supreme Court held that Act No. 3107 could not be applied to and enforced against justices of the peace who had been appointed prior to the 17th day of March, 1923.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had the Secretary of Justice&nbsp; answered said protest, the great <span style="font-style: italic;">injustice </span>which has been done to Julio Agcaoili perhaps might have been avoided.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)&nbsp; That Julio Agcaoili being threatened with a criminal prosecution&nbsp; unless he turned his office over to the auxiliary justice of the peace, and to avoid scandal, disgrace&nbsp; and humiliation which might come to him by virtue of said prosecution, on&nbsp; the 7th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; July, 1923,&nbsp; still protesting, delivered the possession of his office, as justice of the peace, to the auxiliary justice&nbsp; of the peace of the municipality&nbsp; of Laoag.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; a matter of&nbsp; common knowledge&nbsp; that Julio Agcaoili had been entrusted with the highest office in his province which the&nbsp; people could&nbsp; confer upon him.<br><br>The petitions presented by Julio Agcaoili&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance, the first on the 23d day of July, 1925, and the second on the 8th day of September, 1925, contain,&nbsp; in resume, the&nbsp; foregoing facts.&nbsp; To the&nbsp; petition the respondent Alberto Suguitan answered and set up the defense of prescription.&nbsp; Upon the issue thus presented, the Honorable Fermin Mariano, judge, sustained the defense of prescription and&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the petition for the&nbsp; extraordinary&nbsp; legal remedy of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>.&nbsp; From that judgment Julio Agcaoili appealed, and now contends in a vigorous and logical argument that his remedy has not prescribed.<br><br>Considering the first question suggested above,&nbsp; attention is again called to one of the provisions of section 3 of the Jones&nbsp; Law (Act of Congress, August 29,&nbsp; 1916, vol. 12, Public Laws of the Philippine Islands).&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Jones Law" is the constitution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands providing&nbsp; a government therefor.&nbsp; Subparagraph 16 of section 3 of the Jones&nbsp; Law provides "That no bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject,&nbsp; and that subject <span style="font-style: italic;">shall be expressed in the&nbsp; title of the&nbsp; bill."</span>&nbsp; Under said provision, may the legislature adopt a law which contains important&nbsp; provisions to which&nbsp; no&nbsp; reference is made in the title&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Act? The effect of violating said provision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Jones Law has&nbsp; been&nbsp; brought before the courts many times.&nbsp; The effect of violating&nbsp; said&nbsp; provision has&nbsp; already been passed&nbsp; upon by&nbsp; this court.&nbsp; (Central Capiz <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Ramirez, 40&nbsp; Phil., 883,&nbsp; 889.)<br><br>In the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Central Capiz<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>. Ramirez, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, it was decided that said provision of the Jones Law was mandatory and not directory and its violation was fatal to any provision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law to which no reference was made in the title.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; decision of this&nbsp; court in the case of&nbsp; Central Capiz&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Ramirez, the decisions of the courts of many of the states&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Union were&nbsp; followed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the constitutions of the states of the Union contain similar provision&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; that&nbsp; quoted&nbsp;&nbsp; above from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Jones&nbsp; Law. Among such states may be&nbsp; mentioned Alabama, California, Georgia/Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,&nbsp; Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,&nbsp; Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,&nbsp; Nevada, New Jersey,&nbsp; New&nbsp; York,&nbsp; Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,&nbsp; Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. <br><br>Mr. Justice Sutherland, now an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, in his valuable work on&nbsp; "Statutory&nbsp; Construction," vol.&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 2nd&nbsp; ed.) at section 111, states the reason and the&nbsp; purpose- of&nbsp; such&nbsp; a constitutional provision.&nbsp; He says:<br><blockquote>''In the&nbsp; construction&nbsp; and application&nbsp; of this&nbsp; constitutional restriction the courts have kept steadily in view the correction of the mischief against which it was aimed.&nbsp; The object is to prevent the practice, which was common in all legislative&nbsp; bodies where no&nbsp; such&nbsp; restriction existed,&nbsp; of embracing in the same bill incongruous matters having no relation to each&nbsp; other, or to the subject specified&nbsp; in the title,&nbsp; by which measures were&nbsp; often&nbsp; adopted without attracting attention.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; distinct subjects&nbsp; represented diverse&nbsp; interests, and were combined in order to&nbsp; unite the members of the legislature who favor either in support of all.&nbsp; These combinations were corruptive of the legislature and dangerous&nbsp; to the state.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such <span style="font-style: italic;">omnibus </span>bills sometimes included more&nbsp; than a hundred sections&nbsp; on as many different subjects, with a title appropriate to the first section, 'and for other purposes.'<br><br>"The&nbsp; failure to indicate in the title of the bill the object intended to be accomplished by the legislation&nbsp; often resulted in&nbsp; members voting ignorantly&nbsp; for measures which they would not knowingly have approved.&nbsp; And not only were&nbsp; legislators thus misled, but the&nbsp; public also; so that legislative&nbsp; provisions were&nbsp; stealthily pushed through&nbsp; in the closing hours of a session, which, having&nbsp; no merit to commend&nbsp; them, would have been made odious by popular discussion&nbsp; and remonstrance if&nbsp; their pendency had&nbsp; been seasonably announced.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; constitutional clause&nbsp; under discussion is intended to correct these evils; to prevent such corrupting aggregations of incongruous measures, by confining each act&nbsp; to one subject or object; to prevent surprise and inadvertence by requiring&nbsp; that subject or object to be expressed in the title."<br></blockquote>The Supreme Court of the State of Alabama, in discussing the effect&nbsp; of the violation&nbsp; of a similar provision of the constitution of that state in the cases of&nbsp; Walker vs. State (49 Ala., 329) and Lindsay <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> United States Savings &amp; Loan Association (120 Ala., 156), had the following to say, quoting with&nbsp; approval, what Mr. Justice Cooley in his Constitutional Limitations, at page 143, had said upon that question:<br><blockquote>"The object sought to be accomplished, and the mischief proposed to be remedied by this&nbsp; provision, are well known. *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; Legislative assemblies&nbsp; for the&nbsp; dispatch&nbsp; of business often pass bills by their titles only, without requiring them to be read.&nbsp; A specious title sometimes covered&nbsp; a legislation which,&nbsp; if its real character had been disclosed, would&nbsp; not have commanded assent. To prevent&nbsp; surprise and fraud on the legislature&nbsp; is&nbsp; one of the purposes this provision was&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to accomplish.&nbsp; Before the adoption of this provision, the title of a statute was often no indication&nbsp; of its subject or&nbsp; contents.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<br><br>"An evil this constitutional requirement was&nbsp; intended to correct was the blending in one and the same statute of such things as were diverse&nbsp; in their nature, and were connected&nbsp; only to&nbsp; combine in favor&nbsp; of all&nbsp; the advocates of each, thus often securing the passage of&nbsp; several measures, no one of which could have succeeded on its own merits. Mr. Cooley thus&nbsp; sums up&nbsp; his review of the&nbsp; authorities, defining the objects of this provision: 'It may, therefore, be assumed as settled, that the purpose of&nbsp; these provisions was: <span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, to prevent <span style="font-style: italic;">hodge-podge</span>, or log-rolling legislation; <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, to prevent surprise or fraud upon the legislature, by&nbsp; means&nbsp; of provisions in&nbsp; bills of which the titles gave no information, and&nbsp; which might therefore be overlooked&nbsp; and carelessly and unintentionally&nbsp; adopted;&nbsp; and, <span style="font-style: italic;">third</span>, to fairly apprise the people, through such publication of legislative proceedings as is usually made, of the&nbsp; subjects of legislation that are being considered, in order that they may have opportunity of being heard thereon, by petition or otherwise if they shall so desire.'" (49 Ala., 330, 331.)<br><br>"The purposes of the constitutional requirement must be borne&nbsp; steadily in mind, when it becomes&nbsp; necessary to determine whether there has been legislative observance of it.&nbsp; The exposition of&nbsp; these&nbsp; purposes, by&nbsp; Judge Cooley is accepted, we believe, in all the states in which a like limitation prevails. *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * " (120 Ala., 172.)<br></blockquote>In the case of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Parks (58 Cal., 624) the Supreme Court&nbsp; of the State of California had occasion to discuss the Question now before us and said:<br><blockquote>"At the&nbsp; least,&nbsp; then, two heterogeneous subjects are embraced in the act, one of which is not expressed in the title, and they cannot be segregated.&nbsp; The title does not express the objects of legislation embodied in the provisions of the act.&nbsp; It is, therefore,&nbsp; narrower than the body of the act, and fails to impart that notice of the measures enacted, which&nbsp; the Constitution requires.&nbsp; To prohibit such legislation was the sole&nbsp; end and&nbsp; aim of&nbsp; the constitutional requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The practice,'&nbsp; says&nbsp; the Supreme Court&nbsp; of Missouri, 'of comprising in one bill subjects of a diverse and antagonistic&nbsp; nature,&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; combine in its&nbsp; support members who were in favor of particular&nbsp; measures,&nbsp; but neither of which could&nbsp; command the requisite majority on its&nbsp; own merits, was found to be not a corruptive influence in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Legislature&nbsp; itself, but destructive of the best interests of the State.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this was not more detrimental than that other pernicious practice, by which, through dexterous and&nbsp; unscrupulous management, designing men inserted clauses in&nbsp; the bodies of bills, of the true meaning of which&nbsp; the titles gave no indication, and by skillful maneuvering urged them on to their passage.&nbsp; These things led to fraud and injury, and it was found necessary to apply a corrective in the shape of a constitutional provision.'&nbsp; (City of St.&nbsp; Louis <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tiefel, 42 Mo., 590.)&nbsp; This provision has been framed in the constitutions of many of the States of&nbsp; the Union;&nbsp; and courts, whenever it has come before them, have liberally construed it as the will of the people in the interests of honest legislation."<br></blockquote>Decisions to the same effect&nbsp; are found in the following cases: City of St. Louis vs. Tiefel (42 Mo., 578); Cannon vs. Mathes (8&nbsp; Heisk.&nbsp; [Tenn.], 504); Ryerson vs. Utley (16 Mich., 269) ;&nbsp; Board of Public Education for the City of&nbsp; Americus&nbsp; vs. Barlow (49 Ga., 232) ;&nbsp; Spier vs. Baker (120 Cal., 370).<br><br>Mr. Justice Sutherland, in a further&nbsp; discussion of the question, at section 112 of his work on Statutory Construction, said:<br><blockquote>"The efficiency of this constitutional remedy&nbsp; to cure the evil and mischief which has&nbsp; been pointed&nbsp; out&nbsp; depends on judicial enforcement; on this constitutional injunction being regarded as <span style="font-style: italic;">mandatory</span>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; compliance with&nbsp; it essential to&nbsp; the validity of legislation.&nbsp; The&nbsp; mischief existed notwithstanding&nbsp; the sworn official&nbsp; obligation of legislators; it might be expected&nbsp; to&nbsp; continue notwithstanding that the obligation is formulated and&nbsp; emphasized in this constitutional injunction, if it be construed as addressed exclusively to them, and only directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would, in a general sense, be&nbsp; a dangerous doctrine to announce that any&nbsp; of the provisions of the constitution may be obeyed or disregarded at the&nbsp; mere will or pleasure of the legislature,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; it is clear beyond all question that&nbsp; such was the intention of the framers of that instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would seem to be a lowering of the proper dignity of&nbsp; the fundamental&nbsp; law to say that it descends to prescribing rules of order in&nbsp; unessential matters which may be followed&nbsp; or disregarded at pleasure. The fact is this: That whatever constitutional provision can be looked upon as directory&nbsp; merely is&nbsp; very likely to&nbsp; be treated by the&nbsp; legislature as if&nbsp; it was&nbsp; devoid of moral obligation, and to be therefore&nbsp; habitually disregarded."<br></blockquote>In the case of Cannon vs. Matties, supra, Mr. Chief Justice Nicholson, in discussing the effect of the violation of a constitutional provision like the one before us, said:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; This is a direct, positive, and imperative limitation upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; power&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Legislature.&nbsp; It&nbsp; matters not that&nbsp; a bill has passed through three readings in each house, on three different days, and has received the approval of the Governor;&nbsp; still it is not a law&nbsp; of the State if it embraces more than one&nbsp; subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * "<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; Supreme Court of Alabama, in the case of Walker <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. State, supra, said:<br><blockquote>"It is the settled law of this court, founded on&nbsp; reasoning which seems to us unanswerable, that this provision of the Constitution is not a&nbsp; mere rule of legislative procedure, directory to the general assembly, but that it is mandatory, and it&nbsp; is the duty&nbsp; of courts to declare void any statute not conforming to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"<br></blockquote>Mr. Justice Cooley in his valuable work on Constitutional Limitations (pp. 179, 180) states that our courts&nbsp; have held, without&nbsp; exception, that&nbsp; such constitutional provision is <span style="font-style: italic;">mandatory</span>.<br><br>Considering that the great weight of authority is to the effect that&nbsp; the provision like the&nbsp; one above quoted from the Jones Law is mandatory; and considering that there is nothing in the title of Act No. 3107 which indicates in the slightest degree that said Act contains a provision "that justices&nbsp; and auxiliary justices&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace shall be&nbsp; appointed to serve until they have reached the age of&nbsp; sixty- five years," we are&nbsp; forced&nbsp; to the conclusion that, that provision is illegal, void and contrary&nbsp; to the mandatory provision of the Jones Law, and that said&nbsp; law (3107) cannot be&nbsp; applied to justices and auxiliary justices of the peace who were appointed prior to the 17th day of March, 1923; and that when Julio Agcaoili was forcibly,&nbsp; by&nbsp; means of threats and intimidation, ordered to&nbsp; leave&nbsp; his office&nbsp; as justice of the peace, he was forced to do so illegally, without&nbsp; just cause, and&nbsp; should&nbsp; therefore be restored to his position&nbsp; as justice of the peace of&nbsp; the municipality&nbsp; of Laoag, without delay.<br><br>With reference to the second question above suggested, in <span style="font-style: italic;">re</span> prescription or&nbsp; limitation of the action, it may&nbsp; be said that originally there was no limitation or prescription of action in an action for q<span style="font-style: italic;">uo warranto</span>, neither could there be, for the reason that it was an action by the Government and prescription could not be plead as a&nbsp; defense to an action by the Government.&nbsp; The ancient writ of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> was&nbsp; a high prerogative writ in&nbsp; the nature of a writ of right by the King against any one who usurped or claimed any office,&nbsp; franchise or liberty of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crown, to inquire&nbsp; by what authority&nbsp; the usurper supported his claim, in order to determine the right.&nbsp; Even at the present time in many of the civilized countries of the&nbsp; world the&nbsp; action&nbsp; is still regarded as a prerogative writ and no limitation or prescription is permitted to bar the action.&nbsp; As a general principle it may be stated&nbsp; that ordinary statutes of limitation, civil or penal, have no&nbsp; application to <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> proceeding brought to enforce a public right.&nbsp;&nbsp; (McPhail <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> People ex rel Lambert,&nbsp; 160 111., 77; 52 Am.

Section 216, in English, provided that "Nothing herein contained shall authorize&nbsp; an action against a&nbsp; corporation for forfeiture of charter, unless the same be commenced within five years after&nbsp; the&nbsp; act complained of was done&nbsp; or committed; nor shall an action be brought&nbsp; against an officer to be ousted from his office unless within one year after the cause of such ouster,&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to hold the office, arose."&nbsp;&nbsp; The same section&nbsp; (216), as published in Spanish, reads as follows: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ninguna de estas disposiciones facultard la initiation de un&nbsp; juicio&nbsp; contra&nbsp; una corporation por la perdida de sus derechos de&nbsp; concesion, a menos que el juitio se Ueve a efecto dentro de los tinco anos siguientes a la cowrisi&amp;n u omision del hecho objeto de la accidn.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tampoco se podrd iniciar un juicio contra la persona que ejerza un cargo en una corporation&nbsp; para desposeerla, a menos&nbsp; que se lleve a efecto dentro del ano siguiente a la fecha de la comision del hecho&nbsp; que did motivo a su privation,&nbsp; o&nbsp; que se puso&nbsp; en duda su derecho&nbsp; para ocupar el cargo."</span><br><br>Said&nbsp; section&nbsp; (216), as published in Spanish and translated into English, reads as follows: "Nothing herein contained shall authorize an action against a corporation for forfeiture of its corporate&nbsp; rights, unless the same be commenced within five years after the commission or omission complained&nbsp; of took place.&nbsp; Neither may an&nbsp; action&nbsp; be brought against an&nbsp; officer&nbsp; to&nbsp; oust him&nbsp; from&nbsp; office, unless the same is&nbsp; commenced within one year&nbsp; after the commission of the&nbsp; act which caused the deprivation thereof, or after the right to hold the office arose."<br><br>Said&nbsp; section&nbsp; 216,&nbsp; as above quoted in&nbsp; Spanish, was published in vol. 1 of the Public Laws of the Philippine Islands and distributed to the public&nbsp; officers throughout the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; It is a fact&nbsp; of general information that even&nbsp; now, in 1926,&nbsp; the Spanish copy of the&nbsp; Public Laws are consulted by the people&nbsp; in remote&nbsp; parts of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands&nbsp; for the purpose of knowing what the&nbsp; law is.&nbsp; It is not strange, therefore, that the appellant did not believe that said section 216 applied to public officers; that it only&nbsp; applied to officers of corporations as it appeared in the Spanish translation. Is it just and fair and reasonable for the Government of the Philippine Islands to oust one of its officers&nbsp; from an office to which he had been legally appointed, by force and intimidation and without just cause, and then to defeat his action in <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> by invoking the provisions of a public statute, different from the one which the Government itself had&nbsp; furnished its public officers?&nbsp; The appellant is familiar with the Spanish but not with the English language.&nbsp; He naturally relied upon the Spanish version of the law for his information as to what the law really was.&nbsp; Not only&nbsp; had the appellant the right to rely upon the provisions of section 216 as they appeared in Spanish in the Public Laws of the Philippine Islands, but the reading of the three or four sections immediately preceding section 216 will show that they refer specifically to corporations only.&nbsp; The appellant, therefore,&nbsp; was justified in believing that said section&nbsp; 216 as it appeared in Spanish was correct.&nbsp; At least&nbsp; the Government should give him credit with having acted in good faith.<br><br>But, even granting that the appellant is bound by the provisions of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 216 as it appears in English, is the same applicable to the appellant?&nbsp; By reference to said section above&nbsp; quoted in English, it will be seen that after the word "committed" there is&nbsp; a semicolon.&nbsp; Does that which follows&nbsp; the semicolon have reference to the&nbsp; same subject matter which precedes&nbsp; it?&nbsp;&nbsp; A semicolon is a mark of grammatical punctuation, in the&nbsp; English language, to indicate a separation in the relation of the thought, a degree greater than that expressed&nbsp; by a comma, and&nbsp; what follows the semicolon must have relation to the same matter which precedes it.&nbsp; What follows a semicolon&nbsp; always has relation to the same subject matter of that which precedes it.&nbsp; A semicolon is not used for the purpose&nbsp; of introducing a new idea.&nbsp; A semicolon is used for the purpose of continuing the expression of&nbsp; a thought, a degree greater than that expressed&nbsp; by a mere comma.&nbsp; It is never used for the purpose of introducing a new idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; The comma and semicolon are&nbsp; both&nbsp; used for the&nbsp; same purpose,&nbsp; namely, to divide sentences and parts&nbsp; of sentences, the only difference being that the semicolon makes the division a little more pronounced than the comma.&nbsp; The punctuation used in a&nbsp; law may&nbsp; always be referred to for&nbsp; the purpose of ascertaining&nbsp; the&nbsp; true meaning of a&nbsp; doubtful&nbsp; statute.&nbsp; It follows therefore that,&nbsp; Inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; all of the provisions of said section 216 which precede the semicolon refer to corporations&nbsp; only, that which follows the semicolon has reference to&nbsp; the&nbsp; same subject matter, or&nbsp; to&nbsp; officers of a corporation.<br><br>But even granting, for the sake of the argument, that the word "officer" as used in the latter part of said section applies to public&nbsp; officers who have been ousted from their position, and not only to&nbsp; officers of corporations, then we have&nbsp; the question presented: Had the one&nbsp; year mentioned in said section expired on the 23d day of April, 1925, when the first complaint was filed in the present action?&nbsp; When did the year begin to run if said section is applicable to the appellant?<br><br>It will be remembered that on the 7th day of July, 1923, the appellant was ousted&nbsp; from his office as justice&nbsp; of the peace of the&nbsp; municipality of Laoag.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did he surrender his office&nbsp; on that&nbsp; date&nbsp; under protest,&nbsp; but also on the 28th day of April, 1923, when he was notified by the Secretary of&nbsp; Justice that he cease to be a justice&nbsp; of the peace of his&nbsp; municipality, he then&nbsp; protested&nbsp; and gave a long and lucid argument in support of his protest.&nbsp; In all justice to him, did he not have a right, without any legal action to protect his right, to await the solution of his protest of the 28th day&nbsp; of April, 1923?&nbsp; He had a right to believe that the grounds upon which his protest was based would be convincing to the Secretary of Justice and that he would not&nbsp; be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this very&nbsp; hour the&nbsp; record contains no&nbsp; reply from the Secretary of&nbsp; Justice and no answer whatever to the legal grounds presented by the appellant upon&nbsp; his right to&nbsp; continue as justice of the peace and not to be ousted.<br><br>In&nbsp; our opinion, even&nbsp; granting that section 216 is' applicable to the appellant, the period of prescription had riot begun to run&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time of the commencement&nbsp; of the present action.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was justified in delaying the commencement of&nbsp; his action until an answer to&nbsp; his protest had been made.&nbsp; He had a right to await the answer to his protest, in the confident belief that it would be resolved in his favor and that action would be unnecessary.<br><br>It is contended, however, that the question before us was answered and&nbsp; resolved against the contention of the appellant in the case of Bautista <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Fajardo (38 Phil., 624). In that case no question was raised nor was it even suggested that said section 216 did not apply to a public officer. That&nbsp; question&nbsp; was not discussed nor referred to by any of the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; interested in that case.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been frequently decided that the fact that a statute has&nbsp; been accepted as valid, and invoked&nbsp; and applied for many years in cases where its validity was not&nbsp; raised&nbsp; or passed on, does not prevent a court from later passing on its validity, where that question is squarely and properly raised and presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a question passes the court <span style="font-style: italic;">sub silentio,</span> the case in&nbsp; which the question was so passed is not binding on the Court&nbsp; (McGirr vs. Hamilton and&nbsp; Abreu,&nbsp; 30&nbsp; Phil., 563), nor should it be considered as&nbsp; a precedent.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.&nbsp; S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Noriega and Tobias,&nbsp; 31 Phil., 310; Chicote <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Acasio, 31 Phil., 401; U.

S., 82.)&nbsp;&nbsp; For the reasons&nbsp; given in the case of McGirr <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.&nbsp;</span> Hamilton and Abreu, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Bautista <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Fajardo, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, can have no binding force in the interpretation of the question presented&nbsp; here.<br><br>&nbsp;The present&nbsp; case&nbsp; is anomalous under American sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp; An&nbsp; officer was appointed in&nbsp; accordance with the law to the judiciary to serve "during good behavior."&nbsp; After he had faithfully and honestly served the Government for a number of years the legislature adopted a new law which arbitrarily,&nbsp; without giving any reason therefor,&nbsp; provided that said officer cease to be such when he should reach the age of 65 years.&nbsp; Said law contained no express provision or method for its&nbsp; enforcement.&nbsp; The Executive Department, through its Undersecretary of Justice, without any authority given in said law, notified the said officer that he was&nbsp; no longer an officer in the judicial department of the Government and must vacate his office and turn the same over to another,&nbsp; who was designated by said Undersecretary.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the officer protested&nbsp; against such arbitrary action, giving reasons therefor, and without answering said protest, he was threatened with a criminal&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; if he did not immediately vacate his&nbsp; office.&nbsp; The history of this&nbsp; case reads more like a story of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Arabian Nights than like a procedure under a well-organized Government. It seems impossible to believe, and we could not believe it, were the facts not actually supported by the record.<br><br>Why&nbsp; the Undersecretary of&nbsp; Justice did not follow the orderly procedure marked out&nbsp; by Act No. 190 is&nbsp; not explained.&nbsp; The appellant was given&nbsp; no hearing.&nbsp; Even his protest, couched in&nbsp; most humble and&nbsp; respectful language, fell upon deaf ears.&nbsp; Absolute indifference was shown to the respectful protest and the able argument given in support thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only answer to his protest was a threat of a criminal&nbsp; prosecution if he did not&nbsp; vacate his office. His humility was met with austereness.&nbsp;&nbsp; His humble petition&nbsp; was met&nbsp; with a threat.&nbsp;&nbsp; His&nbsp; patient waiting for a reply to his protest was ended by a demand that he be prosecuted for&nbsp; refusing to comply&nbsp; with&nbsp; an order by one who was not willing to follow the well-defined and well beaten road of "due process of law" by preferring charges and&nbsp; giving the appellant an opportunity to be heard and to defend his right.&nbsp; Nothing of that character took place. The whole procedure, from beginning to end, in ousting the appellant from an office to which he had&nbsp; been&nbsp; legally appointed and against whom no complaint&nbsp; has been made, is anomalous in the&nbsp; jurisprudence under the American flag.<br><br>Believing as I do, that the success of free institutions depends upon a rigid adherence to the fundamentals of the law, I have never yielded, and I&nbsp; hope that I may never yield, to considerations of expediency in expounding it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also some plausible reason for&nbsp; the&nbsp; latitudinarian constructions which are resorted to for the purpose of&nbsp; acquiring power—some evil to be avoided, or some good to be attained by pushing the powers&nbsp; of the Government beyond&nbsp; their legitimate boundary.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is by yielding to such influences that the courts and legislatures are gradually undermining and finally overthrowing constitutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is by yielding to such influences that constitutions are gradually undermined and finally overthrown.&nbsp; It has been, and is my purpose, so far as it is possible for me, to&nbsp; follow the fundamental law of the land regardless of consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a particular law does not work well the people or the legislature may amend it.&nbsp; If, however, the legislature or the courts&nbsp; undertake to cure defects in the law by forced&nbsp; and unnatural constructions, they inflict a wound upon the constitution of the state which nothing can&nbsp; cure.&nbsp; One step taken by the legislature or the judiciary in enlarging the&nbsp; powers of the Government, opens the door for another which will be sure to follow;&nbsp; and so the process goes&nbsp; on&nbsp; until all respect for the fundamental law is lost and the powers of the Government are just&nbsp; what those in authority are pleased to call them.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oakley <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Aspinwall, 3 Comstock&nbsp; [N.&nbsp; Y.], 547, 568.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot give my consent to&nbsp; a rule or doctrine which will permit a Government to throw an honest and efficient official out of office without reason and without authority of law, refuse to consider a protest, and then permit the application of&nbsp; a law to&nbsp; prevent a&nbsp; recovery of that&nbsp; which he has lost illegally and without reason.<br><br>The judgment appealed from should&nbsp; be revoked,&nbsp; and a judgment should be entered ordering the restoration&nbsp; of the appellant to the office from which he was illegally ejected.

The plaintiff in turn alleges that there is no such prescription," and then proceeded to deny the petition.&nbsp; On appeal to this&nbsp; court, the errors assigned by Mr. Agcaoili as appellant are these:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp; "(1)&nbsp; The lower court erred in holding&nbsp; that the action of the petitioner had prescribed on account of the same not having&nbsp; been brought&nbsp; within&nbsp; one year from July 7, 1923, when by an illegal order of the Honorable, the Secretary of Justice, the petitioner forcibly ceased to&nbsp; discharge the duties of the office of justice of the peace of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, and the respondent assumed said office and began to act as such justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace.<br><br>&nbsp; "(2)&nbsp; The lower court erred in applying to the instant case the provisions of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 216 of Act&nbsp; No. 190 (Code of Civil Procedure).<br><br>&nbsp;"(3) The lower court erred in&nbsp; finding that the period of prescription must be counted from July 7, 1923, instead of March 4, 1925.<br><br>&nbsp; "(4)&nbsp; The lower court finally erred in&nbsp; not granting&nbsp; the relief invoked&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner; in not ousting&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent from the office of justice of the peace of Laoag, Ilocos Norte, in not reinstating the petitioner in said office and in not sentencing the respondent to pay the costs&nbsp; and damages caused to the petitioner in the sum of P5,000."<br></blockquote>There is not one word either in appellant's brief or in appellee's brief on the subject of the constitutionality of&nbsp; Act No. 3107.<br><br>Had not the&nbsp; constitutional question&nbsp; been discussed&nbsp; and decided without it being suggested&nbsp; anywhere in the&nbsp; bill of exceptions, in the assignments of error, or in the briefs, it would hardly be necessary to cite such well known principles as these:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; "It must be evident to any one that the power to declare a legislative&nbsp; enactment void is one which the judge, conscious of the&nbsp; fallibility of the human judgment, will shrink from&nbsp; exercising in any case where he can conscientiously and with&nbsp; due regard&nbsp; to duty and official oath decline the responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br>&nbsp; "*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The task&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; is a delicate one,&nbsp; and only&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; entered upon&nbsp; with&nbsp; reluctance&nbsp; and hesitation.&nbsp; •&nbsp; •&nbsp; •<br><br>&nbsp;"Neither will a court, as a general rule, pass upon a constitutional question, and decide a statute to be invalid,&nbsp; unless a decision upon that very point becomes necessary to the determination of the cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'While courts cannot shun the discussion of constitutional questions when fairly presented, they will not go out of their way to find such topics.&nbsp; They will not seek to draw&nbsp; in such weighty matters collaterally, nor on trivial occasions.&nbsp; It is both more proper and more respectful to a&nbsp; coordinate&nbsp; department&nbsp; to discuss constitutional&nbsp; questions only when&nbsp; that&nbsp; is the very <span style="font-style: italic;">lis mota.</span><br><br>* *&nbsp; *'"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 7th&nbsp; ed., pp. 227, 228, 231.)<br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Street, J,</span>, with whom concur <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J.</span>,&nbsp; and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Ostrand, J.</span>, dissenting:<br><br>&nbsp;This is an action of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> instituted in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte by&nbsp; Julio Agcaoili for the purpose of securing his restoration to the office of justice of the peace of Laoag and&nbsp; to secure the removal of the defendant, Alberto Suguitan, from the present enjoyment of the same office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing the cause the trial judge, while recognizing the theoretical right of the plaintiff to the office in&nbsp; question, nevertheless held that the plaintiff's right of action had been barred by the limitation prescribed in section 216 of the Code of Civil Procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; He there- fore denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ,&nbsp; with half costs, and the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>&nbsp; It appears that on March 25, 1916, the plaintiff was appointed by the&nbsp; Governor-General&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of justice of the peace of Laoag, in&nbsp; the Province of Ilocos Norte, effective from April 10, 1916, subject to the conditions prescribed by law.&nbsp; This appointment was approved by the Philippine Senate, and the plaintiff entered&nbsp; upon the discharge&nbsp; of his duties in due course.&nbsp; At that time&nbsp; there was no age&nbsp; limit upon the tenure of office&nbsp; of justices of the peace, but on&nbsp; March 17, 1923, Act No. 3107 of the Philippine Legislature went into effect.&nbsp; By this Act, section 203 of the Administrative Code, covering the appointment of justices of the peace, was amended by the addition of a proviso&nbsp; to the first paragraph of said&nbsp; section to the effect: "That justices and auxiliary justices of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace shall be appointed to serve until they have reached&nbsp; the age of sixty-five&nbsp; years."<br><br>&nbsp; In the&nbsp; year 1923 the plaintiff herein had attained the age&nbsp; of&nbsp; 65; and the Secretary of Justice, supposing that the new proviso to&nbsp; section 203 of the Administrative Code was applicable to the case, brought administrative pressure to bear upon the plaintiff, with the result that the plaintiff ceased to exercise the functions of justice of the peace for Laoag and the defendant, Alberto&nbsp; Suguitan, was duly appointed by the Governor-General to the same office.&nbsp;&nbsp; This appointment&nbsp; having been approved by the&nbsp; Senate, the said Suguitan&nbsp; entered upon the discharge of the duties thereof.<br><br>&nbsp; On March&nbsp; 4, 1925, this court&nbsp; promulgated the decision in the case of Segovia vs. Noel (47 Phil., 543), wherein we decided that the amendment contained in Act No. 3107 to section 203 of the Administrative Code should be given prospective application only, with the result that said provision is not applicable&nbsp; to a justice&nbsp; of the peace appointed prior to the enactment of the&nbsp; amendatory law.&nbsp; When this decision was promulgated it came&nbsp; to the attention of the plaintiff, and the present action was&nbsp; instituted by&nbsp; him shortly thereafter for&nbsp; the purpose&nbsp; of obtaining his restoration to the office.&nbsp; Practically the only defense insisted upon in the court below was&nbsp; to the effect that the action had prescribed under the one-year&nbsp; limitation contained in section 216 of the Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure; and the only question made in this appeal arises&nbsp; upon the application of said section.<br><br>&nbsp; It appears from the record&nbsp; that the plaintiff was ousted from office&nbsp; on July 7, 1923,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; defendant, as auxiliary justice of the peace, then entered upon the discharge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; duties of the&nbsp; office, by direction of&nbsp; Governor-General&nbsp; Wood,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; character&nbsp; of a temporary appointee to the vacancy.&nbsp; Later, as already stated, Suguitan entered upon the discharge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; duties of&nbsp; the&nbsp; office under commission from the Governor-General, approved by the Philippine&nbsp; Senate, effective from December&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1923. It is therefore apparent that more than a&nbsp; full&nbsp; year had elapsed between&nbsp; the removal of the plaintiff&nbsp; from&nbsp; office and the date of the institution of the present&nbsp; action; and more than a&nbsp; year had also&nbsp; elapsed after the defendant began the discharge of the duties of the office as a regularly commissioned justice of the peace.<br><br>&nbsp; The section of the Code of&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Procedure, the application of which&nbsp; is here in question, reads,&nbsp; in&nbsp; English, as follows:<br><br>&nbsp; "SEC. 216. <span style="font-style: italic;">Limitations</span>.—Nothing herein contained shall authorize an action against a&nbsp; corporation for forfeiture of charter, unless the same be commenced within five years after the act complained of was done or committed; nor shall an action be brought against an officer to be ousted from his office unless within one year after the cause&nbsp; of such ouster, or the&nbsp; right to hold the office, arose."<br><br>&nbsp; The same section as it stands in a current version of the Spanish translation&nbsp; differs&nbsp; somewhat, in the second member from the English version, as will be seen by comparing the Spanish version, which is as follows:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "ART. 216.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">De las limitaciones.</span>—Ninguna de estas disposiciones facultara la iniciacion de&nbsp; un juicio contra una corporacion por la perdida de sus derechos de concesion, a&nbsp; menos que el juicio&nbsp; se lleve a&nbsp; efecto dentro de los cinco anos&nbsp; siguientes a&nbsp; la comision u omision del hecho objeto de la accion.&nbsp; Tampoco se podra iniciar un juicio contra la persona&nbsp; que ejerza un&nbsp; cargo en una corporacion para desposeerla, a menos que se lleve a efecto dentro del ano siguiente a la&nbsp; fecha de la comision del hecho que did motivo a su privacion, o que se puso en duda su derecho para ocupar el cargo."<br><br>Upon&nbsp; comparison&nbsp; of these versions it will be seen&nbsp; that the&nbsp; word&nbsp; office&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">cargo</span>)&nbsp; in the second sentence of the Spanish version is qualified by the expression "<span style="font-style: italic;">en una corporacion"</span>&nbsp; The plaintiff, relying upon the Spanish version, insists that the provision is&nbsp; not applicable to a public office, like that of justice of&nbsp; the peace; and it is further insisted that the whole section deals exclusively with the subject&nbsp; of the writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> as used against a corporation&nbsp; or against a person&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession of a corporate office.<br><br>I am&nbsp; unable to accede to this view of the law.&nbsp; Upon examination of sections 197 to 216, inclusive, of the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure,&nbsp; it&nbsp; will be found that two subjects are there treated, namely, usurpation of franchise by corporation and usurpation of office; and the evident purpose&nbsp; of this part of the Code is to define the conditions under which the writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>&nbsp; may be used in both&nbsp; kinds&nbsp; of cases.&nbsp; Accordingly&nbsp; in the final section (sec. 216) dealing with the subject, a limitation is prescribed for both.&nbsp; The first member of the section,&nbsp; down as far as the semicolon in the English version, prescribes a limitation of five years upon any action instituted against a corporation for forfeiture of its charter.&nbsp; In the matter following the semicolon is found the limitation&nbsp; appropriate to the case where an office is involved and the action of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> is instituted to oust the incumbent&nbsp; and to secure the office for the person unlawfully kept from the occupancy thereof. The&nbsp; prescription established&nbsp; for this case is one year.<br><br>&nbsp; A careful perusal of the section, in connection with related provisions of the Code,&nbsp; leaves no room for doubt that the second member of the section was intended to&nbsp; apply to actions&nbsp; over public offices as well as&nbsp; corporate offices; and&nbsp; in this sense said provision has been&nbsp; applied by this court.&nbsp; (Bautista <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Fajardo, 38 Phil., 624.)&nbsp; The author, or authors, of the Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Procedure&nbsp; could&nbsp; hardly have intended&nbsp; for this provision&nbsp; to be&nbsp; applied only&nbsp; to corporate officers, since there is a public interest in public offices which requires there&nbsp; should be a&nbsp; prescriptive provision applicable to actions over these offices no less than to actions&nbsp; over the offices of corporations.&nbsp; The insertion by the translator into the Spanish version of the expression "<span style="font-style: italic;">en una corporacion"</span> after the word "<span style="font-style: italic;">cargo</span>" was evidently a mere mistake, resulting from a superficial attention to the context; and it will be found that in the Spanish edition&nbsp; of the Code of Civil Procedure edited by C. M. Recto this phrase has been dropped.&nbsp; It goes without saying that the English version of the Code of Civil Procedure is controlling, and in case of conflict the courts must be governed by this version.&nbsp; The suggestion contained in the opinion of the court that the Spanish version ought to be accepted as controlling in this case for the reason&nbsp; that the plaintiff knows only the Spanish language is novel and if followed by us in the future will be the source of much uncertainty in the interpretation and application of our&nbsp; statutes.<br><br>&nbsp;The opinion of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; contains a&nbsp; lengthy&nbsp; dissertation intended to demonstrate that the amendment of section 203 of the Administrative Code contained in Act No. 3107 is unconstitutional, for defect&nbsp; in the title of the Act.&nbsp; With this proposition I am also unable to agree.&nbsp; The title&nbsp; to Act No. 3107 begins with these words: "An Act to amend and repeal certain provisions of the Administrative Code relative&nbsp; to the judiciary."&nbsp; These words&nbsp; are general and in my opinion broad enough&nbsp; to include the amendment&nbsp; of section 203 relating to the appointment of justices of the peace.&nbsp; By examining the analysis of Title IV of the Administrative&nbsp; Code it&nbsp; will be found that justices of the peace are there treated as&nbsp; a part of&nbsp; the judiciary, as in fact they are; and although the provisions of Act No. 3107 are various,&nbsp; they&nbsp; have&nbsp; this&nbsp; in common,&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; deal with different parts of&nbsp; the judiciary establishment and are intended to effect changes&nbsp; in this system alone.&nbsp; It will be noted that a pronouncement as to the constitutionality of the amendment in question was by no means called for in this case, not only because the point was not raised in the discussion of the case but for the further reason that we are all&nbsp; agreed that&nbsp; said amendment&nbsp; is not applicable to the plaintiff.<br><br><i>&nbsp; Judgment reversed.</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; RESOLUTION UPON PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION<br></div><br><div style="text-align: right; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;February 26,1926<br></div><br>&nbsp;The Clerk having before it for consideration,&nbsp; (a) the motion&nbsp; of Alberto Suguitan for a reconsideration of the decision&nbsp; of the court promulgated on February&nbsp; 13, 1926, and&nbsp; (b) the motion of the Secretary of Justice, praying for leave to appear in said cause as <span style="font-style: italic;">amicus curise;</span> and after a careful review of said decision in relation with said motions, it&nbsp; is hereby ordered and decreed that said decision, heretofore announced, be modified, to the end that the decision of all the questions involved in said decision be limited to the following alone:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a)</span> That said Act&nbsp; No. 3107 can have no application to the petitioner herein, following the doctrine heretofore announced in the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Segovia <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.
