				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this proceeding for certiorari, we are called upon to annul, after the proper proceedings, an order of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Tarlac entered on August 24,&nbsp; 1923, in cadastral proceeding No. 8 of&nbsp; that&nbsp; court, G. L. R. 0. record No. 186, because,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner, said order was&nbsp; made&nbsp; without&nbsp; jurisdiction.<br><br>The&nbsp; complaint having been answered, and there being no dispute&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the facts alleged&nbsp; by the parties, the case was submitted for consideration&nbsp; and judgment, which is now rendered based on the following opinion.<br><br>The facts of the case are:<br><br>On December 2, 1910, there was issued to Monico Corpus&nbsp; Manuel a homestead patent on&nbsp; a land in Caluluan, Concepcion, Tarlac.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Exhibit 2,&nbsp; folio 47.)<br><br>On May 15, 1916, Monico Corpus Manuel&nbsp; sold said land to Bartola Liwanag&nbsp; for P600 with&nbsp; right&nbsp; of&nbsp; repurchase for the period of&nbsp; five years.<br><br>Some years&nbsp; later, cadastral proceedings were commenced covering the lands in that vicinity, which resulted in the division of the aforesaid land&nbsp; of Monico Corpus Manuel, sold&nbsp; with right of repurchase to Bartola&nbsp; Liwanag, into four lots&nbsp; Nos. 577, 578, 579&nbsp; and 580.&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; folio 57, record.)<br><br>On June 29, 1922,&nbsp; judgment was rendered in cadastral proceeding No. 8 of the Court of Tarlac, G. L. R. O. record No. 186, on the land thus divided into lots, which judgment is as follows:<br><blockquote>"It is&nbsp; decreed, after a declaration&nbsp; of&nbsp; general&nbsp; default, that the following lots be adjudicated to and registered in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the persons hereinafter to be mentioned, subject to the conditions specified as to each of them:<br><br><div align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Lot&nbsp; 577 together with lots 578,&nbsp; 579 and&nbsp; 580 have been&nbsp; adjudicated to&nbsp; Monico Corpus&nbsp; Manuel, who&nbsp; holds gratuitous&nbsp; title No. Ill,&nbsp; according to certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title No. 55 dated December 2, 1910.&nbsp; Monico Corpus&nbsp; had acquired it during&nbsp; his marriage&nbsp; with&nbsp; Rufina Romero,&nbsp; now deceased; and, as admitted by him, lot&nbsp; 577 was subdivided, separating a portion of the land south of said lot equal to a portion contained in lots 578, 579 and 580, and apart from lot 577 on the north, excluding the&nbsp; road marked on the plan with the words&nbsp; 'road to S.&nbsp; Miguel the portion south of lot 577&nbsp; having&nbsp; been adjudicated to the heirs&nbsp; of Rufina Romero by&nbsp; the names of Alberto, Juan, Antonio, Severina, Olimpia and Matilde Corpus; and the other portion north&nbsp; of said lot No. 577, with lots 578, 579 and 580 to Monico Corpus,&nbsp; subject to a lien in the sum of P700 in favor of Bartola Quingna of Angeles,&nbsp; Pampanga, payable in May, 1921.<br><br><div align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"So ordered.<br><br>"Given in Concepcion,&nbsp; Tarlac, Philippine Islands, this June 29,&nbsp; 1922.<br><br><div align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ed.

According to said judgment, lot 577 was subdivided and, as a result thereof, the new lots Nos.&nbsp; 2220 and 2221&nbsp; now stand in&nbsp; its place, as may be seen from the plans&nbsp; Exhibits B and B-l&nbsp; (folios 11 and&nbsp; 12 of the record).<br><br>On August&nbsp; 19, 1922, in&nbsp; view of&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; land was not repurchased, the period for the repurchase having expired,&nbsp; Bartola Liwanag brought action in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Tarlac against Monico Corpus Manuel, concerning her title to the land already consolidated. On June&nbsp; 19, 1923, that court rendered&nbsp; judgment, the disposing part of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"In view thereof, judgment is entered&nbsp; as prayed for by said plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title to the&nbsp; land described&nbsp; in the complaint and more particularly in transfer certificate of title No. 493 of the Province of&nbsp; Tarlac is adjudged consolidated in Bartola Liwanag and the heirs of her deceased&nbsp; husband Lupo Ramos;&nbsp; and the defendant Monico Corpus Manuel is hereby ordered to surrender said certificate of title to the register of deeds of the Province of Tarlac, in order&nbsp; that said officer may cancel it and issue another, in accordance herewith, to Bartola Liwanag and the heirs of the latter's deceased&nbsp; husband, Lupo Ramos.&nbsp; The defendant is further ordered to pay said Bartola Liwanag and the heirs of the deceased&nbsp; Lupo Ramos&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of nine hundred&nbsp; pesos, as rental&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land in question&nbsp; for the five years that he had&nbsp; been in possession&nbsp; thereof as&nbsp; tenant;&nbsp; and said defendant is finally ordered to pay the costs of the suit.<br><br>"So ordered.<br>"Tarlac,&nbsp; Tarlac,&nbsp; January&nbsp; 19, 1923.<br><div align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"<i>Judge</i>."<br></div></blockquote>On February 27,&nbsp; 1923, said judgment&nbsp; having become final, transfer&nbsp; certificate No. 546 was issued to Bartola Liwanag, to effect the transfer of the title issued to Monico Corpus Manuel.&nbsp; (See Exhibit 5, folio 55, record.)<br><br>On May&nbsp; 17, 1923, Bartola&nbsp; Liwanag petitioned the lower court that&nbsp; the titles to the aforesaid lots Nos. 577, 578, 579 and 580 be issued to her&nbsp; and the heirs of her deceased husband&nbsp; Lupo Ramos.<br><br>On August&nbsp; 24, 1923, the lower court&nbsp; passed upon this petition,&nbsp; and entered&nbsp; the following order:<br><blockquote>"This matter is&nbsp; before the court upon a motion for the issuance&nbsp; of certificates of title relative&nbsp; to lots 577, 578, 579 and&nbsp; 580 of the above entitled proceeding in the name of Bartola&nbsp; Liwanag and&nbsp; her husband Lupo Ramos in view of the fact that the land formed by these lots is the very land covered by gratuitous title No. 55,&nbsp; registered in the registry of property of this province and issued to Monico Corpus Manuel.&nbsp; On May 15, 1916,&nbsp; Bartola&nbsp; Liwanag and her husband bought this property with right of repurchase from Monico Corpus&nbsp; Manuel, and the conditions of said sale&nbsp; were such that the vendor could repurchase the land within five years from the date of said sale; and by virtue thereof, the transfer certificate of title No. 493 was issued to the purchasers.<br><br>"Monico&nbsp; Corpus&nbsp; Manuel not having&nbsp; made&nbsp; use&nbsp; of his right of&nbsp; redemption within the period stipulated, Bartola Liwanag filed a complaint in this court on August 21, 1922, against&nbsp; Monico Corpus&nbsp; Manuel,&nbsp; praying,&nbsp; among other things, for&nbsp; the consolidation of her and her husband's title (civil case&nbsp; No. 1748.)&nbsp;&nbsp; After the proper proceedings, the court rendered judgment which has become final and subject to execution, declaring consolidated the title of Bartola Liwanag and&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of her husband Lupo&nbsp; Ramos (Exhibit&nbsp; Liwanag-A)&nbsp; to&nbsp; the land described more particularly in transfer certificate of title No. 493.&nbsp; By virtue of said judgment, a new transfer certificate of title No. 546 over the same land (Exhibit Liwanag-B) was issued to Bartola Liwanag and the heirs of her deceased husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; This land is now formed by lots Nos. 577, 578, 579 and 580, according to the declaration of Monico Corpus Manuel and&nbsp; the plans presented (Exhibits Liwanag-C and Liwanag-D).<br><br>"Upon the declaration of&nbsp; the witness Monico&nbsp; Corpus Manuel, expressing his agreement to the motion of Bartola Liwanag, the&nbsp; court grants the&nbsp; petition of Bartola Liwanag, and hereby orders the Chief of the General Land Registration Office to issue in the name of Bartola Liwanag and the heirs of her&nbsp; deceased husband Lupo Ramos certificates of title for lots 577, 578, 579 and 580.<br><br>"So ordered.<br><br>"Tarlac, Tarlac,&nbsp; August 24, 1923.<br><div align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

What the judgment of June 29, 1922,&nbsp; intended in said cadastral&nbsp; proceeding was merely a partition of said&nbsp; land, which, as&nbsp; appears from&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; itself, was&nbsp; based only on the admission of Monico&nbsp; Corpus Manuel&nbsp; himself, instead of going through the procedure prescribed by sections 19 to 24 of Act&nbsp; No. 2259 in such cases.<br><br>It does not appear that any decree was issued under said judgment,&nbsp; and no decree was issued undoubtedly because the execution of the judgment that one month and a few days&nbsp; thereafter was rendered in&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case No. 1748,&nbsp; declaring the consolidation of Bartola Liwanag's title to&nbsp; the whole of the land, met with no opposition; and&nbsp; so, on February 27, 1923, the register of deeds issued, pursuant to said judgment,&nbsp; the transfer certificate of title&nbsp; of&nbsp; the land to Bartola Liwanag.<br><br>It results,&nbsp; therefore, that since&nbsp; the year 1910, when&nbsp; the title over the land in question was issued to Monico Corpus Manuel as homesteader, until February, 1923, when&nbsp; the certificate of the transfer of said&nbsp; title&nbsp; was issued to Bartola Liwanag, this land, according&nbsp; to the Land Registration Act and the&nbsp; books&nbsp; of the register of deeds, belonged first to Monico Corpus Manuel and then to Bartola Liwanag in full ownership.<br><br>The only thing that at the first sight seems&nbsp; to&nbsp; defeat the right and title of Bartola Liwanag is&nbsp; the aforementioned judgment of June&nbsp; 29, 1922,&nbsp; in the cadastral proceeding. But as&nbsp; already stated, said judgment does not define nor adjudicate any title to land, because said land had already been&nbsp; adjudicated before with the same&nbsp; force&nbsp; and effect as under the same Act No. 496&nbsp; to which said cadastral proceeding was subject.<br><br>And the partition intended in said judgment of June&nbsp; 29, 1922,&nbsp; supposing it to have been made according to law, — which does not seem to be the case,—could not and cannot affect the title to the land&nbsp; partitioned.&nbsp; Such a partition intended in said cadastral proceeding is, as already stated, subject to&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of Act&nbsp; No. 2259, section 22 of which provides that an order of&nbsp; partition of this nature shall have&nbsp; the same force and effect as a final judgment in actions for partition under the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure.<br><br>And&nbsp; a final judgment&nbsp; in&nbsp; actions for partition&nbsp; under this&nbsp; Code&nbsp; cannot affect preferential rights according to section&nbsp; 196 thereof, the first part of which says: <blockquote>."Nothing herein&nbsp; contained shall be construed so as to injure,&nbsp; prejudice, defeat,&nbsp; or destroy the&nbsp; estate, right, or title of any person claiming a tract of land, or any part thereof, by title under&nbsp; any other person, or by title paramount to the title of the joint tenants, tenants in common, or coparceners by whom partition may have been made." </blockquote>And it is a fact that on the date of said judgment,—June 29, 1922,—the period within which Monico Corpus Manuel could have repurchased&nbsp; the land had expired, and therefore Bartola Liwanag had already acquired irrevocable title to said land&nbsp; (art. 1509, Civil Code), as was later judicially declared in civil&nbsp; case No. 1748 aforementioned.<br><br>Hence the order of August 24,&nbsp; 1923 (Exhibit D, folio 16), above set out, attacked as&nbsp; void and as having been entered without jurisdiction, is valid and effective, having been issued by a court&nbsp; with full&nbsp; jurisdiction.<br><br>Such order of August 24,&nbsp; 1923, does not&nbsp; review any decree, as there was none; nor does it review the judgment rendered in the aforesaid cadastral proceeding concerning land title,&nbsp; because said judgment&nbsp; of June&nbsp; 29, 1922,&nbsp; did not,&nbsp; nor could it,&nbsp; contain any&nbsp; adjudication of title, as above&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; for said&nbsp; judgment limits itself to&nbsp; making a partition of the land,&nbsp; which&nbsp; the same judgment acknowledges to have already been registered.<br><br>This is,&nbsp; therefore, no occasion for determining whether or not the order of August 24, 1923, is based on section 38 of Act No. 496 invoked by the petitioner; because&nbsp; said order was&nbsp; made&nbsp; for the purpose of enforcing, under&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 196 of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure, the indefeasible and&nbsp; preferential title which Bartola&nbsp; Liwanag had acquired over&nbsp; the lands in&nbsp; question. There is&nbsp; a circumstance in said order of August 24,1923, which&nbsp; must not be overlooked, and that is&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that it was addressed to the Chief of the General Land Registration&nbsp; Office, when&nbsp; it should have been to the register of deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, however,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; affect the jurisdiction of the trial court.<br><br>We hold that in entering the order of August 24,&nbsp; 1923, in cadastral proceeding&nbsp; No. 8, G. L. R. 0. record No. 186, relative to lots Nos. 577, 578, 579, and 580 of said proceeding, the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Tarlac did not exceed its jurisdiction, but did so with full authority and power.<br><br>The writ herein applied for is denied, and the petition<br><br>dismissed&nbsp; without costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Johnson, Street, Avancena, Villamor, </i>and <i>Ostrand, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Malcolm,&nbsp; J, </i>dissents.</div>
