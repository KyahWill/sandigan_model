				<H3>PRUDENCIA CHUA TAN ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. LUCIA DEL ROSARIO, ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED, CHUA TOCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>This is an appeal by the plaintiffs, Prudencia Chua Tan and others, from the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila finally dismissing their 
complaint and absolving the defendant, Lucia del Rosario, as administratrix of 
the intestate estate of Chua Toco, with costs against said appellants. 
<p>In support of their appeal the appellants assign thefollowing alleged errors 
as committed by the trial court in its decision, to wit: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The lower court erred in sustaining the defendant-appellee's defense of 
res judicata, on the ground that this case has already been decided by the 
Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands on May 14, 1927 in civil ease G. R. No. 
26258, No. 25797 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, instituted by 
Benedicta Santa Juana, as administratrix of the intestate estate of Chua Piaco 
against Lucia del Rosario, also as administratrix of the intestate estate of 
Chua Toco.</p>
<p>"2. The lower court also erred in holding that the P20,000 belonged to Chua 
Toco exclusively, when the evidence shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Chua 
Toco received part of this sum of money from his adoptive fatther, Chua Piaco, 
the predecessor-in-interest of the herein plaintiffs- appellants; and that this 
sum of P20,000 deposited in a current account bearing1 interest at twelve per 
cent per annum, with the firm Ty Cameo Sobrino, amounted to P77,118.90 on April 
24, 1913 when the liquidation was made; which sum is the exclusive property of 
Chua Piaco and Chua Toco, father and son. </p>
<p>"3. The lower court also erred in not finding that the sum of P38,559.30 
which is one-half of the P77,118.60 that Chua Toco had used to purchase a piece 
of land on Antonio Rivera Street, expropriated by the Manila Railroad, Company, 
in civil case No. 12832 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, belongs to the 
herein plaintiffs-appellants as surviving spouse and heirs of the late Chua 
Piaco, and to the Intestate Estate of Chua Toco, as adopted son of Chua Piaco. 
</p>
<p>"4. The lower court likewise erred in finally dismissing the complaint filed 
by the herein plaintiffs-appellants, and in sentencing the latter to pay the 
costs of the trial. </p>
<p>"5. The lower court erred in denying the motion for a new trial filed in this 
case by the plaintiffs-appellants."</p></blockquote>
<p>Before entering into the merits of the case, we must decide the question of 
procedure raised by the plaintiffs in their first assignment of error quoted 
above, namely, that the trial court erred in holding that the question here 
raised has already been finally decided in civil case No. 25797 of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, and is res jvdicata.</p>
<p>Section 306 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 306. <i>Effect of judgment</i>-The effect of a judgment or final order 
in an action or special proceeding before a court or judge of the Philippine 
Islands or of the United States, or of any State or Territory of the United 
States, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or order, may be as 
follows: </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>"2. In other cases the judgment so ordered is, in respect to the matter 
directly adjudged, conclusive between the parties and their successors in 
interest by title subsequent to commencement of the action or special 
proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the 
same capacity." </p></blockquote>
<p>And section 307 of the same Code of procedure reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 307. What is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment-That 
only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment which appears upon its 
face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included 
therein or necessary thereto." </p></blockquote>
<p>In Penalosa vs. Tuason (22 Phil., 303), this court, interpreting the 
provisions quoted above, held: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. 'RES ADJUDICATA' ; ESTOPPEL BY JUDGMENT.-The two main rules based on the 
doctrine of res judicata or estoppel by judgment as known to Anglo-American 
jurisprudence are as follows:</p>
<p>"(a) That judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction on the 
merits is a bar to any future suit between the same parties or their privies 
upon the same cause of action, so long as it remains unreversed; </p>
<p>"(b) A point which was actually and directly in issue in a former suit, and 
was there judicially passed upon and determined by a domestic court of competent 
jurisdiction, cannot be again drawn in question in any future action between the 
same parties or their privies, even when the causes of action in the two suits 
are wholly different. </p>
<p>"2. ID.; ID.; A DISTINCTION.-The difference between the effect of a judgment 
as a bar or estoppel against the prosecution of a second action upon the same 
claim or demand, and its effect as an estoppel in another action between the 
same parties upon a different claim or cause of action, is that in the former 
case the judgment, if rendered upon the merits, constitutes an absolute bar to a 
subsequent action, and is a finality as to the claim or demand in controversy, 
concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter 
which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as 
to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose. 
While in the latter case the judgment in the prior action operates as an 
estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted upon the 
determination of which the finding or judgment was rendered." </p></blockquote>
<p>There is no question that in civil case No. 25797 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, the question there raised was finally decided by a final 
judgment of dismissal, affirmed by this court on appeal.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> </p>
<p>The first question to decide is whether there is identity of parties in that 
case and in this one. </p>
<p>In civil case No. 25797 the plaintiff was Benedicta Santa Juana, as judicial 
administratrix of the intestate estate of Chua Piaco, and the defendant was 
Lucia del Rosario, as administratrix of the intestate estate of Chua Toco. In 
the present case the plaintiffs are the presumptive heirs of the late Chua Piaco 
and the defendant is Lucia del Rosario, as administratrix of the intestate 
estate of Chua Toco. </p>
<p>It is the duty of the administrator of the testate or intestate estate of a 
deceased to present an inventory of the real estate and all goods, chattels, 
rights, and credits of the deceased which have come into his possession or 
knowledge, in accordance with the provisions of section 668 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, and to manage them according to section 643 of the same Code; and in 
order that he may have in his power and under his custody all such property, 
section 702 of the aforesaid Code authorizes him to bring such actions for the 
purpose as he may deem necessary. Section 642 in providing for the appointment 
of an administrator where there is no will or the will does not name an 
executor, seeks to protect not only the estate of the deceased but also the 
rights of the creditors in order that they may be able to collect their credits, 
and of the heirs and legatees in order that they may receive the portion of the 
inheritance or legacy appertaining to them after all the debts and expenses 
chargeable against the deceased's estate have been paid. Under the provisions of 
the law, therefore, the judicial administrator is the legal representative not 
only of the testate or intestate estate, but also of the creditors, and heirs 
and legatees, inasmuch as he represents their interest in the estate of the 
deceased. </p>
<p>Benedicta Santa Juana, as administratrix of the intestate estate of the late 
Chua Piaco, was the legal representative not only of said estate but also of its 
creditors and heirs. In view of this relation of agent and principal between her 
and the plaintiffs in the present case, the decision rendered against Benedicta 
Santa Juana, as such administratrix, in the former case is conclusive and 
binding upon said plaintiffs in the present case, in accordance with section 306 
of the Code of Civil Procedure cited above. (Spaths vs. Hanley, 85 Cal., 155; 
Schwarz vs. Bohle, 47 Cal. Ap., 445; Cunningham vs. Ashley, 45 Cal., 485; Lloyd 
vs. Ball, 77 Fed., 365.) With reference to the parties plaintiffs, then, while 
there is no real identity between the plaintiff in civil case No. 25797 of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, and the plaintiffs in the present case, 
nevertheless, there exists between them the relation of legal representation by 
virtue of which the decision rendered in such case against the former binds the 
latter. </p>
<p>With respect to the parties defendant, there is no question that the 
defendant in the first case is the same in the present and appears in the same 
capacity. </p>
<p>The second question to decide is whether or not there is identity of subject 
matter. In the former case the petition was for the rendering of an accounting 
of certain funds alleged to have been delivered in trust by the late Chua Piaco 
to his adopted son, the late Chua Toco. In the present case the petition is for 
the partition of those same funds and their fruits between the heirs of both 
deceased. Therefore, the subject matter of the litigation is the same, and, 
consequently, there is perfect identity of subject matter. </p>
<p>As to whether or not there is identity of cause of action, in the former case 
it was alleged that the late Chua Piaco had delivered in trust to his adopted 
son, the late Chua Toco, certain funds and that the judicial administratrix of 
the latter's intestate estate had refused to render an accounting of said funds 
and the fruits thereof. In the present case the plaintiffs include the same 
allegation of trust, and the defendant makes the same denial, except that 
instead of a rendition of accounts, the partition of said funds and the products 
thereof is asked. </p>
<p>The cause of action in the former case is therefore identical with the cause 
of action in the present case, and is predicated on one and the same alleged 
right of action arising out of an alleged trust, and the same general denial and 
special defense. </p>
<p>It is true that the relief sought, the rendition of accounts in the former 
case, is different from the relief sought in the case now before us, which is 
the partition of funds, but the question at issue, upon the determination of 
which depended the granting or denial of such relief, is the same, namely, 
whether Chua Piaco or Chua Toco was the owner of said funds. This question was 
definitely decided in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff, the 
complaint having been finally dismissed, wherein the latter had alleged, as we 
have stated, that the aforesaid funds and the products thereof belonged to the 
late Chua Piaco, who had delivered the principal to his adopted son, Chua Toco, 
by way of trust. Therefore, the relief sought in both cases necessarily 
involves, as a main question, the ownership of the aforementioned funds and its 
products. </p>
<p>Briefly: (1) While there is no identity between the plaintiff in the former 
case and the plaintiffs in the present ease, there is the relation of 
representation between them; (2) there is identity of cause of action; (3) there 
is identity of subject matter; and (4) there is identity of issue, upon which 
depends the granting or denial of the relief sought in each of said cases, and 
this issue has been impliedly decided in the former case. Therefore, all the 
elements of res judicata in accordance with the aforecited legal provisions are 
present. </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations we are of the opinion and so hold 
that a final judgment upon the merits rendered against the judicial 
administratrix of an intestate estate, as such, in a case where she is plaintiff 
and the administratrix of another intestate estate, as such, is the defendant, 
in which she seeks to secure an accounting of funds alleged to have been 
delivered in trust by the deceased, represented by the plaintiff administratrix, 
to the other deceased, represented by the defendant administratrix, constitutes 
res judicata in another case where the heirs of the alleged donor are plaintiffs 
and the administratrix of the supposed trustee is defendant, and in which the 
partition of the same funds and the products thereof is sought between the heirs 
of both, under the same allegation of trust, the alleged trustee being the 
adopted child of the donor. </p>
<p>Having reached this conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to discuss and decide 
the questions raised in the remaining assignments of error. </p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no error in the judgment appealed from, it is hereby 
affirmed in toto, with costs against the appellants. So ordered. </p>
