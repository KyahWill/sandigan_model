				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In December, 1917, this action was instituted in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Tayabas in the name&nbsp; of Juan Marin as plaintiff,&nbsp; at the instance of his attorney-in-fact, Jose Palacios Lahoz,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of recovering&nbsp; from the Manila Railroad Co. the value of certain land&nbsp; now occupied by it&nbsp; in the municipality of Candelaria, in&nbsp; the Province of Tayabas, and used by it for railroad purposes,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as to recover an adjacent strip of land alleged not to be used by the railroad company for its&nbsp; corporate&nbsp; purposes, together with damages and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; On&nbsp; June 18,&nbsp; 1920, the court,&nbsp; in open session, granted to Lahoz leave to intervene as a plaintiff in the cause, upon his representation that he had acquired from&nbsp; Marin the interest of the latter in the subject matter in litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; No amended complaint&nbsp; was filed pursuant to the authority thus granted, and the record continued to stand upon the leave thus granted by the court in these words:&nbsp; "The plaintiff is permitted to amend his complaint in the sense of including Sr. Jose Palacios Lahoz as plaintiff."<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that the railroad company had taken possession of the property which is the subject matter of&nbsp; this action in&nbsp; virtue of&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; of expropriation which it had instituted&nbsp; in 1907 against Hermenegildo Nadres, the then&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; owner of the property.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; therefore thought desirable by the railroad company to file a crosscomplaint against Nadres for the purpose of&nbsp; warranty in case of eviction, and Nadres was so included at the request of the defendant.&nbsp; Later Nadres&nbsp; died and the&nbsp; litigation instituted by Marin in the case now before us suffered extended delay&nbsp; from the death of said party.&nbsp; Finally, upon the initiative of the plaintiff,&nbsp; one Juan R. Brano was procured to be named as&nbsp; administrator of Nadres, and the proceedings pursued their way towards final resolution. After the proof in&nbsp; chief had&nbsp; all&nbsp; been taken, and&nbsp; the cause was approaching final&nbsp; submission,&nbsp; the&nbsp; attorney for the defendant made a motion, on&nbsp; May 22, 1930, to dismiss the case for uncertainty as to the personality of&nbsp; the plaintiff and an alleged&nbsp; inconsistency in the allegations of the complaint and subsequent proceedings with respect to the personality&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; This motion to dismiss&nbsp; was granted in an order of the&nbsp; presiding judge&nbsp; on May 29, 1930,&nbsp; and after motion for reconsideration had been interposed, the court amplified said order on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1930, denying the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>We&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the opinion that the motion to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; was improperly sustained, and the cause must be returned to the court of origin&nbsp; for a hearing on&nbsp; the merits, with leave to the plaintiff to file an amended complaint and to submit proof in rebuttal, if desired.<br><br>We observe that the&nbsp; only effect of the dismissal of the case would&nbsp; be to impose&nbsp; upon the plaintiff the task of filing a new complaint, with the probable result that the whole business would have to be gone over again.<br><br>It cannot be fairly said upon this record that the plaintiff is to blame for the many delays that the case has suffered, and especially with reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment of an administrator of Hermenegildo Nadres,&nbsp; as this individual was made defendant at the instance of the defendant, and it was in the first place the duty&nbsp; of the defendant to procure said representation to be brought in if necessary for its protection.<br><br>We note that it makes no difference whether Lahoz was intended by the court to be substituted for the original plaintiff Marin or whether Lahoz was intended to&nbsp; be brought in merely as an additional plaintiff, since the proper thing to do in the end, would be to award judgment in favor of the real party in interest as might appear from the proof.<br><br>It was of&nbsp; course&nbsp; desirable that an&nbsp; amended complaint should have&nbsp; been filed for the addition of Lahoz as a plaintiff, but the&nbsp; parties to the case&nbsp; apparently assumed that he had acquired the status of a party by virtue of&nbsp; the&nbsp; leave granted by the court for him to come in "as plaintiff, and if the defendant had thought it desirable to raise the question over the alleged&nbsp; uncertainty as to the&nbsp; personality of the plaintiff, it would have done well to have raised&nbsp; the question sooner, without going to proof&nbsp; on the merits.&nbsp; There is good reason for&nbsp; holding that the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; had waived the formal presentation of an amended&nbsp; complaint, and the court at least erred in not conceding to the plaintiff the right to file an amended complaint when attention was called to the state of&nbsp; the record.<br><br>The order appealed from is set aside and the cause remanded to the court of origin for further proceedings.&nbsp; So ordered, without costs.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br>OSTRAND, <i>J.</i>: I dissent.</div>
