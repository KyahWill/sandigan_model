				<H3>IDONAH SLADE PERKINS, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.

<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petitioner, Idonah Slade Perkins, was adjudged guilty of contempt
by the Court of First Instance of Manila for disobedience of a final
judgment thereof, dated August 4, 1930, requiring the petitioner (<em>a</em>)
to render an accounting to her husband, Eugene Arthur Perkins, of all
the conjugal property in her possession or under her control; (<em>b</em>) to convey, transfer, and deliver to her husband all such conjugal property as might result from said accounting; and (<em>c</em>)
to execute in favor of her husband all such deeds and documents as
might be necessary in order that her husband's title thereto might
legally appear. The court ordered that the petitioner be imprisoned
until she comply with the orders of the court contained in said
judgment. On appeal, the order of commitment for contempt was affirmed
by this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  <p>
The petitioner now claims, in effect, that her imprisonment under said
order of commitment for contempt was unlawful, and that she is,
therefore, entitled to be discharged by a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
  <p>
It would be prolix to dwell at length upon the nature and purpose of
the great writ of habeas corpus. If we did so, we would have to trace
its history back to the early struggles for individual rights and
liberties. Suffice it to say, therefore, that in this jurisdiction, the
writ of habeas corpus extends "to all cases of illegal confinement or
detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, or by which
the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled
thereto, except in cases expressly excepted." (Code of Civil Procedure,
section 525.) But the statute also provides that the writ shall not be
allowed "if it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his
liberty is in custody of an officer under process issued by a court or
magistrate, or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record,
and that the court or magistrate had jurisdiction to issue the process,
render the judgment, or make the order." (Code of Civil Procedure,
section 528.)</p>
  <p> In the case at bar, it is admitted that the
petitioner was in the custody of the respondent Director of Prisons by
virtue of an order of commitment for contempt by the Court of First
Instance of Manila. The question before us is, therefore, limited to an
inquiry into the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance of Manila
to make the aforesaid order.</p>
  <p> The power to punish for
contempt is inherent in all courts; its existence is essential to the
preservation of order in judicial proceedings and to the enforcement of
judgments, orders, and mandates of the courts, and, consequently, to
the due administration of justice. (<em>Ex parte</em> Terry, 128 U. S., 225; 32 Law. ed., 405; <em>In re</em> Kelly, 35 Phil., 944.) In State <em>vs.</em>
Magee Publishing Company (38 A. L. R., 142. 144), the court said: "The
exercise of this power is as old as the English history itself, and has
always been regarded as a necessary incident and attribute of courts.
Being a common-law power, inherent in all courts, the moment the courts
of the United States were called into existence they became vested with
it. It is a power coming to us from the common law, and, so far as we
know, has been universally admitted and recognized. (4 Lewis's Bl.
Com., sec. 286, p. 1675; Oswald, Contempt, Canadian ed., pp. 1-3; 6 R.
C. L., 489; State <em>vs.</em> Morrill, 16 Ark., 390; State <em>ex rel</em>. Rodd <em>vs.</em> Verage, 177 Wis., 295; 23 A. L. R., 491; 187 N. W., 830; and People <em>ex rel</em>. Brundage <em>vs.</em>
Peters, 305 111., 223; 26 A. L. R., 16; 137 N. E., 118.) A splendid
review of the origin and history of such power, supported by a wealth
of authority, as well as its universal recognition, both at common law,
and in the United States, may be found in State <em>ex rel</em>. Crow <em>vs.</em> Shepherd (177 Mo., 205; 99 Am. St. Rep., 624; 76 S. W., 79), to which the bar is referred."</p>
  <p>
Our statute expressly recognizes the power of the Courts of First
Instance and of the judges thereof to punish contempts of court. It
divides contempts into two kinds, namely: (1) Direct contempts, which
may be published summarily; and (2) constructive contempts, which may
be punished only after due hearing. A direct contempt under the statute
is "misbehavior in the presence of or so near the court or judge as to
obstruct the administration of justice, including the refusal of a
person present in court to be sworn as a witness or to answer as a
witness when lawfully required." (Code of Civil Procedure, section
231); and any of the following acts constitutes an indirect contempt,
namely:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">    *	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>
    <p>"1.
Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order,
judgment, or command of a court, or injunction granted by a court or
judge; </p>
    <p>"2. Misbehavior of an officer of the court in the performance of his official duties, or in his official transactions;</p>
    <p> "3. A failure to obey a <em>subpoena</em> duly served; </p>
    <p>"4.
The rescue, or attempted rescue, of a person or property in the custody
of an officer by virtue of an order or process of the court held by him.</p>
    <p>
"5. The person defeated in a civil action concerning the ownership or
possession of real estate who, after having been evicted by the sheriff
from the realty under litigation in compliance with the judgment
rendered, shall enter or attempt to enter upon the same for the purpose
of executing acts of ownership or possession or who shall in any manner
disturb possession by the person whom the sheriff placed in possession
of said realty." (Code of Civil Procedure, section 232, as amended.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
As to constructive contempts, section 236 of the Code of Civil
Procedure provides that "the court shall then determine whether the
accused is guilty of the contempt charged; and, if it be adjudged that
he is guilty, he may be fined not exceeding one thousand pesos, or
imprisoned not more than six months, or both. If the contempt consists
in the violation of an injunction, the person guilty of such contempt
may also be ordered to make complete restitution to the party injured
by such violation." And section 237 further provides that "when the
contempt consists of the omission to do an act, which is yet in power
of the accused to perform, he may be imprisoned until he performs it."</p>
  <p>
The exercise of the power to punish contempt has a twofold aspect,
namely: First, the proper punishment of the guilty party for his
disrespect to the court or its order, and the second, to compel his
performance of some act or duty required of him by the court, which he
refuses to perform. (<em>In re</em> Chiles, 22 Wall., 157; 22 Law. ed.,
819.) Due perhaps to this twofold aspect of the exercise of the power
to punish them, contempts are classified as civil or criminal. A civil
contempt has been defined as the failure to do something ordered to be
done by a court or a judge in a civil case for the benefit of the
opposing party therein; and a criminal contempt, as conduct that is
directed against the authority and dignity of a court or of a judge
acting judicially, as in unlawfully assailing or discrediting the
authority and dignity of the court or judge, or in doing a duly
forbidden act. Concerning the distinction between civil and criminal
contempts, the court, in Hammond Lumber Co. <em>vs.</em> Sailors'
Union of the Pacific (167 Fed., 809), said: "The power to punish for
contempt is universally recognized as one inherent in the very nature
and purpose of courts of justice; it is coeval with their power to
administer justice, and, while it may be in some respects limited,
cannot be entirely taken away. It subserves at once the double office
of protecting the dignity and authority of the tribunal and aiding in
the enforcement of civil remedies, and may be exerted in either civil
or criminal cases, or independently of either, and either solely for
the preservation of the court's authority, or in aid of the rights of
the litigant, or for both those purposes combined. By reason of this
twofold attribute, proceedings in contempt are regarded as being in
their nature anomalous—that is, possessed of characteristics which
render them more or less difficult of ready or definite classification
in the realm of judicial power; and this has led to their being aptly
styled <em>sui generis</em>. That they are largely of a criminal
nature, by reason of the power being one to convict and punish for
wrong committed, is universally conceded; and yet that in some respects
they partake, by reason of the ends subserved, of the nature of a civil
remedy, is likewise recognized. This dual characteristic has given rise
to many and bitter controversies in the courts, the difficulty being,
in most cases, to determine when a particular proceeding assumes the
criminal rather than the civil aspect, or when of both; and if the
latter, which feature must control. * * * An examination of these cases
will disclose that that court has from the first declared, and since
consistently maintained, that contempt proceedings, while not to be
regarded as in any sense a substitute for the ordinary criminal laws of
the country (<em>Ex parte</em> Debs, 158 U. S., 564; 15 Sup. Ct. Rep.,
900; 39 Law. ed., 1092), yet, by reason of the very nature of the power
involved, they are in their essential characteristics to be deemed
primarily criminal and punitory; that while they possess in a sense and
for certain purposes a civil and remedial aspect, growing out of the
fact that they may be invoked to coerce or aid in the enforcement of a
private right or remedy, this aspect can only arise in any instance out
of the nature and purpose of the punishment adjudicated, and then only
to affect the question of how the judgment awarding such punishment may
be reviewed. In other words, the result of those cases is that where
the punishment imposed, whether against a party to the suit or a
stranger, is wholly or primarily to protect and vindicate the dignity
and power of the court, either by fine payable to the government, or by
imprisonment, or both, it is deemed a judgment in a criminal case and
subject to review only in the manner provided for review of judgments
in criminal cases; but where the punishment is by fine directed to be
paid to a party in the nature of damages for the wrong inflicted, or by
imprisonment as a coercive measure to enforce the performance of some
act for the benefit of the party, or in aid of the final judgment or
decree rendered in his behalf, in such case the contempt judgment will,
if made before final decree, be treated as in the nature of an
interlocutory order, or, if made after final decree, as remedial in
nature, and will be reviewed only on appeal from the final decree, or
in such other mode as is appropriate to the review of judgments in
civil cases. And certain it is, as will furthermore be seen, that the
contention of complainant, that the nature of the contempt proceeding
in any case necessarily partakes of the nature of the original action
or proceeding out of which it arises, is wholly unfounded. The fact
that a contempt has arisen in a civil action, such as this, in no way
tends to characterize the nature of the proceeding for its correction.
While it is true that it would be hard to imagine a contempt of a civil
aspect arising in a criminal case, it is equally true that acts of
contempt of a criminal aspect do—and must frequently—arise in actions
of a purely civil character."</p>
  <p>  Another much-cited case is that of <em>In re</em>
Nevitt (117 Fed., 448), wherein the court remarked: "Proceedings for
contempts are of two classes,—those prosecuted to preserve the power
and vindicate the dignity of the courts, and to punish for disobedience
of their orders, and those instituted to preserve and enforce the
rights of private parties to suits, and to compel obedience to orders
and decrees made to enforce the rights and administer the remedies to
which the court has found them to be entitled. The former are criminal
and punitive in their nature, and the government, the courts, and the
people are interested in their prosecution. The latter are civil,
remedial, and coercive in their nature, and the parties chiefly in
interest in their conduct and prosecution are the individuals whose
private rights and remedies they were instituted to protect or enforce
* * * A criminal contempt involves no element of personal injury. It is
directed against the power and dignity of the court, and private
parties have little if any interest in the proceedings for its
punishment. But if the contempt consists in the refusal of a party or a
person to do an act which the court has ordered him to do for the
benefit or the advantage of a party to a suit or action pending before
it, and he is committed until he complies with the order, the
commitment is in the nature of an execution to enforce the judgment of
the court, and the party in whose favor that judgment was rendered is
the real party in interest in the proceedings."</p>
  <p> As applied
to the present case, the distinction between civil and criminal
contempts, is not an important consideration; and, except for the
seriousness with which the point has been pressed, we would not have
discussed it at some length. The question of whether the contempt for
which the petitioner was committed is civil or criminal, does not
affect either the jurisdiction or the power of the court in the
premises. As stated by the court in People <em>ex rel</em>. Brundage <em>vs.</em>
Peters (305 Ill., 223; 26 A. L. R., 16, 18, 19): "The principal reason
for the classification seems to arise out of the form of the
proceedings in the two classes of cases. In the one case the
proceedings may be an incident to a pending suit and serve two
purposes. In addition to vindicating the authority and dignity of the
court, the proceedings may also advance the relief granted a party to
the litigation. In the other class of contempts the application for
punishment may be made in the name of the people. There is no
difference in the power of the court to administer punishment in the
two classes of contempts or in the penalty that may be inflicted. 'The
dividing line between the acts constituting criminal and those
constituting civil contempts1 becomes indistinct in those cases where
the two gradually merge into each other. In those cases contempts have
been classified and punished by the courts in some jurisdictions as
criminal contempts, and in others as civil contempts. Some courts
adhere to the rule defining them as civil or criminal contempts,
according to the character of the suit in which they occur, designating
them as civil contempts if the original suit is a civil suit, and as
criminal contempts if they arise in an original suit criminal in form.
In most cases where they thus rest on the boundary line they are both
civil and criminal contempts, and, so far as the rights of the
contemners are concerned, may be punished as either.' (People <em>vs.</em> Elbert, 287 Ill.,  458; 122 N. E., 816.) " And in <em>Ex parte</em>
Grossman (267 U. S., 87; 69 Law. ed., 527, 532), the Supreme Court of
the United States, through Chief Justice Taft, said: "In the Gompers
case this court points out that it is not the fact of punishment, but
rather its character and purpose that makes the difference between the
two kinds of contempts. For civil contempts, the punishment is remedial
and for the benefit of the complainant, and a pardon cannot stop it.
For criminal contempts, the sentence is punitive in the public interest
to vindicate the authority of the court and to deter other like
derelictions."</p>
  <p> In the light of the principles above
considered, it seems clear that the Court of First Instance of Manila
had jurisdiction of the offense charged against the petitioner—contempt
of court. It had jurisdiction of the person of the petitioner who was
properly brought before the court. It had jurisdiction to hear the
charge and the evidence against the petitioner. It had jurisdiction to
hear and to decide upon the defenses offered by her.</p>
  <p> The
general rule is that when the court has jurisdiction by law of the
offense charged and of the party who is so charged, its judgments,
orders or decrees are not subject to collateral attacks by habeas
corpus. The writ of habeas corpus can not be made to perform the
function of a writ of error. (<em>Re</em> Eckart, 166 U. S., 481, 485; 41 Law. ed., 1085). In Gutierrez Repide <em>vs.</em>
Peterson (3 Phil., 276), this court held that an order made by a court
within the limits of its jurisdiction, even if erroneous, will not be
set aside on habeas corpus.</p>
  <p> We are now brought to consider
the question of whether the petitioner has purged herself of contempt.
It is claimed that she has already complied with the order of the Court
of First Instance of Manila requiring her to render an accounting to
her husband of all the conjugal property in her possession or under her
control. There is nothing in the record to substantiate this claim. We
have noticed her statement, made under oath, to the effect that "there
is no conjugal property in her possession or under her control, and
that, therefore, there is now no conjugal property in her possession
for delivery to the said defendant," meaning her husband. This is
clearly not a compliance with the order for accounting. Compliance with
that order must now be predicated on the findings made by the court in
the order adjudging the petitioner guilty of contempt. In this order
the court made the following findings:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Son
hechos probados y admitidos por la demandante que en su demanda
presentada en esta causa y en el parrafo VII de la misma, enumero las
propiedades que ella considero como gananciales o adquiridas durante su
matrimonio con el demandado mediante el trabajo o esfuerzo comun de
ambos, y en esta demanda se pedia la cesacion de la vida conyugal y la
comunidad de bienes entre la demandante y el demandado, la separacion
de cuerpos entre la demandante y el demandado, la disolucion y
Iiquidacion de los bienes pertenecientes a la sociedad conyugal entre
la demandante y el demandado, la entrega a la demandante de sus bienes
propios o parafernales, la entrega a la demandante de la mitad de los
bienes gananciales despues de liquidada la sociedad de gananciales,
ademas de otras peticiones.</p>
    <p>"Son tambien hechos probados y admitidos por la demandante acusada por desacato que ella tenia en su posesion o bajo su <em>control</em>,
en la fecha de su demanda y en la fecha de la sentencia 4 de agosto de
1930, los siguientes bienes gananciales, incluidos entre los descritos
en el parrafo VII de la demanda:</p>
    <p>"El recibo o certificados
correspondientes a 24,000 acciones de la Benguet Consolidated Mining
Co. (avaloradas por la demandante en su demanda en la suma de P117,500);</p>
    <p> "El recibo, del deposito de 60 piezas de muebles, deposito verificado por la demandante en la Luzon Brokerage Co.;</p>
    <p> "El documento o titulo de la finca de California (avalorada en P44,000 en la demanda de la demandante);</p>
    <p> "Una poliza de seguro (de las cuatro polizas descritas en el parrafo VII de la demanda);</p>
    <p> "Los recibos del pago de amillaramiento; </p>
    <p>"El informe del representante de los Estados Unidos sobre el pago de las contribuciones;</p>
    <p> "Las alhajas, pieles y servicio de plata expresados en el inciso <em>k</em>, parrafo VII de la demanda;</p>
    <p> "La poliza expresada en el inciso <i>m</i>, del parrafo VII de la demanda. (Pags. 275 y 276, n. t.)</p>
    <p> "Estos son los hechos probados y admitidos por la demandante, acusada de desacato."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
In order to purge herself of contempt, the petitioner must render a
full and complete accounting to her husband of the conjugal properties
mentioned in the order above quoted, and perform such other acts as are
required under the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila of
August 4, 1930.</p>
  <p> We do not deem it necessary to pass upon the
other questions raised by the petitioner, as we think they are too
unsubstantial to require serious consideration.</p>
  <p> It results
that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be denied, and the
petitioner will forthwith be recommitted to the respondent Director of
Prisons, subject to the orders of the Court of First Instance of
Manila. Costs shall be taxed against the petitioner. So ordered.</p>
