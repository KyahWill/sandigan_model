				<BR><STRONG>BUTTE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this case the motion for reconsideration of the decision promulgated on October 26,&nbsp; 1935, was granted and the&nbsp; case set&nbsp; for&nbsp; re-argument&nbsp; on December 17,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1935.&nbsp; The court having had the benefit of the oral argument&nbsp; of counsel on the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; of their&nbsp; present&nbsp; value of the premises of&nbsp; the plaintiff-appellant involved in this suit,&nbsp; its decision of&nbsp; October 26, 1935, is amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan in an&nbsp; action for&nbsp; damages for maintaining a&nbsp; nuisance&nbsp; continuously injurious&nbsp; to the&nbsp; plaintiff and his family by reason of the&nbsp; maintenance and operation of a stand pipe,&nbsp; pumping station and&nbsp; open&nbsp; reservoir&nbsp; for the storage of water&nbsp; upon the premises immediately&nbsp; adjacent to the plaintiff's residence.<br><br>"It appears from the stipulation of facts that the plaintiff owns a house&nbsp; constructed of wood and covered with nipa on Avenida Rizal, municipality of Lingayen, Province of Pangasinan; that he and his family have resided there for twenty-seven years, his family being composed of eight members.&nbsp; Their house is of two stories constructed upon a lot which contains 720 square meters.&nbsp; Upon the adjacent lot&nbsp; the defendant,&nbsp; during the years&nbsp; 1924 and&nbsp; 1925, constructed a reinforced&nbsp; concrete stand&nbsp; pipe 28 meters high and nine meters in diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the base of this&nbsp; cylindrical tank there are three machines: One electrical, one gasoline and one crude oil.&nbsp; On the side of the tank nearest the plaintiff's residence&nbsp; and at a distance of 3.4 meters in a chimney which rises to about the height of the gable of the house.&nbsp; The&nbsp; tank itself is 3.8 meters from the house of the plaintiff.</blockquote>"In&nbsp; March, 1927, the plaintiff protested to the governor of the province for the&nbsp; manner in which the plant was being operated and asked that&nbsp; he be indemnified&nbsp; for the&nbsp; value of his&nbsp; house and lot so that he might&nbsp; move his family and his&nbsp; effects to another residence.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this protest he stated:<br><blockquote>" 'Expide humo y olor&nbsp; desagradable que penetran en el interior de mi casa, aun cerradas&nbsp; sus&nbsp; ventanas, molestos y perjudiciales a nuestra salud.&nbsp; La chimenea de la maquina, que esta en el lado del&nbsp; tanque, contiguo al alero de mi casa, aunque esta envuelta en la&nbsp; cabeza como una red de acero chispea en ocasiones en que dentro de la red se ha acumulado por&nbsp; el&nbsp; humo bastante suciedad&nbsp; inflamable, y si algunas chispas llevadas por el viento, cayeran sobre el alero contiguo de mi casa,&nbsp; techada&nbsp; de nipa,&nbsp; ella naturalmente se incendiarfa al momento sin darnos tiempo para salvar nada de su contenido.<br><br>" 'El tanque nos&nbsp; asusta y pone en&nbsp; peligro de ser aplastados por 61, siempre&nbsp; que ocurre un temblor como&nbsp; ya ha ocurrido varias veces desde su&nbsp; levantamiento, por sus pro- porciones y&nbsp; condiciones mencionadas, y la circunstancia de cstar plantado sobre terreno blando, bajo y anegadizo.&nbsp; No es improbable, ni menos increible, que este tanque volcara o se tumbara,&nbsp; si ocurriera en Lingayen un temblor tan f uerte como el ocurrido el afio 63 u 80 en Manila,&nbsp; o&nbsp; el ocurrido en Japdn en 1923, o en la fecha 7 de este mes,&nbsp; que derrumbo muchas casas, matando a millares de personas.&nbsp; Ninguna persona, por sabia que sea, puede dar certidumbre y seguri- dad de que no se tumbaria, por cualquier terremoto fuerte que ocurriera&nbsp; aqui en Lingayen, maxime, estando cargada de gien mil galones de agua en su parte superior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Y si en ocasi6n en&nbsp; que&nbsp; yo y mi familia&nbsp; estuvieramos dormidos, ocurrieran el temblor y el volcamiento del tanque hacia mi casa Â¡ay de&nbsp; nosotros!'</blockquote>"After making an ocular inspection&nbsp; of the plant&nbsp; and hearing the testimony of the witnesses, the&nbsp; trial court came to the conclusion that although the operation of the pumps and the tank&nbsp; creates some annoyance and&nbsp; discomfort to the plaintiff, these are but ordinary and incidental to the reasonable conduct of the defendant's water&nbsp; system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court further&nbsp; held that&nbsp; inasmuch as the plaintiff&nbsp; did not protest&nbsp; till&nbsp; after the plan was constructed,&nbsp; his&nbsp; action is barred for laches.<br><br>"For this later conclusion of law the trial court cites no&nbsp; authority and we are not&nbsp; aware of any.&nbsp; It is to be noted that this is not a suit for equitable relief but an action for damages.&nbsp; The&nbsp; doctrine that one&nbsp; who consents to, permits or&nbsp; acquiesces&nbsp; in the erection of a structure with knowledge of the purpose for which&nbsp; it is to be put and the consequences of its erection and use will not be heard to say that the building or its uses are productive of a nuisance, is not applicable here, for the plaintiff neither consented to, permitted or acquiesced&nbsp; in the erection of the structure; nor could it&nbsp; fairly be said that he had knowledge in advance of all the consequences of the&nbsp; erection and the manner of operation of the plant here in question.&nbsp; The&nbsp; amended complaint in this case was filed on January 4, 1930, from which we infer that the suit was instituted some time before that date.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is nothing in the record which warrants the inference of an estoppel by acquiescence.<br><br>"The learned trial&nbsp; judge, in his&nbsp; decision of January 27, 1934, made&nbsp; a careful and exhaustive&nbsp; analysis both of the law and the evidence in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp; But after a careful examination of the entire record, we cannot accept his conclusion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff has not&nbsp; established by the preponderance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; evidence a case of actionable nuisance.<br><br>"In locating its pumping station within 3.8 meters from the house of the plaintiff, the defendant should reasonably have foreseen that the noise, vibrations, smoke, odor and sparks&nbsp; coming from the plant during&nbsp; its operation,&nbsp; not only during the day but during the night as well, would cause a&nbsp; constant annoyance,&nbsp; discomfort and danger&nbsp; both to the property of the plaintiff and the health and&nbsp; comfort of himself and his&nbsp; family.&nbsp; The chimney which is&nbsp; just opposite the plaintiff's house at&nbsp; a distance of only 3.4 meters emits smoke, gases of crude oil and gasoline and occasionally sparks&nbsp; as well.&nbsp; The plaintiff testified that&nbsp; at&nbsp; times the smoke blinds him and his family&nbsp; affecting their lungs and their eyes and that the noise and vibrations affect their sleep.&nbsp; As against the testimony of the plaintiff, who is exposed day in and day out to these conditions, and of his neighbors who corroborate him, the brief ocular inspection made by the court on one day, although conducted with eminent fairness, seems to us to be entitled to less weight. The&nbsp; witnesses for&nbsp; the defendant, its&nbsp; employees, naturally minimize the harmful effects to the plaintiff of the operation of the machines&nbsp; in the pumping plant.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the evidence as a whole leaves us with the&nbsp; clear conviction that the construction and operation of this pumping plant in such close proximity to the plaintiff's residence has rendered the same practically uninhabitable without exposing to risk the com- fort, health&nbsp; and, in case of fire, even the lives of the plaintiff and his family.<br><br>"We find from the preponderance of the evidence that the fair present value of the appellant's premises involved in this suit fs P3,000; and as, under the circumstances, the maintenance of the nuisance&nbsp; is practically tantamount to an&nbsp; expropriation, we have&nbsp; concluded that the defendant-appellee should be and it is hereby required and adjudged to pay the plaintiff-appellant the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P3,000 upon a tender by him to&nbsp; it of a valid conveyance of the premises, free of liens and&nbsp; incumbrances, reserving to the plaintiff-appellant the right to remove his improvements therefrom within three months from the date of payment of the said P3,000.<br><br>"The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded for&nbsp; further proceedings in accordance&nbsp; with this decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; No special pronouncement as to costs in this instance."<br><br><i>Malcolm, Villa-Real,&nbsp; Imperial</i>, and <i>Goddard, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
