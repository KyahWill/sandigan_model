				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MAXIMINO ARIARTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">The accused was convicted in the Court of First 
Instance of Agusan of the crime of rape.
</p><p align="justify"> We have had the benefit of a carefully prepared 
brief by the attorney <em>de oficio</em> as well as oral arguments by 
the attorney <em>de oficio</em> and the representative of the 
Solicitor-General.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is an undisputed fact that on the afternoon of 
September 25,1932, the defendant had carnal intercourse with the 
offended party. The prosecution claims that the act was committed 
through violence and intimidation, while the appellant contends that it 
was by consent. In the ultimate analysis, conviction, if sustained, must
 rest upon the uncorroborated testimony of the offended party. It is 
true that at the trial she presented a dress which was torn and which 
she claims she was wearing at the time of the act, but appellant denies 
that it was the dress that was worn at the time. There is no proof 
outside of the testimony of the offended party that the dress was in the
 same condition that afternoon as it was when it was presented to the 
court.</p>
<p align="justify"> The offended party is a woman who has been married 
five years and presumably of a normal health and robustness. She admits 
that just before the attack she was armed with a bolo, but claims that 
she threw it away through fear.</p>
<p align="justify"> Her account of the actual occurrence furnishes few 
details by which her story can be tested. In one breath she speaks of 
resistance and struggles, in the next that her resistance was overcome 
by threats and fear. In another place she states that the threat 
consisted of saying he would wound her with a bolo.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is the theory of the prosecution that that 
evening she complained and related the details of the crime to the older
 brother of her husband. There are some conflicting proofs as to what 
took place at the house of her brother-in-law that evening. No real act 
was taken by the offended party or her relatives in making a formal 
complaint to the authorities for five days. According to the evidence 
there was no mark of violence, bruise or scratch on the body, face or 
hands of the offended party or of the assailant.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is evident that the parties met that afternoon by
 agreement; that the elder brother was spying upon the actions of the 
accused; that a sister-in-law was sent to find the offended party that 
afternoon but search for her was apparently without success. A deafmute 
who accompanied the offended party to the field and was working there 
just prior to the alleged assault disappears from the picture without a 
word of explanation. The accused was a married man apparently living 
with his wife.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is true that a conviction can be sustained on the
 uncorroborated testimony of the offended party. But it should never be 
done unless the story of the offended party is impeccable and rings true
 throughout. After a close and painstaking review of the evidence, it is
 impossible for us to say that the guilt of the accused has been proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p align="justify"> Therefore, the judgment appealed from must be 
reversed and the accused discharged. So ordered, with costs <em>de 
oficio</em>.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Street, Abad Santos, Vickers, </em>and<em> Diaz,
 JJ.,</em> concur.
