				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 19,&nbsp; 1915,&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Camarines&nbsp; Norte rendered judgment in case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1747 of that court, ordering Pablo Venida to pay Ramon Pimentel the sum of P7,781.52 with interest&nbsp; at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from July 9,&nbsp; 1905, to the date of the filing of the complaint and, furthermore, to pay the sum of P550, the value&nbsp; of 50 piculs of abaca which had not been delivered and&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs of the action.&nbsp; This judgment became final, no appeal having been&nbsp; taken by the&nbsp; defeated&nbsp; party.<br><br>The present action was&nbsp; brought by the widow and children of Ramon Pimentel to recover&nbsp; the sums specified in the said judgment.&nbsp; Pablo Venida having&nbsp; died, the claim was presented to the&nbsp; committee on&nbsp; appraisal and&nbsp; claims in the intestate proceeding for the settlement of the estate of Pablo Venida.<br><br>The committee&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; the claim declaring&nbsp; that the estate of the deceased Pablo Venida owed the heirs of Ramon Pimentel the sum&nbsp; of P16,850.90.&nbsp; From this admission of the claim, the administrator of the estate appealed, alleging that the commissioners failed to furnish him with a copy of their report and that the report does not show by whom the said claim was admitted.<br><br>The appeal of the administrator and the original action of the plaintiffs were tried in the present case.<br><br>The court below&nbsp; after considering the&nbsp; action&nbsp; of the plaintiffs and the grounds for the appeal of the defendant, reached the conclusion that the plaintiffs have proven their right, but&nbsp; not the defendant administrator, in regard to the defenses set up by&nbsp; him, and therefore rendered judgment against the&nbsp; defendant Eulalio&nbsp; Venida, as&nbsp; administrator of the estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pablo Venida, for the payment to the plaintiffs of the following sums: P7,781.52&nbsp; with interest at 6 per cent per annum&nbsp; from July 9,&nbsp; 1905,&nbsp; until the execution of this judgment; P550 for&nbsp; 50 piculs of abaca which had not been&nbsp; delivered, with interest at 6&nbsp; per cent per annum from the date of the filing of&nbsp; the complaint until&nbsp; the execution of&nbsp; the judgment; P44 the amount of the costs in case No. 1747, with interest at 6 per cent per annum also from the date of the filing of&nbsp; the complaint until the execution of the judgment and the payment of the costs of the action.<br><br>The defendant appealed and now alleges that&nbsp; the trial court erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; sustaining the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Ambos Camarines in&nbsp; civil case No.&nbsp; 1747, entitled Ramon Pimentel <i>vs.</i> Pablo Venida.<br><br>The appellant contends that the said judgment had been rendered without jurisdiction over the person of the defendant,&nbsp; because he&nbsp; had not been summoned&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case.<br><br>Two witnesses&nbsp; were presented by the defendant,&nbsp; namely, Pablo Venida and Proceso Venida, in order to prove that the defendant Pablo Venida had not been notified nor had he had any knowledge of the case.&nbsp; The contention of&nbsp; the appellant is untenable.&nbsp; The plaintiffs presented as evidence a certified copy of the record of the proceedings had in&nbsp; said case No. 1747 and it appears that the complaint was&nbsp; filed on June&nbsp; 10, 1914;&nbsp; on January 9, 1915, the attorneys for the then plaintiff filed a motion alleging that the defendant was duly summoned on August 11,&nbsp; 1914, and as&nbsp; the period prescribed by the rules&nbsp; for&nbsp; entering&nbsp; an appearance&nbsp; had elapsed without the defendant having appeared&nbsp; up to&nbsp; that date,&nbsp; they prayed that the defendant&nbsp; be&nbsp; declared in default.&nbsp; On January&nbsp; 16, 1915, the court granting&nbsp; the&nbsp; said motion and finding&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; alleged therein just&nbsp; and proper, issued an order declaring Pablo Venida&nbsp; in default and ordered the inclusion of this case in the court calendar upon&nbsp; the instance of the plaintiff.&nbsp; On&nbsp; February 19, 1915, the plaintiffs presented his evidence and the court thereupon rendered judgment against the defendant for the payment to the plaintiffs of the sums above-mentioned.<br><br>In&nbsp; regard to the&nbsp; alleged prescription of the&nbsp; action by the plaintiffs,&nbsp; suffice&nbsp; it to&nbsp; say&nbsp; that the judgment sued on in this case was&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; on February 19, 1915, and the complaint herein having been filed on&nbsp; March 24, 1924,&nbsp; it is clear that the period of ten years provided in section 43, paragraph No. 1, of&nbsp; the Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure has not yet elapsed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other error alleged by&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants refers to the credibility of the witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are of the opinion that the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; did&nbsp; not commit an error in weighing&nbsp; said evidence, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from being in accordance with law, it&nbsp; must be,&nbsp; as it&nbsp; is hereby, affirmed, with&nbsp; the costs against the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avance√±a, C.
