				<H3>KISAJIRO OKAMOTO, CAPTAIN OF THE JAPANESE MOTOR FISHING SAMPAN, HOSHO MARU, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. THE INSULAE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify"> About noon of December 14, 1932, revenue cutter Arayat sighted a Japanese fishing boat named the <em>Hosho Maru</em>,
anchored a short distance away from Salomague Island, a small island
off the coast of Northern Luzon. A boarding party was put aboard the
fishing vessel and found seven bags of rice, three sharks, three tunas,
and three trays of bait, with fishing tackle but no articles of
commerce or passengers.</p>
<p align="justify"> Upon a report being made to the Insular Collector of Customs, that official directed the seizure of the <em>Hosho Maru</em>
and, after administrative proceedings, decreed the forfeiture of the
vessel and directed its sale at public auction for the benefit of the
Government, due to the violation of customs and quarantine laws and
regulations.</p>
<p align="justify"> The captain appealed the case to the Court of First
Instance of Manila, where additional evidence was taken. That court
held that the <em>Hosho Maru</em> took refuge in Philippine waters on account of stress of weather, that the <em>Hosho Maru</em>
was not engaged in the importation of merchandise in any Philippine
port, and that nothing had been found indicating that the fishing
vessel unlawfully violated any customs or quarantine law or regulation.
Therefore the order of confiscation and forfeiture was reversed and the
vessel ordered returned to its owner, with costs against the Insular
Collector of Customs.</p>
<p align="justify"> The Solicitor-General brings this appeal and asks
this court to reverse the judgment of the Court of First Instance of
Manila and affirm the decision of the Insular Collector of Customs.</p>
<p align="justify"> Our attention has not been called to any statute
authorizing the Collector of Customs to order the forfeiture of this
boat. Both in England and in the United States confiscation of a vessel
for violation of a customs law cannot be had administratively but only
by court proceedings. Section 1363 of the Administrative Code provides
for the forfeiture of vessels engaged in certain specified illegal
actions, none of which apply in this case. It therefore must be held
that the Collector of Customs was without authority to order the
forfeiture of the vessel.</p>
<p align="justify"> In this kind of appeal the lower court had the
right to take additional evidence and is not limited to the
administrative record as in cases of immigration and deportation of
aliens. The rule in this kind of case is correctly set forth in Smith,
Bell &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs (37 Phil., 87).</p>
<p align="justify"> The right of asylum from stress of weather is a
right well recognized by international law and is in accordance with
the dictates of Christianity. The only limitation is that the weather
must be such as to create an honest belief in the mind of a skillful
and firm mariner.</p>
<p align="justify"> As the Solicitor-General is unable to point out the specific law or regulation that he claims the <em>Hosho Maru</em> violated, further proceedings are deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p align="justify"> The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed with the modification that costs in both instances will be <em>de oficio</em>. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Butte, Goddard, </em>and<em> Diaz, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
