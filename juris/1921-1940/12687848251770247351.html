				<H3>JOSE BASA (ALIAS LIM CHIAN), PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. GAVINA RAQUEL Y SALUD ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>

				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This action was instituted in the Court of First Instance of the Province of 
Cavite by Jose Basa (alias Lim Chian), against Gavina Raquel y Salud and the two 
codefendants named in the complaint, for the purpose of obtaining a declaration 
of nullity of a conveyance of certain property described in the complaint which 
had been sold by the corporation of Dominican Fathers to the said Gavina Raquel 
y Salud, to compel said corporation to execute a deed of conveyance to the same 
property in favor of the plaintiff in conformity with an alleged contract made 
by an authorized agent of said corporation with the plaintiff, and to recover a 
sum of money as damages for breach of contract. 
<p>It appears that the property which is the subject of this action formerly 
belonged to the corporation of Dominican Fathers, whose <em>procurator</em> is 
the defendant Fray Pedro Prat. It also appears that the defendant Alfredo 
Chicote was acting as attorney of the aforementioned Pedro Prat and as agent of 
the corporation of Dominican Fathers at and prior to the time of the incidents 
which gave rise to this action. The corporation, it seems, had decided to sell 
the property in question, and it appears to have been understood that the 
plaintiff, who was occupying the property as a renter, would be given preference 
in the matter of the purchase of the property. On March 14, 1922, one Julian 
Visencio, a clerk or employee in the office of Sr. Chicote in Manila, sent a 
telegram to the plaintiff in Cavite in words to the following effect: "Come. 
Urgent to arrange purchase of house from Sr. Chicote."</p>
<p>In response to this telegram the plaintiff provided him- self with the sum of 
P11,500, which was understood to be the amount of the purchase price, and came 
to Manila for the purpose of effecting the purchase of the property. However, 
the plaintiff alleges that he did not succeed in getting admission at once to 
the office where the transaction would have been consummated, and while he was 
waiting the defendant, Gavina Raquel y Salud, obtained admission and purchased 
the property for the sum stated, thereby causing a disappointment of the hopes 
and expectations that had been entertained by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The defense in brief is that the plaintiff has no writing evidencing the 
agreement for the purchase of this land, sufficient to satisfy the requirement 
of section 335 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This point is undoubtedly well 
taken, and the trial judge committed no error in excluding the oral testimony 
which the plaintiff's attorney wished to offer in court concerning the alleged 
agreement.</p>
<p>The telegram to which reference has been made is not a sufficient memorandum 
because it does not describe the property nor state the purchase price; and it 
is not signed by any person who had authority to bind the seller.</p>
<p>For the reasons stated, the order dismissing the complaint will be affirmed, 
with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Araullo, C. J., Johnson, Malcolm, Avancena, Ostrand, Johns,</em> and 
<em>Romualdez, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
