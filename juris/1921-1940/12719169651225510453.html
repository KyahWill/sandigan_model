				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF BASILISA F. YANGCO. ALEJANDRO M. PANIS, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. JACINTO YANGCO, GUARDIAN AD LITEM OF THE MINORS PEDRO UY TIOCO AND BRUNO UY TIOCO, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present case is an incident in the intestate proceedings of 
the estate of Basilisa F. Yangco, deceased. In the course of these proceedings 
Attorney Alejandro M. Panis, as attorney for the administrator Teodoro D. Uy 
Tioco, presented a statement to the court for professional services rendered by 
him, and asked the approval thereof in the sum of P15,000. The administrator of 
said estate answered the motion for attorney's fees, leaving it to the court to 
fix a reasonable sum for the services rendered by said attorney. And the court 
on December 5, 1927, considering the amount involved in said intestate 
proceedings, which, according to the report of the committee on appraisal, was 
P210,640.21, and considering also the value of the services rendered by 
claimant, fixed Attorney Panis' fee for all the services rendered by him in 
connection with the property left by the deceased Basilisa F. Yangco, at 
P15,000, and ordered the administrator to pay this fee. 
<p align="justify">On February 8, 1928, the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> of the minor Pedro 
Uy Tioco petitioned the court under the provisions of section 113 of the Code of 
Civil Procedure to vacate its order of December 5, 1927, and to give the 
petitioner his day in court to prove his contention relative to the fixing of 
attorney's fees in these intestate proceedings; that he believes the amount 
fixed by the court to be excessive and prejudicial to the estate; that the 
amount involved in the intestate proceedings is only about P100,000, and not 
over P200,000, as the committee erroneously stated; that the nature of the 
services rendered by the attorney consisted merely in taking simple and ordinary 
proceedings in court, with no objection raised therein, and hence, no obstacle 
in the course of the proceedings; that the opponent had no opportunity to argue 
against the motion of October 8, 1927, and he was surprised to learn of the 
existence of said motion and of the court's order only a few days since. </p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for Mr. Panis answered this motion with a prayer for 
the confirmation of the order of December 5, 1927, and on February 15, 1928, the 
court denied the motion presented by the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> of the minor Pedro Uy 
Tioco. The latter appealed from such an order after having moved for the 
reconsideration of the same, which was denied. </p>
<p align="justify">One of the questions raised in the appellant's brief is whether 
a guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span>, being entitled to intervene in the intestate; proceedings 
of an estate of which the minor is a forced heir, has a right to be notified of 
any motion presented or an order issued bearing on the case. We believe that 
since the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> was appointed to represent the minor in the 
intestate proceedings he has a right to be notified of any motion filed or order 
issued by the court in order to be able to protect the minor's interests; and 
the lack of notification of the order issued by the court on December 5, 1927, 
fixing the attorney's fees, is sufficient cause to entitle the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> 
to invoke the remedy provided by section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and 
his failure to except to said order of December 5, 1927 in time is due to the 
fact that he was unaware of Attorney Panis' motion. His neglect in this regard 
is excusable, and having filed his petition for relief from the order of 
December 5, 1927 on February 8, 1928, it is evident that said petition was 
presented within the period fixed by section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
</p>
<p align="justify">According to section 783 of the Code of Civil Procedure, any 
person legally interested in any order, decree, or judgment of a Court of First 
Instance in the exercise of its jurisdiction in special proceedings in the 
settlement of the estates of deceased persons, etc., may appeal to the Supreme 
Court from such order, decree, or judgment, when such order, decree, or judgment 
constitutes a final determination of the rights of the appellants, and the 
appeal shall affect every order, decree, or judgment appealed from, and not 
merely the interests which the appellants may have therein. </p>
<p align="justify">Passing now to the consideration of the merits of the question 
raised in this appeal, it should be observed that, in accordance with section 29 
of the said Code, a lawyer shall be entitled to have and recover from his client 
no more than a reasonable compensation for the services rendered, with a view to 
the importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the extent of the 
services rendered, and the professional standing of the lawyer. But in such 
cases the court shall not be bound by the opinion of lawyers as to the proper 
compensation, but may disregard such testimony and base its conclusion on its 
own professional knowledge. A written contract for services shall control the 
amount of recovery if found by the court not to be unconscionable or 
unreasonable. </p>
<p align="justify">In cases like the one at bar a written contract for 
professional services is determinative of the amount to be charged as fees, 
provided it is not unreasonable. (Early vs. Sy-Giang, 4 Phil., 727.) And even 
where the parties have made a. written agreement as to the fee the courts have 
the power to ignore the contract, if the amount fixed is unconscionable or 
unreasonable, and reduce the fee to a reasonable amount. (Bachrach vs. Golingco, 
39 Phil., 138.) And where there is no agreement as to the fee, the Courts of 
First Instance have discretionary power to fix the lawyer's fee in testate 
proceedings pending before them. (Escueta vs. Sy-Juilliong, 5 Phil., 405; Piliin 
vs. Jocson and Agoncillo, 41 Phil., 26.) And in any case, whether there is an 
agreement or not, the courts can fix a reasonable compensation which lawyers 
should receive for their professional services. In the case of Delgatdo vs. De la 
Rama (43 Phil., 419) the circumstances to be considered in determining a 
lawyer's compensation were set down as follows: "The amount and character of the 
services rendered; the labor, time, and trouble involved; the nature and 
importance of the litigation or business in which the services were rendered; 
the responsibility imposed; the amount of money or the value of the property 
affected by the controversy or involved in the employment; the skill and 
experience called for in the performance of the services; the professional 
character and social standing of the attorney; the results secured, and whether 
or not the fee is absolute or contingent, it being a recognized rule that an 
attorney may properly charge a much larger fee when it is to be contingent than 
when it is not. The financial ability of the defendant may also be considered by 
the jury, not to enhance the amount above as reasonable compensation, but to 
determine whether or not he is able to pay a fair and just compensation for the 
services rendered, or as an incident in ascertaining the importance and gravity 
of the interests involved in the litigation."</p>
<p align="justify">We have carefully examined the various items of the statement 
for professional fees submitted by counsel of Attorney Panis, and bearing in 
mind the circumstances indicated in the case of Delgado vs. De la Rama, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, 
we are clearly of the opinion that the amount of P15,000 demanded by Attorney 
Panis is exorbitant, and we hold that, for the work performed as described in 
the aforesaid statement and particularly the character of the services rendered, 
the time employed, and the value of the work done by the lawyer in the discharge 
of his duty, said fees must be fixed at P5,000.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the order appealed from is modified, and we hold 
that the fees to which Attorney Panis is entitled for services rendered in the 
aforesaid intestate proceedings are hereby reduced to P5,000. </p>
<p align="justify">Without special pronouncement of costs. So ordered.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Johns, Ostrand,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Romualdez, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
