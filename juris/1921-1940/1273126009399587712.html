				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, the dispositive part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"So sobresee la demanda sin especial pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The property in question in the case in now before this court for
the third time. The land claimed by the plaintiff-appellant has an area
of 32 hectars, 50 ares and 75 centiares and is made up of lots Nos.
528, 819, 820 and 822-A of case No. 9, G. L. R. O. Cadastral Record No.
187 of the Province of Tarlac. </p>
<p>On March 12, 1914, Jose P. Henson, the appellant herein, filed a petition in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac (<em>Expendiente</em>
No. 33, G. L. R. O. No. 10010) for the registration underAct No. 496 of
two parcels of land having an area of 175 hectares, 37 ares and 63
centares and located in the barrio of Santa Monica, municipality of
Concepcion, Province of Tarlac. The Director of Lands filed his
opposition the registration on the ground that said parcels of land
belonged to the public domain.</p>
<p>On September 13, 1915, Vicente Nepomuceno, judge, rendered a
decision adjudicating the Henson the parcel of land in question in this
case and declaring the rest of the lots, claimed by him, public land.
Said adjudication was, however, subject to the condition that Henson
should, within a period of 40 days, segregate the land ajudicated to
him and present a new plan and technical description of the chief
surveyor of the General Land Registration Office. Instead of complying
with this order of the lower court Henson appealed to this court from
the part of the decision which declared the rest of the land, applied
for by him, as public land. While that appeal was pending in this court
(G,. R. No. 11662), Henson filed a motion for a new trial based on
newly discovered evidence. On May 17, 1918, the court granted the
motion and remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial.<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup>
Upon receipt of the record Judge Nepomuceno, on July 1, 1918, ordered
that the case be set for hearing at the next session of that court. So
far as the record shows Henson took no further steps in that case to
perfect his title to the land in question in this case, which had been
conditionally adjudicated to him by Judge Nepomuceno. This was a
mistake upon his part as the Director of Lands did not appeal from the
decision. If he had complied with the requirement of the lower court
and presented a new plan and technical description, a final decree of
confirmation and registration would probably have been issued in his
favor. Such a decree must contain a technical description so that a
certificate of title may be issued. All certificates of title must
contain a technical description of the land they cover. Therefore the
contention of the appellant that the decision of the trial court in
registration case No. 33 is final and that that decision in his favor
is <em>res judicata</em> is not tenable. As a matter of fact the
resignation case No. 33 was finally dismissed on April 30, 1924, over
ten years after it was filed in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac.
So far as the record shows there were no further proceedings therein
with reference to the land in question from September 13, 1915, to the
date of its dismissal.
</p><p>On January 10, 1920, nearly six years after Henson filed
registration case No. 33, the Director of Lands instituted two
cadastral cases in the court of First Instance of Tarlac (cases Nos. 8
and 9, G. L. R. O. Cad. Rec. Nos. 186 and 187). In said proceedings
Henson claimed, among others, lots Nos. 528, 819, 820, 821 and 822-A,
the same land conditionally adjudicated to him in registration case No.
33. On June 29, 1922, Judge Eduardo Gutierrez David rendered a decision
in cadastral cases Nos. 8 and 9 adjudicating to Henson, among others,
the above mentioned lots with a total area of 32 hectares, 68 ares and 1
centaire. The Director of Lands appealed from that decision. On October
16, 1923, this court revoked (G. R. Nos. 20463)<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup> the decision rendered by Judge David. The court said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Considering the assignments of error for the
Attorney-General with reference to the lots ordered to be registered in
the name of Jose P. Henson by the lower court, it may be stated that
the record is very incomplete in that the plans presented by the
appellee are very indefinite and uncertain, and that the documents
presented by him failed in many respects to show a complete title of
the parcels of land in question, nor specific identification of the
same. And, moreover, it may be added that during the trial of the court
cause Jose P. Henson made no claim whatever as being the owner of the
following lots which were included in the decree of the lower court:
Nos. 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 734, 735, 851, 853, 1420, 814, 820,
823, 826, and 833. It is difficult therefore to understand how these
particular lots could have, under any theory, been registered in his
name. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"After a careful consideration of the record and the evidence
adduced during the trial of the cause, and without further discussion
of the facts, we are fully convinced that the same fails to show that
Jose P. Henson or his predecessors in interest possessed or occupied
these lots for the period of time and under the conditions by which he
might have acquired title. Therefore, the judgment of the lower court
decreeing to him the lots mentioned in its decree is hereby revoked,
and without any pronouncement as to costs it is ordered."
</p><p>If Henson had followed up the conditional decision in case No.
33 and secured a certificate of title to the land in question and
presented that certificate in these cadastral cases as proof of his
ownership, the decision of Judge David would not have been revoked by
this court. A Torrens title issued for land, included later in a
cadastral proceeding, must be represented and protected by the
cadastral court.
</p><p>The attorney, representing Henson before this court, asserts,
and he is correct, that this court did not specifically declare the
land question as public land. In a cadastral proceeding the Government
of the Philippines Islands, represented by the Director of Lands, is
applicant, the theory being that all the land included in the cadastral
survey is presumed to be public and that all persons who may have any
right to or interest in said land or any part thereof, must file their
"answers" with the clerk of court in order that they may not lose their
rights. It naturally follows that when the person answer, alleging that
he is owner of a portion of the land included in the cadastral survey,
and prays that said portion be ajudicated to him and, after hearing,
his prayer is denied, that land in so far as the defeat claimant is
concerned, is deemed public land. A final judgment against a claimant
is a cadastral case in conclusive as to his alleged rights.
</p><p>On January 23, 1924, after the decision of this court became
final and the record in cadastral cases Nos. 8 and 9 was returned to
the trial court, upon the motion of the Director of Lands, that court
issued an order requiring the provincial sheriff to eject Henson and
his tenants from the land in question and to put the homestead who had
applied therefore possession.
</p><p>On November 25, 1927, more than three years after the order of
ejectment was issued, Henson filed civil case No. 2489, in the Court of
First Instance of Tarlac, against the Director of Lands, alleging that
Lands be the appeal in cadastral case No. 9 was filed after the time for
appeal had expired; that the decision of this court, upon said appeal,
was therefore null and void and prayed the Director of Lands be
enjoined from resignation case No. 33. On December 3, 1928, the trial
court issued an order denying the petition of Henson and he again
appealed to this court (55 Phil., 586). In affirming that order this
court said:
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">"In conformity with the ordinary practice, the General Land
Registration Office on January 10, 1923, sent notices of the
adjudications to the litigants in two cases. The provincial fiscal, on
behalf of the Director of Lands, thereupon appealed from the decisions
in regard to Henson, and on February 6, 1923, he perfected the appeals
by bills of exemptions, and in this court the cases were given the
numbers G. R. 20462 and 20463. No objection to the appeals was
presented by Henson, and briefs were filed by both parties, and as a
final result, this on October 16, 1923, reversed the decision of the
lower court and declared all the lots in question public lands. In
1924, the various lots were distributed among the homesteaders who had
occupied the land for some time.
</p><p align="center">* * * * * * *
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="justify">"As stated by counsel for the
plaintiff, 'this is a suit in equity whereby the plaintiff seeks
equitable relief against a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court.' It
is a well known maxim that 'equity aids the vigilant, not those who
slumber on their rights.' In the cases in question, the herein
appellant let all objections pass for over four years and in the
meantime, the title to the land involved had been granted other persons
in good faith. It is indeed too late to claim that the appeals referred
to were unauthorized by law and must be declared null and void.
(Glaizer <em>vs.</em> Carpenter, 16 Gray [Mass.], 385; 3 C. J., 371.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the complaint, in the case now under
consideration, the plaintiff alleges that he is the absolute owner of
the land in question; that he bought the land from the Doroteo Narciso
on October 16, 1913, and from that date until January 15, 1924, he had
been in continuous, public and peaceful possession as owner of said
land; that on the date, mentioned above, the defendant Drector of
Lands, "sabiendo muy bien dicha posesion del aqui demandante, presento
a este Juzgado una mocion para la expedicion a su favor de un
madamiento de posesion sobre la mencionada parcel de terreno con
lanzamiento del aqui demandante"; that before he brought the land from
Doroteo Narciso, the latter had been in possession thereof for at least
thirty years having brought it from Julian Ramos and that Doroteo
Narciso had procured the registration for "una informacion posesori"
covering said land. He prays that the possession of the land restored
to him; that the homestead claims of the defendantsCandelaria Mercado
as adminatrix of the estate of Lorenzo Mercado and Emigdio Bantig be
declared null and void and that the defendants be sentenced to pay him
damages.
</p><p align="justify">In resignation case No. 33 and in cadastral
cases No. 8 and 9 the herein plaintiff, Jose P. Henson, based his claim
as owner of the land in question upon the same facts alleged in his
complaint in this case.
</p><p align="justify">It has been shown that he abandoned any
advantage he may have acquired in resignation case No. 33 by not
complying with the order of the court discussed above and that in
cadastral case No. 9 this court revoked the judgment of in trial court
decreeing to him the land now in question in this case. </p><p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, and after giving due
weight to all the arguments advance in the excellent brief of the
attorney now representing the plaintiff, it is held that the decision
of the court in cases Nos. 8 and 9, G. L. R. O. Cadastral Record Nos.
186 and 187, is conclusive and final as to the alleged rights of Jose
P. Henson to the land in question in this case.
</p><p align="justify">The judgment of the lower court is affirmed with costs in this instance against the plaintiff-appellant.
