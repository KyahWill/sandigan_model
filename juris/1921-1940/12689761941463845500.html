				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action is brought to recover&nbsp; damages in the&nbsp; sum of P30,000 for&nbsp; the erroneous&nbsp; registration in&nbsp; the name of the defendant&nbsp; Gasataya&nbsp; of three parcels of&nbsp; land situated in the municipality of Isabela,&nbsp; Province of Occidental Negros, and of which the plaintiff was the owner at the&nbsp; time of the registration.<br><br>There&nbsp; is practically no dispute as&nbsp; to the facts.&nbsp; The three parcels of land were formerly owned by one Domingo Gayondato, who inherited&nbsp; them from his mother, Ramona Granada, in 1896.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1899&nbsp; Domingo married the defendant Adela Gasataya, with whom he had a child, the herein plaintiff, born in October,&nbsp; 1900.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the death of Domingo in the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1902, Gabino&nbsp; Gasataya, the father&nbsp; of Adela, took charge of the three parcels of land in question. In 1908&nbsp; Adela married the defendant Domingo Cuachon, and&nbsp; Gabino&nbsp; Gasataya thereupon turned&nbsp; over to them the possession of the land.<br><br>The three parcels were&nbsp; included in cadastral case No. 11 of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Occidental&nbsp; Negros as lots Nos. 70, 364 and 375, and when that case came on for hearing in August, 1916, the defendant Domingo Cuachon appeared on behalf of his wife and stepdaughter and&nbsp; filed claims for&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid&nbsp; lots by way of answers in which he stated that the.lots were the property of "his wife Adela Gasataya and of her daughter, fifteen years&nbsp; of age."&nbsp; Notwithstanding this statement, the Court of First Instance erroneously decreed the registration of the aforesaid lots in the name of&nbsp; Adela&nbsp; Gasataya alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently Adela, with the consent of her husband, mortgaged the property to the National Bank and finally in the year 1920 sold it to the&nbsp; defendant Rodriguez for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P13,000, the purchaser, in&nbsp; addition thereto, assuming the liability for a mortgage of f*8,000 to the&nbsp; National Bank and&nbsp; for certain other debts amounting to over P4,000.<br><br>The complaint in the present case&nbsp; was filed on&nbsp; August 18, 1922, Adela Gasataya, Domingo Cuachon,&nbsp; Francisco Rodriguez and the&nbsp; Insular&nbsp; Treasurer&nbsp; being made parties defendant.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; facts above stated the trial&nbsp; court rendered judgment in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff Rosario Gayondato, ordering the defendants&nbsp; Adela Gasataya and Domingo Cuachon jointly and&nbsp; severally to indemnify the said plaintiff in the sum of P35,000 and to pay the costs. The Insular Treasurer and&nbsp; Francisco Rodriguez were absolved from the complaint. From this&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>The sum&nbsp; and substance of&nbsp; the assignments of error&nbsp; is that the court erred in absolving the Insular Treasurer from the complaint, and in this&nbsp; we agree with the appellant.&nbsp; The court below appears to have been under the impression that the liability of the assurance fund is confined to cases where the erroneous registration is due to omission, mistake or&nbsp; malfeasance on the part of the employees&nbsp; of the registration court.&nbsp; That&nbsp; this view&nbsp; is erroneous,&nbsp; is evident from the language of sections 101 and&nbsp; 102 of the Land Registration Act, which&nbsp; read as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 101. Any person who without negligence on his part sustains&nbsp; loss or damage through any omission, mistake,&nbsp; or misfeasance of the clerk, or register of deeds,&nbsp; or of any examiner of titles, or of any deputy or clerk of the register of&nbsp; deeds in the&nbsp; performance of&nbsp; their respective duties under the provisions of this Act, and any person who is&nbsp; wrongfully&nbsp; deprived of any land&nbsp; or&nbsp; any interest therein, without negligence on his part, through the bringing of the same under the provisions of this Act or by the registration of any&nbsp; other&nbsp; person&nbsp; as owner of such land,&nbsp; or by any&nbsp; mistake, omission, or misdescription in&nbsp; any certificate or owner's&nbsp; duplicate,&nbsp; or in any entry or memorandum&nbsp; in the register&nbsp; or&nbsp; other&nbsp; official book,&nbsp; or by any cancellation, and <i>who&nbsp; by the provisions of this Act&nbsp; is barred or in any way precluded from&nbsp; bringing an action for the recovery of such land or interest&nbsp; therein, or claim upon the same,</i> may bring in any court of competent jurisdiction&nbsp; an action against the&nbsp; Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago for the recovery of damages to be paid out of the assurance fund.<br><br>"SEC. 102. If such action be for recovery for loss or damage&nbsp; arising only through any omission,&nbsp; mistake, or misfeasance of&nbsp; the- clerk, or of the register of deeds, or of any examiner of titles, or of any deputy or clerk of the register of deeds in the performance of their respective duties under the provisions of this Act, then the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago shall be the sole defendant to such action.&nbsp; But if such action be brought for&nbsp; loss or damage arising only through the fraud or willful act of some person or persons other than the clerk, the register of deeds, the examiners of titles,&nbsp; deputies,&nbsp; and&nbsp; clerks, or arising jointly through the fraud or wrongful act of such&nbsp; other person or persons and the omission, mistake, or misfeasance of the clerk, the&nbsp; register of deeds, the examiners of titles,&nbsp; deputies, or clerks, then such action shall be brought against both the Treasurer of the Philippine&nbsp; Archipelago and such person or persons aforesaid.&nbsp; In all such actions where there are defendants other than the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago and&nbsp; damages shall have been recovered, no final judgment shall be entered against&nbsp; the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago&nbsp; until execution against the other defendants shall&nbsp; be returned unsatisfied in whole or in part, and the officer&nbsp; returning the execution shall certify that the amount still&nbsp; due&nbsp; upon the execution cannot be collected except&nbsp; by application to the assurance fund.&nbsp; Thereupon the&nbsp; court having jurisdiction of&nbsp; the action, being satisfied as to the truth of such return, may, upon proper showing,&nbsp; order the amount of the execution and costs, or so much thereof as&nbsp; remains&nbsp; unpaid, to&nbsp; be paid by the Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago out of the assurance fund.&nbsp; It shall be the duty of the Attorney- General in person or by deputy&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear&nbsp; and defend all such suits with the aid of the&nbsp; fiscal of the&nbsp; province&nbsp; in which&nbsp; the land lies or the city attorney of the&nbsp; City of Manila as the case may be: <i>Provided, however,</i> That nothing in this Act shall be construed to deprive&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; of any action which he may have against any person for such loss or damage or deprivation of land or of any estate or interest&nbsp; therein&nbsp; without&nbsp; joining&nbsp; the&nbsp; Treasurer of the Philippine Archipelago as a defendant therein."<br></blockquote>As the plaintiff-appellant was&nbsp; a minor at the time&nbsp; of the registration of the land and consequently no negligence can be imputed to her, it is clear from the sections&nbsp; quoted that in the absence of special circumstances to the contrary the assurance fund&nbsp; is secondarily liable for&nbsp; the damages suffered&nbsp; by her through the wrongful&nbsp; registration.<br><br>But the Attorney-General in his brief for the Insular Treasurer&nbsp; raises&nbsp; the&nbsp; point that Domingo&nbsp; Cuachon and Adela Gasataya prior to&nbsp; the registration must be considered to have held&nbsp; the property in&nbsp; trust and for the&nbsp; benefit of the plaintiff; that the relation of trustee and&nbsp; cestui que trust was thus created; and that the case therefore falls under section 106 of the&nbsp; Land&nbsp; Registration Act,&nbsp; which provides that "the assurance fund shall&nbsp; not be liable&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; for&nbsp; any loss or damage or deprivation occasioned&nbsp; by a breach of trust, whether express, implied, or constructive, by any registered owner who&nbsp; is&nbsp; a trustee, or by the improper exercise of any sale in mortgage-foreclosure proceedings."<br><br>At first&nbsp; blush the Attorney-General's&nbsp; contention seems quite plausible.&nbsp; For&nbsp; want of&nbsp; better&nbsp; terms&nbsp; the&nbsp; words "trust" and "trustee"&nbsp; are frequently used in a broad and popular&nbsp; sense&nbsp; so&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; embrace a&nbsp; large variety of relations.&nbsp; Thus if a person obtains legal title to property by&nbsp; fraud or concealment, courts&nbsp; of&nbsp; equity&nbsp; will impress upon the title&nbsp; a so-called&nbsp; constructive&nbsp; trust in&nbsp; favor of the defrauded party.&nbsp; The&nbsp; use of the word "trust"&nbsp; in this sense is not technically&nbsp; accurate: as&nbsp; Perry&nbsp; says, such trusts "are not trusts&nbsp; at all in the strict&nbsp; and&nbsp; proper signification of the word 'trust'; but&nbsp; as&nbsp; courts are&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; in administering the&nbsp; same remedy in a certain class of frauds as are administered in fraudulent breaches of trusts, and as courts and the profession have&nbsp; concurred in calling such frauds constructive trusts, there can be no misapprehension in continuing the&nbsp; same phraseology, while a change might lead&nbsp; to confusion&nbsp; and&nbsp; misunderstanding." (Perry&nbsp; on Trusts, 5th ed., sec. 166.)<br><br>If this is the kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; constructive trust referred&nbsp; to in section 106, <i>supra</i>, it must&nbsp; be conceded that the&nbsp; plaintiff cannot recover damages from the assurance&nbsp; fund.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that such is not the case, becomes quite apparent&nbsp; upon an examination&nbsp; of sections&nbsp; 101 and&nbsp; 102,&nbsp; above&nbsp; quoted, in which the right of recovery from&nbsp; the&nbsp; assurance&nbsp; fund in cases of registration&nbsp; through fraud&nbsp; or wrongful&nbsp; acts is expressly recognized&nbsp; and which, in&nbsp; our opinion, clearly show that the term trust as used in section 106&nbsp; must be taken&nbsp; in its technical and more&nbsp; restricted&nbsp; sense.&nbsp; Indeed, if it&nbsp; were to be&nbsp; regarded&nbsp; in its broadest sense, the assurance fund&nbsp; would,&nbsp; under the conditions here prevailing, be of little or no value.<br><br>Bouvier defines&nbsp; a trust in&nbsp; its technical sense&nbsp; as&nbsp; "a&nbsp; right of property,&nbsp; real&nbsp; or&nbsp; personal, held by&nbsp; one party for the benefit of another."&nbsp; In the&nbsp; present case we have&nbsp; this situation : The&nbsp; plaintiff was&nbsp; a minor&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time of the registration of the land&nbsp; and had no legal guardian.&nbsp; It is true that her mother&nbsp; in&nbsp; whose name the land was registered was the natural guardian&nbsp; of her person,&nbsp; but&nbsp; that guardianship did not extend to the property of the minor and conferred no&nbsp; right to the administration of the&nbsp; same (Palet <i>vs.</i> Aldecoa &amp; Co., 15 Phil., 232;&nbsp; Ibañez&nbsp; de&nbsp; Aldecoa <i>vs.</i> Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation,&nbsp; 30 Phil., 228) and the plaintiff, being a minor and under disability, could not create a technical&nbsp; trust of any kind.&nbsp; Applying Bouvier's definition to this&nbsp; state of facts, it&nbsp; is clear&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was no trust&nbsp; in&nbsp; its technical signification.&nbsp; The mother had no right of property or administration in her daughter's estate and&nbsp; was nothing&nbsp; but a mere&nbsp; trespasser. The language of the New Jersey&nbsp; Court of Chancery in the case of Henninger <i>vs.</i> Heald (30 Atlantic,&nbsp; 809),&nbsp; is therefore particularly apposite in the present case,<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; the case before us the title was acquired by Heald tortiously, or in violation of every well-settled principle of law.&nbsp; It never was trust property.&nbsp; Strictly speaking,&nbsp; he was not a trustee, any more than a trespasser or other wrongdoer.&nbsp; The wrongdoer&nbsp; who&nbsp; becomes possessed of property under such circumstances has been&nbsp; styled a 'trustee;' but this is for want of a better term, and because he has no&nbsp; title to property, and really holds it for the true owner.&nbsp; It might as well be said that, where two persons conspire to possess&nbsp; themselves of the personal property of another when he brings trover for its recovery, they should be styled 'trustees,' instead of 'tort feasors' and should be&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; to claim the benefit of a lien for care or for provender."<br></blockquote>From what has been said it follows&nbsp; that the&nbsp; judgment absolving&nbsp; the Insular Treasurer from the complaint must be&nbsp; reversed.&nbsp; We also&nbsp; note&nbsp; from the&nbsp; record&nbsp; that Adela Gasataya&nbsp; died March 1, 1923, before the&nbsp; trial of the case and that an administrator of her estate&nbsp; was appointed.&nbsp; It was therefore error to render judgment&nbsp; against her personally.&nbsp; It may further be noted that the measure of damages&nbsp; applied by&nbsp; the court below, i. e. the&nbsp; full value of the land,&nbsp; is not strictly accurate.&nbsp; The property was subject to a&nbsp; life estate&nbsp; of one-third in&nbsp; favor of Adela Gasa-taya&nbsp; as the widow&nbsp; of&nbsp; Domingo Gayondato, the value of which must be deducted from the total&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the fee simple. It may also&nbsp; be&nbsp; observed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the amount demanded in the complaint is only P30,000 and that the land was sold&nbsp; to Francisco Rodriguez for but little&nbsp; more than P25,000.&nbsp; We are therefore&nbsp; of the opinion that the damages&nbsp; awarded should be reduced to&nbsp; P25,000.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is reversed, and it is hereby ordered that the defendants Domingo Cuachon and the estate of&nbsp; Adela Gasataya jointly and severally&nbsp; pay to the plaintiff, the sum of P25,000, with interest&nbsp; at the&nbsp; rate of 6&nbsp; per cent per annum from August 18, 1922, the&nbsp; date of the filing&nbsp; of the complaint, with the costs.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; further ordered that if the execution of this judgment is returned unsatisfied in whole or&nbsp; in part and the&nbsp; officer&nbsp; returning the execution certifies that the amount upon the execution cannot be collected except by application to the assurance fund&nbsp; and the&nbsp; court having&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; over the action shall be satisfied as to the truth of such return, said court shall order the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the execution and&nbsp; costs, or so much thereof as remains unpaid, to be paid by the Treasurer of the&nbsp; Philippine Archipelago&nbsp; out&nbsp; of the assurance fund.&nbsp; The complaint will stand dismissed&nbsp; as to Francisco Rodriguez.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs will be allowed.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i> Avanceña, C. J., Street, Villamor, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
