<p>March 25, 1920, the defendants executed a mortgage to the plaintiff on all 
the sugar cane planted and sown during the agricultural years 1920 and 1921 on 
the hacienda Santa Julia, situated in the municipality of Himamaylan, Occidental 
Negros, estimated to yield 2,500 piculs of sugar approximately, and upon ten 
different carabaos, which are specifically described in the mortgage. Also 
one-half of a parcel of agricultural land in the sitio of Kabigtagan, 
municipality of Kabankalan, Province of Occidental Negros. containing an area of 
thirty-two hectares, also specifically described. The mortgage recites that it 
is executed as security for the payment to the plaintiff of the sum of P8,000, 
with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum in the nature of a loan. Also 
that:</p>
<p>"Fourth. The mortgagor is under obligation to consign to the mortgagee 2,500 
piculs of sugar approximately of the crops mortgaged of the year 1920-1921 
actually existing on the lands above indicated, which crop shall be 2,500 piculs 
approximately.</p>
<p>"Fifth. The debtor hereby binds himself to sell to the mortgagee all the 
sugar he may harvest up to the amount of P8,000, with interest thereon; 
provided, that the purchase to be made by the creditor of said sugar must be on 
the basis of P1.50 less for each picul than the price the same may have in the 
Iloilo market on the date or dates of its arrival.</p>
<p>"Sixth. All transportation expenses and internal revenue shall be for the 
account of the mortgagor." It further provides that should the mortgagor violate 
any of the conditions, he should pay the further sum of P500 as attorney's fees. 
The mortgage was duly signed, witnessed, acknowledged and filed for record.</p>
<p>For a breach of its conditions, the plaintiff commenced this action. Among 
other things, the complaint alleges that between March 25, 1920, and April 15, 
1921, plaintiff furnished the defendants various sums of money and merchandise, 
on which the defendants agreed to pay interest at the rate of 12 per cent per 
annum, the full amount of which with interest to April 15, 1921, is P18,166.79. 
An itemized list of the items is attached to, and made a part of, the complaint. 
It is then alleged that notwithstanding the provisions of the mortgage, the 
defendants delivered only 866.20 piculs of sugar on February 14, 1921, the value 
of which was P6,265.92, for which defendants were duly credited; that there is 
now due and owing from the defendants to the plaintiff the sum of P11,900.87, 
with interest from April 15, 1921, at the rate of 12 per cent per annum; that 
under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff is entitled to recover P500 as 
attorney's fees, and prays judgment for the respective amounts, "and for such 
other relief as the court may deem just and equitable."</p>
<p>For answer, the defendants made a general denial, and, as a special defense, 
"allege that the contract and contracts upon which the suit is based are 
usurious in that the rate of interest is greater than that allowed by law, that 
is to say, the same is in excess of 12 per cent and also because the contracts 
called for payment of the alleged debt and loans in crops and there is no 
provision in said contract and contracts that the said crops should be taken 
over by the plaintiff at their market value," and they pray that the complaint 
be dismissed, the contract be declared null and void, and for damages resulting 
from the attachment upon the property.</p>
<p>Upon such issues, the trial court found from the evidence that, under the 
terms and conditions of the mortgage, the plaintiff had loaned and advanced to 
the defendant, Jose Rivera, money and merchandise to the value of P18,166.79, 
upon which the defendant had only paid P6,265.92, the agreed price of the 866.20 
piculs of sugar, leaving a balance due and owing plaintiff of P1,900.87. The 
court also found that all of the loan was usurious, with the exception of 
P3,500, and rendered judgment for that amount, with interest on P1,500 at the 
rate of 12 per cent from April 28, 1920, and legal interest on the remaining 
P2,000 from the date of the filing of the complaint, and absolved the defendant 
Regina Avellar, upon the theory that it had not been proven that she had 
anything whatever to do with Exhibits 1 and 2, covering the P3,500 transaction, 
and denied the right of the plaintiff to recover attorney's fees. From this 
decision plaintiff appeals, specifying the following assignments of error:</p>
<p>"1. The court erred in rendering judgment condemning the defendant Jose 
Rivera to pay the plaintiff only the sum of P3,500 instead of P11,900.87, the 
difference between the total amount advanced to the defendants, P18,166.79, and 
the P6,265.92, value of the 866 piculs of sugar delivered by the defendants to 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>"2. The court erred in not allowing P500 to plaintiff as attorney's fees.</p>
<p>"3. The court erred in deciding that the P1.50 less per picul to be paid by 
the plaintiff to the defendants was in the form of interest, and consequently 
usurious.</p>
<p>"4. The judgment of the lower court is contrary to the weight of the 
evidence.</p>
<p>"5. The judgment of the lower court is contrary to law.</p>
<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>It will be noted that the appellant does not make any assignment of error as 
to the decision of the court in absolving the defendant Regina Avellar. Neither 
is it discussed in its brief.</p>
<p>The mortgage was executed to secure the amount of the original loan of 
P8,000, and the trial court found as a fact that all other amounts were advanced 
and loaned to the defendant Jose Rivera upon the same conditions as those stated 
in the mortgage. It specifically provides that the P8,000 shall draw interest at 
the rate of 12 per cent per annum, and that the estimated crop of 2,500 piculs 
of sugar shall be assigned to the mortgagee, and that the proceeds of sale shall 
be applied in satisfaction of the debt. It further recites "that the purchase to 
be made by the creditor of said sugar must be on the basis of P1.50 less for 
each picul than the price the same may have in the Iloilo market on the date or 
dates of its arrival." In other words, that Jose Rivera bound himself to deliver 
to the plaintiff the amount of the crop estimated to be 2,500 piculs, and to 
sell it to plaintiff at P1.50 less than the mar- ket price of sugar.</p>
<p>If the transaction had been carried out as agreed upon between the parties, 
the plaintiff would not only have received 12 per cent interest on the amount of 
his loan, but in addition he would have received the further sum of P3,750, the 
difference between the market price of the sugar and the price which plaintiff 
was to pay for it. The plaintiff contends that he was to be paid the P1.50 per 
picul for his commission and expenses in the handling and sale of the sugar. But 
the mortgage will not bear that construction. It does not contain any provision 
of that nature. It is very apparent that the promise of Jose Rivera to sell the 
sugar to plaintiff for "P1.50 less than the market price, in addition to 
interest at 12 per cent per annum, was one of the inducements for the making of 
the loan.</p>
<p>We agree with the trial court that the mortgage upon its face should be 
construed as a usurious transaction. It found that the total amount of 
plaintiff's claim was P18,166.79. But as pointed out in the appellees' brief, 
that amount includes interest on the loan up to the filing of the complaint, or 
P1,394.34. Hence, it follows that, exclusive of interest, the actual amount 
loaned to the defendant was P16,772.45. Deducting from this P6,265.92, the value 
of the sugar delivered to plaintiff, it leaves a balance due and owing of 
P10,506.53, which, exclusive of interest, is the amount which the trial court 
found was due and owing from Jose Rivera to the plaintiff. As a matter of fact, 
there is no dispute about the amount. In legal effect, the defendant admits that 
amount to be correct, but contends that because the transaction was usurious, it 
was void and, therefore, he is released from all liability, and that plaintiff 
is not entitled to recover anything.</p>
<p>In other words, in legal effect, Jose Rivera admits that he got that amount 
of money and that he owes it to the plaintiff, but because the transaction was 
usurious, that he is released from the debt, and plaintiff cannot enforce his 
claim. That position is not tenable. If the defendant had paid the debt and had 
complied with his contract, he would then be in a position to recover any 
usurious interest which he paid. But, here, the defendant breached the contract 
and only delivered about one-third of the amount of sugar which he agreed to 
deliver, and the court finds as a fact that, exclusive of interest, there is now 
due and owing the plaintiff the sum of P10,506.53.</p>
<p>Upon what theory can the defendant breach his own contract and rely upon its 
enforcement? Upon what legal principle can he deny liability upon a contract 
which he repudiated and failed to perform ? How and in what manner has the 
defendant paid the amount of the original loan, which he admits having received? 
Upon what legal or equitable principle can he defeat the payment of the amount 
of the original loan for the reason that he failed and neglected to perform his 
own contract? By no fiction or rule of law would the fact that the interest was 
usurious and was never paid by the defendant operate as a payment or 
satisfaction of the original loan.</p>
<p>In any event, he should pay the plaintiff the amount which he justly owes 
him. That question was squarely met and decided in the case of Aguilar vs. 
Rubiato and Gonzalez Vila (40 Phil., 570), which upon legal principle was 
followed in Delgado vs. Alonso Duque Valgona, decided by this court on March 31, 
1923, and reported in the Philippine Reports, vol. 44, page 739, and which was 
cited and approved in Go Chioco vs. Martinez, decided by this court on October 
17, 1923, p. 256, <em>ante</em>, where the syllabus says:</p>
<p>"2. USURIOUS LOAN; ACTION TO RECOVER PRINCIPAL.— Under Act No. 2655, all 
usurious loan is void, but this does not mean that the debtor may keep the 
principal received by him as loan, thus unjustly enriching himself to the damage 
of the creditor, but that the creditor has no right of action for the recovery 
of the stipulated interest, although he may sue for the recovery of the 
principal loaned."</p>
<p>That is this case. Upon that decision the plaintiff is entitled to judgment 
for the full amount of its claim against the defendant Jose Rivera.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and one will be entered here in 
favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, Jose Rivera, for the sum of 
P10,506.53, with interest on P1,500 of that amount at the rate of 12 per cent 
per annum from the 28th day of April, 1920, and with interest upon the balance 
of that amount from April 19, 1921, the. supposed date of the filing of the 
original complaint, at the rate of 6 per cent per annum, and with costs in this 
and the lower court, but without attorney's fees.</p>
<p>It further appearing that an attachment was issued and levied upon the 
property of the defendant to secure plaintiff's claim, it is further ordered 
that the property so attached be sold to satisfy the judgment. So ordered.</p>
