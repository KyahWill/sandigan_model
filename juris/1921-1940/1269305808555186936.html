				<BR><BR><p> </p><div align="justify">Plaintiffs brought this action in the
Court of First Instance of Capiz for the annulment of the deed of sale,
Exhibit A, executed in the municipality of Capiz, Capiz Province, by
Sabas Escutin, now deceased, on February 26, 1932, and ratified before
the notary public, Rafael Lozada, on the same date, whereby he conveyed
to the defendant lot No. 1801 of the cadastral survey of Dao, Capiz
Province, for P1,925.
<p> The trial judge found the deed in question to be null and void
because it was simulated and fraudulent, and that the land therein
described was the property of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p> It appears from the evidence that Sabas Escutin was married forty
years ago to Paula Arboly, who is still living, by whom he had four
children, the plaintiffs herein. Formerly Sabas Escutin lived with his
wife and children in the municipality of Dao, but he left them and for
many years prior to his death on March 10, 1932, had been living with
his mistress, Juana Yap, in Capiz. The defendant Socorro Escutin is the
daughter of Juana Yap, and lived in the same house with Sabas Escutin
and her mother. Sabas Escutin was sick for a long time before he died.
On February 26, 1932, twelve days prior to his death, Sabas Escutin
executed the public instrument in question, which purports to evidence
the sale to the defendant for P1,925 of a parcel of registered land in
the municipality of Dao, having an area of 19 hectares, 21 ares, and 43
centares, more or less. The reasonable market value of this land, a
part of which was used for growing rice and the rest of it for raising
corn, was P3,750.</p>
<p> The contention of the appellant is that the consideration of P1,925
was delivered to Sabas Escutin in cash at the time of the execution of
the deed; that the document was signed by Sabas Escutin in the presence
of two employees of the Court of First Instance of Capiz and the notary
public, Rafael Lozada. No money was paid over in the presence of the
witnesses. The notary public testified, however, that the defendant
took a bundle of bank note3 from a wardrobe in the room where the
document was signed and handed the money to Sabas Escutin, who counted
it.</p>
<p> The .document in question was presented to the register of deeds of
the province on April 27, 1932, but no transfer certificate of title
was issued in favor of the defendant, nor did the defendant take
possession of the land.</p>
<p> To state the fact euphemistically, we cannot credit the testimony
of the notary public respecting the delivery of the money by the
defendant to the deceased Sabas Escutin. The evidence shows that
neither the defendant, who is unmarried, nor her mother had any
occupation or profession or any real property or other source of income
which might have enabled the defendant to pay the sum stipulated in the
document in question. The defendant and her mother lived in the house
with Sabas Esmtin and at his expense. When the family of the deceased
came to remove his body to Dao for burial, the defendant and her mother
stated that Sabas Escutin had not left any money, and his family had to
defray the expenses of his interment.</p>
<p> Daniel Amancio, an inspector of the Capiz Motor Bus Co., testified
that in February, 1932 Juana Yap told him that Sabas Escutin had a
parcel of land in Lacaron, in the municipality of Dao, which he was
trying to sell; that he answered that he did not have any money with
which to buy it; that Juana Yap then told him that he was not to be the
real purchaser, but only a figurehead, because in case of the death of
Sabas Escutin he would convey the land to Socorro Escutin; that when he
refused, the defendant said that he did not have any pity for her,
although she regarded him as a brother.</p>
<p> Sofronia Escolin testified that she took care of Sabas Escutin
during his last illness; that she was present when Juana Yap and the
defendant begged him to convey the land in the barrio of Lacaron,
municipality of Dao, to the defendant, but he did not answer them; that
three days later the defendant and her mother cried and again requested
Sabas Escutin to convey the land in Lacaron to the defendant; that
Juana Yap left the house but came back two hours later with a document,
which was placed by her on a book on a pillow, and Sabas Escutin then
signed it; that no money was paid by the defendant or her mother to
Sabas Escutin; that the defendant told her that the document was
executed in order that she might have something to live on in case of
the death of her father; that the defendant requested her not to
mention the matter to anyone.</p>
<p> Neither the defendant nor her mother took the witness stand,
although they were present in court when Daniel Amancio and Sofronia
Escolin testified, and the case for the defendant as to the payment of
the consideration rests upon the uncorroborated testimony of the notary
public. In our opinion the evidence fully sustains the findings of the
lower court that the consideration stated in the deed was fictitious,
and the document was executed in fraud of the plaintiffs. It is
therefore without force or effect in accordance with article 1275 of
the Civil Code, which provides that contracts without consideration or
with an illicit consideration produce no effect whatsoever.</p>
<p> It was held in the case of Ocejo, Perez &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em>
Flores and Bas (40 Phil., 921), that a contract of purchase and sale is
null and void and produces no effect whatsoever where it appears that
the same is without the cause or the consideration which should have
been the motive thereof, or that the purchase price which appears
therein as paid was never in fact paid by the purchaser to the vendor.</p>
<p> In the case of De Belen <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs and
Sheriff of Manila (46 Phil., 241), this court held that a simulated
transfer of property made without consideration and with intent to.
hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors of the grantor constitutes no
obstacle to the levy of legal process of any sort directed against the
grantor; that in such case no independent action to rescind or annul
the transfer is necessary; that a simulated contract lacks some of the
elements necessary to make any contract whatever and may be treated as
non-existent for all purposes.</p>
<p> In the case of Gallion <em>vs.</em> Gayares (53 Phil., 43, 48),
this court said: "* * * It is established doctrine in this court that a
simulated transfer of property made without consideration and with
intent to defraud the creditors of the grantor may be treated as
non-existent (De Belen <em>vs.</em> Collector of Customs and Sheriff
of Manila, 46 Phil., 241). A wife who is damnified by a fraudulent
conveyance of property, effected by her husband, is substantially in
the position of a creditor who is defrauded by a fictitious transfer
executed by his debtor. We are of the opinion, in short, that the wife,
so defrauded, has a remedy, under article 1413 of the Civil Code, to
annul the transfer and cancel the Torrens title issued in favor of the
grantee. * * *</p>
<p> It is true, as alleged in the fourth assignment of error, that if
the contract in question were valid in all other respects, its validity
would not be affected by the fact that the notary public before whom it
was acknowledged was not eligible for appointment in the provincial
capital because he was not an attorney-at-law. The decision appealed
from does not rest, however, upon the erroneous holding of the lower
court respecting the acknowledgment, but upon the lack of
consideration. This disposes of the case on its merits.</p>
<p> In the first and second assignments of error the defendant and
appellant alleges that the trial court erred in denying her motion,
dated April 4,1933 (Bill of Exceptions, p. 9), to strike out paragraph
III of the complaint and the words, "with his paramour, their
daughter", contained in paragraph IV of the complaint and also the
words, "his illegitimate daughter and the paramour of the said
deceased," contained in paragraph VI of .the complaint; and in
admitting evidence tending to investigate the paternity and filiation
of the appellant with regards to the deceased Sabas Escutin over the
objection of the defendant and appellant.</p>
<p> We think these two assignments of error are well taken, because the
allegations in the complaint to the effect that Sabas Escutin was the
father of the defendant were immaterial and irrelevant, and should have
been stricken out in accordance with section 107 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. The purpose for which the action was brought was to annul a
deed of sale executed by Sabas Escutin in favor of the daughter of his
mistress. The question of the paternity of the defendant was not
involved.</p>
<p> As to whether or not the prohibition of article 141 of the Civil
Code of any inquiry into the paternity of illegitimate children who do
not have the legal qualification of natural children is applicable in a
case like the present, we do not now need to decide. "Generation is a
mysterious act of nature." (Borres and Barza <em>vs.</em> Municipality
of Panay, 42 Phil., 643, 651; decision of the Supreme Court of Spain,
April 20, 1892.) Plaintiffs had no means of establishing the truth of
their allegations respecting the paternity of the defendant. The
testimony of plaintiffs' witnesses that Sabas Escutin was the father of
the defendant is of no probative value and the finding of the trial
judge that the defendant is an adulterous child of the deceased Sabas
Escutin is clearly not justified by the evidence. The errors complained
of are not, however, reversible errors, because they in no way affect
the proof that the contract in question was without consideration.</p>
<p> The decision of the lower court is therefore affirmed, with the costs against the appellant.</p>
<p> <em>Avancena, C. J., Abad Santos, Hull, </em>and<em> Diaz, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
