				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These two cases were tried together in the  court below and but one judgment rendered for both.<br><br>The decision handed down  on August 3,  1918 in regard to  lot 1897 in cadastral  proceeding  No. 4, G. L.  R. 0. Record No. 103 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"It having been shown  by the evidence  adduced at the trial that,  except  for certain portions of  riparian  forest land, not  exceeding  200  hectares  covered  with  trees of the first, second, and third groups, along the Patalac, Palasan, and  Buhay creeks,  all of the land in Question has been known for more than forty years to date, as the private property, and in continuous possession as owners, of Antonio Sangabol's father, and afterwards of his children and grandchildren, who subsequently sold it to the spouses Bartolome A. Ramos and Jorja Torres,  it is ordered that after  the portions specified above as containing timber have been segregated from lot 1897, the remaining portion be adjudged to, and registered in the name of, the conjugal partnership of Bartolome A. Ramos and Jorja Torres.  The cadastral surveyor  is hereby ordered with the aid of the forest inspector, to identify the portions covered by trees of the first, second, and third groups, not  to exceed 200 hectares, along the aforementioned creeks,  and to segregate them from the lot  in question, later  filing  with the court a sketch together with the proper technical  description, showing the various portions or new lots into which lot 1897 is subdivided."<br></blockquote><br>No appeal was taken from this judgment.<br><br>This lot originally belonged to Antonio Sangabol's heirs from whom Bartolome A. Ramos and his wife Jorja Torres purchased it.  But this sale having been subsequently rescinded, Antonio Sangabol's heirs conveyed  it to Arsenio Sangueza, who later also sold it to Fernando Busuego, and who, in turn, transferred it to the spouses Fernandez Lopez  and Carmen Gonzales.  In view of these conveyances, the court on January 6, 1922 amended its decision rendered on August 3, 1918, upon petition of the interested parties, and ordered  that, after the exclusion  of  the portions not to exceed 200 hectares, pursuant to the judgment of March 3, 1918, this lot be adjudged to, and registered in the name of, the spouses Vicente Lopez and Carmen  Gonzales.  By the order of the court, surveyor Silverio Choco accompanied by an inspector appointed by the Bureau of Forestry went to the land for the purpose of locating  the portions which could be considered forest land, in the segregation ordered. As a result of this action, the provincial fiscal of Nueva Ecija,  at the request of  the  Director  of the  Bureau of Forestry, filed a  petition  in  the  court  on May 22, 1923, to the effect that, after an investigation by the said Bureau, it was found that the land included in lot 1897 is not forest land throughout, and he therefore prays that only a strip of 15 meters on each side of the creeks be segregated from said lot.  The spouses Lopez and  Gonzales objected  to this petition and made application that all of said  lot be registered  in their name.  On June  11, 1923 this cause was heard at the request of the fiscal, there being present the said fiscal and the attorneys for Vicente Lopez and Carmen Gonzales, the latter introducing  their evidence and  the provincial  fiscal  waiving  his  right  to  present any.  On July 9th of the  same year, the court, finding that said lot 1897 did not contain any portion which might be considered as forest land,  denied  the provincial fiscal's petition and ordered the registration of the whole  lot in the name of the spouses Vicente Lopez and Carmen  Gonzales.<br><br>In  1920,  during the course of these proceedings,  the plaintiffs occupied the two portions of  land  included  in the 200 hectares subject to segregation in accordance with the court's order, as a homestead.  Said plaintiffs continued in said  possession levelling trees and otherwise preparing the land for cultivation, until 1921.<br><br>The plaintiffs  now bring this action against the spouses Vicente Lopez and Carmen Gonzales praying that they be ordered to transfer to them the parcels  of land occupied by them, or, if such an order cannot lie, that they be ordered to pay them the amount spent by  them in improving these portions.<br><br>The court  absolved the  defendants from the complaint.  The plaintiffs  allege that they spent P5,486.30 on these portions.  They base their  action on section 102 of Act No. 2874, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>"Any owner of uncultivated agricultural land who knowingly permits application for  the  same to be made  to the Government and  the land  to be tilled and  improved by a bona  fide grantee without protesting  to the  Bureau of Lands within one year  after cultivation has begun, shall loss all right to the part of the land so cultivated and improved,  unless he shall  bring action  in the proper court before  such action for recovery prescribes  and obtains favorable judgment therein, in which case the court shall, upon its decision having become  final, order the payment to the grantee, within a reasonable period, of the indemnity fixed by said court for the cultivation and improvement."<br></blockquote><br>It is seen from the foregoing that in the years 1920 and 1921 when  the  plaintiffs occupied and worked these portions preparatory to cultivation  thereof, defendants' title to said portions had not yet been defined, since the registration of  lot 1897 in their name ordered  by the trial court was subject to the segregation of an area not to exceed 200 hectares in which the portions occupied by the plaintiffs were situated in that year.  Such being the case, when the plaintiffs occupied these  portions,  the defendants could not proceed against them, since they had not yet been declared the owners of these 200 hectares.<br><br>But the plaintiffs were  undoubtedly possessors in good faith and made these improvements  on the  land  in the belief that they were entitled to make them, and that they would eventually become the owners  thereof.  Under  article 453 of  the Civil Code, as such bona fide possessors, they are entitled to reimbursement of the useful expenditures, with  the right to retain the land until such  reimbursement is made.<br><br>Plaintiffs  admit that between the two of them, they succeeded in cleaning  up and making ready for cultivation only 15 hectares.  They likewise  admit that the amount of P5,486.30 which they  allege  having spent,  consisted mainly of the purchase of farming  implements and work animals,  which  they still possess  and which are in good condition.  They also admit that as reimbursement of their labors on the land they have received its fruits.  The right to reimbursement for expenses is  limited to the increased value of the  land due thereto.  Naturally, the  cost of the farming implements  and the work animals  should be excluded from the computation, since the plaintiffs still  have them and the latter  do not remain on  the  land,  as well as the expenses through  which the plaintiffs received the fruits, insofar  as they were made for their own benefit.  The evidence does not distinguish one expense from another in order to determine which belongs to the  defendants by reason of the increased value of the land.  But,  in  view of all the circumstances of the case, we consider the sum of P50 per hectare as reasonable.<br><br>In virtue whereof, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the defendants are ordered to pay P750 to the plaintiffs,  with the right to retain the portion  occupied by them until they are reimbursed in this sum  by the defendants, without special pronouncement as  to  costs.  So ordered.<br><br><br><i>Street, Villamor, Ostrand, Johns,</i> and  <i>Villa-Real, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
