				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos 
Sur finding the defendant, Felix Soria, guilty of homicide and sentencing him 
to suffer fourteen years, eight months and one day of<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion temporal</span> with 
the accessory penalties and usual indemnity. 
<p>It appears from the evidence that on the evening of October 22, 1926, some 
boys or young men were practising boxing on the bank of the River Narvacan in 
Ilocos Sur. While the boxing was going on, the now deceased Rosendo Abiang 
appeared on the scene. He was apparently under the influence of liquor, and, 
after criticising the style of the boxers, offered to teach them the art. One of 
the boys, Magno Pascua, accepted the challenge and put on the gloves with 
Abiang. There is some dispute as to the result of the boxing between the two, 
but it seems evident that Abiang was not in condition to do any damage to his 
opponent, and the evidence to the effect that he himself received several heavy 
blows does not seem unreasonable.</p>
<p>The gloves used belonged to one Telesforo Soria. He had lent them to his 
young nephew, Amparo Soria, who in turn allowed the other boys to use them. 
After the bout between Abiang and Magno Pascua was over, Abiang refused to 
return the gloves and threatening to cut them to pieces with his bolo, left the 
place and took the gloves with him. Amparo complained to his uncle, Telesforo 
Soria, who in company with Felix Soria and with one Dominador Pimentel set out 
to find Abiang and recover the gloves. When they found Abiang, it appeared that 
he had already turned the gloves over to Amparo. The evidence for the 
prosecution is to the effect that, notwithstanding the fact that Abiang no 
longer had the gloves, Telesforo took away his bolo, and Felix Soria first 
struck him in the left eye with his fist and thereafter struck him on the neck 
with an iron bar about one-half inch thick, and also struck him on the throat 
with a brass knuckle; that Abiang fell down, and his attackers went away, but 
that Felix Soria returned and again struck Abiang on the thigh with the iron 
bar. Upon this point the evidence for the defense is in direct conflict with 
that of the prosecution and is to the effect that upon meeting Abiang, they were 
informed that he had already returned the gloves and no violence was offered 
him. </p>
<p>The following day Abiang was examined by Dr. Antonio Nolasco, who found that 
he was suffering from soreness in the larynx and the esophagus. There were no 
external marks on the throat or neck except a slight swelling of the latter. 
</p>
<p>The condition of Abiang became gradually worse, and he finally died on 
November 18, 1926. In the following autopsy Doctor Nolasco found that the death 
was due to septicaemia caused by an abscess formed in the esophagus; that the 
abscess might have been produced by a blow on the throat but that that blow 
could not have been inflicted with a brass knuckle or an iron bar a half an inch 
thick without leaving external marks. Upon this point the testimony of Doctor 
Nolasco is supported by that of Dr. Eufemio Domingo, a witness for the defense. 
</p>
<p>In our opinion, the guilt of the defendant has not been proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt. It is possible that he illtreated the deceased on the occasion 
above referred to, but we find it difficult to believe that he in rapid 
succession struck the deceased first with the fist, thereafter with an iron bar, 
and finally with a brass knuckle; there could hardly have been any necessity for 
such an inconvenient shifting of weapons. Neither do we believe that heavy blows 
on the neck and throat with a slender iron rod and with brass knuckles would not 
have left marks on the skin. It seems more likely that such injuries as there 
may have been, were received in the boxing contest. The abscess in the esophagus 
could have been caused in various ways, and it is to be observed that the death 
of the deceased did not occur until nearly a month after the alleged 
illtreatment. It is also significant that nothing appears to have been said to 
Doctor Nolasco, the physician of the deceased, about such illtreatment, though 
the doctor almost daily visited his patient during the latter's sickness. </p>
<p>For the reasons stated, the appealed judgment is reversed, and the appellant 
will stand acquitted of the crime charged with the costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>. So ordered.
