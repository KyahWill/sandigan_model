				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MAIN ET AL. (ATAS), DEFENDANTS. MAIN, APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This action deals with the crime of murder of which the defendant and 
appellant was accused and who was found guilty of homicide by the Court of First 
Instance of Davao and sentenced to fourteen years, eight months and one day 
reclusion temporal, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 1N500 
and to pay the costs. The defendant appeals from this judgment and assigns the 
following errors as committed by the trial court: In not applying the penalty 
taking into consideration the mitigating circumstances provided in article 11 of 
the Penal Code; in not taking into consideration the evidence of the defense and 
in convicting him.</p>
<p>We have examined the evidence and find it proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the appellant, prompted by resentment, was one of those who killed 
Mampudian while the latter was sleeping.</p>
<p>These facts are not sufficiently overthrown by the evidence of the 
defense.</p>
<p>The trial court, therefore, did not commit an error in convicting the 
appellant. Neither did it do so in imposing the penalty above-mentioned inasmuch 
as the accused is a non-Christian inhabitant of Mindanao to whom the provisions 
of section 106 of the Administrative Code of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu 
are applicable, by virtue of which the courts may use their prudent judgment and 
discretion. Said legal provision is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 106. <em>Sentences upon Moros and non-Christians.</em>â€” In pronouncing 
sentence upon a Moro or other non-Christian inhabitants of the Department, 
convicted of crime or misdemeanor, the judge or justice may ignore any minimum 
penalty provided by law for the offense, and may impose such penalty not in 
excess of the highest penalty provided by law, as, in his opinion, after taking 
into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including the state of 
enlightment of the accused and the degree of moral turpitude which attaches to 
the offense among his own people, will best subserve the interest of justice. 
The judge or justice may also, in his discretion at any time before the 
expiration of the period allowed for appeal, suspend the execution of any 
penalty or part thereof so imposed, subject to such conditions as he may 
prescribe.' Taking this special provision into consideration, we cannot follow 
the recommendation of the Attorney-General that the penalty of cadena perpettia 
be imposed upon the appellant which is, under general circumstances, the penalty 
for the crime in question, alleged and proved as murder, inasmuch as the record 
does not show abuse or undue use, on the part of the trial court, of the 
discretion granted in the legal provision above quoted.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the reasons stated, we find no error in the judgment appealed from the 
same is hereby affirmed, with the costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Street, Malcolm, Avancena, Villamor, Ostrand</em>, and <em>Johns, JJ., 
</em>concur.</p>
