				<BR><STRONG>DIAZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At midnight on October 9,&nbsp; 1935, the spouses Leon or Leonardo Nacpil&nbsp; and Marcelina Mercado&nbsp; were attacked and killed, and their son Jose Nacpil, 13 years of age, seriously&nbsp; wounded, while they&nbsp; were sleeping in&nbsp; their&nbsp; own house where they lived alone, in Maunani, within the barrio of Ungut in the municipality&nbsp; of Porac, Province of Pampanga, the house having later been burned by the person or persons who committed the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; It having resulted from the&nbsp; first&nbsp; investigations&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; authorities and theiragents that Ciriaco Piring, Leoncio Piring, Felix Capili and Flaviano Capili committed said acts, they were arrested and charged with double murder and serious physical injuries in two separate cases, it having been alleged in the information for double murder filed against them&nbsp; that they committed the crime with the&nbsp; aggravating circumstances&nbsp; of uninhabited place, disguise, dwelling,&nbsp; nighttime, cruelty and aid of armed persons.&nbsp; Upon their petition&nbsp; they were granted two separate trials in the case for double murder,&nbsp; one for Felix&nbsp; Capili and Flaviano Capili, and another for Ciriaco Piring and Leoncio Piring.&nbsp;&nbsp; For lack of&nbsp; evidence, everybody was acquitted except Ciriaco Piring&nbsp; who was&nbsp; found guilty of said&nbsp; crime by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Pampanga which sentenced him to <i>reclusion&nbsp; perpetua</i>, having taken into consideration the mitigating&nbsp; circumstance of&nbsp; lack of instruction in his favor,&nbsp; in spite of having&nbsp; stated that the aggravating circumstances of&nbsp; disguise, dwelling and cruelty, in addition to&nbsp; the&nbsp; qualifying circumstance of treachery, were also present in the commission of the crime.&nbsp; Ciriaco Piring&nbsp; appealed from the&nbsp; sentence imposing upon him&nbsp; the penalty in question and&nbsp; that of indemnity&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P2,000 to the heirs of&nbsp; the deceased spouses, alleging that the&nbsp; lower court erred:&nbsp; (1) In giving credit to the testimony of the minor Jose Nacpil; (2)&nbsp; in admitting Exhibit D-1-A, which is&nbsp; his confession made before&nbsp; the justice of the peace, as&nbsp; evidence against him; and (3) in sentencing him to the above-stated penalty.<br><br>It has been proven by the prosecution and&nbsp; not disputed by&nbsp; the defense, that at midnight&nbsp; on October 9, 1935, a man&nbsp; whose face was&nbsp; covered by a handkerchief climbed into the house of Leon or&nbsp; Leonardo Nacpil and Marcelina Mercado, attacked them and their son Jose Nacpil with a bolo, while they were asleep, and later set fire to their house in order to burn it, as it in fact, burned.&nbsp; Leon or Leonardo Nacpil and Marcelina Mercado died instantly of the wounds received by&nbsp; them and their bodies were found burned and charred on&nbsp; the&nbsp; following&nbsp; day.&nbsp; It is also proven&nbsp; by the prosecution&nbsp; and not disputed by the defense&nbsp; that in the barrio where the deceased lived, there were some people who considered them witches; that one month or some weeks prior to the night in question, the accused Leoncio Piring, Ciriaco Piring and others went to the house of the deceased spouses to ask the deceased Leon or Leonardo Nacpil to explain why he had been&nbsp; circulating the&nbsp; story that they had robbed&nbsp; him of a plow; and as he told them, after a slight altercation, that he really suspected&nbsp; Leoncio Piring, Leoncio, together with his&nbsp; brother Ciriaco Piring and one De la Pena, challenged him to a fight, surrounding him later, holding him by the hands&nbsp; in order to take away his&nbsp; bolo, and wounding him&nbsp; in the little finger.<br><br>The boy Jose Nacpil testified that on the night in question he was awakened by the cries of his&nbsp; father; that he saw a man, whose face was covered by a handkerchief, attacked his father&nbsp; and mother with a bolo; that said man forthwith approached him&nbsp; saying "there is the boy",&nbsp; as if he were addressing somebody; that he was later struck in the&nbsp; face with a bolo, which rendered him unconscious; that when he regained consciousness,&nbsp; their house was already on fire; and had it not been for a&nbsp; voice that told him to "come down right away", he would not have gotten up because he had no strength&nbsp; to move.&nbsp; He further testified that the man whose face was covered by a handkerchief, who attacked him and his parents, was no other than the appellant; that he recognized the man not only by his voice with&nbsp; which&nbsp; he was already&nbsp; familiar, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; him, but also by the clothes he wore, which were the same as those worn by him in the morning of the following day, when the constabulary took him from his house for investigation.<br><br>The defense contends that the testimony of the boy Jose Nacpil&nbsp; should be disregarded because it is unworthy of credit; because his version of the incident, which he claims to have witnessed, is improbable, being based upon a miracle, and because miracles are&nbsp; unbelievable.&nbsp; In addition to the foregoing, said boy really testified that it was the child Jesus who, after he had jumped from their house to escape from the lire, led him to that of his sister Josefa&nbsp; Nacpil about a kilometer away.&nbsp; Be it a miracle or a hallucination that gave Jose Nacpil strength to arrive at his sister's house on&nbsp; the night in question, after he had already been wounded, the truth&nbsp; is that the&nbsp; appellant himself, in a confession made by him before the justice of the peace Ramon Miranda, on November 7, 1935&nbsp; (Exhibit D-1-A)— which confession he did not even attempt to contradict be- cause, on&nbsp; the contrary, his counsel stated in his brief that had the appellant testified at the trial, the only thing he could have stated would be the same as that contained in his confession—admitted that upon the invitation of his uncle Felix Capili,&nbsp; he accompanied the&nbsp; latter,&nbsp; together with Flaviano&nbsp; Capili and&nbsp; Leoncio&nbsp; Piring, to the house&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased for the purpose of killing them for being witches, although to lessen&nbsp; his&nbsp; liability he stated that at first he had refused to accompany him, telling that he did not want to take&nbsp; a life; that he finally decided to follow his uncle because the latter threatened&nbsp; to&nbsp; kill him&nbsp; if&nbsp; he did not do so; and that, at any rate, he did not directly participate in the commission of the crimes imputed to him and his co-accused, because&nbsp; the only one who went up the house to commit them and&nbsp; later set the house on fire was Felix Capili.&nbsp; Therefore, the testimony of the boy Jose&nbsp; Nacpil is neither, unworthy of credit, nor improbable, particularly, if it is taken into consideration that the clothes worn by the appellant in the morning after the night of the crime were similar if not the same as those which the boy saw were worn by the man who attacked *him and his parents. If to this is added the fact that the voice which&nbsp; uttered the words "there is&nbsp; the&nbsp; boy",&nbsp; referring to&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Nacpil, before he was wounded, belonged to the appellant himself, according to said witness there would be&nbsp; no doubt&nbsp; that said appellant&nbsp; directly participated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of the murder of&nbsp; Leon or Leonardo Nacpil and that of Marcelina Mercado.<br><br>It is not strange that&nbsp; the appellant has not admitted having&nbsp; personally committed the two crimes in question before&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; peace Ramon&nbsp; Miranda, because, ordinarily, it is the natural tendency of every transgressor, with very rare exceptions, to acquit&nbsp; himself of all liability while he can do so, or at least&nbsp; mitigate it&nbsp; in the eyes of the&nbsp; law and&nbsp; of his fellowmen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&nbsp; it not be said that as the&nbsp; appellant's admission contained&nbsp; in Exhibit D-1-A is based upon the fact therein stated that he was threatened with death by his uncle Felix Capili,&nbsp; instead of prejudicing him, greatly favors him, for it supplies him with evidence exempting&nbsp; him from all&nbsp; responsibility inasmuch as&nbsp; evidence of such nature, if&nbsp; admitted, must be&nbsp; admitted and accepted in its entirety,&nbsp; because it&nbsp; does&nbsp; not appear that the&nbsp; threat has been continuous and&nbsp; he had&nbsp; had no opportunity to evade it.&nbsp; It appears, however, that he had said opportunity because Felix&nbsp; Capili had left him and his companions Flaviano Capili&nbsp; and Leoncio Piring alone, when Felix Capili went up to&nbsp; the house of the deceased.&nbsp; The part of said document&nbsp; proving&nbsp; this reads: "*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; my&nbsp; uncle&nbsp; Felix&nbsp; Capili,&nbsp; his&nbsp; son&nbsp; Flaviano Capili, my&nbsp; younger brother Leoncio&nbsp; Piring and I were on our way to&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; of the spouses Leon Nacpil&nbsp; and Marcelina Mercado, when we reached a place overgrown with&nbsp; cogon near&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; Nacpils&nbsp; house, my uncle Felix Capili instructed us to stay there because it was too early* that at about 12 o'clock at&nbsp; night, according to his calculation, he brought us to the house&nbsp; of Leon Nacpil&nbsp; and Marcelina Mercado.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon arriving there&nbsp; my uncle Felix Capili went up to the house.&nbsp; He wanted us to follow&nbsp; him but we three did not go&nbsp; up; we remained downstairs."<br><br>The foregoing&nbsp; confession of the appellant disproves everything he may say about his having been threatened to death by Felix Capili and&nbsp; his not having conspired with the latter and the other two persons above-stated.<br><br>On the other hand, the rule that a confession should be admitted and considered in its entirety, whether a&nbsp; part thereof be favorable or unfavorable to the accused, stated in general terms in the case of United States vs. Alano (32 Phil., 381), is not absolute as this court has&nbsp; already held in People vs. Layos (60 Phil., 760).&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this is that there&nbsp; may be instances, and in fact there are some&nbsp; instances, where only a part of confessions or admissions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the nature&nbsp; of Exhibit&nbsp; D-1-A&nbsp; is admissible, rejecting the rest by reason of the improbability of the facts or statements contained therein, or because there are other reasons or facts showing that&nbsp; they are false thus&nbsp; making them unworthy of credit.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the present case, the testimony of Jose&nbsp; Nacpil, the clothes worn by the appellant on the morning of his arrest, his antecedents with the deceased Leon&nbsp; or Leonardo Nacpil, and the belief of some people of his barrio that Leon or Leonardo Nacpil and his wife were witches, disprove and destroy everything favorable to the appellant contained in his said confession,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; D-1-A.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; foregoing, it seems clear that the&nbsp; first two errors&nbsp; attributed to the lower court by the appellant are unfounded, and we are of the opinion that said appellant should be found guilty&nbsp; not&nbsp; of only&nbsp; one&nbsp; crime of double murder but of two crimes of murder:&nbsp; the one&nbsp; committed on&nbsp; the person of Leon or Leonardo Nacpil and that committed on&nbsp; the&nbsp; person of Marcelina Mercado.&nbsp;&nbsp; Treachery should be considered as a qualifying circumstance of said two&nbsp; crimes,&nbsp; and as&nbsp; aggravating circumstances those of disguise, as the fact that one covers his face with a handkerchief constitutes disguise because he thereby avoids recognition ; and dwelling, because said crimes were committed in the&nbsp; very&nbsp; house where the deceased lived.&nbsp; The only mitigating circumstance&nbsp; to be&nbsp; taken into consideration in favor of the appellant is his lack of instruction.<br><br>The&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; of nighttime,&nbsp; uninhabited&nbsp; place, cruelty&nbsp; and&nbsp; aid of&nbsp; armed persons&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be taken into consideration as aggravating&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; because the first,&nbsp; or nighttime,&nbsp; was&nbsp; necessarily included&nbsp; in&nbsp; that of treachery; that of uninhabited place, because it&nbsp; has not been proven&nbsp; that there were no houses near the house of the deceased; that of cruelty, because the fire, which is the fact in&nbsp; which said circumstance is&nbsp; made to consist, took place after the victims were&nbsp; already dead,&nbsp; the appellant not having taken advantage of said means&nbsp; to deliberately augment the seriousness of the crime; and that of aid of armed persons, because the appellant&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as those who cooperated with him in the commission of the crimes in question acted&nbsp; under the 3ame plan and for the&nbsp; same purpose.<br><br>Were it&nbsp; not for&nbsp; the fact that there has&nbsp; been no&nbsp; unanimity in&nbsp; imposing the death penalty upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant, this penalty&nbsp; should be the one imposed upon him, because by compensating the aggravating circumstance of disguise with&nbsp; the circumstance of lack of&nbsp; instruction&nbsp; there&nbsp; still remains the&nbsp; aggravating circumstance of dwelling which, by&nbsp; itself alone, is sufficient to warrant the&nbsp; imposition of said penalty.&nbsp; However, as there has been&nbsp; no&nbsp; unanimity in the&nbsp; decision, the penalty next&nbsp; lower&nbsp; to death,&nbsp; which is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> in each case,&nbsp; that is, for the murder of Leon or Leonardo Nacpil and for the murder&nbsp; of Marcelina Mercado, should be&nbsp; imposed upon him, by&nbsp; virtue of the provisions&nbsp; of section 133 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by section 2&nbsp; of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 3.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is modified, sentencing the appellant&nbsp; to <i>reclusion&nbsp; perpetua</i> for&nbsp; the murder of&nbsp; Leon or&nbsp; Leonardo&nbsp; Nacpil,&nbsp; and to another penalty of the same nature for the murder of Marcelina Mercado; and in each case to indemnify the heirs of&nbsp; each&nbsp; of the deceased in the sum of P1,000.&nbsp; The judgment in question is affirmed&nbsp; in&nbsp; all other respects,&nbsp; except in&nbsp; regard to the pronouncement thereof relative&nbsp; to the&nbsp; crime of serious physical injuries committed on the person of&nbsp; Jose Nacpil, which is left open for the decision of the Court of Appeals, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; of this instance to the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C&nbsp; J., Villa-Real, Imperial,&nbsp; Recto,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
