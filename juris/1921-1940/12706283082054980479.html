				G.R. No. 29414, July 17, 1928</h4>
				<H3>TEODORICO UY TIOCO, PETITIONER, VS. CARLOS IMPERIAL, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND ALEJANDRO M. PANIS, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain the 
respondent judge from compelling the petitioner to pay the sum of P11,250 to the 
other respondent, Alejandro Panis, out of the funds of the estate of the 
deceased Basilisa Yangco, of which estate said petitioner is the 
administrator.
<p align="justify">It appears from the record that the respondent Panis was 
counsel for the administration of said estate and that he on October 31, 1927, 
before the final settlement of accounts, presented a motion in the probate 
proceedings for the allowance of attorney's fees in the sum of P15,000. On 
December 5,1927, the respondent judge, over the objections in writing presented 
by the administrator, granted the motion and allowed the fees claimed by Panis. 
The administrator, herein petitioner, did not appeal from the order of the 
court, but on February 8, 1928, Jacinto Yangco, in his capacity as guardian 
<em>ad litem</em> of the minors Pedro and Bruno Uy Tioco, the sons and then only 
heirs of the deceased, presented a motion for reconsideration under section 113 
of the Code of Civil Procedure on the grounds that he was not notified of the 
motion for the allowance of fees and had no knowledge thereof or of the order 
granting the motion until a few days before the filing of the motion for 
reconsideration; that the fees allowed Panis were excessive and prejudicial to 
the interests of the estate; and that considering the nature of the work 
performed, the services rendered by him did not warrant the payment of the sum 
claimed. This motion was denied on February 15, 1928, the respondent judge 
holding that while the heirs of the deceased were not notified of the hearing of 
the motion for allowance of attorney's fees, such notice was duly served upon 
the administrator; that that was a sufficient compliance with the law; that the 
<em>curador ad litem</em> might have the right to intervene in the case but had 
no absolute right to be notified of the motion; that the provisions of section 
113 of the Code of Civil Procedure were not applicable to the case; and that, in 
any event, the motion for reconsideration is entirely without merit.</p>
<p align="justify">On February 23, 1928, the guardian <em>ad litem</em> excepted 
to the order of February 15, 1928, and gave notice of his intention to appeal to 
the Supreme Court. On the 28th of the same month, Attorney Felix Wijangco, on 
behalf of Panis, filed a motion in the probate proceedings in which he set forth 
that the minor Bruno Uy Tioco is now deceased and that his share of the 
inheritance will go to his father, the herein petitioner; that the property 
involved in the case is community property of which one-half belongs to the 
petitioner; that consequently the minor Pedro Uy Tioco is only entitled to a 
one-fourth of the property pertaining to the estate, and that therefore his 
appeal from the order allowing the attorney's fees can only relate to one-fourth 
of the amount allowed, wherefore the movent asked that the administrator be 
ordered to make payment of threefourths of the amount within five days from the 
presentation of the motion. To this motion the guardian ad litem objected, but 
under the date of March 6,1928, the respondent judge ordered the administrator 
to make payment of three-fourths of the P15,000, within five days. The 
administrator refused to make such payment, and on March 17th the court, after 
citing him to show cause, again ordered him to pay as provided for in the order 
of March 6, under penalty of removal from office. The present action was 
thereupon brought. Upon the filing of the petition the respondents were ordered 
to answer within ten days. Instead of filing an answer, as ordered, the 
respondents submitted a demurrer which we, considering that there can be no 
dispute as to the essential facts, shall regard as a sufficient answer to said 
petition.</p>
<p align="justify">In our opinion, the petition must be granted. The orders of 
March 6th and 17th for a partial payment of the fees claimed were issued after 
an appeal had been taken and perfected by the filing of an appeal bond approved 
by the court. The appeal was taken from the order of February 15 denying the 
motion for a reopening and reconsideration of the allowance for attorney's fees 
and involves the validity of that order and the finality of the order of 
December 5, 1927. Whether these orders were valid and final need not here be 
determined, but they are appealable, and we are not aware of any provision of 
law authorizing the lower court to enforce the immediate execution of such 
orders in probate proceedings after an appeal has been perfected. The interests 
of the appellee are supposed to be sufficiently protected by an adequate 
bond.</p>
<p align="justify">The arguments submitted indicate a misconception of the 
character of the liability for attorney's fees in probate proceedings. The 
services for which fees are claimed are supposed to have been rendered to the 
executor or administrator to assist him in the execution of his trust. The 
attorney can therefore not hold the estate directly liable for his fees; such 
fees are allowed to the executor or administrator and not to the attorney. The 
liability for the payment rests on the executor or administrator, but if the 
fees paid are beneficial to the estate and reasonable, he is entitled to 
reimbursement from the estate. Such payments should be included in his accounts 
and the reimbursement therefor settled upon the notice prescribed in section 682 
of the Code of Civil Procedure. (<em>See</em> Church on Probate Law and 
Practice, pp. 1570-1588 and authorities there cited; Woeraer on the American Law 
of Administration, 2d ed., sections 515 and 516.)</p>
<p align="justify">For the reasons stated the respondent judge is hereby 
prohibited from enforcing the payment of the attorney's fees above-mentioned 
until the appeal taken by Jacinto Yangco, as guardian <em>ad litem</em> for the 
minor Pedro Uy Tioco, has been passed upon by this court or dismissed. No costs 
will be allowed. So ordered.</p> <em>Avance√±a, C. J., Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez,</em> 
and <em>Villa-Real, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
