				<BR><STRONG>JOHNSON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The only question presented by this appeal is: When the purchaser from the 
Government of lots or parcels of land formerly belonging to the Friar Land State 
dies before complete payment is made, leaving a widow surviving him, do such 
lots or parcels belong to the estate of the deceased to be administered by his 
administrator, or may the wife have the inchoate title in such lots or parcels 
transferred to her and thus be eliminated or excluded from the estate of her 
deceased husband?
<p>The facts in the present case may be stated as follows: (<i>a</i>) that some 
time prior to November 1, 1918, the said Silvestre Estacion purchased from the 
Government the following lots or parcels of land Nos. 1018, 723, 1007, 687, 270, 
742, and 386; (<i>b</i>) that said lots had theretofore been purchased by the 
Government as a part of the <i>Hacienda de los Frailes en el Municipio de Santa 
Cruz de Malabon</i>; (<i>c</i>) that Silvestre Estacion and his predecessors had 
been in possession, as tenants, of said parcels of land since before the 
American occupation of the Philippine Islands; (<i>d</i>) that he was the 
occupant, as tenant, of said parcels of land at the time the said 
<i>hacienda</i> was purchased; (<i>e</i>) that after he had purchased said lots 
he continued to make the partial payments under his contract, up to the time of 
his death; (<i>f</i>) that he left a widow surviving him, who is the present 
plaintiff; (<i>g</i>) that after the death of Silvestre Estacion, and on the 
12th day of September, 1919, the said Valentina Jocson, as the surviving widow 
of Silvestre Estacion, taking advantage of the provisions of section 16 of Act 
No. 1120, had said1 lots transferred to her (see Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, and 
G); (<i>h</i>) that notwithstanding the fact that the widow, Valentina Jocson, 
of Silvestre Estacion had had said lots transferred to her in accordance with 
said section 16 after the death of her husband, the administrator of the estate 
of Silvestre Estacion took possession of the same, included them in the 
inventory of the estate and continued to administer the same as a part of the 
estate of the deceased.</p>
<p>Valentina Jocson, under the foregoing facts, prayed that said seven lots be 
excluded from the inventory of the administrator of the estate of Silvestre 
Estacion, and that the same be returned to her immediately. The lower court 
denied her petition and decided that said lots were a part of the estate of 
Silvestre Estacion and that, as such, Antero Soriano, as administrator, had a 
right to include them in his inventory and to administer them. From that 
judgment the plaintiff appealed.</p>
<p>The appellant now contends that the inchoate title to said lots belongs to 
her and that she has the sole and exclusive right to occupy and administer them. 
Her contention is based upon the provisions of Act No. 1120, with special 
reference to section 16 of the same. Act No. 1120 provides, among other things, 
that the actual occupant of any portion of the Friar Lands at the time of the 
purchase by the Government should be given a preference in the right to purchase 
the land or lot occupied. Silvestre Estacion was the actual occupant, as tenant, 
of the said seven parcels of land at the time of the purchase by the Government 
and at the time of his purchase from the Government, and he continued to be in 
possession of the same until his death. Said Act further provides that the 
purchaser had a right to make partial payments until the full purchase price was 
paid. The Act further provides that the title to each and every parcel of land 
sold should remain in the Government <i>until the full payment of all 
installments of purchase money and interest by the purchaser has been made</i>, 
and that any incumbrance created by the purchaser against said parcels or lots 
shall be invalid as against the Government. Section 16 provides that "in the 
event of the <i>death</i> of a holder of a certificate (of purchase of any 
portion of said land), the issuance of which is provided for in section 12 
hereof, <i>prior to the execution of a deed by the Government to any purchaser, 
his widow shall be entitled to receive a deed of the land</i> stated in the 
certificate upon showing that she has complied with the requirements of law for 
the purchase of the same. * * *"</p>
<p>At the time of the death of Silvestre Estacion, he had nothing but an 
inchoate right in the parcels of land. The title was still in the Government. 
The Government being the owner, until full payment was made, had a perfect right 
to prescribe how such property should be disposed of in case of the death of the 
husband. The character of the right of Silvestre Estacion was very analogous to 
that of a homesteader. Act No. 926, which provides for the granting of 
homesteads, in its section 3 contains a very similar provision to that of 
section 16 of Act No. 1120, for the disposition of the homestead in case the 
applicant dies before title in him is perfected, leaving surviving him a wife. 
Said section 3 provides that "in the event of the death of an applicant (for a 
homestead) prior to the issuance of a patent (title), <i>his widow</i> shall be 
entitled to have a patent for the land applied for issue to her" upon a proper 
showing, and until a final title or patent is issued for the land to the 
applicant the Government remains the owner.</p>
<p>Acts Nos. 1120 and 926 were patterned after the laws granting homestead 
rights and special privileges under the laws of the United States and the 
various states of the Union. The statutes of the United States as well as of the 
various states of the Union contain provisions for the granting and protection 
of homesteads. Their object is to provide a home for each citizen of the 
Government, where his family may shelter and live beyond the reach of financial 
misfortune, and to inculcate in individuals those feelings of independence which 
are essential to the maintenance of free institutions. Furthermore, the state 
itself is concerned that the citizens shall not be divested of a means of 
support, and reduced to pauperism. (Cook and Burgwall <i>vs</i>. McChristian, 4 
Cal., 24; Franklin <i>vs</i>. Coffee, 70 Am. Dec., 292; Richardson <i>vs</i>. 
Woodward, 104 Fed. Rep., 873; 21 Cyc., 459.)</p>
<p>The conservation of a family home is the purpose of homestead laws. The 
policy of the state is to foster families as the factors of society, and thus 
promote general welfare. The sentiment of patriotism and independence. the 
spirit of free citizenship, the feeling of interest in public affairs, are 
cultivated and fostered more readily when the citizen lives permanently in his 
own home, with a sense of its protection and durability. (Waples on Homestead 
and Exemptions, p. 3.)</p>
<p>Under the statutory and constitutional provisions of the various states of 
the Union it has been held that "homestead privilege does not terminate on the 
husband's death but is transmitted to his widow and children." (21 Cyc., 
562.)</p>
<p>In the case of the Estate of Fath (132 Cal., 609) the Supreme Court of 
California held that "a homestead selected by the husband in his lifetime * * * 
vests absolutely in his surviving wife * * *. The descent of the homestead to 
the surviving widow was governed by the law in force at the death of her 
husband." (Dickey <i>vs</i>. Gibson, 54 Am. St. Rep., 321.)</p>
<p>Neither does a widow lose her right in the homestead estate of her first 
husband by a second marriage. (Sanders <i>vs</i>. Russell, 21 Am. St. Rep., 29; 
Miles <i>vs</i>. Miles, 88 Am. Dec., 208.)</p>
<p>Upon the death of the husband, the wife may continue to occupy the whole of 
the homestead. (Nicholas <i>vs</i>. Purczell, 89 Am. Dec., 572.)</p>
<p>The doctrine announced with reference to the right of the widow in the 
homestead upon the death of her husband, does no injustice to the creditors of 
the deceased, since they have it always in their power to protect themselves 
either by refusing credit or by demanding such security as will protect them 
from loss. (Keyes <i>vs</i>. Cyrus, 38 Am. St. Rep., 296.)</p>
<p>Said section 16 (Act No. 1120) provides that in the event of the death of a 
holder of a certificate prior to the execution of a deed by the Government, his 
widow <i>shall</i> be entitled to receive a deed of the land upon a showing that 
she has complied with the requirements of the law for the purchase of the same. 
In the present case the widow took the steps necessary under the law to protect 
her right, and had the necessary certificates of transfer made to her (Exhibits 
A to H). From that date the inchoate right which her husband possessed passed to 
her, and to her alone, and she had a right to continue making the partial 
payments required, and when completed, to secure an absolute conveyance from the 
Government. The law conceded to her the right held by her husband, without 
diminution of control, subject only to her completing the contract with the 
Government. That being true, we are fully persuaded that the administrator of 
the estate of Silvestre Estacion had no interest nor any control whatever in the 
administration of said lots or parcels of land. Under the law they did not 
belong to the estate of Silvestre Estacion. Whatever interest he had, passed 
immediately upon his death to his widow. The said lots constituted no part of 
the estate of Silvestre Estacion.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is hereby ordered and decreed that the judgment of the lower 
court be revoked; that the defendant, as administrator of the estate of 
Silvestre Estacion, exclude the said seven parcels of land immediately from the 
inventory of said estate, return the possession thereof to the plaintiff, and 
that he render to the Court of First Instance of the Province of Cavite, within 
a period of thirty days, a full and correct account of his administration of 
said parcels of land, and that he pay over to Valentina Jocson whatever sum or 
sums may be due her. And, without any finding as to costs, it is so 
ordered.</p><i>Malcolm, Avanceña, Villamor, Johns,</i> and <i>Romualdez,
