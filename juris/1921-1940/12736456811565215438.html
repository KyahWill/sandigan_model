information alleging "that on or about the 31st day of August, 1923, in the 
municipality of San Pablo, Province of Laguna, Philippine Islands, the herein 
accused did wilfully, unlawfully, and criminally and with intent to kill, attack 
and assault the Chinaman Si Song, inflicting several wounds on his body and 
head, the wound on the nape of the neck being necessarily fatal, which caused 
the immediate death of the said Si Song; and once the latter was dead, the 
accused seized and took the sum of f*25 belonging to the said offended party and 
converted the same to his own use and personal benefit.</p>
<p>"Contrary to law and with the concurrence of the aggravating circumstances of 
evident premeditation, treachery, cruelty and of the crime having been committed 
in an uninhabited place."</p>
<p>The trial court found the defendant guilty of the double crime of murder and 
robbery, the murder having been perpetrated as the means of committing the 
robbery and sentenced him to suffer the death penalty.</p>
<p>That the defendant committed the crime substantially as alleged in the 
information is not disputed by the defense and admits of no doubt, but we agree 
with the Attorney-General that the court below erred in finding the defendant 
guilty of the double crime of murder and robbery instead of the complex crime of 
robbery with homicide. The judge of that court took the view that where the 
death of the victim precedes the robbery the crime cannot be considered the 
complex crime of robbery with homicide defined in paragraph 1 of article 503 of 
the Penal Code and cites a sentence of the supreme court of Spain of February 5, 
1886, to that effect. It is, however, well settled in this jurisdiction that 
when, as in this case, there is "a direct relation, an intimate connection 
between the robbery and the killing—whether the latter be prior or subsequent to 
the former or whether both crimes be committed at the same time—it is 
unquestionable that they constitute the complex special crime defined and 
penalized in article 503, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code." (Sentence of supreme 
court of Spain of May 26, 1877; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Landasan, 35 Phil., 359; U. 
S. <em>vs.</em> Antonio, 31 Phil., 205.)</p>
<p>The court below found that the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the 
mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction, but this is offset by the 
aggravating circumstance that the defendant is a recidivist inasmuch as he has 
served a sentence in Bilibid Prison for robo en cuadrilla. The aggravating 
circumstances alleged in the information have not been sufficiently proven. The 
penalty for robbery with homicide must therefore be imposed in its medium degree 
and the defendant is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of cadena perpetua, 
with the accessory penalties provided for in article 54 of the Penal Code, to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P1,025, and to pay the costs. 
So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
