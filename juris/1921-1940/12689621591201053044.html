				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action was instituted in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija by Dolores,&nbsp; Ines,&nbsp; Candida,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Tomas Prades against felario Tecson, for the purpose of obtaining a judicial declaration to&nbsp; the effect that the&nbsp; plaintiffs are the owners&nbsp; in&nbsp; common&nbsp; with the&nbsp; defendant of&nbsp; an undivided four-tenths&nbsp; interest in three parcels of land&nbsp; in the barrio of Pamacmacan, municipality of&nbsp; Jaen,&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, and more particularly described in the complaint, and to obtain&nbsp; a judicial&nbsp; partition of&nbsp; the same.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant answered, denying the right of the plaintiffs to the three parcels, and asserted that he had purchased the land from Felix Prades, the&nbsp; father&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiffs, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the latter had sold the same as ganancial property pertaining to himself and a former&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs having&nbsp; amended their original complaint,&nbsp; the defendant, in addition to relying upon his previous answer, interposed a cross-complaint with a view to recovering&nbsp; from the plaintiffs the value of the&nbsp; produce of one of&nbsp; the three parcels during&nbsp; the&nbsp; two years preceding the date&nbsp; of the crosscomplaint,&nbsp; alleging that the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; were&nbsp; unlawfully detaining the same from&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Upon hearing&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause the trial court found that&nbsp; the property had been acquired by the plaintiffs' father, Felix Prades, during the life of his first wife, Rufina Velazquez, that the same therefore pertained to the conjugal estate of Felix Prades and Rufina Velazquez,&nbsp; and that Felix Prades, on June 14, 1920, had joined with his son Gaspar in selling it under contract of sale&nbsp; with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de&nbsp; retro</span> to the defendant, Hilario Tecson, (Exhibit 1).&nbsp;&nbsp; His Honor therefore concluded that the plaintiffs have no interest in the land and he accordingly gave judgment to the effect that the defendant be absolved from the complaint; and it further appearing that the plaintiffs Dolores, Candida, and Ines Prades have been&nbsp; withholding one of the parcels from the defendant since&nbsp; the beginning of the year&nbsp; 1923, his Honor sustained&nbsp; the crosscomplaint and ordered said&nbsp; plaintiffs to&nbsp; surrender this parcel to the defendant and to pay him 385 cavans of palay for each agricultural year beginning with&nbsp; the year mentioned and continuing until delivery of possession should be effected.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this judgment the plaintiffs appealed.<br><br>It clearly appears from the evidence that the land concerned in this litigation was acquired by&nbsp; Felix Prades,&nbsp; the father of the plaintiffs, during the life&nbsp; of his first wife, Rufina Velazquez,&nbsp; who died several years before the outbreak of the&nbsp; revolution against Spain.&nbsp; Within&nbsp; a&nbsp; short while after the&nbsp; death of&nbsp; Rufina, Felix Prades married a second wife&nbsp; and took up his&nbsp; abode with her&nbsp; in&nbsp; another place, leaving his five children,&nbsp; of&nbsp; whom Dolores Prades was the oldest, in possession at least of the first and second parcels&nbsp; described&nbsp; in the complaint&nbsp; and possibly&nbsp; also in possession of the third.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time that he changed his abode, Felix Prades did not interfere with the management of the&nbsp; property thus&nbsp; placed in the possession of his children; and as the children reached maturity and married, a suitable&nbsp; portion of this land was successively assigned to each.&nbsp; About twenty-five years passed in this way, until on&nbsp; June 14,&nbsp; 1920, Felix Prades and&nbsp; his&nbsp; son Gaspar,&nbsp; a brother of the plaintiffs, united in the document Exhibit 1, conveying all three parcels to the defendant, Hilario Tecson^ under contract of sale with pacto de retro, for a purported consideration of P4,500.&nbsp;&nbsp; The document referred to recites that said consideration&nbsp; had been paid to the vendors; but if the testimony of&nbsp; Dolores Prades is to be believed,&nbsp; this consideration really&nbsp; consisted of a debt which&nbsp; Gaspar Prades had previously contracted to&nbsp; Tecson.&nbsp; At any rate Felix Prades and his son&nbsp; Gaspar failed to redeem from this sale; and the property, so far&nbsp; as they&nbsp; had been able to convey it, consolidated in the defendant.&nbsp; However, in order to get&nbsp; possession Tecson was compelled to institute a&nbsp; revindicatory action&nbsp; against Felix Prades&nbsp; and&nbsp; Gaspar Prades, which action was&nbsp; finally terminated&nbsp; in favor of Tecson.&nbsp; An&nbsp; execution was then&nbsp; sued out by Tecson upon this judgment against Felix Prades and&nbsp; Gaspar&nbsp; Prades; and possession of the second and third&nbsp; parcels was&nbsp; effectually delivered to Tecson, but the plaintiffs, or some of, them, being&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession of the other&nbsp; parcel, refused to surrender&nbsp; possession, and&nbsp; this position&nbsp; they&nbsp; have maintained until the present.<br><br>It is contended for the plaintiffs that the half&nbsp; interest of their&nbsp; mother in&nbsp; these lands&nbsp; descended to them, with their&nbsp; brother Gasp^i', and that therefore each of the four plaintiffs is entitled&nbsp; to an undivided fifth of said&nbsp; half, or all&nbsp; together&nbsp; to&nbsp; four-tenths of the&nbsp; whole.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand, the plaintiffs concede that the defendant Tecson is the owner of the undivided share of their brother Gaspar in the property, as well as of the half&nbsp; which pertained to their father in his. right as member of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defunct conjugal partnership composed of himself and the plaintiffs' mother.<br><br>For the defendant it is maintained that&nbsp; the&nbsp; conjugal partnership has never been liquidated, that Felix Prades as the surviving husband had the power to convey the whole, and that therefore the defendant has acquired the entire property by&nbsp; virtue of&nbsp; the deed signed&nbsp; by Felix Prades and his son Gaspar.&nbsp; In this connection reliance is placed By the defendant upon Nable Jose <i>vs.</i> Nable Jose (41 Phil., 713), and Manuel arid Laxamana <i>vs.</i> Losano (41 Phil., 855), wherein&nbsp; it is held that the surviving husband&nbsp; has power to alienate the community property pertaining to the conjugal partnership.<br><br>In reply to this contention&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs point&nbsp; to&nbsp; the fact that Rufina Velazquez died more than&nbsp; thirty&nbsp; years ago, and that shortly after that&nbsp; event&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs, with their brother&nbsp; Gaspar,&nbsp; were placed&nbsp; in possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the property now in question by their father, since which time they have treated it as an undivided property belonging to them in common with their father; while during the same period the father himself has refrained from exercising any actual authority over the property adverse to the plaintiffs.&nbsp; As a result of this state of&nbsp; affairs, so it is contended, the ganancial partnership has ceased to exist and in lieu thereof has been substituted a sort of conventional partnership between the plaintiffs and&nbsp; their father, which has had&nbsp; the effect of terminating&nbsp; his power&nbsp; as surviving husband&nbsp; and administrator of the conjugal estate.<br><br>We are of the opinion that this contention&nbsp; of the plaintiffs is well founded.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the execution of the deed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; the defendant relies Felix Prades had been out of possession for twenty-five years, during which time his&nbsp; children had enjoyed the&nbsp; fruits of the land and had exercised over it all the <span style="font-style: italic;">indicia </span>of ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp; These facts&nbsp; could not have&nbsp; been unknown to the defendant, for the possession exercised by the plaintiffs, with their brother Gaspar, was&nbsp; open and notorious to&nbsp; all persons in the community who were in any wise acquainted with the property and its antecedent history.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of these facts it must&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; that Felix&nbsp; Prades had abdicated, or waived, his authority as surviving spouse, and that a mere conventional&nbsp; community of ownership had been established between him&nbsp; and his&nbsp; children in place of the interest that he had held as surviving husband.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Borja <i>vs.</i> Addison (44 Phil., 895-906), this court&nbsp; said: "There is no&nbsp; reason in law why the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased wife may not form a partnership with the surviving husband for the management&nbsp;&nbsp; and control&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; community&nbsp; property of&nbsp; the marriage&nbsp; and conceivably&nbsp; such a&nbsp; partnership, or&nbsp; rather community of property, between the heirs and surviving husband might be formed&nbsp; without a written&nbsp; agreement. *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * "&nbsp; We think that the facts before us justify the conclusion that precisely this sort of arrangement was made in this case;&nbsp; and the&nbsp; only question&nbsp; about which any doubt can reasonably exist is whether the acts of the parties were sufficiently notorious&nbsp; to affect a third person with notice of the changed status of the property.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in view of the long continued and&nbsp; exclusive possession of the children, we are of the opinion that this question must be answered in the affirmative.<br><br>In&nbsp; stating this conclusion the court does&nbsp; not mean to impair in its substance the doctrine&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in the cases of Nable Jose <i>vs.</i> Nable Jose, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, and Manuel and Laxamana <i>vs.</i> Losano, supra.&nbsp; We merely mean to hold&nbsp; that a husband administrator can&nbsp; waive the rights&nbsp; conceded to him in these&nbsp; cases and that long continued possession, on the part of&nbsp; the children, of property pertaining&nbsp; to the ganancial&nbsp; estate may&nbsp; establish&nbsp; an&nbsp; ownership in common between them and&nbsp; their father in&nbsp; the&nbsp; place&nbsp; of the&nbsp; community interest previously vested exclusively in him.<br><br>It results that&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; acquired by virtue of the deed Exhibit 1 only the shares of Felix Prades and Gaspar Prades in&nbsp; the property in&nbsp; question, notwithstanding the fact that said deed&nbsp; purports to convey the entire estate.<br><br>We&nbsp; note that Candida Prades affixed her signature to the deed Exhibit 1 and&nbsp; Dolores Prades also placed her finger&nbsp; mark thereon.&nbsp; If it&nbsp; were clearly proved that these two plaintiffs were fully aware of the exact tenor of this document and had known that their father&nbsp; and brother intended by&nbsp; said instrument to convey away&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole property, including the interest&nbsp; of the two witnesses, they would&nbsp; undoubtedly be estopped&nbsp; to assert the claim&nbsp; which they now make in&nbsp; this action,&nbsp; but&nbsp; Dolores says that she was given&nbsp; to understand, at the time this&nbsp; instrument was executed, that it&nbsp; was intended merely as a recognition of indebtedness owing by Gaspar and that she arid her sister were unaware of the&nbsp; true nature of the&nbsp; instrument.&nbsp; In view of their ignorance such&nbsp; a misunderstanding&nbsp; might easily&nbsp; have arisen,&nbsp; and we are unwilling to hold upon the facts before us that they are estopped.<br><br>From what has been said it follows that the four plaintiffs must&nbsp; be declared to be the owners in common, with the defendant Tecson,&nbsp; of an undivided four-fifths of the half, or four-tenths of the whole, of parcels 1 and 2, and to this extent the&nbsp; cause will be reversed and remanded to the court&nbsp; of origin&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that partition of the same may be effected.&nbsp; The&nbsp; judgment entered against the plaintiffs upon&nbsp; the cross-complaint of the defendant will also be&nbsp; reversed; but in connection&nbsp; with the partition of lots 1 and 2, the plaintiffs will be required to account&nbsp; to the defendant&nbsp; for his proper portion of the produce of lot No. 1, for the&nbsp; agricultural year 1923-1924, and subsequently; and the defendant&nbsp; will be required on his part to account to the plaintiffs&nbsp; for their proper&nbsp; share of the produce of lot 2 during the same period.&nbsp; The judgment in favor of the defendant, so far as regards parcel 3, is&nbsp; affirmed, inasmuch as it does not clearly appear that this parcel had been&nbsp; under the exclusive control of the plaintiffs, as was the case with the other two.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered,&nbsp; without costs.?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.
