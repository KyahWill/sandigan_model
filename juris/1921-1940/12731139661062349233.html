Natividad were accused in the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila of a 
crime against the fundamental laws of the State, it being alleged in the 
information as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 30th day of May, 1931, and for some time prior thereto, 
the above named accused, conspiring and confederating together and helping one 
another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously affiliate to, 
compose and become members of, the so-called Communist Party of the Philippines 
(Partido Komunista sa Pilipinas), an illegal association, whose principal 
purposes and objects are to bring about, by the use of force, the downfall of 
the present form of government and establish in place thereof another patterned 
after the Soviet Government of Russia and run by those affiliated to and in 
sympathy with said association; to incite a revolt of the laboring class, 
advocating and urging struggle between said laboring class and the so-called 
capitalists, and other similar objects tending to combat the fundamental basis 
of the present social order and alter the regularity of its functions and to the 
commission of violations of the existing laws, which above-mentioned association 
was formed and organized without the local authorities having been informed of 
its aforesaid objects and purposes as well as of the by-laws thereof; and that 
at the time and place hereinabove mentioned, in the furtherance of their 
conspiracy and in utter disregard of the notice or warning given by the 
authorities that they could not hold any meeting anywhere, the said accused 
assembled, gathered and congregated under the name and auspices of the Katipunan 
ng mga Anak pawis sa Pilipinas (Association of the Sons of the Sweat of the 
Philippine Islands), another association having the same illegal aims and 
purposes as the said Communist Party of the Philippines, at El Retono Building, 
in said City of Manila."</p></blockquote>
<p>After trial the court below convicted the said accused, with the exception of 
Norberto Nabong, Sixto Estrada, Augusto David, Doroteo Cahumban, Jose Ilagan, 
Liboro Natividad, and Mateo del Castillo, who were acquitted. </p>
<p>Thereafter the convicted accused appealed to this court. </p>
<p>The accused were charged with the crime of illegal association in the Court 
of First Instance of the City of Manila in that on or about the 30th day of May, 
1931, and for some time prior thereto, the said accused affiliated to, and 
became members of, the so-called Communist Party of the Philippines whose 
principal purposes and object were to bring about by force the downfall of the 
present form of government and establish in its place another patterned after 
the Soviet Government of Russia, and to incite a revolt of the laboring class. 
</p>
<p>After trial the court below convicted the said accused, with the exception of 
Norberto Nabong, Sixto Estrada, Augusto David, Doroteo Cahumban, Jose Ilagan, 
Liboro Natividad, and Mateo del Castillo, who were acquitted. </p>
<p>It appears that the appellants, Evangelista, Manahan, Capadocia, Torrente, 
Arcega, Monroy, Rafael, Senson, Tolentino, Reyes, San Juan, Santos, Lagman, 
Santiago, Mesina, Cruz, Gutierrez, and Ambrosio, presented themselves as 
candidates of the Communist Party for different offices- insular, provincial and 
municipal-in the last elections; that the accused Mariano P. Balgos, Cenon 
Lacanienta and some of those who campaigned for their candidacies as members of 
the Communist Party, delivered speeches at several meetings of the Communist 
Party, advocating the ideas and principles of the said Communist Party and 
urging the laborers to join it.</p>
<p>It also appears that the appellant Enrique Torrente appears in the newspaper 
known as Titis, an organ of the Communist Party, as the editor thereof. </p>
<p>The appellants have not denied being members of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines; on the contrary, Crisanto Evangelista admitted expressly at the 
trial that he was affiliated to the said party. As'witness for the defense, he 
testified that the objects and purposes of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines are set out in its constitution and by-laws which purposes and 
objects, according to said constitution and by-laws, are to overthrow the 
present form of government by any means necessary, especially armed revolution. 
</p>
<p>The appellant, Catalino Monroy, admitted having gone to Russia as delegate of 
the Kapisanan nang mga Anah pawis to the Red International Labor Union 
Congress.</p>
<p>From, the foregoing it is clear that the twenty appellants herein are or were 
members of the Communist Party of the Philippines, for all of them, with the 
exception of Balgos' and Lacanienta, presented themselves as candidates in the 
last general elections as communists, arid said Balgos and Lacanienta, as well 
as many of those mentioned, delivered speeches at several meetings held under 
the auspices of the said Communist Party, advocating communism and urging the 
laborers to affiliate to the said party. If any one of these appellants were not 
a member of the Communist. Party, it would have been very easy for him to deny 
it, but no one has so done. </p>
<p>The principal defense set up by the appellants is that the Communist Party of 
the Philippines is not an illegal association in that it preaches only a social 
but not an armed revolution, but a mere reading of the constitution of the 
Communist Party will show that such a pretense is obviously useless. Neither is 
there any merit in ihe appellants' argument that communism is not prohibited in 
any part of the civilized world. And as to the validity of the law prohibiting 
communism, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the law of California 
prohibiting the display of the communist red flag as a sign inciting sedition 
and disorderly opposition to the government. Under the law of the Philippine 
Islands, the association formed by the appellants is clearly illegal. Article 
188 of the Penal Code, as substituted by article 24 of the Royal Decree of 
September 12, 1897 (Alcubilla, Diccionario de Administration, Apendice de 1897, 
p. 454), says that illegal associations are those the object of which is against 
public morals, to commit some crime, or to attack the fundamental basis of the 
social order or alter the regularity of its functions. Now, according to 
appellant Crisanto Evangelista and the constitution and by-laws of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines, the purpose of the party is to incite class struggle 
and to overthrow the present government by peaceful means or by armed 
revolution; therefore the purpose of the party is to alter the social order and 
to commit the crimes of rebellion and sedition. An association having such an 
object must necessarily be illegal (decision of Oct. 8, 1884, of the Supreme 
Court of Spain, 7 Hidalgo, Cod. Pen., 531-532.) The report submitted by 
Secretary-Hughes to the Senate of the United States, as well as that made by 
Hamilton Fish, after an investigation of communism, leads to the same 
conclusion, namely, that force and violence are inseparable from communist 
programs. </p>
<p>The last point made by the appellants is relative to the penalty imposed. The 
trial court imposed the penalty of confinamiento for the period of eight years 
and one day, as provided by paragraph 5, article 190 of the old Penal Code, as 
substituted by article 26 of the Royal Decree of September 12, 1897, in 
connection with articles 28 and 114 of the same Code. The appellants contend 
that this is erroneous because the Revised Penal Code has eliminated this kind 
of penalty. But there is no merit in this argument, because the act took place 
under the sanction of the old Code, and the penalty of confinamiento, therein 
provided for, is lighter than that provided by the new Code in its article 147, 
which is prision correctional and arresto mayor and fine. </p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the costs against the twenty 
defendants. So ordered. </p>

Vickers,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i> concur. </p></div>
