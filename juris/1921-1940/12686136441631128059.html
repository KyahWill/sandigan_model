				<H3>PEDRO V. MANZA ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. EDUARDO GUTIERREZ DAVID, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TAYABAS, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GODDARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for a writ of prohibition in which it is prayed:
<blockquote>
  <p> "Por tanto, al Honorable Tribunal respetuosamente
pide que, previos los tramites correspondientes, declare que el Juez
recurrido no adquirio ni tiene jurisdiction para conocer de dicha
protesta excepto para sobreseerla; y expida un mandamiento de
inhibition para que se abstenga de continuar conociendo de la mismaâ€”con
las costas a los recurridos."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Within the time fixed by law a motion of protest was filed in the
Court of First Instance of Tayabas in which the election to the offices
of municipal president and municipal councilors of the municipality of
Lopez, Province of Tayabas, was contested. This protest was signed and
sworn to by Emilio A. Siazon, a candidate for the office of municipal
president, and clearly shows upon its face that its object was to
contest the election of June 5, 1934, for all of the above-mentioned
offices. The first paragraph of that motion reads in part as follows:
"Comparecen los recurrentes, y como motivo de action, Emilio Siazon
contra los recurridos Tomas V. Florido y Perfecto Reyes, y los demas
recurrentes contra los recurridos * * *, respetuosamente alegan:" The
first allegation in the motion commences as follows: "Que los
recurrentes son mayores de edad, etc." and further alleges that "Emilio
Siazon siendo candidato registrado y votado para el cargo de Presidente
Municipal de Lopez, Tayabas, y siendo los demas recurrentes candidates
registrados y votados para el cargo de Concejal, del mencionado
municipio * * *."</p>
<p> In view of the fact that this motion of protest was signed by
Emilio A. Siazon and not signed by any of the other contestants, a
motion was presented asking that the protest be dismissed as to the
offices of municipal councilors. After that motion was filed the
persons included therein as contestants for the offices of municipal
councilors filed an affidavit which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Antonio D. Villapando, Jose R. Barros, Rufo
Javier, Emilio A. Mascardo, Efigenio Panganiban, Leon Salumbides y
Potenciano Desembrana, previo juramento, en forma legal, declaran: Que
la motion de protesta presentada en esta causa con fecha 20 de junio de
1934, y suscrita por Emilio A. S'iazon en su propia representation, y
en nombre y representacion de los aqui declarantes, fue de hecho
presentada, suscrita y jurada bajo nuestra expresa autorizacion; que
los declarantes tambien ratifican y aprueban y hacen suyo todo lo que
el mencionado Sr. Siazon ha hecho hasta ahora en.relation a dicha
morion de protesta"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> This affidavit was sworn to on July 9, 1934. In view this affidavit
Judge Gutierrez David denied the motion to dismiss the protest.
Whereupon this petition for a writ of prohibition was filed. This
petition alleges in substance that the respondent judge lacks
jurisdiction to hear and decide this protest for the following reasons:
That in the motion under consideration two protests are joined, one for
the office of municipal president and the other for the offices of
municipal councilors, and that said motion is not signed by any of the
candidates for the office of municipal councilor or by any person
competent to appear for them.</p>
<p> In the case of Lichauco <em>vs.</em> Alejandrino and Weinmann (21
Phil., 58), Faustino Lichauco, who was not an attorney, brought that
action for himself and in representation of his coheirs. That case
seems to have been tried by the lower court upon the theory that all of
the interested parties were present. This court set aside the judgment
of the lower court with this proviso: "* * * unless the coheirs of
Faustino Lichauco, within a period of ten days from notification of
this decision, shall appear personally or by attorney in the Court of
First Instance of the Province of Pampanga, either as plaintiffs or
defendants, and in writing indicate their full conformance with the
proceedings had in the present cause. In which case, the Court of First
Instance of the Province of Pampanga is hereby directed to enter a
judgment confirming the judgment heretofore rendered by said court on
the 10th day of February, 1910." In the motion of protest now under
consideration the parties in interest, who did not sign the motion,
appeared personally in writing by means of the affidavit quoted above
and not only ratified and approved that motion but also stated that it
was presented and sworn to by Emilio A. Siazon on their behalf and
under their express authorization. This cured, from the date of filing,
any defect that the motion of protest may have had by reason of the
fact that Siazon was the only one of the contestants who signed the
same.</p>
<p> Section 479 of the Administrative Code, as amended by Act No. 3834,
prohibits the filing of a joint election protest for the offices of
municipal president and municipal councilor. Although this point was
raised by the herein petitioners for the first time before this court,
in view of the express prohibition in the above-mentioned section, as
amended, the hearing of the motion of protest under consideration may
be continued before the Court of First Instance of Tayabas as to the
contestant Emilio A. Siazon for the office of municipal president, and,
in conformity with the decision of this court in G. R. No. 42071,<sup><span style="color: red;">[1]</span></sup>
the other contestants should be allowed to file a separate protest, as
of the date of the filing of the joint protest, within ten days after
receiving notice of this decision.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "It has been frequently decided, and it may be
stated as a general rule recognized by all the courts, that statutes
providing for election contests are to be liberally construed, to the
end that the will of the people in the choice of public officers may
not be defeated by <em>merely technical objections."</em> (Galang <em>vs.</em> Miranda and De Leon, 35 Phil., 269, 271.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Writ of prohibition denied, without costs.</p>
