				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JULIO DE LA PEÑA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Julio de la Peña and Agapito Rafael engaged in a fight armed with weapons, as 
a result of which the latter was killed. The former was accused and convicted of 
homicide and sentenced to fourteen years, eight months, and one day <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion 
temporal,</span> to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P1,000, and to 
pay the costs.</p>
<p>From this judgment, the present appeal was taken, in support of which the 
following alleged errors are assigned: (1) In granting the prosecution a 
continuance over the defendant's objection; (2) in giving credit to the 
testimony of Crisanto Francisco, the only eyewitness, in spite of the fact that 
the trial court found that he was not telling the truth; (3) in not holding that 
the defendant acted in self-defense; (4) in admitting the declaration in Exhibit 
B together with the testimony of Antonio Rafael and Carlos Candido as <span style="font-style: italic;">res 
gestae</span>; and (5) in not acquitting the defendant.</p>
<p>As to the granting of the continuance in the first instance prayed for by the 
prosecuting attorney, the record contains nothing which might point to an abuse 
of discretion on the part of the trial court. The following is the fiscal's 
petition for a continuance, which was granted by the court:</p>
<p>"We telephoned the municipal president of Polo, Bulacan, to bring with him 
the barrio lieutenant, Carlos Candido, in order to testify in this case at about 
3 o'clock this afternoon; and said president answered that they would come; but 
for some reason or other they did not arrive until 4.30 this afternoon. 
Therefore, we pray the court to postpone the hearing until tomorrow, the 4th 
inst.'" (Pages 24-25, s. n.)</p>
<p>Applications for continuances are left to the discretion of the court, and 
unless an abuse is shown, this court will not reverse the action of the trial 
court thereon.</p>
<p>An examination of Crisanto Francisco's testimony of record does not in the 
least detract from its credibility. But the trial court, in its decision states 
that full credence cannot be given to said witness. The learned judge must have 
arrived at this conclusion from a consideration of the witness's attitude and 
manner of testifying, which advantage this court lacks. The trial judge, 
however, did not entirely reject said testimony, but merely believed it was 
somewhat exaggerated.</p>
<p>This court deems said testimony worthy of belief where it states that the 
defendant pursued the deceased and that when the latter fell on his face, the 
defendant slashed him. This portion of the testimony is corroborated by other 
details of the case, and especially as to the location of the two principal 
wounds upon the victim's body, one of them in the back of the neck, and the 
other in the left scapular region (Exhibit A). This circumstance does not of 
necessity make the crime murder, since the pursuit and attack by the defendant 
did not constitute treachery, but were a mere incident of the fight which was 
going on.</p>
<p>There is not sufficient merit in the second assignment of error.</p>
<p>Counsel for the appellant contends that the accused acted in self-defense. 
The evidence shows that the defendant stated the truth in declaring that the 
deceased started the fight. Considering the circumstances of the case, it was 
the deceased rather than the accused, who had a motive for doing so, inasmuch as 
the latter, against whom the defendant had filed a complaint before the proper 
authorities, believed his rights were being infringed upon when he saw the 
appellant cutting grass and herbs on the land claimed by both, and which the 
deceased claimed belonged to himself.</p>
<p>There was not, in this court's opinion, sufficient provocation on the 
defendant's part, and thus there were present two of the elements of 
self-defense, to wit: An unlawful attack, and lack of provocation on the part of 
the accused.</p>
<p>But there was no reasonable necessity to take the deceased's life. It has 
been sufficiently proved that when the latter received the two mortal wounds, 
the bolo with which he had attacked the defendant had already fallen to the 
ground:</p>
<p>We have reached these conclusions by an examination of the record, even 
without considering Exhibit B and the testimony given by Antonio Rafael and 
Carlos Candido relative to said document. For this reason, even if the fourth 
assignment of error were proved it would not affect the result of this case.</p>
<p>This, then, is a case of incomplete self-defense, provided for in article 86 
of the Penal Code, under which the penalty must be lowered two degrees, and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span> in its maximum degree shall be imposed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is modified, and the appellant hereby 
sentenced to six years <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>, with the costs and the accessory 
penalties provided in article 61 of the Penal Code; in all other respects, said 
judgment is affirmed. So ordered.</p>
