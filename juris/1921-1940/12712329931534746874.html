				<H3>MARTIN CARREON, AS ADMINISTRATOR OF THE ESTATE OF ACOP BANGUILAN, AND CHANAL (ALIAS DANAL), PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. SIOCO CARIÑO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of the 
subprovince of Benguet, dismissing an action brought by the plaintiffs to 
recover the sum of P4,800 and other personal property pertaining to the estate 
of the deceased <span style="font-style: italic;">Igorrote</span>, Acop Banguilan.&nbsp;
<p>It is alleged in the complaint that the plaintiff Martin Carreon is the 
administrator of the estate of Acop Banguilan; that the plaintiff Chanal (<span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> 
Danal) is the surviving spouse of the deceased; that on or about October or 
November, 1921, about one year after the death of Acop Banguilan and before 
letters of administration were issued, the defendant, Sioco Cariño, took away 
from Ghanal the sum of P4,800, and some title documents, all belonging to the 
conjugal property of Acop and Chanal, on the condition that he, the defendant, 
would return it to Chanal after a "cañao" or feast over said money had been 
celebrated; that the defendant obtained possession of the property under the 
pretext that he, being an influential man in the community, could keep the 
property safely from the danger of robbers; that in spite of repeated demands, 
the defendant continues to retain the property illegally; and that as a result 
of the illegal detention of the aforesaid sum of P4,800, the plaintiffs have 
suffered damages in the amount P4,800. </p>
<p>The defendant, in his answer, denies generally and specifically each and 
every allegation of the complaint, and as a special .defense alleges (1) that 
any action which the plaintiff might have had against the defendant has already 
prescribed under the laws of the Philippine Islands, and (2) that this action 
has been illegally and improperly brought, inasmuch as it contravenes a final 
order made by the Court of First Instance of Benguet in civil case No. 247, 
entitled "E. Speth et al., plaintiffs, vs. Sioco Cariño, defendant." </p>
<p>Upon a careful examination of the record, we are of the opinion that the 
judgment of the court below must be reversed. It is obvious that the defendant's 
special defense of prescription has not been established. The money claimed by 
the plaintiff, whether conjugal property or not, pertains to the estate of Acop 
Banguilan until a distribution of the estate has been made, and assuming that 
the defendant took possession of said money, he can only be regarded as an 
administrator <span style="font-style: italic;">de son tort</span>, holding the property in trust for the heirs, and in 
favor of whom the statute of limitation consequently did not run, at least not 
until after an administrator was legally appointed. It may be noted that an 
administrator of the estate in question was not appointed until 1923. No 
evidence whatever has been introduced in support of the defendant's second 
special defense, and the determination of the case, therefore, reduces itself to 
a question of the credibility of the witnesses who testified to the delivery of 
the money to the defendant. </p>
<p>The record shows that Acop Banguilan had his home in Batdi, an isolated place 
situated at a distance of about 14 kilometers from the City of Baguio. He 
married twice, and the defendant's wife, Guilata Acop, is a daughter of the 
first marriage, her mother's name being Anguing Pirang. The plaintiff Chanal was 
Acop's second wife with whom he had several children, among them Sixto and 
Biring Acop. Acop Banguilan died on July 13, 1920, leaving a considerable 
estate, consisting of cattle, real estate, and money.</p>
<p>Chanal is an ignorant woman, and it is not disputed that she had no property 
at the time of her marriage to Acop. At the trial of the case she testified that 
in October or November, 1921, after the death of Acop, the defendant came to her 
house at Batdi, accompanied by his wife, Guilata, and her son-in-law, Manuel 
Caoili, and induced her to turn over to him the money left by Acop, representing 
to her that it was publicly known that Acop was rich and that Chanal, being a 
woman and alone, would be an easy prey to robbers and might even be killed; that 
she gave the defendant P4,000 in currency and P800 in coin, but told him that he 
must return it all within a month; that the defendant promised that he would do 
so when the danger of robbery ceased and that he then would celebrate a cañao 
(feast) over the death of Acop; that Manuel Caoili counted the coin and put it 
in a Hour sack, while the defendant and his wife counted the currency, after 
which the defendant wrapped it up and took it away to an automobile which was 
waiting for them; that when the defendant did not return the money as he had 
promised, she told her son Sixto to make demand therefor; that Sixto thereupon 
went to the defendant's house and asked for the money but did not get it, the 
defendant telling him that he would personally bring it back to Acop's house; 
that later on the defendant celebrated the <span style="font-style: italic;">cañao</span> at Acop's house, to which he 
invited many people and that he, at said <span style="font-style: italic;">cañao</span>, announced publicly that he would 
not give Chanal as much as one centavo because she was poor when she married 
Acop; that she, Chanal, stated to the defendant that the money was earned during 
her marriage with Acop, to which the defendant answered that that could not be 
true; and that he also said that, in any event, she could do nothing to him 
because he was a chief and influential with the government; that upon hearing 
this she cried and was contemplating suicide because her children would be 
deprived of their inheritance. </p>
<p>Chanal's daughter Biring corroborated her mother's testimony and stated that 
she was with her mother when Guilata Acop, Sioco Cariño, and Manuel Caoili came 
to their house and took away the 4,800 pesos. Several other witnesses also 
testified that they were present at the <span style="font-style: italic;">cañao</span> when the defendant stated that he 
would not return the money to Chanal. </p>
<p>Guilata Acop, the principal witness for the defendant, testified that her 
mother, Anguing Pirang, died sometime in 1898 or 1899; that when her mother died 
she left in the possession of Acop Banguilan the sum of P6,000, of which sum 
P1,000 was given to her mother by the tetter's father and that the rest of the 
money was the earnings of her mother and father. She further testified that 
before his death, her father had been sick a long time; that he stayed for about 
two weeks in her house, during which time and in the presence of Chanal and 
others, she asked her father what had become of the money left by her mother, to 
which he answered that it was under the care of Chanal; that Chanal admitted 
that she kept the money in Batdi; that she, the witness, went only once to the 
house of her father in Batdi after his death and that that was on the occasion 
when the <span style="font-style: italic;">cañao</span> was celebrated; that on the day after the <span style="font-style: italic;">cañao</span> she had a 
conversation with Chanal about the money left by Anguing Pirang; that one Laruan 
asked Chanal about the money kept by her and that she said that Acop had been 
lying and that there was no money; that after some quarreling with Chanal, the 
witness went to Bagnio in an automobile which had been parked about two 
kilometers from Acop's house; and that she did not see any one take any money 
from Chanal at any time after the death of Acop. </p>
<p>The defendant introduced a large number of other witnesses, but the testimony 
of most of them relate to charges against Chanal and her son Sixto for alleged 
embezzlement of money and selling of cattle pertaining to the estate, and it may 
be noted that the witnesses who testified to the essential points in the case 
are near relations of Guilata and the defendant and are personally interested in 
the controversy.</p>
<p>The principal witnesses for the plaintiff are apparently ignorant and merely 
semi-civilized; the translation of their testimony from their dialect into 
English undoubtedly presented difficulties; and some of their statements are 
somewhat confused and not entirely in accordance with the established facts. As 
a consequence thereof the court below may have formed an unfavorable opinion as 
to their veracity, but in the light of the circumstances of the case, we are 
convinced that they, in the main, told the truth in regard to the taking of the 
money and the occurrences at the <span style="font-style: italic;">cañao</span>. The statement of Chanal, especially, 
rings true and brings out details which she is not likely to have invented. </p>
<p>The record shows that the defendant is an intelligent and prosperous man of 
considerable influence in his community, and there are indications in the record 
that he is of a rather grasping disposition. He is not a stranger to the courts, 
and his testimony shows that he is not ignorant of their functions. His wife, 
Guilata, is one of the heirs of Acop Banguilan, and her testimony indicates that 
she considers Chanal as an interloper who originally was only a concubine of 
Acop and of an inferior class; that she, Chanal, had brought no property to the 
estate and had no rights in the inheritance. It also appears that it was known 
to the defendant that the deceased Acop Banguilan left a considerable sum of 
money in the possession of Chanal. In these circumstances, it seems highly 
improbable that the defendant for the period of three years would have refrained 
from resorting to the courts if he had not obtained possession of the money. We 
therefore accept the plaintiffs' version of what had taken place. </p>
<p>Relying on the provisions of section 711 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the 
plaintiffs demand a recovery of double the amount of the money taken by the 
defendant, but under the doctrine laid down in the case of Ingersoll vs. 
Chui-Tian Lay (11 Phil., 564), we seriously doubt that said section is 
applicable to the present case. <br></p><p>The appealed judgment is reversed and it is 
hereby ordered that the estate of the deceased Acop Banguilan have and recover 
from the defendant, Sioco Cariño, the sum of P4,800 with interest at the rate of 
6 per cent per annum from January 11, 1927, the date of the filing of the 
complaint. No costs will be allowed. So ordered. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, 
concur.</p>
<hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center">

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING </strong></p>
<p><strong>AVANCEÑA, C. J.: </strong></p>
<p>This is an action of specific performance of an unwritten contract, to compel 
the defendant to pay back the sum of P4,800, having bound himself to do so one 
month after receiving it. For this case the statute of limitations (sec. 43, 
Code of Civil Procedure) fixes the period of six years. And as this is a matter 
of deposit, prescription does not begin unless the bailee disown the deposit. 
The proper question before us, then, is: When did the defendant disown the 
deposit? He did so, according to the plaintiff's own evidence, when during the 
cañao on occasion of Acop Banguilan's death, the defendant announced to all 
those present at the feast, including: Chanal and her children, that he would 
not return the money. <br></p><p>According: to the evidence of the defendant, the cañao or 
feast on the occasion of Acop Banguilan's death took place four months after 
said death, and according to Fernando Acusalan, the plaintiff's witness in 
rebuttal, five months after. If the defendant made this announcement at the 
cañao or feast, he must have received the money before that feast, or a little 
after Acop's death, and not in October or November of 1921, fully a year and a 
half afterwards. Thus, the weight of the evidence shows that the defendant 
announced his refusal to return the money four months after Acop's death, or, at 
most, five months after, according to the plaintiff's own witness, Aeusalan, 
that is, in the month of November, 1920. From that time until this action was 
brought, in January 11, 1927, the period of six years fixed by the statute of 
limitations has elapsed. The only thing required, and that only impliedly, in 
order that prescription may begin, is that there be a person capable of bringing 
the prescribing action. In the case at bar, the administrator of the intestacy 
of Acop Banguilan was not the only person who could bring the action to recover 
of the defendant the amount in question. Chanal herself could, bring it, for, by 
her own statement, she was one of the interested parties. Furthermore, the 
defendant received the money from her on deposit, and she could therefore 
recover it from the time he disavowed the deposit, without being hindered by the 
circumstance that she was not the sole owner or the absolute owner, since the 
defendant, as a bailee, could not require her to prove that she owned the thing 
deposited (art. 1771, Civil Code). <br></p><p>In my opinion, the action now before us has 
already prescribed, and the judgment appealed from should be affirmed. Judgment 
reversed.</p></div>
