				<H3>TESTATE ESTATE OF JOSEPH G. BRIMO.  JUAN MICIANO, ADMINISTRATOR, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. ANDRE BRIMO, OPPONENT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The partition of&nbsp; the estate left by the deceased Joseph G. Brimo is in question in this&nbsp; case.<br><br>The judicial administrator of this estate filed a scheme of partition.&nbsp; Andre Brimo, one of the brothers of&nbsp; the deceased, opposed it.&nbsp; The court, however,&nbsp; approved it.<br><br>The errors&nbsp; which the&nbsp; oppositor-appellant&nbsp; assigns are: (1) The approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; scheme&nbsp; of partition; (2)&nbsp; the denial of his participation in the&nbsp; inheritance; (3)&nbsp; the denial of the motion for reconsideration of the order approving the partition;&nbsp; (4) the approval of the purchase made by Pietro Lanza&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased's&nbsp; business and the deed of transfer of said business; and (5) the declaration that&nbsp; the Turkish laws are impertinent to this cause,&nbsp; and the failure not to postpone the approval of the scheme of partition and the delivery of&nbsp; the deceased's business to&nbsp; Pietro Lanza until&nbsp; the receipt&nbsp; of the depositions requested in reference to the Turkish laws.<br><br>The appellant's opposition is&nbsp; based on the fact that&nbsp; the partition in&nbsp; question&nbsp; puts&nbsp; into effect the provisions of Joseph&nbsp; G. Brimo's&nbsp; will which are not in accordance with the laws of his Turkish nationality,&nbsp; for which reason they are void as being in violation of&nbsp; article 10 of the Civil Code which, among other things, provides the following:<br><blockquote>"Nevertheless,&nbsp; legal&nbsp; and&nbsp; testamentary&nbsp;&nbsp; successions, in respect to the order of succession as well as to the amount of the successional rights and the intrinsic validity of their provisions, shall&nbsp; be regulated by the national law&nbsp; of&nbsp; the person&nbsp; whose succession&nbsp; is in question, whatever may be the nature of&nbsp; the property or the country in which it may be situated."<br></blockquote>But the fact is that the oppositor did&nbsp; not prove that said testamentary dispositions are not in accordance with the Turkish laws, inasmuch as he did not present any evidence showing what the Turkish laws are on the matter, and in the absence of evidence on&nbsp; such laws,&nbsp; they&nbsp; are&nbsp; presumed to be the same as those of the Philippines.&nbsp; (Lim and Urn <i>vs.</i> Collector of Customs, 36 Phil., 472.)<br><br>It has not been proved in these proceedings&nbsp; what the Turkish laws are.&nbsp; He, himself, acknowledges it&nbsp; when he desires to&nbsp; be given an opportunity to&nbsp; present&nbsp; evidence on this point; so much so that he assigns as an error of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; in not having&nbsp; deferred the&nbsp; approval of the scheme of&nbsp; partition until the receipt of certain testimony requested&nbsp; regarding the Turkish laws on the matter. The&nbsp; refusal to&nbsp; give&nbsp; the&nbsp; oppositor another opportunity to prove such laws does not constitute an error.&nbsp; It is discretionary&nbsp; with the trial court, and, taking into consideration that the oppositor was granted ample opportunity to introduce&nbsp; competent evidence,&nbsp; we find no abuse of discretion on&nbsp; the part of the court in this particular.<br><br>There is, therefore,&nbsp; no evidence in the record that the national law of the testator Joseph G. Brimo was violated in the testamentary dispositions in question&nbsp; which, not being contrary to our laws in force, must be complied with and&nbsp; executed.<br><br>Therefore, the approval of the&nbsp; scheme of partition in this&nbsp; respect was not erroneous.<br><br>In regard to the first assignment of error which&nbsp; deals with the exclusion of the herein&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; as a legatee, inasmuch&nbsp; as he is one&nbsp; of the persons&nbsp; designated as such in the will, it must&nbsp; be&nbsp; taken into consideration that such exclusion is based on the last part of the second clause of the will, which says:<br><blockquote>"Second.&nbsp; I likewise desire to state&nbsp; that&nbsp; although,&nbsp; by law, I am&nbsp; a Turkish citizen, this citizenship having been conferred&nbsp; upon me by conquest and not by free choice, nor by nationality and, on the other hand,&nbsp; having resided for a&nbsp; considerable&nbsp; length&nbsp; of time&nbsp; in. the&nbsp; Philippine Islands where I succeeded in acquiring&nbsp; all of the property that I now possess, it is&nbsp; my&nbsp; wish that the distribution&nbsp; of my property and everything in connection with this, my will, be made and disposed of in accordance with the laws in force in the Philippine Islands, requesting all of my relatives to respect this wish, otherwise, I&nbsp; annul and cancel beforehand whatever disposition found in this will favorable to the person&nbsp; or persons who fail to comply with this request."<br></blockquote>The institution&nbsp; of legatees in this will is&nbsp; conditional, and the condition is that the instituted legatees must respect the testator's will to distribute&nbsp; his&nbsp; property, not&nbsp; in accordance with the laws of his nationality, but in accordance with the laws of the Philippines.<br><br>If this condition as it is&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; were legal and valid, any legatee&nbsp; who fails to&nbsp; comply with&nbsp; it, as the&nbsp; herein oppositor who,&nbsp; by&nbsp; his&nbsp; attitude&nbsp; in these proceedings&nbsp; has not respected the will of the testator, as expressed,&nbsp; is prevented from receiving&nbsp; his&nbsp; legacy.<br><br>The fact is,&nbsp; however, that the said condition is void, being contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; law,&nbsp; for article 792 of the Civil Code provides the following:<br><blockquote>"Impossible&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; and those&nbsp; contrary to&nbsp; law or good morals shall be considered as not imposed&nbsp; and shall not prejudice the heir or legatee in&nbsp; any manner whatsoever,&nbsp; even should the testator otherwise provide."<br></blockquote>And&nbsp; said&nbsp; condition&nbsp; is contrary&nbsp; to law because&nbsp; it expressly ignores the testator's national law when, according to&nbsp; article&nbsp; 10&nbsp; of the Civil&nbsp; Code above quoted,&nbsp; such national law of the testator is the one to govern&nbsp; his testamentary dispositions.<br><br>Said condition then,&nbsp; in the light of the legal provisions above cited, is considered unwritten, and the institution of legatees in said will is unconditional and consequently valid and effective even as to the herein oppositor.<br><br>It results from all this that the second clause of the will regarding the law which shall govern it, and to the condition imposed upon the legatees, is null and&nbsp; void, being contrary to law.<br><br>All of the&nbsp; remaining clauses of said will&nbsp; with all their dispositions and requests are perfectly valid and effective it not&nbsp; appearing that said clauses&nbsp; are contrary to the testator's national laws.<br><br>Therefore,&nbsp; the orders&nbsp; appealed from are modified and it is directed&nbsp; that the distribution of this estate be made&nbsp; in such a manner&nbsp; as to&nbsp; include the herein appellant&nbsp; Andre Brimo as one of the legatees, and the scheme of partition submitted by the judicial administrator is approved in all other respects, without any pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs. So ordered.<br><br><i>Street,&nbsp; Malcolm, Avance√±a, Villamor, </i>and <i>Ostrand, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Johnson, J., </i>dissents.</div>
