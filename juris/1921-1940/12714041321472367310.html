				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. YU CHAI HO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu in which the defendant was found guilty of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> 
under paragraph 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to suffer 
five months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> and to pay the costs.
<p align="justify">It appears from the evidence that on December 19, 1925, the 
accused Yu Chai Ho, in representation of his firm, Gui Sing &amp; Co., of which 
he was the managing partner, placed an order with Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. for 
a quantity of Colgate perfumes and soap to be shipped from New York to Cebu. The 
order was transmitted to Colgate &amp; Co., New York, and the merchandise was by 
them shipped to Cebu, consigned to themselves and subject to their order. The 
bill of lading and the invoices were forwarded to the Cebu branch of the 
International Banking Corporation, subject to delivery to the purchaser on 
payment of the purchase price, $259.70. The shipping documents were accompanied 
by a draft on Gui Sing &amp; Co., who accepted the draft but was unable to pay. 
The International Banking Corporation of Cebu, therefore, retained the shipping 
documents and invoices, without which the merchandise could not be cleared 
through the customhouse and delivered to the defendant or his firm. Through the 
intervention of Morrison, the Manager of the Cebu branch of Wm. H. Anderson 
&amp; Co., the International Banking Corporation agreed to deliver the documents 
to Gui Sing &amp; Co. upon their giving a trust receipt. The trust receipt was 
duly executed by Gui Sing &amp; Co. and delivered to the International Banking 
Corporation, whereupon the shipping documents were surrendered to the defendant, 
who upon presentation of them to the customs authorities, obtained delivery of 
the merchandise. The defendant thereupon sold the merchandise but, in violation 
of the terms of the trust receipt, failed to make payment to the International 
Banking Corporation, and Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., as guarantors, were 
compelled to pay the amount of the draft for the purchase price of the 
merchandise to the International Banking Corporation. </p>
<p align="justify">The trust receipt is in the usual form and, among other things, 
contains the following provisions: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I/We hereby agree to hold said goods in trust for the said 
corporation, and as its property with liberty to sell the same for its account, 
but without authority to make any other disposition whatever of the said goods 
or any part thereof (or to proceeds thereof) either by way of conditional sale, 
pledge, or otherwise.</p>
<p align="justify">"In case of sale I/We further agree to hand the proceeds, as 
soon as received, to the International Banking Corporation to apply against the 
relative acceptances (as described above) and for the payment of any other 
indebtedness of mine/ours to the International Banking Corporation." 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">That under this trust receipt the title to the merchandise 
remained in the International Banking Corporation and did not pass to the 
defendant, is almost too elementary for discussion. It is sufficient to quote 
the language of the court in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">In re</span> Dunlap Carpet Co. (206 Fed., 
726), in regard to trust receipts: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"By this arrangement a banker advances money to an intending 
importer, and thereby lends the aid of capital, of credit, or of business 
facilities and agencies abroad, to the enterprise of foreign commerce. Much of 
this trade could hardly be carried on by any other means, and therefore it is of 
the first importance that the fundamental factor in the transaction, the 
banker's advance of money and credit, should receive the amplest protection. 
Accordingly, in order to secure that the banker shall be repaid at the critical 
point—that is, when the imported goods finally reach the hands of the intended 
vendee—<span style="font-style: italic;">the banker takes the full title to the goods at the very beginning</span>; he 
takes it as soon as the goods are bought and settled for by his payments or 
acceptances in the foreign country, and he continues to hold that title as his 
indispensable security until the goods are sold in the United States and the 
vendee is called upon to pay for them. This security is not an ordinary pledge 
by the importer to the banker, for the importer has never owned the goods, and 
moreover he is not able to deliver the possession; but the security is the 
complete title vested originally in the bankers, and this characteristic of the 
transaction has again and again been recognized and protected by the courts. Of 
course, the title is at bottom a security title, as it has sometimes been 
called, and the banker is always under the obligation to reconvey; but only 
after his advances have been fully repaid and after the importer has fulfilled 
the other terms of the contract." (Italics ours.) (<span style="font-style: italic;">See also</span> Moors vs. Kidder, 
106 N. Y., 32; Farmers &amp; Mechanics' Nat. Bk. vs. Logan, 74 N. Y., 568; Barry 
vs. Boninger, 46 Md., 59; Moors vs. Wyman, 146 Mass., 60; and New Haven Wire Co. 
Cases, 5 L. R. A., 300.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">But counsel for the defendant argues vigorously that inasmuch 
as the price of the merchandise in question had been paid to the International 
Banking Corporation by Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., the bank had suffered no loss, 
and that, therefore, an essential element of the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> was lacking; 
that the only party prejudiced by the actions of the defendant was Wm. H. 
Anderson &amp; Co. and that as to the latter, the defendant had incurred a civil 
obligation.</p>
<p align="justify">We cannot accept this theory. Paragraph 5 of article 535 of the 
Penal Code reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Any person who, to the prejudice of another, shall convert or 
misappropriate any money, goods, or other personal property received by such 
person for safe-keeping, or on commission, or for administration, or under any 
other circumstances giving rise to the obligation to make delivery of or to 
return the same, or shall deny having received such money, goods, or other 
property." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The language of the paragraph is clear and requires no special 
construction. As will be seen, the person whose interests are prejudiced through 
the" conversion or misappropriation of the money, goods, or other personal 
property need not necessarily be the owner thereof; if such had been the 
intention of the authors of the Code, the phrase "to the prejudice of another" 
would have read "to the prejudice of the <span style="font-style: italic;">owner</span>." <br><br>Our opinion is also 
supported by the Supreme Court of Spain in its sentence of May 8, 1884, which in 
principle is exactly in point. The facts of that case are that one Enrique 
Mariano handed his watch to his friend, the accused, to keep for him while he, 
Mariano, was engaged in certain professional work in a circus. Instead of 
returning the watch to its owner, Mariano, the accused pawned it in a pawnshop 
for a loan of 225 <span style="font-style: italic;">pesetas</span>, Mariano recovered the watch from the pawnbroker 
almost immediately and without any expense. In that case, as in the present one, 
it was argued that as the owner of the watch suffered no loss, no <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> had 
been committed. The Spanish Supreme Court held that it was immaterial whether 
the loss had been suffered by the owner or by a third person, and among other 
things, said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Considering that in view of the literal terms of the provision 
of said article, as well as its spirit and legal reason, whenever damages are 
caused as a consequence of the aforesaid appropriation or taking away, the act 
constitutes the crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, even though the person who suffered the damage 
is a third party and not the one to whom the misappropriated or converted goods 
belongs or to whom it is to be returned, for this is an incidental element which 
in no way affects the juridical nature of the crime." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The correctness of the view we have taken seems quite clear 
when it is considered that the action is not one between the defendant and Wm. 
H. Anderson &amp; Co. or between the defendant and the International Banking 
Corporation; it deals with a public offense and is brought against the defendant 
by the People of the Philippine Islands. The very evident object of the article 
of the Penal Code under which the action is brought is to discourage dishonesty 
and unfaithfulness in the administration or care of money, goods, or other 
personal property received for such purposes. The object is not simply to 
enforce payment of indemnities; that is merely a side issue of a <span style="font-style: italic;">quasi</span> civil 
nature and is not the gist of the crime or the cause of action. <br><br>The fact 
that the defendant gave surety for the fulfillment of his obligations under the 
trust receipt, is of no consequence and does not alter the case. In the case of 
United States vs. Tabotabo (11 Phil., 372), the court said: "Assuming that the 
surety company had in fact paid the sum misappropriated, this payment by the 
bonding company, made by virtue of its. obligation to guarantee the liability of 
their client, does not exempt the latter from the punishment provided for * * 
*." </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Canal-Commercial Trust &amp; Savings Bank vs. N. 
O. Tex. &amp; Mex. Ry. Co., Appt., International Trading &amp; Rice Company, 
Warrantor, Appt. (49 A. L. R., 274), it was held that the bank could recover 
from the appellants, including the warrantor, the value of the sugar, the bill 
of lading for which had been delivered upon trust receipt. In that case the 
court said: "The improper use of pledged securities, by the pledgor holding them 
under a trust receipt, is a species of embezzlement." </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of People vs. De Lay (80 Cal., 52), the defendant, 
an assignee for the benefit of creditors, was convicted of embezzlement of funds 
which came into his possession by virtue of collections of accounts and sales of 
property of the assignor. The court said: "The fact that Nunan and Lowney took a 
written indemnity from the defendant in no way affects the guilt or innocence of 
the defendant, who is charged with embezzling the property intrusted to him for 
certain purposes by Mrs. Furlong."</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The fact that a defendant has given an indemnity bond is no 
defense to a prosecution for embezzlement;" (20 C. J., 456). </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It has been asserted that the information upon which the 
present action is brought is defective in that it is alleged therein that the 
offense was committed to the prejudice of Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. when it 
should have been alleged that the International Banking Corporation was the 
prejudiced party inasmuch as the loss suffered by Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. was 
not contemporaneous with the commission of the crime. The information itself is 
the best answer to this proposition. It reads as follows in translation: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The undersigned, sworn, accuses Yu Chai Ho of the crime of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, because on or about April 25, 1926, in the municipality of Cebu, 
Province of Cebu, the above-named defendant, under a trust receipt and a 
guaranty signed by Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., in favor of the International 
Banking Corporation, withdrew and received from said International Banking 
Corporation, 2 cases of merchandise worth P539.65, consisting of bottles of 
perfumes and soap, Colgate brand, belonging to Colgate &amp; Co., which 
merchandise was consigned to said bank in Cebu for the purpose of holding them 
in trust and selling them with the express obligation of turning over the 
proceeds of the sale to said International Banking Corporation, but the said 
accused, instead of complying with this obligation, willfully, unlawfully, and 
criminally, with intent of gain, and through fraud, converted said merchandise 
to his own use and benefit, to the damage of Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., who for 
lack of payment by the accused, notwithstanding the repeated demands made to 
that effect, had to pay the sum of P539.65 to said International Banking 
Corporation. Contrary to law.</p>
<p align="justify">"Cebu, Cebu, P. I., August 24, 1926. </p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
</div><p style="text-align: right;">"(Sgd.) LUCIO SANCHEZ<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Deputy Provincial Fiscal</span>" </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">As will be seen, the facts of the case are fully set forth in 
the information; it clearly shows the consequences of the defendant's acts to 
the International Banking Corporation as well as to Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. 
and was entirely sufficient to enable the defendant to prepare his defense. 
Assuming for the sake of the argument, that the fiscal erred in alleging that 
Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. suffered damages by reason of the defendant's acts, 
the alleged error was, therefore, non-prejudicial and did not vitiate the 
proceedings. (Sec. 10, G. O., 58.)</p>
<p align="justify">We do not, however, think that the fiscal erred in alleging1 
that the commission of the crime resulted to the prejudice of Wm. H. Anderson 
&amp; Co. It is true that originally the International Banking Corporation was 
the prejudiced party, but Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. compensated it for its loss 
and thus became subrogated to all its rights against the defendant (article 
1839, Civil Code). Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., therefore, stood exactly in the 
shoes of the International Banking Corporation in relation to the defendant's 
acts, and the commission of the crime resulted to the prejudice of the firm 
previously to the filing of the information in the case. The loss suffered by 
the firm was the ultimate result of the defendant's unlawful acts, and we see no 
valid reason why this fact should not be stated in the information; it stands to 
reason that, in the crime of estafa, the damage resulting therefrom need not 
necessarily occur simultaneously with the acts constituting the other essential 
elements of the crime. </p>
<p align="justify">In the sentence of the court below provision for the payment of 
indemnity is omitted on the ground that the defendant being insolvent, the 
prejudiced party has probably presented his claim in the insolvency proceedings. 
There being no direct evidence to that effect, we do not think that there is 
sufficient reason for such omission. </p>
<p align="justify">For the reasons stated the appealed sentence is modified by 
ordering the defendant to indemnify Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. in the sum of 
P519, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. In all other respects 
the judgment of the court below is affirmed, with the costs of this instance 
against the appellant. So ordered. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.</span>, concur. </p>
<hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center">

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>STREET, J.:<br> </strong></p>
<p align="justify">The offense of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> was certainly committed by the appellant 
in this case; and if the information had been properly drawn, there would have 
been no difficulty in sustaining the conviction. The information, however, is 
defective, as I shall proceed to show; and I concur in the recommendation of the 
Solicitor-General to the effect that the appellant should be acquitted, but I 
hasten to add that this would be without prejudice to further prosecution upon a 
proper information. </p>
<p align="justify">Subsection 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, under which the 
appellant was convicted, declares that anyone who, "to the prejudice of 
another," shall commit any of the various forms of embezzlement defined in that 
section, shall be subject to the penalty prescribed in article 534. No one can 
question that the words "to the prejudice of another," in said subsection, 
define an essential element of the offense, and this element of the offense 
should be charged in the information with truth and legal precision. In the case 
before us it is alleged that the offense was committed to the prejudice of Wm. 
H. Anderson &amp; Co., and I now propose to show that this allegation is 
untrue.</p>
<p align="justify">In this connection we note that the accused was manager of the 
partnership "Gui Sing &amp; Co.;" and in this capacity he appears to have signed 
a trust receipt, engaging to take certain merchandise in trust from the 
International Banking Corporation with the obligation to sell the same and 
deliver the proceeds to said bank, to be applied to the indebtedness owing by 
Gui Sing &amp; Co. upon account of the firm's acceptance of the draft for the 
same goods.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, I have no criticism to make upon the opinion of the court 
in its exposition of the proposition that the title to the goods taken out upon 
a trust receipt remains in the trustor, nor with the further proposition that 
the appropriation of the proceeds by the accused, as manager of Gui Sing &amp; 
Co., was an embezzlement punishable under subsection 5 of article 535 of the 
Penal Code. Indeed, I consider the act thus done to fall most literally and 
directly under said provision.</p>
<p align="justify">This brings us to consider the manner in which Wm. H. Anderson 
&amp; Co. is related to the case. This is explained by the following note 
written by Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., under date of April 6, 1924, and addressed 
to the International Banking Corporation:</p>
<blockquote>"GENTLEMEN: We refer you to Colgate draft in the amount of 
$259.70 drawn on the above-mentioned party [Gui Sing &amp; Co.]. Please deliver 
shipping documents to them and we hereby guarantee payment on due date, provided 
trust receipt is furnished."</blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">In a word Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. became guarantor of the 
draft accepted by Gui Sing &amp; Co.; and as a consequence of the failure of Gui 
Sing &amp; Co. to take up the draft at its due date, Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. 
was called upon to make good on its guaranty, which it did.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon these facts we propound the question, Who was prejudiced, 
in a correct legal sense, by the <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> committed in this case? On this point I 
think it self-evident, and true beyond any possibility of cavil, that the person 
really prejudiced by the act denounced was the International Banking 
Corporation. That entity was the trustor in the trust receipt and was therefore 
in immediate contractual relation with the accused. It was to the bank that the 
appellant was required to account, and when the accused converted the proceeds 
of the goods which had been received upon the trust receipt, he appropriated the 
money which he was bound to deliver to the bank. Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. was a 
complete stranger to the trust relation, and when the proceeds of the goods were 
embezzled, no legal damage thereby resulted to Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. It was 
only when this company had complied with its contract of guaranty by taking up 
the draft that said entity can be said to have suffered a loss. It will be seen 
that the incurring of this loss was not contemporary with the act of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. Of 
course it is obvious that under subsection 5 of article 535 of the Penal Code, 
the prejudice which is contemplated in the law must arise from the act of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> 
and the incurring of the prejudice must consequently be contemporaneous with the 
embezzlement. In the case before us the bank suffered a prejudice in the very 
instant that the embezzlement was committed, and the bank was the only person 
then in a position to incur such prejudice. </p>
<p align="justify">Of course, under well recognized principles of civil law, when 
Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. paid the draft, an obligation arose on the part of the 
accused to indemnify or exonerate said company, his guarantor; but, again, this 
obligation did not arise at the time the <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> was committed but only when the 
draft was paid. Moreover, while it is true that Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., upon 
satisfying its contract of guaranty, was subrogated to the rights of the bank, 
yet this circumstance cannot in any wise affect the criminal liability of the 
appellant, which already existed. </p>
<p align="justify">If the information in this case had alleged—as it should have 
alleged—that the <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> was committed to the prejudice of the International 
Banking Corporation, the prosecution would have been soundly planted, and in 
view of the subrogation, of Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. to the rights of the bank, 
it would have been proper for the court to have ordered the indemnity incident 
to this fraud to be paid to Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co.</p>
<p align="justify">There is another point which, though of a somewhat technical 
nature, I consider to be clear. It is this: Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. entered 
into a contractual relation with the International Banking Corporation, 
guaranteeing the payment on due date of the draft above mentioned, and in the 
event that occurred Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. paid the draft. In doing this act 
Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. suffered no legal prejudice, for compliance with a 
fair contract cannot be recognized in law as being a prejudice to either of the 
contracting parties. What happened was that, in compensation for payment of the 
acceptance, Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co. acquired a right to demand indemnification 
from the appellant. This is a civil right which the law concedes to every 
guarantor as against his principal. </p>
<p align="justify">The decision of the Supreme Court of Spain, of May 8, 1884, 
cited in the opinion of the court, in no wise supports the court upon the point 
now under criticism. In that case the owner of a watch had trusted it to the 
keeping of a friend, who pawned it without authority for a loan of 225 <span style="font-style: italic;">pesetas</span>. 
The owner came along and reclaimed his watch from the pawnshop, without paying 
the amount for which the watch had been pledged. This of course means that the 
pawnbroker lost the money which had been advanced by him to the person pledging 
the watch; and it was merely held by the Supreme Court of Spain, in the decision 
referred to, that the person who falsely pawned the watch could be convicted of 
the <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> committed against the pawnbroker. This was right enough, because it 
was the pawnbroker who had been defrauded; and the fraud upon the pawnbroker, be 
it noted, was committed in the very act of misappropriation of the watch by the 
person who pledged it.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not our contention that the words "to the prejudice of 
another" must be interpreted to mean "to the prejudice of the owner." They 
should, however, be interpreted to mean to the prejudice of the person defrauded 
in the very act of embezzlement. The word "another," in the expression quoted, 
should not be stretched to apply to any person upon whom the loss may ultimately 
fall as a result of a contract to which the accused is a stranger. The decision 
of the Supreme Court of Spain to which we have referred does not reveal the form 
in which the information was drawn in that case; but it must be supposed that it 
was so drawn as to allege, as the proof showed, that the estafa had been 
committed to the prejudice of the pawnbroker, assuming that Spanish 
jurisprudence attaches importance to this fundamental. </p>
<p align="justify">The truth is that a person who commits <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> against a 
pawnbroker by falsely representing himself to be the owner of a watch which is 
pawned by the person making such representation, is not—as against the 
pawnbroker—guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> (embezzlement) under subsection 5 of article 535 
of our Penal Code, but of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> (deceit) incident to the fraudulent 
misrepresentation of ownership,—an offense falling under subsection 1 of the 
same article. The contention of the accused, in the Spanish case referred to, 
was therefore entirely misconceived; and the Supreme Court of Spain, while not 
in error in holding that the accused was guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>, was inadvertently 
misled into considering the offense in relation with subsection 5, when the 
decision would have been more logical if based on subsection 1. </p> With reference to the case now before us, it is evident that 
the bank was not only the owner of the embezzled goods, but it was the entity in 
whose immediate prejudice the act was done; and this fact seems so obvious as 
not to require or even admit of elaborate exposition. In the light of these 
facts the conclusion is irresistible that the information in this case is 
defective in alleging that the offense in question was committed in prejudice of 
Wm. H. Anderson &amp; Co., when the facts show that the person truly prejudiced 
was the International Banking Corporation. It results, in my opinion, that the 
conviction upon this information was improper; the judgment should therefore be 
reversed, and the accused should be held to answer to a new information in which 
it should be stated that the offense was committed to the prejudice of the bank. 
I therefore dissent from the decision affirming the present appeal.</div>
