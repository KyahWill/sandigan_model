				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the administration proceedings for the&nbsp; settlement of the&nbsp; estate of&nbsp; Francisco Derayunan, deceased,&nbsp; pending in the&nbsp; court of First Instance of Iloilo,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judicial administrator submitted a scheme of partition of the estate of the said deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; The widow, by the second marriage,&nbsp; Elisa Dominado, objected to said partition.&nbsp; After a hearing of the parties the court ordered the partition to be made upon the following&nbsp; basis:<br><blockquote> "In the scheme&nbsp; of partition there shall first be separated the&nbsp; conjugal property belonging to the widow&nbsp; and half of the conjugal property belonging to the deceased which, together with his private property,&nbsp; will constitute the&nbsp; inheritance&nbsp; to be&nbsp; partitioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; This inheritance shall&nbsp; be divided into three equal&nbsp; parts: Two thirds thereof shall constitute the legitime of the two children of the deceased according to article 808 of the Civil Code, and the remaining one-third shall be the free portion from which shall be taken that which is to&nbsp; go to the&nbsp; widow Elisa Dominado in usufruct.&nbsp; This portion, which&nbsp; legally belongs to the widow in usufruct, shall&nbsp; be equal to the&nbsp; legitime of each of the children who has not received any betterment.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See article 834 of the Civil Code.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The betterment, according to article 808 of the Civil Code, is one-third of the estate—one of&nbsp; the two-thirds&nbsp; which&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; the legitime, or one-half of the legitime,<br><br>"According to the&nbsp; law,&nbsp; then, two-thirds of the inheritance must be&nbsp; adjudicated to the children, one-half&nbsp; to the son Narciso Derayunan and the other half to the daughter Margarita&nbsp; Derayunan.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the law&nbsp; the widow Elisa Dominado is entitled to one-sixth of the inheritance in usufruct,&nbsp; which one-sixth&nbsp; part shall be&nbsp; taken from&nbsp; the free portion.<br><br>"Furthermore, there&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; adjudicated to each&nbsp; of the children Narciso&nbsp; Derayunan&nbsp; and&nbsp; Margarita Derayunan, one-half, in full ownership, of the free portion not adjudicated to the widow&nbsp; Elisa Dominado and, in addition, the naked&nbsp; ownership of the portion allotted in usufruct&nbsp; to the widow Elisa Dominado.<br><br>"This is the basis to be followed in the scheme of partition of the estate of the deceased Francisco Derayunan."<br></blockquote>Upon this basis&nbsp; determined by the court, the administrator of the intestate&nbsp; estate presented another&nbsp; scheme of partition on April 24,&nbsp; 1925, which, after&nbsp; a hearing, was approved by the court in&nbsp; an order dated&nbsp; December 2, of the same year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; widow appealed from this&nbsp; order.<br><br>One of the questions raised in the appellant's brief refers to the manner of determining the portion of the inheritance which&nbsp; pertains to&nbsp; the widow in usufruct,&nbsp; two children of different marriages of the deceased Francisco Derayunan inheriting with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the&nbsp; appellant, the widow's usufruct in the&nbsp; present case constitutes one-third of the inheritance,&nbsp; citing in support of her&nbsp; contention the opinions of the illustrious commentators on&nbsp; the Civil Code, Messrs. Manresa and&nbsp; Sanchez Roman.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the appellee maintains that said&nbsp; usufruct consists of one sixth part of the inheritance as&nbsp; found&nbsp; by the trial&nbsp; court.<br><br>Article 834 of the Civil Code provides that "any widower or widow who, on the death of&nbsp; his or her&nbsp; spouse, is not divorced, or should be so by the fault of the&nbsp; deceased, shall be entitled to a&nbsp; portion in usufruct equal&nbsp; to that&nbsp; corresponding by way of legitime to each of&nbsp; the&nbsp; legitimate children or descendants who have not received any betterment."<br><br>What is necessary, then, to determine is&nbsp; the&nbsp; legitime of the&nbsp; children&nbsp; who have&nbsp; not&nbsp; received&nbsp; any betterment. First of all, it must be noted that the legitime which serves as a point of comparison is that of the children or descendants who have&nbsp; not received any&nbsp; betterment,&nbsp; which implies&nbsp; that the deceased has made use of the right to give a betterment.&nbsp; But, in the present case,&nbsp; there being no&nbsp; betterment, what is the legitime of the two children?<br><br>Sanchez Roman, in&nbsp; solving the legal problems that might arise in the interpretation of article 834 of the Civil Code, among other things, says:<br><blockquote>"According to article 834, the legitime that pertains&nbsp; to a legitimate child, or descendant not received any betterment or the <span style="font-style: italic;">legitime </span>by which the <i>amount</i> of the widow's usufruct is regulated in order that said legitimes may be <span style="font-style: italic;">equal </span>in <span style="font-style: italic;">amount</span>, is the two-thirds of the inheritance as <i>maximum</i> when there is no&nbsp; betterment; as a <span style="font-style: italic;">minimum</span>, the one-third constituting the short legitime only when the&nbsp; whole of the&nbsp; second third&nbsp; constituting the betterment is&nbsp; given as such; and as a <span style="font-style: italic;">medium</span>, said one-third constituting the short legitime, to which is to be added what&nbsp; remains of the third constituting the betterment&nbsp; when only&nbsp; a part and not the whole thereof is given; and fixing within these limits, maximum, minimum and medium, the amount which must be allotted to the widow in each case as her share, which must be equal to that of the child or each of the children not receiving any betterment, according to their number." (6 Sanchez Roman, vol.&nbsp; 2, p. 878.)<br></blockquote>Manresa fully solves the same question as follows:<br><blockquote> "What is the legitime&nbsp; pertaining to each of the children not having received any betterment?&nbsp; It is necessary&nbsp; to get the meaning of the words 'pertaining' and 'not receiving any betterment/&nbsp; What pertains to each of the children by way&nbsp; of legitime&nbsp; is the portion to which he is&nbsp; entitled according to the law whether there is a surviving spouse&nbsp; or not, for the fact that&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; inherits with descendants cannot alter their legitimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The children not receiving any betterment are&nbsp; those in whose favor the testator has not expressly disposed of any part of the one-third constituting the betterment, for the code, as shown by articles 825 and 828, does not admit of implied betterments.&nbsp; The law excludes,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; the amount of the express betterments whether or not they absorb the one-third constituting the same.&nbsp; The legitime, therefore, that must be taken into account&nbsp; is the two-thirds, if&nbsp; no betterment is&nbsp; given, the one-third constituting the short, legitime if the other third was given entirely as a betterment,&nbsp; or said one-third plus the residue of the other&nbsp; not given as a betterment by the testator.&nbsp; It is this&nbsp; portion, or the two-thirds, one third and the one-third plus the residue, according to the case, that must be divided equally by the number of the children and will give the legitime belonging or pertaining, by force of law, to each of the children not receiving any betterments"&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 Manresa, p. 541.)<br></blockquote>Perhaps Mr. Arturo Casanueva may be cited in support of appellant's&nbsp; contention, said author being of the opinion that, in order to determine the widow's usufruct, the short legitime of the children,&nbsp; or, one-third&nbsp; of&nbsp; the inheritance constituting the same must be considered&nbsp; as the basis of the computation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In an article on&nbsp; usufruct&nbsp; of the spouse published&nbsp; in the <i>Revista&nbsp; de Legislation&nbsp; y&nbsp; Jurisprudencia,</i> vol. 134, p. 532, Mr. Casanueva, among other things, says:<br><blockquote>"Does the phrase 'not receiving any betterment' refer to express betterment?&nbsp; <i>Ubi lex non&nbsp; distinguit, nee nos distinguere&nbsp; debemus.</i>&nbsp; It&nbsp; is conclusive—not receiving&nbsp; any betterment.&nbsp; And&nbsp; those who appear to have received betterments impliedly are&nbsp; as much bettered as&nbsp; those who do so expressly.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the three cases which are possible, namely, some having&nbsp; received&nbsp; a&nbsp; betterment and&nbsp; others not, all having received expressly or impliedly equal betterments, and&nbsp; all having received betterments but unequal, only the latter two give rise to doubt.&nbsp; But in both&nbsp; cases&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *. Art&nbsp; we going to accept&nbsp; a&nbsp; different view ?&nbsp; From&nbsp; a reading of article 834 of the Civil&nbsp; Code we draw the inference that the portion in usufruct is <span style="font-style: italic;">equal to&nbsp; that&nbsp; which pertains to each one as his legitime,</span>&nbsp; and as things&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">equal </span>to&nbsp; the&nbsp; same things—portion in usufruct—are equal&nbsp; to each&nbsp; other,&nbsp; it results that that part which pertains to <span style="font-style: italic;">each of them as legitime</span>, is equal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this occur&nbsp; when all&nbsp; have received unequal betterments?&nbsp; The absurdity is&nbsp; evident if it is admitted that those&nbsp; unequal parts are real legitimes.&nbsp; In a decision rendered&nbsp; December 2, 1893, the&nbsp; Supreme Court has&nbsp; held that&nbsp; 'any interpretation&nbsp; or construction which leads to an absurdity&nbsp; must be rejected.'&nbsp; Therefore, the view whereby&nbsp; the legitime of a legitimate child or descendant&nbsp; is considered&nbsp; as a part of the two-thirds&nbsp; must be rejected.<br><br>"Having established that the legitime to be taken into account in the computation of the&nbsp; usufruct&nbsp; of the widow is an aliquot part of the one-third, a divisor of the said one-third still&nbsp; remains&nbsp; to be found, which is also much debated. Some are of the&nbsp; opinion that it must&nbsp; be the number of the children, and others that it is the number of the children plus one, because they consider the surviving spouse as another&nbsp; child.<br><br>"Let&nbsp; us admit as the divisor the number&nbsp; of children plus one, and as we can&nbsp; give the number of children any value whatever, let us give it the value of one,&nbsp; and we will find as divisor one plus one equals two.&nbsp;&nbsp; What will be the result?&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; will be that&nbsp; in&nbsp; case a surviving&nbsp; spouse inherits with&nbsp; a&nbsp; single child, one-half of the one-third constituting the&nbsp; betterment&nbsp; would belong to him in usufruct, which is against&nbsp; the conclusive&nbsp; provisions of the Civil Code, which precisely&nbsp; determine&nbsp; that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case where there is&nbsp; only&nbsp; one&nbsp; child he will receive the whole third in usufruct. It is therefore&nbsp; an inadmissible divisor because it leads to a&nbsp; manifest juridical absurdity,&nbsp; manifestly contrary to the law.<br><br>"In short,&nbsp; the&nbsp; portion in&nbsp; usufruct pertaining&nbsp; to&nbsp; the widow is obtained by dividing one-third&nbsp; of the inheritance by the number of&nbsp; children."'<br></blockquote>But in this jurisdiction the legal doctrine laid down in the case of&nbsp; Chico <i>vs.</i> Viola and&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; (40 Phil., 316), is that under&nbsp; articles 825 and 828,&nbsp; there can be&nbsp; no implied betterments that, under&nbsp; article 808, the two-thirds of the inheritance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; father or of the mother&nbsp; constitute the legitime&nbsp; of&nbsp; the legitimate children and&nbsp; descendants without prejudice&nbsp; to the right to give a betterment; and when this right has not been&nbsp; made use of, the two-thirds pertain to them as legitime; but this does not mean&nbsp; that they thereby&nbsp; receive a&nbsp; betterment.&nbsp; Dividing, then, the&nbsp; two thirds of the&nbsp; inheritance&nbsp; of the deceased Francisco Derayunan between the two&nbsp; children&nbsp; by&nbsp; his two&nbsp; marriages, one-third of the said inheritance pertains to each one as his legitime&nbsp; and this&nbsp; one-third is the measure of the portion that must go&nbsp; to the widow-appellant in usufruct, or one- third also of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; inheritance, which must&nbsp; be&nbsp; the one-third of free&nbsp; disposal in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; article 839 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; Therefore, we find that the trial court committed an error of&nbsp; law in holding that the portion which belongs to the widow-appellant in usufruct consists of one-sixth part of the inheritance.<br><br>Another error&nbsp; assigned by the appellant as committed by the court is&nbsp; that the ^court adjudicated to the widow Elisa Dominado half of the expenses&nbsp; incurred in sowing the 798 cocoanut trees,&nbsp; instead of half of the said trees. the planting of these&nbsp; cocoanut trees took place during the marriage of Domiirgo&nbsp; Derayunan and Elisa Dominado, the land being exclusive property of the former.&nbsp; The appellant claims half of these cocoanut trees as her half of the conjugal property, invoking paragraph No. 1&nbsp; of article 1407 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code in support of her contention.&nbsp; This contention&nbsp; is untenable.&nbsp; A similar question was raised in the&nbsp; case of Tabotabo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Molero (22 Phil., 418).&nbsp; Diego Tabotabo was married the second time to Gregoria Molero.&nbsp; He had a piece of land as his exclusive property which&nbsp; had been&nbsp; planted&nbsp; with more&nbsp; than 2,000 cocoanut&nbsp; trees during his second&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; with Molero.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; latter&nbsp; claimed the&nbsp; right to one- half of the said coconut trees,&nbsp; but this court denied her claim&nbsp; enunciating the following&nbsp; doctrine:<br><blockquote> "To the owner of realty also belongs, by right of accession, the&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; made&nbsp; thereon.&nbsp; Buildings,&nbsp; crops and other&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; upon land belong to the owner of the realty.&nbsp; To this rule there is an exception in the case of&nbsp; married persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph 2 of article 1404 of the Civil Code provides that buildings constructed during the marriage,&nbsp; on land belonging to one of the&nbsp; spouses, are conjugal property, but the&nbsp; owner of the realty&nbsp; shall be entitled to credit for the value of the&nbsp; land.&nbsp; This exception, however, is limited to buildings and does not apply to crops and&nbsp; other improvements, with&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to which the general rule applies.&nbsp; Expenses incurred&nbsp; in making such crops and improvements are conjugal&nbsp; expenses, for which the conjugal partnership must be reimbursed.<br></blockquote>The second error, therefore, must be overruled.<br><br>The determination of the part of the land described in tax assessment&nbsp; No. 3308, the subject-matter of the third assignment of error, lies within the sound discretion of the court, taking into account the interests of the parties, regarding which it is not&nbsp; incumbent upon us to make&nbsp; any pronouncement.<br><br>For the foregoing,&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; appealed from must be,&nbsp; as it is hereby, modified in that the portion pertaining to the widow in usufruct consists&nbsp; of&nbsp; one-third of the estate of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Francisco Derayunan,&nbsp; without&nbsp; any special findings&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Johnson, Street,&nbsp; Ostrand, Johns,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
