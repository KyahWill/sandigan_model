				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the Government of the Philippine Islands&nbsp; from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros, ordering that lot No. 70 in cadastral case No. 26 of said province (G.&nbsp; L. R. 0. Record No. 214) be registered in the name of the appellee Vicente Franco.<br><br>The assignments of error relate only to question of fact in regard to which we are&nbsp; not&nbsp; prepared to&nbsp; say that the findings of the court below were erroneous.&nbsp; The appellee has presented as evidence a certified copy of an entry in the registry of property of a possessory information, recorded on April 17,1895, for a tract of land of 200 hectares, more or less,&nbsp; and described as follows: Bounded on&nbsp; the north by the River Sicaba and the land of&nbsp; Nicolas Gepanaga, Estero Cambucao and the land of&nbsp; Juan Jardeliza; on the east by the sources of the streams Nabuligan and Mañgocñgoc; and on the south and west by the said stream Mañgocñgoc and the River Gimaruyan. According to the appellee's testimony the lot here in question&nbsp; represents&nbsp; the northern part of the land&nbsp; described in the <i>information&nbsp; posesoria,</i> embraces about 60 hectares&nbsp; and is described as follows:&nbsp; Bounded on the&nbsp; north by lot No. 394, Marcela Segovia <i>vs.</i>Insular Government; on the east by lot No. 49 claimed by Domingo Franco; on the&nbsp; south by lot&nbsp; No. 46, also&nbsp; claimed by Domingo Franco; and on&nbsp; the west by&nbsp; the stream Mañgocñgoc.&nbsp; The appellant contends that the two descriptions differ so widely, that they cannot relate to&nbsp; the same land.&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight, this argument seems quite plausible, but from an examination of the sketch plans in evidence,&nbsp; it appears clearly from the location of the various streams mentioned in Exhibit&nbsp; A that lot No. 70&nbsp; is well within the boundaries of the land described in said exhibit.During the past&nbsp; thirty years a great many changes of boundary men&nbsp; may&nbsp; have&nbsp; occurred and dliscrepancies in descriptions resulting from such&nbsp; changes are usually of comparatively slight importance.and cannot prevail against well established natural boundaries. <br><br>The&nbsp; appellant also contends that the appellee has not sufficiently&nbsp; shown" that he&nbsp; has held possession of the land for the period of time required by section 45, paragraph (b) of Act&nbsp; No. 2874, which requires that the possession and occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain must be open,&nbsp; continuous, exclusive,&nbsp; and notorious, and under a bonafide&nbsp; claim of&nbsp; acquisition of ownership, except as against&nbsp; the Government, since July 26, 1894.&nbsp; This contention cannot be sustained.&nbsp; Exhibit A recites that Juan Salarza, who instituted the possessory information proceedings, held&nbsp; the land for over twelve years prior to April,&nbsp; 1895, and&nbsp; there is testimony to the&nbsp; effect that the appellee Vicente Franco acquired the land by purchase from Juan Salarza in 1899, and has been in possession ever since.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed without costs. <br><br>So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Street, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez,</i> and <i>Villa-Real, JJ.,</i> concur.&nbsp; </div>
