				<BR><STRONG>GODDARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p> "Por las consideraciones expuestas, el Juzgado
falla este asunto condenando a Dizon y Cia., Inc., a acreditar en sus
libros coxno pago de las obligaciones? de Bonifacio Lumanlan la suma de
P11,840, ordenando a la misma entidad que inmediatamente expida los
certificados de accion equivalente a la menclonada suma; declarando
perpetuo y absoluto el interdicto prohibitorio expedido contra los
demandados; condenando a la Dizon y Cia., Inc., al pago de la suma de
P2,000 a favor del demandante, y se condena a los demandados al pago de
las costas del juicio. En cuanto a los danos y perjuicios reclamados
por el demandante, no habiendo este probado los mismos, el Juzgado no
puede accederlos."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The appellant, Dizon &amp; Co., Inc., assigns twenty-three errors as having been committed by the trial court</p>
<p> The appellant is a corporation duly organized under the laws of the
Philippine Islands with its central office in the City of Manila. The
plaintiff-appellee Bonifacio Lumanlan, on July 31, 1922, subscribed for
300 shares of stock of said corporation at a par value of P50 or a
total of P15,000. Julio Valenzuela, Pedro Santos and Francisco Escoto,
creditors of this corporation, filed suit against it in the Court of
First Instance of Manila, case No. 37007, praying that a receiver be
appointed, as it appeared that the corporation at that time had no
assets except credits against those who had subscribed for shares of
stock. The court named Tayag as receiver for the purpose of collecting
said subscriptions. As Bonifacio Lumanlan had only paid P1,500 of the
P15,000, par value of the stock for which he subscribed, the receiver
on August 30, 1930, filed a suit against him in the Court of First
Instance of Manila, civil case No. 37492, for the collection of
P15,109, P13,500 of which was the amount he owed for unpaid stock and
P1,609 for loans and advances by the corporation to Lumanlan. In that
case Lumanlan was sentenced to pay the corporation the above-mentioned
sum of P15,109 with legal interest thereon from August 30, 1930, and
costs. Lumanlan appealed from this decision.</p>
<p> Pending this appeal, with the permission of the court, the
creditors, some of the directors and the majority of the stockholders
held several meetings in which it was agreed in substance that
subscribers for the capital stock who were in default should pay the
creditors; Lumanlan was designated to pay the debt of the corporation
to Julio Valenzuela, one of the petitioners in case No. 37007; at that
time the corporation owed Valenzuela the sum of P8,000 plus interest
thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum from March 17, 1928.
Lumanlan agreed to assume this obligation and in turn the corporation
agreed that if Lumanlan would dismiss his appeal in case No. 37492 the
corporation would collect only 50 per cent of the amount subscribed by
him for stock, provided that in case the 50 per cent was insufficient
to pay Valenzuela he should pay an additional amount which should not
exceed the amount of the judgment against him in that case. In view of
this agreement Lumanlan withdrew his appeal and paid Valenzuela the sum
of P11,840 including interest and thereby was subrogated in place of
Valenzuela. The petitioning creditors having been paid the amounts owed
to them by the corporation asked that the receiver be dismissed and the
court granted this. Disregarding this agreement and notwithstanding the
payment made by Lumanlan to Valenzuela, the corporation on May 5, 1932,
asked for the execution of the sentence in case No. 37492 and by virtue
of an order of execution the provincial sheriff levied upon two parcels
of land belonging to Lumanlan described in certificate of title No. 901
of the Province of Tarlac. Lumanlan brought this case to collect from
Dizon &amp; Co., Inc., and to prevent the sheriff from selling the two
parcels of land. Pending the result of this case the sheriff was
enjoined from proceeding with the sale.</p>
<p> In the promissory note given by the corporation to Valenzuela the
former obligated itself to pay Valenzuela the sum of P8,000 with
interest at 12 per cent per annum and, upon failure to pay said sum and
interest when due, 25 per cent of the principal as expenses of
collection and judicial costs in case of litigation.</p>
<p> By virtue of these facts Lumanlan is entitled to a credit against
the judgment in case No. 37492 for P11,840 and an additional sum of
P2,000, which is 25 per cent on the principal debt, as he had to file
this suit to collect, or receive credit for the sum which he had paid
Valenzuela for and in place of the corporation, or a total of P13,840.
This leaves a balance due Dizon &amp; Co., Inc., of P1,269 on that
judgment with interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum from August 30,
1930.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> It appears from the record that during the trial of
the case now under consideration, the Bank of the Philippine Islands
appeared in this case as assignee in the "Involuntary Insolvency of
Dizon &amp; Co., Inc." That bank was appointed assignee in case No.
43065 of the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila on November
28, 1932. It is therefore evident that there are still other creditors
of Dizon &amp; Co., Inc. This being the case that corporation has a
right to collect all unpaid stock subscriptions and any other amounts
which may be due it.</p>
  <p> "It is established doctrine that
subscriptions to the capital of a corporation constitute a fund to
which the creditors have a right to look for satisfaction of their
claims and that the assignee in insolvency can maintain an action upon
any unpaid stock subscription in order to realize assets for the
payment of its debts." (Philippine Trust Co. <em>vs.</em> Rivera, 44 Phil., 469, 470.)</p>
  <p>
"* * * the Corporation Law clearly recognizes that a stock subscription
is a subsisting liability from the time the subscription is made, since
it requires the subscriber to pay interest quarterly from that date
unless he is relieved from such liability by the by-laws of the
corporation. The subscriber is as much bound to pay the amount of the
share subscribed by him as he would be to pay any other debt, and the
right of the company to demand payment is no less incontestable."
(Velasco <em>vs.</em> Poizat, 37 Phil., 802, 805.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In view of the above conclusions it is not necessary to discuss the other questions raised by the parties in this case.</p>
<p> The judgment of the trial court is modified in accordance with the
above and Dizon &amp; Co., Inc., is ordered to credit Bonifacio
Lumanlan with the sum of P13,840 against the judgment for P15,109, in
case No. 37492 of the Court of First Instance of Manila; to issue to
Bonifacio Lumanlan 300 shares of its capital stock upon payment by him
of the sum of P1,269 with interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum from
August 30, 1930. The preliminary injunction issued in this case is
hereby dissolved for the purpose of enabling Dizon &amp; Co., Inc., to
ask for a new order of execution in case No. 37492, Court of First
Instance of Manila, for the sum of P1,269 with interest thereon as
stated above. Without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Hull, </em>and<em> Imperial, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
