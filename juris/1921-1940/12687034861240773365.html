				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Rizal denying a motion presented by the Fiscal of said province for the issuance of a new writ of execution against Joaquin C.&nbsp; Yuseco,&nbsp; being one of the bondsmen for the provisional liberty of one Chan Lin Tam <u>alias</u> Manuel Zalazar,&nbsp; accused in the above&nbsp; entitled case.<br><br>It appears that on October 20,&nbsp; 1925,&nbsp; the above named Chan Lin Tam <u>alias</u> Manuel Zalazar was accused,&nbsp; together with other persons, in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, of the crime of murder, and upon his&nbsp; arrest he was required to put up a bail in the sum of P15,000 for his provisional liberty; that on December 11, 1925, Jose G. Paraiso, Mariano Y. Granados, and Joaquin C. Yuseco,&nbsp; jointly and severally,&nbsp; subscribed the bond in favor of the said accused in the form prescribed by law; that on June 12,&nbsp; 1926,&nbsp; for the non-appearance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused Chan Lin Tam <u>alias</u> Manuel Zalazar,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court below ordered his arrest and the forfeiture of the bond for&nbsp; his provisional liberty;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; on September&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1926, a writ&nbsp; of execution against the&nbsp; property of the bondsmen&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued.<br><br>It developed&nbsp; that no&nbsp; property of the bondsmen could be located;&nbsp; that another writ&nbsp; of execution&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the court for the sum of P6,500&nbsp; on the property of&nbsp; Joaquin C. Yuseco and that by virtue thereof the property&nbsp; of&nbsp; Yuseco was&nbsp; executed and a certificate of sale was&nbsp; issued by&nbsp; the deputy&nbsp; sheriff of Nueva Ecija&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; but upon&nbsp; investigation conducted by the office of the Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands, the&nbsp; land executed and sold to the&nbsp; government was&nbsp; of&nbsp; the public&nbsp; domain and, as such, it was occupied by&nbsp; several public-land applicants under the Public Land Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon the Deputy&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal of Rizal presented a motion&nbsp; to the Court of First Instance praying that a new writ of execution&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; against the property of bondsman Joaquin C.&nbsp; Yuseco.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion was&nbsp; denied by the court below in&nbsp; its order of September 2,&nbsp; 1930.&nbsp; From this order the Provincial Fiscal appealed to this Court&nbsp; and&nbsp; assigned the following as error:<br><blockquote>"El Juzgado a quo incurrio en error al dictar su auto de fecha 20 de noviembre de&nbsp; 1930 desestimando la&nbsp; mocion&nbsp; del ministerio fiscal en la que&nbsp; se pide una&nbsp; nueva orden de ejecucion contra los bienes del&nbsp; apelado&nbsp; fiados&nbsp; Joaquin C. Yuseco."</blockquote>The assignment of error above quoted is&nbsp; well&nbsp; taken, and for the purposes of this appeal,&nbsp; we&nbsp; repeat&nbsp; our&nbsp; ruling in the case of U. S.&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Carmen,&nbsp; 13 Phil.,&nbsp; 455, to the effect that&nbsp; in order to enforce the bond,&nbsp; the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; should not bring a new action,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; institute an ordinary action; he should only take the necessary steps&nbsp; for the execution of the prior judgment of forfeiture and require the bondsmen&nbsp; to pay the amount of the bond or attach a portion&nbsp; of their property the proceeds of which on sale&nbsp; should be&nbsp; enough to&nbsp; satisfy the liability of the bondsmen."&nbsp; The&nbsp; Bleibel case,&nbsp; 34&nbsp; Jur.&nbsp; Fi.,&nbsp; 244, is not in point.<br><br>The order appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is reversed and the&nbsp; issuance of a new writ of execution against&nbsp; the property of Joaquin C. Yuseco is hereby ordered,&nbsp; without costs.<br><br>Ten days after the&nbsp; promulgation of this decision final judgment will be entered,&nbsp; and&nbsp; five&nbsp; days&nbsp; thereafter the&nbsp; record will be remanded to&nbsp; the court&nbsp; below.<br><br>It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Johnson, Villamor,</i> and <i>Villa-Real,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
