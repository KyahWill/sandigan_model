				<BR><STRONG>JOHNS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"> STATEMENT<br></div><br>The complaint alleges that at all the times hereinafter stated, the plaintiff was the owner of the&nbsp; American steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Farmingdale</span>; that on June 16,&nbsp; 1924, it entered into a contract with the defendant Juan&nbsp; Gisbert for the charter of the steamship for a period of six months, a copy of which is attached to the complaint, marked Exhibit A; that in accord with the terms of the charter-party,&nbsp; and on June 16,&nbsp; 1924, the&nbsp; defendant Juan&nbsp; Gisbert secured&nbsp; and delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp; plaintiff a bond of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Guaranty Company, in the sum of P20,000 for his faithful performance of the charter-party contract;&nbsp; that pursuant thereto, and on June 16, 1924, the plaintiff delivered to the defendant Juan Gisbert the&nbsp; steamship in question&nbsp; at&nbsp; Olongapo "in seaworthy&nbsp; condition and good repair;" that&nbsp; upon its delivery, Juan Gisbert paid the plaintiff P6,232.50 as charter hire&nbsp; for one month, and the sum of P1,000 as partial payment of the insurance premiums on the vessel, as provided for in paragraph 18&nbsp; of the&nbsp; charter-party contract; that no&nbsp; other payments have ever been made under the contract; that the vessel in question was sold October 27, 1924; and that at the time of&nbsp; the sale, the&nbsp; charter hire had then accrued in the sum of P27,267.18, together with the insurance in the sum of P4,375; that on July 28, 1924, the defendant&nbsp; Ricardo Caballero deposited&nbsp; with&nbsp; the plaintiff the sum&nbsp; of P20,000 in cash as a guaranty of the performance of the contract by the defendant Juan Gisbert;&nbsp; and that by reason&nbsp; thereof, plaintiff surrendered and cancelled the bond of the Philippine&nbsp; Guaranty Company for&nbsp; a&nbsp; like amount; "that the said sum of P20,000 is&nbsp; now in the possession and control of plaintiff;" that on August 13,1924, due to the failure of the defendant Gisbert to pay the char- ter hire and insurance premiums then due, plaintiff notified him&nbsp; that the contract&nbsp; of the charter-party was rescinded, "and thereupon took possession of the said&nbsp; steamship;" that plaintiff, at the instance of Gisbert, caused repairs to be made on the steamship at a&nbsp; cost, of P8,978.33, no part of which has been paid; that in the return of the steamship from Manila&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo, plaintiff&nbsp; incurred&nbsp; expenses amounting to P910.72, and has&nbsp; paid outstanding charges against the ship,&nbsp; incurred by the&nbsp; defendant, in&nbsp; the sum of P44 for rent of signal apparatus for the month of July, 1924, and&nbsp; P79.76 for customs&nbsp; charges; that during the period of Gisbert's possession, equipment of the ship&nbsp; of the value of P200&nbsp; was used by the defendant; that&nbsp; while in his possession,&nbsp; the defendant Gisbert used fuel oil,&nbsp; which was the property of the plaintiff, of the value of P2,491.44, no part&nbsp; of which has been paid,&nbsp; and payment thereof refused.<br><br>Plaintiff prays for judgment against Gisbert in the sum of P34,944.19, with interest and costs, and that the&nbsp; cash bond of P20,000 deposited by the defendant Caballero&nbsp; with plaintiff be&nbsp; applied&nbsp; "in&nbsp; partial satisfaction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said judgment," and that it have such further relief as to the court may seem just and&nbsp; equitable.<br><br>For answer the defendant Gisbert admits the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4,&nbsp; 5, 6 and 8&nbsp; of the amended complaint, and specifically denies all other allegations, and as a&nbsp; special&nbsp; defense alleges&nbsp; that any interest which&nbsp; he had as charterer of the steamship was transferred to his co-defendant Ricardo Caballero, as evidenced by a public document executed July 22, 1924, a&nbsp; copy of which is attached to, and made a part of, the pleadings; that in and thereby, the defendant Caballero assumed all the rights and obligations of this defendant, of which the plaintiff had knowledge, and as a counterclaim, he alleges that he acted merely as a captain of the chartered steamer for three months, and&nbsp; that his services were reasonably worth the&nbsp; sum of P500 a month.&nbsp; Wherefore,&nbsp; he prays that, as to him, the complaint be dismissed, and that he have judgment&nbsp; against the plaintiff and the defendant Caballero&nbsp; for P1,500, with interest and costs.<br><br>For answer the&nbsp; defendant Caballero makes a&nbsp; specific denial, and as a first special defense&nbsp; alleges that, notwithstanding the provisions in article 18 of the charter-party, there was an agreement that such provisions could not and would&nbsp; not be enforced;&nbsp; that about August&nbsp; 6, 1924,&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; advised the&nbsp; defendant Gisbert&nbsp; to immediately deposit $40,000 in lieu of a membership&nbsp; by which&nbsp; the plaintiff might be secured, and in accord with the&nbsp; regulations of the American Steamship Owners' Mutual&nbsp; Protection&nbsp; and Indemnity Association; that as&nbsp; a result thereof, this defendant was relieved from all liability as the supposed surety of Gisbert.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a second special defense, it is alleged that the supposed delay in the payment of the freight by the defendant Gisbert was due not only to the requirement made by the United States Shipping Board in connection with the additional security in cash in the sum of $40,000, but also to&nbsp; a prior agreement had&nbsp; between plaintiff and the defendant Gisbert, pending&nbsp; the&nbsp; arrangement&nbsp; with regard&nbsp; to the controversies between them&nbsp; on account of the $40,000 in the nature of&nbsp; a bond.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a third special defense, it is alleged that the expenses in connection with the repairs&nbsp; of the ship in the sum&nbsp; of P8,978.33 is not a legal&nbsp; claim&nbsp; and ought not to be charged&nbsp; against either Gisbert or this defendant.&nbsp; As a cross-complaint, the defendant alleges that about July 28, 1924, he deposited with the plaintiff the sum of P20,000, which was then and&nbsp; is now his property, which was&nbsp; the subject of a letter dated September 3,&nbsp; 1924, in&nbsp; which he demanded the&nbsp; return of the money, which&nbsp; was refused, and he prays for&nbsp; judgment absolving him from all liability as surety,&nbsp; and that he is entitled to the possession and&nbsp; return of the&nbsp; P20,000.<br><br>In October, 1925, Ruiz,&nbsp; Rementeria &amp; Co., Ltd., filed a bill of&nbsp; intervention in which it is&nbsp; alleged that&nbsp; in June, 1924, the defendant, now&nbsp; the plaintiff, was the&nbsp; owner of the ship in question, and that the defendant Gisbert was the captain, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; this plaintiff was the owner of a grocery store&nbsp; in the City of Manila; that on June 27, 1924, the defendant Gisbert, as&nbsp; captain and master of the vessel, bought on credit&nbsp; from the intervenor provisions for the vessel of the&nbsp; value of&nbsp; P316.10, the amount of which has never been paid, and it prays for corresponding judgment, with costs.<br><br>After the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; was taken&nbsp; upon&nbsp; such issues, the lower court rendered judgment against the defendant Juan Gisbert, as principal, and the&nbsp; defendant Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero, as&nbsp; surety, and in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiff for the sum&nbsp; of P7,232.50, with legal interest from&nbsp; October 29,&nbsp; 1924, and against the defendant Gisbert, and in favor of Ruiz, Rementeria&nbsp; &amp; Co. for the sum of P316.10, and that the plaintiff should return to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Caballero&nbsp; the ?20,000 in question, after deducting&nbsp; therefrom&nbsp; the&nbsp; P7,232.50 and interest.<br><br>From that judgment, all parties appeal, and in it's appeal, the&nbsp; plaintiff assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote>"The trial court erred:<br><br>"1.&nbsp; In rendering judgment&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff- appellant for charter hire&nbsp; and insurance premiums upon the&nbsp; vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Farmingdale</span>,&nbsp; in the sum of P7,232.50 covering one month only, instead of P22,339.94, P19,264.93 for charter hire and P3,075.01 for insurance premiums for three&nbsp; months and&nbsp; two days covering the period&nbsp; July 16, 1924,&nbsp; to&nbsp; October&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1924, the date&nbsp; of the sale of&nbsp; the vessel, three months and eleven&nbsp; days, less nine days allowance for the period the vessel was undergoing repair.<br><br>"2.&nbsp; In&nbsp; not rendering judgment in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; plaintiff- appellant for the&nbsp; sum of P8,978,33, the costs of repairs made to the vessel by the owner.<br><br>"3.&nbsp; In&nbsp; not rendering judgment in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant for the&nbsp; sum of P910.72 expenses of returning the vessel to Olongapo; P44 for rent of signal apparatus; P79.76 for customs charges; P200 for equipment used by defendants; P2,491.44 for fuel oil&nbsp; used by&nbsp; defendants, all of which items the court erroneously found were&nbsp; not covered by the stipulation of facts although the same were fully set forth in the statement of account Exhibit C which was admitted by&nbsp; the parties in&nbsp; open court to be corrected as appears on page 5 of the transcript&nbsp; of the stenographic notes of the&nbsp; trial.<br><br>"4. In rendering judgment in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Ricardo Caballero&nbsp; for&nbsp; the return of a portion of the cash deposit made by him to guarantee the performance of the terms of said charter party.<br><br>"5. In not&nbsp; rendering judgment in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant for the sum of P34,944.19 and the application of the entire amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; deposit of P20,000 in partial satisfaction thereof.<br><br>"6. In denying plaintiff-appellant's motion&nbsp; for a&nbsp; new trial.<br></blockquote>The defendant Gisbert assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote>"I. The court below erred in not admitting the special defense and counter-claim of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Juan Gisbert against the defendant Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero for the sum of P1,500, the value of his salaries as&nbsp; captain of the steamship<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lake Farmingdale</span>, corresponding to the months of July and August, and a monthly pay for the month of September, 1924.<br><br>"II. The lower court erred&nbsp; in not finding that the&nbsp; real charter of the steamship <span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Farmngdale </span>was the defendant Ricardo Caballero."<br></blockquote>The defendant Caballero assigns the following&nbsp; errors:<br><blockquote>"1. The lower court erred in admitting over the objection of appellant Ricardo Caballero Exhibit B&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States of America.<br><br>"2. The lower court erred in admitting over the objection of Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero the testimony of Juan&nbsp; Gisbert in relation to the existence of a bond or undertaking which had deference to Ricardo Caballero.<br><br>"3. The lower court erred in finding that the undertaking for the sum of $10,000 subscribed&nbsp; by the Philippine Guaranty Company&nbsp; on June 26, 1924, to guarantee the faithful performance by Juan Gisbert&nbsp; of his obligations under the terms&nbsp; of the charter party was substituted by&nbsp; the cash deposit made by Ricardo Caballero.<br><br>"4. The lower court erred in finding that Ricardo Caballero assumed the obligations of a surety to&nbsp; the full extent of his&nbsp; cash deposit from the moment the said Ricardo Caballero made said cash deposit of P20,000, and in holding him&nbsp; liable as surety for&nbsp; Juan Gisbert. <br><br>"5. The lower court erred in&nbsp; not finding&nbsp; Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero&nbsp; entitled to the&nbsp; full amount of P20,000&nbsp; instead of adjudicating the said sum of&nbsp; P20,000 less&nbsp; the. amount awarded to the plaintiff entity.<br><br>"6. The lower court erred in sentencing Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero, as surety, to pay the sum of P7,232.50 with legal interest thereon from October 29,1924, to the United&nbsp; States of America.<br><br>"7. The lower court erred in not finding that there had been a novation of the contract of charter party between the United States&nbsp; of America and&nbsp; Juan Gisbert sufficient under&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; to release Ricardo Caballero as alleged bondsman even granting&nbsp; but not conceding that he had assumed responsibility as surety for the charterer.<br><br>"8. The lower court&nbsp; erred in not finding that the alleged delay on the part&nbsp; of Juan Gisbert&nbsp; in the payment of the monthly rental was due to a previous arrangement between the owner of the vessel and the charterer thereof, in&nbsp; consequence of which Caballero was relieved from responsibility under a contract of suretyship which we shall assume to have existed.<br><br>"9. The lower court erred in not finding that at the time of the&nbsp; alleged violation of the terms of the charter-party by Juan Gisbert, Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero had not yet made the cash deposit of P20,000 and&nbsp; consequently should not&nbsp; be held answerable for Gisbert's default even were we to grant for the sake&nbsp; of argument&nbsp; that Caballero actually assumed the obligations of&nbsp; a surety."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; intervenor-appellant contends that the lower court erred in not sentencing the plaintiff as owner of the&nbsp; vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Farmingdale</span> and the defendant Juan Gisbert to pay jointly and severally the sum of P316.10, the value&nbsp; of the merchandise&nbsp; furnished the vessel.<br><br>JOHNS, J.: <br><br>The&nbsp; Bareboat Charter, known in the&nbsp; record as Exhibit A, was duly executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff and&nbsp; the defendant Juan Gisbert.<br><br>Among other&nbsp; things, it&nbsp; provides that the steamer shall be delivered at the port of Olongapo, fully equipped in every respect, and in good running order; that it shall be surveyed before delivery,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on its redelivery to determine its condition, and&nbsp; that the cost of such survey&nbsp; on delivery shall be paid for by Gisbert, and that such cost of redelivery shall be paid by the plaintiff; that Gisbert shall pay all port charges, pilotages, and all other costs and expenses incident to the&nbsp; use&nbsp; and operation of the vessel, and at his own expense shall keep the vessel in&nbsp; good running&nbsp; order and in the same condition as when received, less reasonable wear and tear;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Gisbert shall pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff for the use of the steamer at&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate of P1.50 deadweight per ton per month, commencing from the date of its&nbsp; delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendants shall pay for all&nbsp; fuel and consumable stores&nbsp; on board the ship at the time of the delivery, and the plaintiff shall accept and pay for such fuel and stores left on board at&nbsp; the time of redelivery at current market prices&nbsp; at the ports of delivery and redelivery.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant shall have the use of all outfit, equipment and appliances now on board without extra cost, with the exception of the submarine signal apparatus, blinker lights, and radio equipment, which shall be returned to the plaintiff on redelivery in as good&nbsp; a condition as when received, ordinary&nbsp; wear and&nbsp; tear excepted.&nbsp; A complete inventory of the steamer's&nbsp; equipment shall be taken and mutually&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; upon at the time of delivery, and a like inventory at the&nbsp; time of redelivery.<br><br>Clause 13 specifically provides that neither the defendant nor the master of the vessel "shall have any right, power, or authority to create, incur, or&nbsp; permit to be imposed upon the steamer any&nbsp; liens&nbsp; whatsoever except for crew's wages and salvage;" that the charterer shall carry a certified copy of this contract in the ship or vessel, subject&nbsp; to inspection by any person having business with the steamer, and further that a notice that the steamer is the property of the Government and is not subject to liens, shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; posted in a conspicuous place.<br><br>Among other things, clause 18 provides:<br><blockquote>"The charterer shall, at its own expense, fully insure the steamer&nbsp; for owners'&nbsp; account&nbsp; with the Marine Insurance Department,&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; Shipping&nbsp; Board&nbsp; Emergency Fleet Corporation, under the form of policy attached hereto and made a part hereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner and/or insurer shall not have any right&nbsp; of recovery or subrogation&nbsp; against the charterer on account of loss of or any damage to the vessel or her machinery or appurtenances covered by&nbsp; such insurance, or&nbsp; on account of payments made to discharge claims against or liabilities of the vessel or owner covered by such insurance.—Charterer to&nbsp; pay owner premium at rate of four per&nbsp; cent for six&nbsp; months.<br><br>"The charterer&nbsp; shall,&nbsp; at its&nbsp; own expenses, enter&nbsp; the steamer&nbsp; in the American&nbsp; Steamship Owner's Mutual Protection &amp; Indemnity Association, Inc., and the cover under this association shall&nbsp; be made available to the&nbsp; owner,&nbsp; and the charterer&nbsp; shall&nbsp; furnish to the owner&nbsp; proper evidence of such&nbsp; entries immediately upon the signing&nbsp; of this charter."<br></blockquote>It is also provided&nbsp; that at&nbsp; the expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the charter period, the vessel shall be redelivered to the owner at Olongapo where it was&nbsp; received,&nbsp; or at Manila at the&nbsp; owner's option, in as good order and&nbsp; condition as when&nbsp; received, ordinary wear and&nbsp; tear excepted.<br><br>Clause 24 provides&nbsp; that the submarine signal apparatus, blinker lights&nbsp; and radio equipment, if any,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be kept and maintained by the defendant Gisbert who assumes all the obligations of the plaintiff under any of its contracts in connection&nbsp; therewith.<br><br>Clause 26 provides:<br><blockquote>"The charterer shall furnish, before&nbsp; delivery&nbsp; of steamer, a bond in the sum of&nbsp; ten thousand dollars ($10,000) guaranteeing&nbsp; full&nbsp; performance of its&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; under&nbsp; this Charter."<br></blockquote>Clause 30, among other things, provides that:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; "If at any time after the delivery of the said&nbsp; steamer to the&nbsp; charterer&nbsp; hereunder, the&nbsp; charterer&nbsp; shall&nbsp; fail to perform any&nbsp; of its duties&nbsp; or&nbsp; obligations or shall violate any of the. prohibitions imposed upon it under this charter," that the owner may, without prejudice to any&nbsp; of its legal rights,&nbsp; "withdraw and retake&nbsp; the&nbsp; said steamer, wherever the same may be&nbsp; found."<br></blockquote>The vessel&nbsp; was delivered to Gisbert on&nbsp; June 16, 1924, at 6 a. m., and plaintiff seeks to recover rental&nbsp; for&nbsp; the period&nbsp; of four&nbsp; months and eleven and one-fourth days at P1,50 per deadweight ton per month.<br><br>June 28,&nbsp; 1924,&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; Gisbert&nbsp; notified R.&nbsp; C. Morton, the local agent of the U. S.&nbsp; Shipping Board, that he was going to take the vessel to Saigon, and that "I am sorry that I depart without having terminated the P. &amp; I. Insurance, but I&nbsp; believe that before my return the P. &amp; I, Insurance will be fully settled."&nbsp; That letter refers to clause 18 of the charter-party contract.<br><br>The evidence shows that Gisbert never complied with that clause of the contract, and that after&nbsp; some negotiations in which he failed to satisfy the authorities as to the insurance, on August 6, the U. S. Shipping Board at Washington cabled its local agent Morton&nbsp; that, in. view of the failure of the charterer to meet the charter condition with respect to P, &amp;. I. Insurance, the contract is cancelled, and that redelivery of the vessel should&nbsp; be&nbsp; taken.&nbsp; On the strength of that cable, cancelling the contract,&nbsp; redelivery of the vessel was&nbsp; taken on August 16, 1924.<br><br>The plaintiff having elected to cancel&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; and to take the&nbsp; redelivery of the&nbsp; vessel, it is&nbsp; now estopped to claim or assert that the contract&nbsp; was thereafter in force, or to collect rental from the date of redelivery.<br><br>In plaintiff's&nbsp; Exhibit C, there&nbsp; is an&nbsp; item&nbsp; of P44&nbsp; for submarine rental.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also a claim&nbsp; for P8,978.33 for repairs made on the vessel at Cavite.&nbsp; For 1,078.3 barrels of fuel oil at P4.20 per barrel amounting to P4,528.86.&nbsp;&nbsp; For equipment found missing after rechecking P200.&nbsp; For inspector and guard service and pier charges P79.76.&nbsp; For expense of&nbsp; returning the ship to&nbsp; Olongapo after its redelivery amounting to P910.72.<br><br>We are clearly of the opinion that the amount of P8,978.33 claimed for repairs ought not to be allowed.&nbsp; Such repairs were made on and between June 16 and 24, inclusive.&nbsp; That is to say,&nbsp; immediately after the vessel was delivered&nbsp; to Gisbert,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that he never made any actual use of the vessel&nbsp; until after the repairs&nbsp; were made, and under the terms of the contract, it was to be seaworthy and in good condition.&nbsp; All of the above-mentioned items are covered by, and included in, the contract, and are&nbsp; a&nbsp; valid claim against Gisbert.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is to say, Gisbert should be charged with the rental of the vessel from June 16,&nbsp; 1924, to August 16, 1924, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; price&nbsp; amounting to P12,465, and the&nbsp; items&nbsp; of P44, P4,528.86,&nbsp; P200, P79.76, P910.72,&nbsp; to which should be added P2,000 for insurance during the life of the contract,&nbsp; making&nbsp; the total amount for which he is liable of&nbsp; P19,958.34.&nbsp; It further appears from Exhibit C that defendant is given and should have&nbsp; credit for the following items:&nbsp; Cash&nbsp; paid on&nbsp; account of charter&nbsp; hire, June 14, P6,232.50; insurance paid to the plaintiff P1,000; time allowance for repairs made on the vessel from June 16&nbsp; to June 24,&nbsp; inclusive,&nbsp; P1,869.75;&nbsp; corresponding rate on insurance during the period of&nbsp; repairs&nbsp; P299.99; credit for fuel&nbsp; oil&nbsp; returned 485.1&nbsp; barrels at P4.20&nbsp; per barrel, P2,037.42, making a total credit to be allowed the defendant from plaintiff's own Exhibit C of P11,439.66.&nbsp; Thus leaving a balance due and owing the plaintiff from Gisbert at the time of the redelivery of the vessel on August 16, of P8,518.66.<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; Cabailero claims that he is exempt from all liability.&nbsp; That he never signed any bond or any writing in and by which he assumed or agreed to pay any amount found due or owing the plaintiff from the defendant Gisbert under the charter contract.&nbsp; As&nbsp; stated, at the time it was signed,&nbsp; a surety bond for $10,000 was given under section 26 of the contract,&nbsp; which provides that the charterer shall furnish&nbsp; before&nbsp; delivery of&nbsp; the&nbsp; steamer a&nbsp; bond&nbsp; in that amount&nbsp; "guaranteeing full performance of its obligations under this&nbsp; charter."<br><br>It appears that the surety bond was given and&nbsp; surrendered on July 28, at which time Caballero turned over and delivered-to the plaintiff P20,000&nbsp; in&nbsp; cash "to take the place of bond dated June 16,&nbsp; 1924, issued by the Philippine Guaranty Company to cover the faithful&nbsp; performance of all terms and conditions of&nbsp; charter party dated June 16, 1924," and&nbsp; for which a&nbsp; corresponding receipt was issued and delivered to Caballero, known in the record as Exhibit B, which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Received from Mr. Ricardo Caballero the sum of twenty thousand pesos (P20,000)&nbsp; to take the place of bond dated June 16, 1924, issued by the Philippine Guaranty Company to cover the faithful performance of all terms and conditions of charter&nbsp; party dated June&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1924, between the United States Shipping&nbsp; Board and Capt.&nbsp; Juan Gisbert for the bareboat charter of the S. S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Lake Farmingdale</span>&nbsp; for six months&nbsp; from date of&nbsp; charter."<br></blockquote>It will be noted that in the instant case, plaintiff is not seeking to enforce liability on any bond against the defendant Caballero.&nbsp; What it asks for is to apply from and out of the P20,000, which was&nbsp; delivered to it&nbsp; by&nbsp; Caballero, and which is now&nbsp; in its&nbsp; possession, to the&nbsp; payment and satisfaction of the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; found&nbsp; due and&nbsp; owing from Gisbert to&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is not claimed that Caballero ever signed any bond, or that he is liable on a bond.&nbsp; The sole purpose and intent of the delivery of the P20,000 in cash to&nbsp; the plaintiff was to dispense with, and to take the place of, the bond, and in legal effect that is what it did.<br><br>It appears from Morton's receipt, which was delivered to, and accepted by, Caballero, that the P20,000 was to take the place of the bond, and that it was "to cover the faithful performance of all terms and conditions of charter party dated June 16, 1924."<br><br>Plaintiff now seeks to apply the money in its actual possession in payment of the damages which it has sustained by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; breach and the failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; keep and perform those conditions.&nbsp; Having paid over and parted with his money&nbsp; for that specific purpose, and having accepted the receipt for the money, specifying that purpose, the defendant&nbsp; Caballero is&nbsp; now&nbsp; estopped to claim or assert that he paid over the money for that specific purpose.<br><br>We are clearly of the opinion that the&nbsp; plaintiff is entitled to take and&nbsp; apply from the money now in its&nbsp; possession the full amount of its&nbsp; claim against the&nbsp; defendant Gisbert.<br><br>As to the intervenor, we also agree with the trial court.<br><br>The vessel in question was a Government owned vessel, and it was operated under a lease which specifically provides that it shall be kept free and clear of all charges or liens, except for crew's wages and salvage, and that a notice of that fact should be&nbsp; kept posted in a conspicuous place on the vessel, and that at all times the charterer should keep a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; the charter-party among the ship's papers&nbsp; for the&nbsp; inspection of&nbsp; any one dealing with the ship.&nbsp; Under such conditions, the vessel being owned by the U. S. Government, neither the plaintiff nor the ship is liable for supplies in the nature of groceries purchased by the captain for the use of the ship.<br><br>There is no merit&nbsp; in the appeal of the defendant Gisbert.<br><br>The judgment of the lower court will be modified, and&nbsp; one will be entered here in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiff and against. the defendants Juan Gisbert&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ricardo&nbsp; Caballero,&nbsp; the former as principal obligor, and the latter as surety, for the sum of P8,518.66, with legal interest from October 29,1924, and&nbsp; after the satisfaction of such&nbsp; judgment, the plaintiff is ordered to&nbsp; return to the defendant Caballero any amount which may be left remaining of the P20,000, as&nbsp; evidenced by its receipt of&nbsp; July 28,&nbsp; 1924.&nbsp; In all&nbsp; other respects, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed,&nbsp; without costs to either party on this appeal.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C.
