				<BR><STRONG>STREET, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal has been brought to reverse a judgment of the Court of First 
Instance of the Province of Pampanga, finding the appellant, Pablo Ocampo, 
guilty of the offence of homicide, committed on June 19, 1920, in the 
municipality of Macabebe, Province of Pampanga, upon the person of Liborio 
Bustos, and sentencing the appellant to undergo imprisonment for seventeen 
years, four months and one day, <i>reclusion temporal</i>, with the accessories 
prescribed in article 59 of the Penal Code; to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased in the sum of P1,000; and to pay the costs of prosecution.
<p>This case, though forming an independent proceeding exclusively against the 
present appellant, is nevertheless intimately related with People <i>vs</i>. 
Bustos et al., p. 9, <i>ante</i>, in which nine other persons were jointly 
prosecuted for the same homicide; and the Attorney-General of the Philippine 
Islands, after carefully going over the proof in the present case and 
considering the same in relation with the proof contained in G. R. No. 17763, 
recommends that the judgment entered in the present case against Pablo Ocampo be 
reversed and that he be acquitted. This is without doubt the proper disposition 
to be made of the case, and this result follows as a necessary consequence from 
the resolution reached by us in the case against Proceso Bustos et al. (G. R. 
No. 17763).</p>
<p>How the present appellant happened to be convicted in the lower court in the 
case before us requires certain explanation, which can be given in a few words. 
To begin with, this appellant is evidently without means and not capable from 
any resources of his own of maintaining a legal battle on equal terms with the 
powerful forces that were arrayed against him. From the beginning his attorney 
in the trial court seems to have realized that the proof submitted for the 
prosecution in the case against Proceso Bustos et al. (G. R. No. 17763) 
constituted the chief basis of any defence to be made by Pablo Ocampo in this 
case; and after the case against Proceso Bustos et al. had been appealed to this 
court, a petition was addressed to us in behalf of the present appellant, asking 
us to permit that record to be withdrawn from the Supreme Court for the purpose 
of being used as evidence for Ocampo in this case. In this connection it was 
made to appear that the petitioner was poor and completely without means to pay 
the cost of a certified copy. For obvious reasons this court was compelled to 
deny that petition.</p>
<p>When the cause came on to be heard in the lower court the prosecution 
presented a string of witnesses, consisting of peddlers and cockpit habitues, 
mostly repeaters from the other trial, who pretended to have seen Ocampo 
assassinate Liborio Bustos. To these were added a number of other witnesses, who 
had also for the most part already testified in the other case, and whose 
testimony was directed mainly to two points, namely, to show, first, that the 
homicide hnd not been committed at the place where the disturbance arose in the 
circus, and hence could not have been committed by Proceso Bustos, and, 
secondly, that Pablo Ocampo had a petty grievance against Liborio Bustos arising 
from the failure of the latter to pay certain wages due to the former.</p>
<p>After the prosecution had closed its case, the attorney for the accused 
offered in evidence the complete record in People <i>vs</i>. Bustos et al. (G. 
R. No. 17763) for the purpose merely of showing, so the attorney informed the 
court, that six of the accused in that case had been convicted of the same 
homicide. Apart from this, no evidence in chief was submitted in behalf of the 
defence. Ocampo himself was not even called upon to testify in his own behalf; 
and not a single one of the important witnesses who had testified in the other 
case was examined upon facts touching the killing of Liborio Bustos by Proceso 
Bustos.</p>
<p>From this it will be seen that the defence in the present case was allowed in 
effect to go by default; and the sole hope of the accused must have been that in 
appraising the proof for the prosecution in this case the trial court would 
somehow or other take into account the proof that had been accumulated in the 
case against Proceso Bustos et al.</p>
<p>It so happened, however, that the judge who tried the present case was a 
different judge from the one who had presided in the other trial; and hence the 
judge who tried the case against Ocampo was not familiar with the facts revealed 
in the earlier case. Furthermore, in view of the limited purpose for which the 
record in the earlier case had been submitted as proof herein, the judge who 
heard this cause below did not consider himself at liberty to go fully into the 
facts as revealed in the other record for the purpose of balancing the 
probabilities of the guilt of the accused in the respective cases; and he, 
therefore, in passing judgment limited himself to the testimony presented in 
court in this case.</p>
<p>This made a foregone conclusion against the appellant, Pablo Ocampo, because 
no witnesses had been placed upon the stand by his attorney, except in rebuttal 
of minor matters brought out by the prosecution; and, if the testimony of the 
accusing witnesses was to be accepted at its face value, there could be no doubt 
as to the appellant's guilt. Judgment was therefore entered against him almost 
as a matter of course.</p>
<p>When the case reached this court, the Attorney-General, evidently 
appreciating the fact that vital interests of justice were at stake, considered 
the case against Ocampo in the light of all the proof revealed in both records; 
and conceding to this appellant the benefit of the proof contained in the record 
against Proceso Bustos and others, the Attorney-General recommended that Pablo 
Ocampo be acquitted, as intimated at the beginning of this opinion. This was 
undoubtedly the proper course to pursue under the circumstances of the case, as 
this court could not possibly permit a judgment to stand against a person whom 
it knows to be innocent, regardless of the technical condition of the record. In 
other words, we concede to the present appellant the benefit of the demonstrated 
facts appearing of record in the prosecution against Bustos et al. although the 
proof in that case was not technically submitted to the lower court as proof for 
all purposes.</p>
<p>So much having been said by way of preface, we proceed to pass a few words of 
comment upon the additional proof incorporated in this record showing, or 
tending to show, that Pablo Ocampo killed Liborio Bustos; and it must be 
understood that what is now to be said is merely supplemental to the discussion 
contained in our opinion in People vs. Bustos et al. (G. R. No. 17763). In other 
words we shall not pause here to demonstrate again the perjuries which we 
attributed in that opinion to certain witnesses who have merely repeated in this 
record the testimony given by them in that case.</p>
<p>The outstanding fact in the present record, so far as relates to proof of the 
prosecution, is that two additional witnesses have been introduced who pretend 
to have been eyewitnesses to the killing of Liborio Bustos by Pablo Ocampo. 
These are Juan Tuiud and Pedro San Agustin. These two personalities are about on 
a level, as regards character and antecedents, with the others who, as witnesses 
for the defence, testified to the same effect in the case against Proceso Bustos 
and his companions; for Juan Tuiud admits that he is an habitue of the cockpit, 
and Pedro San Agustin is a peddler by trade. Both of these persons were procured 
to act as witnesses by Francisco Isip, an uncle of Proceso Bustos, who is the 
same person who procured Honorio Garcia and Fausto Navarro, who first appeared 
as witnesses in the other case after the judgment of conviction had been there 
entered against six of the accused.</p>
<p>Both of the two witnesses to whom reference is now made, namely, Tulud and 
San Agustin, admit that they had never communicated the information which they 
possess with reference to the homicide to any person prior to the time when they 
casually let it out in the presence of the other two and within hearing of Isip. 
The reason they gave for this reticence is that they believed, from rumors 
current in Macabebe, that any person communicating facts relative to the 
homicide to the public officers investigating the case would be joined in the 
prosecution as an accused; and Juan Tulud even pretends that Roman Bondoc was 
actually joined as a defendant in the other case because he had inadvertently 
told something that he knew about the homicide. This story is of course only a 
repetition of the excuse given by their companion witnesses who testified upon 
the same point in the other case.</p>
<p>A noteworthy fact connected with the testimony of Juan Tulud and Pedro San 
Agustin is that, when the disturbance arose in the circus on the night of June 
19, 1920, both of these witnesses were admittedly on the outside of the tent. 
Tulud says that, having heard some one say that there had been a disturbance in 
the circus, he started to go in to get a grandson who was in the general 
admission. When he arrived at the door on his way in he saw Liborio Bustos 
coming out, and at the same instant he saw Pablo Ocampo strike Liborio Bustos 
with a big knife just as had been described by other witnesses. Pedro San 
Agustin also states that he was on the outside of the circus but was preparing 
to go in when he saw Ocampo deliver the fatal blow in the way described by other 
witnesses.</p>
<p>As both these witnesses place the scene of the tragedy immediately at the 
entrance to the circus, as seen by a person coming from without, their testimony 
is in harmony with the revised version of the proof relative to this act as 
fixed by Garcia and Navarro as witnesses for the defence in the case against 
Proceso Bustos and his companions; for it will be remembered that the first 
three witnesses who there testified about this matter (Laquindanum, Manansala, 
and Cunanan) placed the scene of tragedy well within the tent.</p>
<p>Again, according to the two witnesses whose testimony is now being 
considered, as well as others whose testimony is discussed in the earlier 
opinion, no commotion was made by this assault upon Liborio Bustos by Pablo 
Ocampo at the entrance to the circus door; and apart from certain exclamations 
which the witnesses put in the mouth of Ocampo and Liborio Bustos respectively, 
the tranquillity of the departure of Liborio Bustos from the tent was not marred 
by the slightest commotion.</p>
<p>In the present record, therefore, we have a string of seven witnesses who 
pretend to have seen Ocampo kill Liborio Bustos. These persons pertain without 
exception to an irresponsible class, or classes, of people from whose ranks 
perjurers might most readily be recruited, namely, peddlers and cockpit 
habitues. Furthermore, we have shown, in our opinion in the other case, that at 
least two of these individuals (Laquindanum and Navarro) were not present at the 
circus on the night of the homicide; and in the present record Felicisimo Bustos 
corroborates the proof on this point as to Navarro. Again, it will be noted that 
the two additional witnesses brought before the court in this case, who pretend 
to have seen Ocampo kill Liborio Bustos, admit that they were not among the 
spectators in the circus when the trouble arose, but were both then on the 
streets of Macabebe. In the light of these and other facts more fully brought 
out in our other opinion the falsity of the present charge against Pablo Ocampo, 
which supposes him to be the actual slayer of Liborio Bustos, is most manifest; 
and the only proper interpretation which a court can place upon evidence of this 
character is that the witnesses are mechanical perjurers, who have been induced 
to tell this impossible story in order to wreck the prosecution against Proceso 
Bustos and his companions.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect of the case which requires a brief discussion. It 
will be remembered that, according to the story told in the other case by Pablo 
Ocampo himself, a conspiracy had been formed, with Proceso Bustos at its head, 
to take the lives of Liborio Bustos and Aureliano Dizon. Pablo Ocampo further 
admits, though with reservation as to his moral guilt, that he had participated 
in the principal conference at which the death of the two persons mentioned had 
been determined; and he admits that he went with the conspirators to the circus 
on the occasion when he knew the homicides were designed to be committed and 
that he himself had been deputed to slay one of the victims. The qualification 
which he makes as to his participation in the conspiracy is that his 
participation was external only, and that he had no intention whatever at any 
time of carrying out his part of the murderous compact. In other words, in 
testifying as a witness for the prosecution in the other case, Pablo Ocampo came 
very near to establishing his own guilty participation in the crime, though not 
in the role of slayer; and it must be admitted in his favor that he abstained 
from making the assault upon Aureliano Dizon, which had been assigned to 
him.</p>
<p>The most plausible case that could be imagined against Pablo Ocampo would be 
one in which he would appear as one of several conspirators, with Proceso Bustos 
at the head. But this is not the theory of the present prosecution. As the case 
against Ocampo is here presented, he is guilty as the sole slayer of Liborio 
Bustos, or he is not guilty at all. There is not before us in this case a line 
of proof that would tend to show complicity on his part in a conspiracy promoted 
by another; and when the proof tending to exhibit him in the role of actual 
slayer is eliminated from the record, there is nothing to show his connection 
with the crime in any way. It goes without saying that the prosecution in this 
case did not introduce in evidence against Ocampo the admissions which he had 
made on the stand as a witness in the other case, tending to show his complicity 
in a conspiracy, promoted by Proceso Bustos, to take the lives of Liborio Bustos 
and Aureliano Dizon. It results that it is necessary to acquit Ocampo because of 
demonstrated falsity of the testimony of those witnesses who pretend that he was 
the actual slayer of Liborio Bustos and the total failure of the proof to show 
complicity in any other character.</p>
<p>From what has been said it follows that the judgment in this case must be 
reversed, and the defendant will be absolved from the complaint. So ordered, 
with costs of both instances <i>de oficio</i>.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Malcolm, 
Avanceña, Villamor,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>JOHNS, J.:</strong></p>
<p>This is a companion case to the People <i>vs</i>. Bustos et al., p. 9, 
<i>ante</i>, in which the defendant here was convicted of committing the same 
crime as the defendants in People <i>vs</i>. Bustos.</p>
<p>The majority opinion of this court has found the defendants in the Bustos 
case guilty of the crime alleged to have been committed by Ocampo in this case; 
hence it follows that the majority opinion here has found Ocampo not guilty of 
the crime alleged.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court in the case of People <i>vs</i>. Bustos was 
rendered on April 29, 1921, and the case was then appealed to this court. 
Pending that appeal, an information was filed charging Ocampo with the 
commission of the same crime, upon which he was tried before his Honor, Judge E. 
P. Revilla, and on March 9, 1922, was found guilty as charged in the 
information; that is to say, his Honor, Judge Bartolome Revilla, found the 
defendants guilty in the Bustos case and thereafter his Honor, Judge E. P. 
Revilla, found the defendant Ocampo guilty of the same crime. That is a point 
worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>After the conviction in the Bustos case, the court, who saw and heard the 
witnesses testify in the Ocampo case and had before him the record in the Bustos 
case, found the defendant Ocampo guilty.</p>
<p>The majority opinion points out that after the prosecution had closed the 
Ocampo case, the attorney for the defendant offered the complete record in the 
case of People <em>vs</em>. Bustos to show that six of the accused in that case 
had been convicted of the same crime; that no other evidence was offered by the 
defense and that Ocampo himself did not testify, from which it is contended that 
no bona fide effort was made by his attorney to defend Ocampo. That is not 
tenable.</p>
<p>This court should not criticize the attorney for the defendant because he 
failed to call his client as a witness. For many and different reasons no good 
lawyer will ever call a guilty client as a witness. It is very probable that the 
acquittal of Ocampo by the majority opinion now is very largely due to the fact 
that he was not called as a witness in his own defense. The majority opinion 
says: "* * * if the testimony of the accusing witnesses was to be accepted at 
its face value, there could be no doubt as to the appellant's guilt." The trial 
court, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, did accept their testimony at 
its face value and there is no valid reason shown in the record why this court 
should not do the same thing. To justify its conviction in the Bustos case, the 
majority opinion in the instant case says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the cause came on to be heard in the lower court the prosecution 
presented a string of witnesses, consisting of peddlers and cockpit habitues, 
mostly repeaters from the other trial, who pretended to have seen Ocampo 
assassinate Liborio Bustos. To these were added a number of other witnesses, who 
had also for the most part already testified in the other case, and whose 
testimony was directed mainly to two points; namely, to show, first, that the 
homicide had not been committed at the place where the disturbance arose in the 
circus, and hence could not have been committed by Proceso Bustos, and, 
secondly, that Pablo Ocampo had a petty grievance against Liborio Bustos arising 
from the failure of the latter to pay certain wages due to the 
former."</p></blockquote>
<p>That statement is both unfair and unjust. The record shows that the witnesses 
for the prosecution in this case were:</p>
<p>Honorio Garcia, 42 years of age, cloth peddler.</p>
<p>Fausto Navarro, 43 years old, cloth peddler.</p>
<p>Dr. Monserrat, who testified that the incision of the wound was made by some 
person in front and to the left of the deceased.</p>
<p>Juan Tulud, 62 years old, owner of the cockpit.</p>
<p>Pedro San Agustin, 39 years old, cloth peddler.</p>
<p>Tomas Laquindanum, 40 years old, storekeeper.</p>
<p>Ciriaco Cunanan, 33 years old, merchant.</p>
<p>Jacinto Manansala, 45 years old, day laborer.</p>
<p>Fidel Dunca, 33 years old, cloth peddler, and his son Sergio Dunca, 17 years 
old.</p>
<p>Hilarion Viray, 77 years old, fisherman.</p>
<p>Francisco Isip, 61 years old, farmer.</p>
<p>Marcelo Bautista, 28 years old, landowner.</p>
<p>Juan Alfonso, 31 years old, landowner.</p>
<p>Celerio de Franco, 27 years old, physician.</p>
<p>Roman Bondoc, 27 years old, merchant.</p>
<p>Alejandro Ronquillo, 22 years old, laborer.</p>
<p>Tiburcio Manansala, 48 years old, laborer.</p>
<p>Aureliano Dizon, 53 years old, laborer.</p>
<p>Antonio Gomez, 45 years old, Constabulary captain.</p>
<p>Yet, the majority opinion says "that the prosecution presented a string of 
witnesses, consisting of peddlers and cockpit habitues, etc."</p>
<p>Again, it appears from the record that the defendant Ocampo, whom the trial 
court says was a poor man without friends, had just been released from Bilibid 
where he had served a long sentence for a serious crime, another fact which is 
overlooked in the majority opinion.</p>
<p>No attempt was made in the majority opinion to analyze the testimony for the 
prosecution, and a detailed analysis of it would not serve any useful purpose in 
the dissenting opinion. Suffice it to say that in the Ocampo case the trial 
court, who saw and heard the witnesses testify, had before it the complete 
record in the Bustos case and heard a large amount of testimony that was never 
introduced in the Bustos case, found the defendant guilty of the same crime 
about one year after the conviction in the Bustos case.</p>
<p>As I read and construe the record, Ocampo is the one who stabbed Liborio 
Bustos at or near the entrance to the theatre as he was leaving it and is guilty 
of the crime, and Liborio Bustos was not stabbed in the pit or body of the 
theatre as found by the majority opinion in the Bustos case.</p>Before leaving 
for the States, Mr. Justice Ostrand read and re-read the record in the instant 
case and, with me, was firmly convinced of the guilt of the defendant Ocampo in 
this case, and that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed.</div>
