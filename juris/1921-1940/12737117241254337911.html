				<H3>THE PHILIPPINE INDUSTRIAL CO., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. EL HOGAR FILIPINO AND SALVADOR VALLEJO, DEFENDANTS. EL HOGAR FILIPINO, APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The parties submitted this case to the trial court for decision upon a 
stipulation of facts, which is inserted in the judgment appealed from, and from 
which it appears that the defendant Salvador Vallejo executed a mortgage in 
favor of his codefendant, El Hogar Filipino, upon a certain real estate 
belonging to him, registered in the registry of property under the Torrens law. 
This mortgage contains a stipulation that the mortgagor cannot create any legal 
light upon the realty in favor of a third person, nor make, with regard to said 
realty, any contract of lease registerable under the law, or whereby a rental 
for more than one month is to be paid in advance, without obtaining the previous 
consent in writing of the association El Hogar Filipino. That same mortgage, 
moreover, contains a stipulation that in case the debt falls due for 
non-compliance, on the part of the debtor, with any of the obligations mentioned 
in the contract, the manager of the association El Hogar Filipino is authorized 
to proceed to the extrajudicial sale of the mortgaged property at public auction 
before a notary, or an auctioneer to be designated by the board of directors of 
the association, after publication of notice thereof in a newspaper of general 
circulation in this city, once a week for three consecutive weeks; the manager 
of the association being likewise authorized to execute, as agent of the 
borrower, the corresponding deed of sale in favor of the highest bidder who may 
present himself at the auction at the time and in the manner prescribed in the 
tenth clause of said contract.
<p>After said mortgage was noted as a lien and encumbrance on the certificate of 
title of the property mortgaged, a document was presented to the register of 
deeds whereby the debtor made a second mortgage in favor of the plaintiff 
corporation, the herein appellee. The register of deeds refused to register said 
second mortgage on the ground that it did not appear therein that the first 
mortgagee, El Hogar Filipino, ever consented to the registration, in accordance 
with the prohibiting clause of the mortgage previously recorded; and an 
administrative proceeding having been instituted against the action of the 
register of deeds, the trial court ruled that the validity or nullity of the 
prohibiting clause in question must be litigated in an ordinary action.</p>
<p>The first mortgage having fallen due, according to the terms thereof, El 
Hogar Filipino advertised the sale at public auction of the property mortgaged 
and the plaintiff then brought this action, wherein it is prayed that the 
prohibiting clause above mentioned be declared void, and a preliminary 
injunction issued against the defendants, El Hogar Filipino and Salvador 
Vallejo, their attorneys, agents and representatives and other persons acting on 
their behalf, commanding them to abstain from carrying out the advertised sale 
of the land in question.</p>
<p>The trial court, in view of the stipulation of facts, held that the 
prohibition to register the second mortgage executed by the defendant Salvador 
Vallejo is of no effect, and ordered the register of deeds of this city to 
register the same, and declared, furthermore, the preliminary injunction 
previously issued to be final.</p>
<p>From this judgment the defendant corporation, El Hogar Filipino, took an 
appeal and assigned in its brief, as errors of the trial court, the following: 
(1) The holding that the clause of the contract of mortgage wherein the debtor 
binds himself not to create any subsequent real right in favor of a third person 
is of no effect; (2) the finding as to the value of the property twice mortgaged 
when no evidence was introduced as to what its value was; (3) the pronouncement 
declaring the preliminary injunction final, whereby the foreclosure of the first 
mortgage is prevented, notwithstanding the fact that it was due; and (4) the 
failure to dismiss the complaint with the costs against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>In an old decision dated September 6, 1863, the supreme court of Spain held 
that when a contract, whereby a thing is specially mortgaged, contains the 
additional stipulation that the same should not be mortgaged for the second 
time, a stipulation which is not contrary to law, the new encumbrance being 
otherwise void, any other mortgage that may have been made upon the same 
property can have no effect. This doctrine, however, was modified by the 
Mortgage Law, which took effect in the Philippines on December 1, 1889, article 
107, No. 4, of which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 107. The following are mortgageable, but with such restrictions as are 
hereinafter expressed:</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"4. Property already mortgaged, even if it was agreed not to mortgage it 
again, provided the preference is reserved which the creditors in whose favor 
the prior mortgages are created have in the collection of their 
loans."</p></blockquote>
<p>Galindo and Escosura,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> commenting on 
this provision of the Mortgage Law which is the same as that in force in the 
Peninsula, say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Doubt may be entertained as to whether or not subsection 2 of paragraph 4 of 
article 107 is in force, which authorizes the mortgaging of a property already 
mortgaged, although the previous mortgage was executed with the stipulation that 
no subsequent mortgages should be made.</p>
<p>"In order to repeal our old civil law on this point which allowed said 
stipulation (decision of February 6, 1863), the committee took into account that 
'it is an onerous condition that should not have any binding civil effect, 
because it is devoid of any object, and unnecessarily, unjustly and without any 
possible reason whatsoever diminishes the territorial credit, and rather than a 
guaranty, it seems to be an exorbitant exaction made thru the painful situation 
in which the owner may be found in certain cases.' "</p></blockquote>
<p>After the promulgation of the Civil Code, which recognizes in its article 
1255 the absolute liberty of the contracting parties to make such stipulations 
as they may deem fit, provided that they are not contrary to law, morals and 
public order, there being no statute whatsoever prohibiting the stipulation in 
question and the same not being immoral nor contrary to public order, it seems 
that it must be given effect; but as article 1880 of the same Code provides that 
the form, operation and effect of mortgages, as well as all matters relating to 
their creation, modification and extinction and <i>all other matters</i> which 
have not been included in Chapter 3, Title 15, Book 4, wherein nothing is said 
as to said article 107, shall be subject to the provisions of the Mortgage Law, 
it seems clear that as article 107, No. 4, of the Mortgage Law in effect, 
restricts, to a certain extent, the liberty of the contracting parties to make 
such stipulations as they may deem fit, said stipulation not to make any second 
mortgage has no effect whatsoever under said article. It should be noted that 
the Mortgage Law does not declare void the stipulation prohibiting a second 
mortgage, but simply limits itself to permitting the registration of a second 
mortgage upon the mortgaged property, where the first mortgage contains such a 
stipulation. And it is for the purpose of giving effect to this legal provision 
that article 1880 of the same Code' declares that the form, operation and effect 
of mortgages are subject to the provisions of the Mortgage Law.</p>
<p>But in the instant case, said article 107 of the Mortgage Law has no 
application because this is a case of a property registered in accordance with 
the Torrens system prescribed by Act No. 496, section 124 of which provides that 
the system of registration established by the laws in force on the matter in the 
Philippine Islands should continue to be applicable to properties not registered 
in accordance with this law, with the modifications established therein. Nor can 
said article 1880 of the Civil Code, giving effect to the provisions of the 
Mortgage Law, be invoked. Therefore, the provision of article 1255 of the Civil 
Code remains in force, which gives the contracting parties absolute liberty to 
make such stipulations as they may deem fit, provided they are not contrary to 
law, morals and public order; and there being no, law whatsoever prohibiting the 
stipulation that no other mortgage should be made, and said stipulation not 
being immoral, nor contrary to public order, we are of the opinion that such a 
stipulation is valid and binding between the parties.</p>
<p>It is evident that the mortgagor may obtain subsequent loans by means of 
subsequent and successive mortgages of his property, but when the debtor 
voluntarily binds himself not to make any second mortgage without the consent of 
the mortgagee, we see no reason whatsoever why said debtor should not be bound 
to comply with all the conditions of the contract. As has been stated, article 
107, No. 4, of the Mortgage Law not being applicable, which expressly permits 
the registration of subsequent mortgages executed upon a real estate previously 
mortgaged under the Mortgage Law, even if there is a stipulation that no other 
mortgage should be made, there exists no law prohibiting such a stipulation and 
the debtor, having agreed not to make any second mortgage without the consent of 
the creditor, is bound thereby.</p>
<p>For all of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from must be, as is hereby, 
reversed, the complaint herein is dismissed and the preliminary injunction 
issued in this case is dissolved, without special finding as to costs in this 
instance. So ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Johnson, Avanceña,</i> and

<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>JOHNS, 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>The court has heretofore gone far, and I say it with regret, in sanctioning 
laws, pacts and clauses in documents intended to authorize unconscionable 
advantages for creditors in their dealings with debtors, the latter many times 
of the most ignorant class. It has reluctantly validated the iniquitous <i>pacto 
de retro</i>. (Cuyugan <i>vs</i>. Santos [1916], 34 Phil., 100.) It has, against 
the dissent of Justices Ostrand, Johns, and Malcolm, approved of private sales 
at the option of the Philippine National Bank. (National Bank <i>vs</i>. De Poli 
and Wise &amp; Co., 44 Phil., 763.) It has, against the dissent of Justices 
Johns and Malcolm, legalized, unconditionally, the power of sale in mortgages. 
(El Hogar Filipino <i>vs</i>. Paredes, R. G. No. 19843.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>) It has, against the dissent of Justices 
Street and Malcolm, permitted usurers to recover the principal of their loans. 
(Go Chioco <i>vs</i>. Martinez, R. G. No. 19684, and Ortiga Hermanos <i>vs</i>. 
Go Chioco, R. G. No. 19685.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>) And now, 
carried along on the same current of authority, against the views of competent 
judges of First Instance and to the detriment of the poorer strata of the 
community, the court confirms clauses in a mortgage permitting of a private sale 
by the mortgagor and denying to the mortgagee the right further to mortgage his 
property. Although my dissent in similar cases has been of little avail, and wiH 
again be of little weight, I feel it my duty to register my nonconformity.</p>
<p>The senior mortgage accomplished by Salvador Vallejo, running in favor of El 
Hogar Filipino, contains two clauses reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Thirteenth</i>.—It is agreed and stipulated that the borrower cannot 
create any real right upon the mortgaged property in favor of a third party, nor 
make, with regard to said realty, any contract of lease registerable in 
accordance with law, or that the amount of rents for more than one month be paid 
in advance, without previously obtaining the written consent of the partnership; 
provided that any breach of the agreement contained in this clause will cause 
the debt to become due at once and the partnership will have the right to 
proceed with the collection thereof in the manner provided in the tenth clause 
hereof.</p>
<p>"<i>Tenth</i>.—The borrower does hereby give and grant the manager of the 
partnership sufficient and irrevocable power in case the debt hereby 
acknowledged becomes due by reason of the borrower having failed to fulfill any 
of the obligations mentioned in the second, fourth, fifth, eleventh, twelfth, 
<i>thirteenth</i>, sixteenth, seventeenth and twentieth clauses hereof, and upon 
a resolution being adopted by the Board of Directors declaring that the 
partnership has elected to exercise its right to consider the debt of the 
borrower to. have fallen due, and after publication of notices in a newspaper of 
general circulation in this city, once a week during three successive weeks, to 
proceed to sell extrajudicially and at public auction before a notary or an 
auctioneer to be designated by the Board of Directors the realty hereby 
mortgaged and the manager of the partnership acting at the time is likewise 
authorized and given the irrevocable power to execute, as agent of the borrower, 
the proper deed of sale in favor of the highest bidder, provided, however, that 
said deed of sale shall not be executed except after the expiration of the 
period of thirty days from the date of the auction and, provided further, that 
if within the said period of thirty days from the date of the auction, the 
borrower shall pay to the partnership the total amount of his debt at that time, 
plus the interest due and the expenses occasioned by the auction sale, less the 
withdrawing value of the shares, the auction sale shall become of no effect and 
the corresponding deed of cancellation of the mortgage hereby made shall be 
executed by the representative of the partnership, the expenses of the execution 
of the document of cancellation to be for the account of the 
borrower."</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial judge, the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, held the clauses above 
quoted invalid, and it is this decision which the court would now reverse.</p>
<p>Any contract which is contrary to law, morals or public policy is void. Any 
contract which takes property without due process of law is likewise void. The 
rights of the original mortgagee cannot be bartered away through an 
extrajudicial sale. The rights of subsequent mortgagees cannot legally be 
defeated by any arrangement between a prior mortgagee and the mortgagor, or by 
any adjudication of their respective rights. A junior mortgagee cannot be 
prejudiced in respect to. his security by an agreement of the debtor with the 
senior lienor to which he is no party. Such undue interference with the rights 
of ownership, such undue interference with the rights of creditors, such undue 
interference with the rights of third parties cannot be countenanced without 
violation of the most elementary principles of law and justice. (Civil Code, 
arts. 4, 1115, 1255; 8 Manresa, <i>Comentarios al Codigo Civil</i>, p. 574; 3 
Sanchez Roman, p. 807; 2 Jones on Mortgages, p. 125.)</p>I think sufficient has 
been said to show the legal and ethical utenability of the stand of the court, 
not alone in the instant case, but in a series of similar cases. I vote for the 
affirmance of the judgment.<br><br><br>
