				<H3>TECK SEING & CO., LTD., PETITIONER AND APPELLEE. SANTIAGO JO CHUNG CANG ET AL., PARTNERS, VS. PACIFIC COMMERCIAL COMPANY ET AL., CREDITORS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Following the presentation of an application to be adjudged an insolvent by 
the "Sociedad Mercantil, Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd.," the creditors, the Pacific 
Commercial Company, Piñol &amp; Company, Riu Hermanos, and W. H. Anderson &amp;. 
Company, filed a motion in which the Court was prayed to enter an order: "(A) 
Declaring the individual partners as described in paragraph 5 parties to this 
proceeding; (B) to require each of said partners to file an inventory of his 
property in the manner required by section 51 of Act No. 1956; and (C) that each 
of said partners be adjudicated insolvent debtors in this proceeding." The trial 
judge first granted the motion, but, subsequently, on opposition being renewed, 
denied it. It is from this last order that an appeal was taken in accordance 
with section 82 of the Insolvency Law.
<p>There has been laid before us for consideration and decision a question of 
some importance and of some intricacy. The issue in the case relates to a 
determination of the nature of the mercantile establishment which operated under 
the name of Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd., and this issue requires us to look into, 
and analyze, the document constituting Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd. It reads:</p>

<p>Proceeding by process of elimination, it is self-evident that Teck Seing 
&amp; Co., Ltd., is not a corporation. Neither is it contended by any one that 
Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd., is the accidental partnership denominated <i>cuenta 
en participacion</i> (joint account association).</p>
<p>Counsel for the petitioner and appellee described his client in one place in 
his opposition to the motion of the creditors, as "<i>una verdadera sociedad 
anonima</i>" (a true <i>sociedad anonima</i>). The provisions of the Code of 
Commerce relating to <i>sociedades anonimas</i> were, however, repealed by 
section 191 of the Corporation Law (Act No. 1459), with the exceptions that 
<i>sociedades anonimas</i> lawfully organized at the time of the passage of the 
Corporation Law were recognized, which is not our case.</p>
<p>The document providing for the partnership contract purported to form "<i>una 
sociedad mercantil limitada,</i>" and counsel for the petitioner's first 
contention was that Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd. was not "<i>una sociedad regular 
colectiva, ni siquiera comanditaria, sino una sociedad mercantil limitada.</i>" 
Let us see if the partnership contract created a "<i>sociedad en comandita,</i>" 
or, as it is known in English, and will hereafter be spoken of, "a limited 
partnership."</p>
<p>To establish a limited partnership there must be, at least, one general 
partner and the name of at least one of the general partners must appear in the 
firm name. (Code of Commerce, arts. 122 [2], 146, 148.) But neither of these 
requirements have been fulfilled. The general rule is, that those who seek to 
avail themselves of the protection of laws permitting the creation of limited 
partnerships must show a substantially full compliance with such laws. A limited 
partnership that has not complied with the law of its creation is not considered 
a limited partnership at all, but a general partnership in which all the members 
are liable. (Mechem, Elements of Partnership, p. 412; Gilmore, Partnership, pp. 
499, 595; 20 R. C. L., 1064.)</p>
<p>The contention of the creditors and appellants is that the partnership 
contract established a general partnership.</p>
<p>Article 125 of the Code of Commerce provides that the articles of general 
copartnership must state the names, surnames, and domiciles of the partners; the 
firm name; the names, and surnames of the partners to whom the management of the 
firm and the use of its signature is intrusted; the capital which each partner 
contributes in cash, credits, or property, stating the value given the latter or 
the basis on which their appraisement is to be made; the duration of the 
copartnership; and the amounts which, in a proper case, are to be given to each 
managing partner annually for his private expenses, while the succeeding article 
of the Code provides that the general copartnership must transact business under 
the name of all its members, of several of them, or of one only. Turning to the 
document before us, it will be noted that all of the requirements of the Code 
have been met, with the sole exception of that relating to the composition of 
the firm name. We leave consideration of this phase of the case for later 
discussion.</p>
<p>The remaining possibility is the revised contention of counsel for the 
petitioners to the effect that Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd. is "<i>una sociedad 
mercantil 'de facto' solamente</i>" (only a <i>de facto</i> commercial 
association), and that the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of 
Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs</i>. Kieng-Chiong-Seng [1906], 6 Phil., 498), is controlling. 
It was this argument which convinced the trial judge, who gave effect to his 
understanding of the case last cited and which here must be given serious 
attention.</p>
<p>The decision in Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs</i>. Kieng-Chiong-Seng, <i>supra</i>, 
discloses that the firm Kieng-Chiong-Seng was not organized by means of any 
public document; that the partnership had not been recorded in the mercantile 
registry; and that Kieng-Chiong-Seng was not proven to be the firm name, but 
rather the designation of the partnership. The conclusion then was, that the 
partnership in question was merely <i>de facto</i> and that, therefore, giving 
effect to the provisions of article 120 of the Code of Commerce, the right of 
action was against the persons in charge of the management of the 
association.</p>
<p>Laying the facts of the case of Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs</i>. Kieng-Chiong-Seng, 
<i>supra</i>, side by side with the facts before us, a marked difference is at 
once disclosed. In the cited case, the organization of the partnership was not 
evidenced by any public document; here, it is by a public document. In the cited 
case, the partnership naturally could not present a public instrument for record 
in the mercantile registry; here, the contract of partnership has been duly 
registered. But the two cases are similar in that the firm name failed to 
include the name of any of the partners.</p>
<p>We come then to the ultimate question, which is, whether we should follow the 
decision in Hung-Man-Yoc <i>vs</i>. Kieng-Chiong-Seng, <i>supra</i>, or whether 
we should differentiate the two cases, holding Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd., a 
general copartnership, notwithstanding the failure of the firm name to include 
the name of one of the partners. Let us now notice this decisive point in the 
case.</p>
<p>Article 119 of the Code of Commerce requires every commercial association 
before beginning its business to state its articles, agreements, and conditions 
in a public instrument, which shall be presented for record in the mercantile 
registry. Article 120, next following, provides that the persons in charge of 
the management of the association who violate the provisions of the foregoing 
article shall be responsible <i>in solidum</i> to the persons not members of the 
association with whom they may have transacted business in the name of the 
association. Applied to the facts before us, it would seem that Teck Seing &amp; 
Co., Ltd. has fulfilled the provisions of article 119. Moreover, to permit the 
creditors only to look to the person in charge of the management of the 
association, the partner Lim Yogsing, would not prove very helpful to them.</p>
<p>What is said in article 126 of the Code of Commerce relating to the general 
copartnership transacting business under the name of all its members' or of 
several of them or of one only, is wisely included in our commercial law. It 
would appear, however, that this provision was inserted more for the protection 
of the creditors than of the partners themselves. A distinction could well be 
drawn between the right of the alleged partnership to institute action when 
failing to live up to the provisions of the law, or even the rights of the 
partners as among themselves, and the right of a third person to hold 
responsible a general copartnership which merely lacks a legal firm name in 
order to make it a partnership <i>de jure</i>.</p>
<p>The civil law and the common law alike seem to point to a difference between 
the rights of the partners who have failed to comply with the law and the rights 
of third persons who have dealt with the partnership.</p>
<p>The supreme court of Spain has repeatedly held that notwithstanding the 
obligation of the members' to register the articles of association in the 
commercial registry, agreements containing all the essential requisites are 
valid as between the contracting parties, whatever the form adopted, and that, 
while the failure to register in the commercial registry necessarily precludes 
the members from enforcing rights acquired by them against third persons, such 
failure cannot prejudice the rights of third persons. (<i>See</i> decisions of 
December 6, 1887, January 25, 1888, November 10, 1890, and January 26, 1900.) 
The same reasoning would be applicable to the less formal requisite pertaining 
to the firm name.</p>
<p>The common law is to the same effect. The State of Michigan had a statute 
prohibiting the transaction of business under an assumed name or any other than 
the real name of the individual conducting the same, unless such person shall 
file with the county clerk a certificate setting forth the name under which the 
business is to be conducted and the real name of each of the partners, with 
their residences and post-office addresses, and making a violation thereof a 
misdemeanor. The Supreme Court of Michigan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The one object of the act is manifestly to protect the public against 
imposition and fraud, prohibiting persons from concealing their identity by 
doing business under an assumed name, making it unlawful to use other than their 
real names in transacting business without a public record of who they are, 
available for use in courts, and to punish those who violate the prohibition. 
The object of this act is not limited to facilitating the collection of debts, 
or the protection of those giving credit to persons doing business under an 
assumed name. It is not unilateral in its application. It applies to debtor and 
creditor, contractor and contractee, alike. Parties doing business with those 
acting under an assumed name, whether they buy or sell, have a right, under the 
law, to know who they are, and who to hold responsible, in case the question of 
damages for failure to perform or breach of warranty should arise.</p>
<p>"The general rule is well settled that, where statutes enacted to protect the 
public against fraud or imposition, or to safeguard the public health or morals, 
contain a prohibition and impose a penalty, all contracts in violation thereof 
are void. * * *</p>
<p>"As this act involves purely business transactions, and affects only money 
interests, <i>we think it should be construed as rendering contracts made in 
violation of it unlawful and unenforceable at the instance of the offending 
party only, but not as designed to take away the rights of innocent parties who 
may have dealt with the offenders in ignorance of their having violated the 
statute.</i>" (Cashin <i>vs</i>. Pliter [1912], 168 Mich., 386; Ann. Cas. 
[1913-C], 697.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The early decision of our Supreme Court in the case of Prautch, Scholes &amp; 
Co. <i>vs</i>. Hernandez ([1903], 1 Phil., 705), contains the following 
pertinent observations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another case may be supposed. A partnership is organized for commercial 
purposes. It fails to comply with the requirements of article 119. A creditor 
sues the partnership for a debt contracted by it, claiming to hold the partners 
<i>severally</i>. They answer that their failure to com ply with the Code of 
Commerce makes them a civil partnership and that they are in accordance with 
article 1698 of the Civil Code only liable <i>jointly</i>. To allow such liberty 
of action would be to permit the parties by a violation of the Code to escape a 
liability which the law has seen fit to impose upon persons who organized 
commercial partnerships; 'Because it would be contrary to all legal principles 
that the nonperformance of a duty should redound to the benefit of the person in 
default either intentional or unintentional.' (Mercantile Law, Eixala, fourth 
ed., p. 145.)" (<i>See also</i> Lichauco <i>vs</i>. Lichauco [1916], 33 Phil., 
350, 360.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Jose de Echavarri y Vivanco, in his <i>Codigo de Comercio</i>, includes 
the following comment after articles 121 and 126 of the Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the decisions cited in this and in the previous comments, the following 
is deduced: 1st. Defects in the organization cannot affect relations with third 
persons. 2d. Members who contract with other persons before the association is 
lawfully organized are liable to these persons. 3d. The intention to form an 
association is necessary, so that if the intention of mutual participation in 
the profits and losses in a particular business is proved, and <i>there are no 
articles of association</i>, there is no association. 4th. An association, the 
articles of which have not been registered, is valid in favor of third persons. 
5th. The private pact or agreement to form a commercial association is governed 
not by the commercial law but by the civil law. 6th. Secret stipulations 
<i>expressed in a public instrument</i>, but not inserted in the articles of 
association, do not affect third persons, but are binding on the parties 
themselves. 7th. An agreement made in a public instrument, other than the 
articles of association, by means of which one of the partners guarantees to 
another certain profits or secures him from losses, is valid between them, 
without affecting the association. 8th. <i>Contracts entered into by commercial 
associations defectively organized are valid when they are voluntarily executed 
by the parties, if the only controversy relates to whether or not they complied 
with the agreement.</i></p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"The name of the collective merchant is called firm name. By this name, the 
new being is distinguished from others, its sphere of action fixed, and the 
juridical personality better determined, without constituting an exclusive 
character of the general partnership to such an extent as to serve the purpose 
of giving a definition of said kind of a mercantile partnership, as is the case 
in our Code.</p>
<p>"Having in mind that these partnerships are prevailingly of a personal 
character, article 126 says that they must transact business under the name of 
all its members, of some of them, or of one only, the words 'and company' to be 
added in the latter two cases.</p>
<p>"It is rendered impossible for the general partnership to adopt a firm name 
appropriate to its commercial object; the law wants to link, and does link, the 
solidary and unlimited responsibility of the members of this partnership with 
the formation of its name, and imposes a limitation upon personal liberty in its 
selection, not only by prescribing the requisites, but also by prohibiting 
persons not members of the company from including their names in its firm name 
under penalty of civil solidary responsibility.</p>
<p>"Of course, the form required by the Code for the adoption of the firm name 
does not prevent the addition thereto of any other title connected with the 
commercial purpose of the association. The reader may see our commentaries on 
the mercantile registry about the business names and firm names of associations, 
but it is proper to establish here that, while the business name may be 
alienated by any of the means admitted by the law, it seems impossible to 
separate the firm names of general partnerships from the juridical entity for 
the creation of which it was formed." (Vol. 2, pp. 197, 213.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On the question of whether the fact that the firm name "Teck Seing &amp; Co., 
Ltd." does not contain the name of all or any of the partners as prescribed by 
the Code of Commerce prevents the creation of a general partnership, Professor 
Jose A. Espiritu, as <i>amicus curiae</i>, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My opinion is that such a fact alone cannot and will not be a sufficient 
cause of preventing the formation of a general partnership, especially if the 
other requisites are present and the requisite regarding registration of the 
articles of association in the Commercial Registry has been complied with, as in 
the present case. I do not believe that the adoption of a wrong name is a 
material fact to be taken into consideration in this case; first, because the 
mere fact that a person uses a name not his own does not prevent him from being 
bound in a contract or an obligation he voluntarily entered into; second, 
because such a requirement of the law is merely a formal and not necessarily an 
essential one to the existence of the partnership, and as long as the name 
adopted sufficiently identify the firm or partnership intended to use it, the 
acts and contracts done and entered into under such a name bind the firm to 
third persons; and third, because the failure of the partners herein to adopt 
the correct name prescribed by law cannot shield them from their personal 
liabilities, as neither law nor equity will permit them to utilize their own 
mistake in order to put the blame on third persons, and much less, on the firm 
creditors in order to avoid their personal responsibility."</p></blockquote>
<p>The legal intention deducible from the acts of the parties controls in 
determining the existence of a partnership. If they intend to do a thing which 
in law constitutes a partnership, they are partners, although their purpose was 
to avoid the creation of such relation. Here, the intention of the persons 
making up Teck Seing &amp; Co., Ltd. was to establish a partnership which they 
erroneously denominated a limited partnership. If this was their purpose, all 
subterfuges resorted to in order to evade liability for possible losses, while 
assuming their enjoyment of the advantages to be derived from the relation, must 
be disregarded. The partners who have disguised their identity under a 
designation distinct from that of any of the members of the firm should be 
penalized, and not the creditors who presumably have dealt with the partnership 
in good faith.</p>
<p>Articles 127 and 237 of the Code of Commerce make all the members of the 
general copartnership liable personally and <i>in solidum</i> with all their 
property for the results of the transactions made in the name and for the 
account of the partnership. Section 51 of the Insolvency Law, likewise, makes 
all the property of the partnership and also all the separate property of each 
of the partners liable. In other words, if a firm be insolvent, but one or more 
partners thereof are solvent, the creditors may proceed both against the firm 
and against the solvent partner or partners, first exhausting the assets of the 
firm before seizing the property of the partners. (Brandenburg on Bankruptcy, 
sec. 108; De los Reyes <i>vs</i>. Lukban and Borja [1916], 35 Phil., 757; 
Involuntary Insolvency of Campos Rueda &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Pacific Commercial 
Co. [1922], 44 Phil., 916.)</p>
<p>We reach the conclusion that the contract of partnership found in the 
document hereinbefore quoted established a general partnership or, to be more 
exact, a partnership as this word is used in the Insolvency Law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is reversed, and the record shall be 
returned to the court of origin for further proceedings pursuant to the motion 
presented by the creditors, in conformity with the provisions of the Insolvency 
Law. Without special finding as to the costs in this instance, it is so 
ordered.</p><i>Araullo, C.J., Johnson, Street, Avanceña, Villamor, Johns,</i> 
and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
