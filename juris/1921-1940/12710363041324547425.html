				<H3>FEDEBICO VALERA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. MIGUEL VELASCO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal taken by Federico Valera from the judgment of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing his complaint against Miguel 
Velasco, on the ground that he has not satisfactorily proven his right of 
action.
<p align="justify">In support of his appeal, the appellant assigns the following 
alleged errors as committed by the trial court in its judgment, to wit: (1) The 
lower court erred in holding that one of the ways of terminating an agency is by 
the express or tacit renunciation of the agent; (2) the lower court erred in 
holding that the institution of a civil action and the execution of the judgment 
obtained by the agent against his principal is but a renunciation of the powers 
conferred on the agent; (3) the lower court erred in holding that, even if the 
sale by Eduardo Hernandez to the plaintiff Federico Valera be declared void, 
such a declaration could not prevail over the rights of the defendant Miguel 
Velasco inasmuch as the right of redemption was exercised by neither Eduardo 
Hernandez nor the plaintiff Federico Valera; (4) the lower court erred in not 
finding that the defendant Miguel Velasco was, and at present is, an authorized 
representative of the plaintiff Federico Valera; (5) the lower court erred in 
not annulling the sale made by the sheriff at public auction to defendant Miguel 
Velasco, Exhibit K; (6) the lower court erred in failing to annul the sale 
executed by Eduardo Hernandez to the plaintiff Federico Valera, Exhibit C; (7) 
the lower court erred in not annulling Exhibit L, that is, the sale at public 
auction of the right to repurchase the land in question to Salvador Vallejo; (8) 
the lower court erred in not declaring Exhibit M null and void, which is the 
sale by Salvador Vallejo to defendant Miguel Velasco; (9) the lower court erred 
in not ordering the defendant Miguel Velasco to liquidate his accounts as agent 
of the plaintiff Federico Valera; (10) the lower court erred in not awarding 
plaintiff the P5,000 damages prayed for.</p>
<p align="justify">The pertinent facts necessary for the solution of the questions 
raised by the above quoted assignments of error are contained in the decision 
appealed from and are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"By virtue of the powers of attorney, Exhibits X and Z, 
executed by the plaintiff on April 11, 1919, and on August 8, 1922, the 
defendant was appointed attorney-in-fact of the said plaintiff with authority to 
manage his property in the Philippines, consisting of the usufruct of a real 
property located on Echague Street, City of Manila.</p>
<p align="justify">"The defendant accepted both powers of attorney, managed 
plaintiff's property, reported his operations, and rendered accounts of his 
administration; and on March 31, 1923 presented Exhibit F to plaintiff, which is 
the final account of his administration for said month, wherein it appears that 
there is a balance of P3,058.33 in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
<p align="justify">"The liquidation of accounts revealed that the plaintiff owed 
the defendant P1,100, and as a misunderstanding arose between them, the 
defendant brought suit against the plaintiff, civil case No. 23447 of this 
court. Judgment was rendered in his favor on March 28, 1923, and after the writ 
of execution was issued, the sheriff levied upon the plaintiff's right of 
usufruct, sold it at public auction and adjudicated it to the defendant in 
payment of all of his claim.</p>
<p align="justify">"Subsequently, on May 11, 1923, the plaintiff sold his right of 
redemption to one Eduardo Hernandez, for the sum of P200 (Exhibit A). On 
September 4, 1923, this purchaser conveyed the same right of redemption, for the 
sum of P200, to the plaintiff himself, Federico Valera (Exhibit C).</p>
<p align="justify">"After the plaintiff had recovered his right of redemption, one 
Salvador Vallejo, who had an execution upon a judgment against the plaintiff 
rendered in a civil case against the latter, levied upon said right of 
redemption, which was sold by the sheriff at public auction to Salvador Vallejo 
for P250 and was definitely adjudicated to him. Later, he transferred said right 
of redemption to the defendant Velasco. This is how the title to the right of 
usufruct to the aforementioned propelrty later came to vest in the said 
defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">As the first two assignments of error are very closely related 
to each other, we will consider them jointly.</p>
<p align="justify">Article 1732 of the Civil Code reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Art. 1732. Agency is terminated:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. By revocation;</p>
<p align="justify">"2. By the withdrawal of the agent;</p>
<p align="justify">"3. By the death, interdiction, bankruptcy, or insolvency of 
the principal or of the agent." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And article 1736 of the same Code provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Art. 1736. An agent may withdraw from the agency by giving 
notice to the principal. Should the latter suffer any damage through the 
withdrawal, the agent must indemnify him therefore, unless the agent's reason 
for his withdrawal should be the impossibility of continuing to act as such 
without serious detriment to himself."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case of De la Peña vs. Hidalgo (16 Phil., 450), this 
court laid down the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. AGENCY; ADMINISTRATION OF PROPERTY; IMPLIED AGENCY.—When 
the agent and administrator of property informs his principal by letter that for 
reasons of health and medical treatment he is about to depart from the place 
where he is executing his trust and wherein the said property is situated, and 
abandons the property, turns it over to a third party, renders accounts of its 
revenues up to the date on which he ceases to hold his position and transmits to 
his principal a general statement which summarizes and embraces all the balances 
of his accounts since he began the administration to the date of the termination 
of his trust, and, without stating when he may return to take charge of the 
administration of the said property, asks his principal to execute a power of 
attorney in due form in favor of and transmit the same to another person who 
took charge of the administration of the said property, it is but reasonable and 
just to conclude that the said agent had expressly and definitely renounced his 
agency and that such agency was duly terminated, in accordance with the 
provisions of article 1732 of the Civil Code, and, although the agent in his 
aforementioned letter did not use the words "renouncing the agency," yet such 
words, were undoubtedly so understood and accepted by the principal, because of 
the lapse of nearly nine years !up to the time of the latter's death, without 
his having interrogated either the renouncing agent, disapproving what he had 
done, or the person who substituted the latter."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The misunderstanding between the plaintiff and the defendant 
over the payment of the balance of P1,000 due the latter, as a result of the 
liquidation of the accounts between them arising from the collections by virtue 
of the former's usufructuary right, who was the principal, made by the latter as 
his agent, and the fact that the said defendant brought suit against the said 
principal on March 28, 1928 for the payment of said balance, more than prove the 
breach of the juridical relation between them; for, although the agent has not 
expressly told his principal that he renounced the agency, yet neither dignity 
nor decorum permits the latter to continue representing a person who has adopted 
such an antagonistic attitude towards him. When the agent filed a complaint 
against his principal for the recovery of a sum of money arising from the 
liquidation of the accounts between them in connection with the agency, Federico 
Valera could not have understood otherwise than that Miguel Velaseo renounced 
the agency; because his act was more expressive than words and could not have 
caused any doubt. (2 C. J., 543.) In order to terminate their relations by 
virtue of the agency, the defendant, as agent, rendered his final account on 
March 31, 1923 to the plaintiff, as principal.</p>
<p align="justify">Briefly, then, the fact that an agent institutes an action 
against his principal for the recovery of the balance in his favor resulting 
from the liquidation of the accounts between them arising from the agency, and 
renders a final account of his operations, is equivalent to an express 
renunciation of the agency, and terminates the juridical relation between 
them.</p>
<p align="justify">If, as we have found, the defendant-appellee Miguel Velaseo, in 
adopting a hostile attitude towards his principal, suing him for the collection 
of the balance in his favor, resulting from the liquidation of the agency 
accounts, ceased <em>ipso facto</em> to be the agent of the plaintiff-appellant, 
said agent's purchase of the aforesaid principal's right of usufruct at public 
auction held by virtue of an execution issued upon the judgment rendered in 
favor of the former and against the latter, is valid and legal, and the lower 
court did not commit the fourth and fifth assignments of error attributed to it 
by the plaintiff-appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">In regard to the third assignment of error, it is deemed 
unnecessary to discuss the validity of the sale made by Federico Valera to 
Eduardo Hernandez of his right of redemption in the sale of his usufructuary 
right made by the sheriff by virtue of the execution of the judgment in favor of 
Miguel Velasco and against the said Federico Valera; and the same thing is true 
as to the validity of the resale of the same right of redemption made by Eduardo 
Hernandez to Federico Valera; inasmuch as Miguel Velasco's purchase at public 
auction held by virtue of an execution of Federico Valera's usufructuary right 
is valid and legal, and as neither the latter nor Eduardo Hernandez exercised 
his right of redemption within the legal period, the purchaser's title became 
absolute.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, the defendant-appellee, Miguel Velasco, having 
acquired Federico Valera's right of redemption from Salvador Vallejo, who had 
acquired it at public auction by virtue of a writ of execution issued upon the 
judgment obtained by the said Vallejo against the said Valera, the latter lost 
all right to said usufruct.</p>
<p align="justify">And even supposing that Eduardo Hernandez had been tricked by 
Miguel Velasco into selling Federico Valera's right of repurchase to the latter 
so that Salvador Vallejo might levy an execution on it, and even supposing that 
said resale was null for lack of consideration, yet, inasmuch as Eduardo 
Hernandez did not present a third party claim when the right was levied upon for 
the execution of the judgment obtained by Vallejo against Federico Valera, nor 
did he file a complaint to recover said right before the period of redemption 
expired, said Eduardo Hernandez, and much less Federico Valera, cannot now 
contest the validity of said resale, for the reason that the one-year period of 
redemption has already elapsed.</p>
<p align="justify">Neither did the trial court err in not ordering Miguel Velasco 
to render a liquidation of accounts from March 31, 1923, inasmuch as he had 
acquired the rights of the plaintiff by purchase at the execution sale, and, as 
purchaser, he was entitled to receive the rents from the date of the sale until 
the date of the repurchase, considering them as a part of the redemption price; 
but not having exercised the right of repurchase during the legal period, and 
the title of the purchaser having become absolute, the latter did not have to 
account for said rents.</p>
<p align="justify">Summarizing, the conclusion is reached that the disagreements 
between an agent and his principal with respect to the agency, and the filing of 
a civil action by the former against the latter for the collection of the 
balance in favor of the agent, resulting from a liquidation of the agency 
accounts, are facts showing a rupture of relations, and the complaint is 
equivalent to an express renunciation of the agency, and is more expressive than 
if the agent had merely said, "I renounce the agency."</p>
<p align="justify">By virtue of the foregoing, and finding no error in the 
judgment appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed in all its parts, with costs 
against the appellant. So ordered.</p> <em>Johnson, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</em> and <em>Johns, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
