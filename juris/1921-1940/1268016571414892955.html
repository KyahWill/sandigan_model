				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is an appeal taken by the petitioner for a writ of habeas&nbsp; corpus, denied&nbsp; by the Court of First Instance of Davao.<br><br>The appeal is based on the&nbsp; ground that the denial of the petition is contrary to the law&nbsp; and the evidence.<br><br>The appellant contends that he is entitled to remain in the Philippines by&nbsp; virtue of the registry certificate which he has adduced as Exhibit D.&nbsp; But this registry certificate is only equivalent to the present cedula certificate, and was issued to every resident in the country,&nbsp; not to Chinese alone (<i>Vide</i> circular No.&nbsp; 12 issued on December 12, 1899, by the Office of the Military Governor of the United States in the Philippines).&nbsp; The Military Governor&nbsp; also issued circular No.&nbsp; 6 of May 30, 1899, which contained circular No. 13 of the Bureau of Customs and Insular Affairs, dated&nbsp; in Washington,&nbsp; April 14, 1899, reading as follows:<br><br>"The following&nbsp; is&nbsp; published for&nbsp; the information&nbsp; and guidance of all concerned:<br><blockquote>"The laws and regulations governing immigration to the United&nbsp; States are&nbsp; hereby declared to&nbsp; be in effect&nbsp; in the territory under government by the&nbsp; military force of the United&nbsp; States, and collector&nbsp; of customs are&nbsp; directed to enforce said laws&nbsp; and regulations until the establishment of immigration stations in said territory.&nbsp; All money&nbsp; collected under this order must be&nbsp; deposited and accounted for as prescribed for customs collections.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 360px;">"G. D. MEIKLEJOHN<br></div><div style="margin-left: 360px;">"<i>Acting Secretary of War</i>"</div></blockquote>The registry certificate mentioned&nbsp; above,&nbsp; Exhibit D, was issued not by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Collector of Customs, but by the Collector of Internal Revenue of Manila, and at that time there was&nbsp; already&nbsp; a&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs appointed by the Military Government in and for this city.<br><br>Moreover, the matter now in question has&nbsp; already been finally decided&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; tribunal, and is therefore <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, inasmuch&nbsp; as the&nbsp; appellant has already been denied the right to remain in the&nbsp; country on the ground&nbsp; that the registry certificate Exhibit D was not sufficient to grant him that right,&nbsp; and, before filing this action, he had already petitioned for&nbsp; a writ of habeas corpus,&nbsp; which was denied by&nbsp; a competent&nbsp; court on October 6, 1928, and which decision became final&nbsp; upon the dismissal&nbsp; of the appeal&nbsp; taken therefrom by the appellant herein.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J.,&nbsp; Street, Malcolm,&nbsp; Villamor, Villa-Real,</i> and <i>Imperial, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
