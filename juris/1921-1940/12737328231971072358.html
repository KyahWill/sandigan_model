We will take them under view in order. <st1:place>I.</st1:place> Power of the House of Representatives to punish for contempt.—For comparative and informative purposes, it is advisable to turn to the experience of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Great Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United<span style="">&nbsp; States</span style=""></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Houses of the British Parliament were originally courts of judicature,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>still retain, on account of that origin, the power to punish for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>contempt. But it is not to be inferred, because of this power of the Houses in the British Parliament, that a like power belongs to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>legislative<span style="">&nbsp; </span>assemblies in the British dependencies, as for instance, in the<span style="">&nbsp; House of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assembly of Newfoundland. In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the theory of the division of powers negatives any implication<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the possession by the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>commingled legislative and judicial authority<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as to contempts, which is exercised by the English House of Commons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two Houses of the Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> do not possess the general power of punishing for contempt, and the cases in which they can do so<span style="">&nbsp; </span>are very limited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to deal directly by way of contempt, without criminal prosecution, may be implied from the constitutional grant of legislative power to the Congress in so far, and so far only, as<span style="">&nbsp; </span>such authority is necessary<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to preserve and carry out the legislative power granted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two Houses of the Congress, in their separate relations, possess such auxiliary powers as are appropriate to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>make the express powers effective. In these latter cases,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the power to punish for contempt rests solely upon the right of self-preservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceeding on this theory, punishment has been imposed for assaults upon members of the House of Representatives which prevented<span style="">&nbsp; </span>members from<span style="">&nbsp; </span>attending the sessions of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the power does not extend to the infliction of punishment as such.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the apt phrase of Chief Justice White of the United States Supreme Court, "It is a means to an end<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and not the end itself."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Burdett vs. Abbott [1811], 14 East,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1; Kielley<span style="">&nbsp; </span>vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Carson</st1:place></st1:city> [1841], 4 Moo.

</span>upon it unless there is evidence of a manifest<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and absolute disregard of discretion, which does not appear from the record in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; The facts of record show that the contempt was not punished<span style="">&nbsp; </span>during the session when it occurred, not because of negligence or<span style="">&nbsp; </span>condonation of the offense by the House, but because the petitioner could<span style="">&nbsp;

of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the constitution conferring the authority.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not very well settled what are the limits to this power; and in the leading case in this country the speaker's warrant for the arrest of the person <span style="">&nbsp;</span>adjudged guilty of contempt was sustained, though it did not show in what<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the alleged contempt consisted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the leading English case a libelous publication concerning the house was treated<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>Upon that question Judge Cooley, as We have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>stated<span style="">&nbsp; </span>above, makes the statement: "When imprisonment is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>imposed<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>(a) Adjournment of the sessions from day to day, (&amp;)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>adjournment of sessions from one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>period to another, of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the same<span style="">&nbsp; </span>legislature<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or Congress,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and<span style="">&nbsp; (c) final<span style="">&nbsp; </span>adjournment of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the particular legislature<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or Congress, which means that that particular entity, as<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a legislative<span style="">&nbsp; </span>body, has<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ceased<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to exist and has no further<span style="">&nbsp; </span>power as a legal entity for the purposes of legislation.</span style=""></p><p class="MsoNormal">If I understand<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>facts in this case, the Legislature which authorized Manuel Roxas, its Speaker, to order the arrest of the appellant<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on September<span style="">&nbsp; </span>16, 1930,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>exactly the same legislative<span style="">&nbsp; </span>entity against which the appellant committed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>contempt in 1929, and had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not<span style="">&nbsp; </span>finally adjourned at<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>time<span style="">&nbsp; the present<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petition for the writ of habeas corpus was presented to the Court of First Instance of the City of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Said Legislature, therefore, at the time of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the consideration of the petition for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the writ of habeas corpus, still had full authority to carry into effect, through proper<span style="">&nbsp; </span>channels, the order of arrest complained of.</span style=""></p><p class="MsoNormal">There has been a good deal of discussion concerning the sessions<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of the Legislature and its right to punish for contempt after the close of the sessions at which the contempt was committed.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my judgment the argument which supports the contention that the power to punish has ceased to exist, after the close of the sessions<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at which the contempt was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>committed,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>is<span style="">&nbsp; </span>not<span style="">&nbsp; well supported,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>unless<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the close of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the period of sessions is a final adjournment or a sine die adjournment,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>which means<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that that particular legislative body, as a legislative entity, has gone out of existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my judgment there is no support for the contention that the close<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of a particular<span style="">&nbsp; </span>period<span style="">&nbsp; of sessions deprives the legislative body of its right to punish for contempt committed during that period.</span style=""></span style=""></p><p class="MsoNormal">In view of all of the foregoing, I am forced to the conclusion<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the judgment appealed from<span style="">&nbsp; </span>should be affirmed, with costs.<o:p></o:p></p></meta name="progid"></div>
