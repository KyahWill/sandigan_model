				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellant&nbsp; was convicted in the Court of First Instance of Batangas of a violation&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 208 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>In July,&nbsp; 1933, appellant was municipal president of the municipality of&nbsp; San Juan, Province of Batangas, and was engaged in&nbsp; raising funds for the construction of a ward in the provincial hospital,&nbsp; for&nbsp; tubercular patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding all his efforts&nbsp; to secure contributions, he was unable to approximate the&nbsp; quota which&nbsp; had been set for his town by the provincial authorities, and he therefore on July 22 and July 29, organized and held cock-fights, neither day being authorized by law for such purposes.<br><br>Article 208, of which appellant was found guilty, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"ART. 208. <i>Prosecution of&nbsp; offenses; negligence and tolerance</i>.—The penalty of&nbsp; prision correccional in&nbsp; its minimum period and suspension&nbsp; shall be imposed&nbsp; upon any public officer, or officer of the law, who, in dereliction of the duties of his&nbsp; office, shall maliciously refrain from instituting prosecution&nbsp; for the&nbsp; punishment of violators of the law,&nbsp; or shall tolerate the commission of offenses."</blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; not clear&nbsp; whether the Government is claiming the right to punish&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; because he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; institute prosecution&nbsp; against himself for organizing a cock-fight on a day other than those permitted by law&nbsp; or,&nbsp; under the last clause, that&nbsp; it was his duty to have prosecutions instituted against all&nbsp; who attended the cock-fights and&nbsp; bet&nbsp; money thereon.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; also contended&nbsp; in argument that the word "maliciously" in the Act means&nbsp; no more than mere knowledge or voluntary violation of the law and that it only applies to the first clause and does not qualify the toleration therein denounced.&nbsp; It is true that the word "maliciously" has been , given by the&nbsp; courts&nbsp; different meanings&nbsp; according&nbsp; to the context of the legislation&nbsp; in which the word is used.&nbsp; The Spanish text of the Act being the controlling one, the definition of <i>malicia</i> found in&nbsp; 21 <i>Enciclopedia Juridica Española</i>, page 542, is instructive. <br><br>"MALICIA.&nbsp; El estado de&nbsp; espfritu que se complace en el deseo y practica de una accion perversa, a sabiendas de su maldad y no obstante esta.<br><br>"La malicia es la caracteristica&nbsp; subjetiva o psicologica del delito, segun las ideas tradicionales de la escuela&nbsp; penal espanola.&nbsp; Asi, desde los comienzos de la codification, el Codigo&nbsp; Penal de&nbsp; 1822 definia&nbsp; el&nbsp; delito&nbsp; de&nbsp; esta&nbsp; suerte: 'Comete delito el que, libre y voluntariamente,<i> y con malicia</i>, hace u omite lo que la ley prohibe o&nbsp; manda bajo alguna pena' (art. 1.°).&nbsp; Y aun despues de eliminada la palabra en la redaccidn del&nbsp; Codigo de&nbsp; 1870,&nbsp; todavia la repite el Codigo&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Marina de&nbsp; guerra, como si fuera&nbsp; de hecho insubstituible:&nbsp; 'Son delitos&nbsp; y faltas las acciones u omisioires penadas&nbsp; por la ley&nbsp; y ejecutadas&nbsp; <i>con malicia</i>' (art. 1.°).&nbsp; Pero, illamariamos&nbsp; realmente 'malicia' al estado&nbsp; de&nbsp; animo del delincuente politico&nbsp; generoso,&nbsp; del delin- cuente&nbsp; pasional&nbsp; honrado?&nbsp;&nbsp; La formula,&nbsp; no obstante sus apariencias de exactitud, nos parece incapaz&nbsp; de&nbsp; servir de comtin denominador a todos los delitos.<br><br>"En otra de sus acepciones que en Derecho tiene menos valor, la palabra&nbsp; 'malicia'&nbsp; equivale&nbsp; a la penetration, sutileza y sagacidad propia de ciertos espiritus, mas o menos habitualmente."<br><br>These definitions indicate what the&nbsp; ordinary use of the word connotes,&nbsp; that the action complained of&nbsp; must be the result of a deliberate evil intent&nbsp; and does&nbsp; not cover a mere voluntary act.<br><br>Looking at it from a practical&nbsp; standpoint, it is clear that giving this section the most liberal interpretation possible would result in impossible&nbsp; conditions in these Islands.&nbsp; If every public functionary&nbsp; who fails to institute criminal proceedings for every misdemeanor&nbsp; which he has&nbsp; reason to believe has been&nbsp; committed, is&nbsp; liable&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; sent&nbsp; to jail for a year and a half as a felon, an intolerable&nbsp; situation would occur.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; president in&nbsp; the Islands would be subject to conviction by the machinations of his political enemies, under a statute as rigorous as any devised by Draco.<br><br>Appellant admits in his testimony acts which are clearly denounced by article 199, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>"ART. 199. <i>Illegal cockfighting.</i>—The penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> or a fine not&nbsp; exceeding 200 pesos, or both, in the discretion of the court, shall be imposed upon:<br><blockquote>"1. Any person who directly or indirectly participates in cockfights, by betting&nbsp; money or other valuable things, or who organizes cockfights at which bets are made, on a day other than those permitted by law."</blockquote>For his infraction of the law he can be punished under this section, and there is no necessity of straining a highly criminal statute to adequately punish his acts.<br><br>We therefore find appellant not guilty of a violation of article 208 but guilty of a violation of article 199, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code, and sentence him to pay a fine of P10, with subsidiary confinement in case of insolvency.<br><br>The judgment appealed from, as thus modified, is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Malcolm,&nbsp; Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Vickers, Butte, Goddard,</i> and <i>Diaz, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><center><b>DISSENTING</b></center><br>ABANCEÑA, C.J., :<br><br>It is alleged in the information, among other things, that the appellant, being municipal president of San Juan, Batangas, tolerated cock-fights at which money was betted on days not permitted by law.&nbsp; The appellant's admission that he organized and&nbsp; conducted these cock-fights&nbsp; establishes&nbsp; this allegation of the information&nbsp; in the sense that he tolerated the commission of the violation of the law wherein others, besides&nbsp; him,&nbsp; intervened.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; my opinion, this is sufficient to warrant the affirmance of the sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the circumstances of the case, however, the absolute pardon of the appellant should be recommended to the Chief Executive. Judgment modified.</div>
