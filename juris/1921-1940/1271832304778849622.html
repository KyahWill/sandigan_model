				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Father Braulio Pineda died in January 1925 without any 
ascendants or descendants, leaving a will in which he instituted his sister 
Irene Pineda as his sole heiress. During his lifetime Father Braulio donated 
some of his property by public instruments to the six plaintiffs, severally, 
with the condition that some of them would pay him a certain amount of rice, and 
others of money every year, and with the express provision that failure to 
fulfill this condition would revoke the donations <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>. These six 
plaintiff-donees are relatives, and some of them brothers of Father Braulio 
Pineda. The donations contained another clause that they would take effect upon 
acceptance. They were accepted during Father Braulio's lifetime by every one of 
the donees. 
<p align="justify">Every one of the six plaintiffs filed a separate action against 
the Collector of Internal Revenue and his deputy for the sums of which each of 
them paid, under protest, as inheritance tax on the property donated to them, in 
accordance with section 1536 of the Administrative Code, as amended by section 
10 of Act No. 2835, and by section 1 of Act No. 3031. Section 1536 of the 
Administrative Code reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Every transmission by virtue of inheritance, devise, bequest, 
gift <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span> or advance in anticipation of inheritance, devise, or bequest 
of real property located in the Philippine Islands and real rights in such 
property; * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The trial court in deciding these six cases, held that the 
donations to the six plaintiffs made by the deceased Father Braulio Pineda are 
donations <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>, and therefore, not subject to the inheritance tax, and 
ordered the defendants to return to each of the plaintiffs the sums paid by the 
latter. </p>
<p align="justify">The defendants appealed from this judgment. </p>
<p align="justify">The whole question involved in this appeal resolves into 
whether the donations made by Father Braulio Pineda to each of the plaintiffs 
are donations <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>, or <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>, for it is the latter upon which the 
Administrative Code imposes inheritance tax. In our opinion, said donations are 
<span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>. It is so expressly stated in the instruments in which they appear. 
They were made in consideration of the donor's affection for the donees, and of 
the services they had rendered him, but he has charged them with the obligation 
to pay him a certain amount of rice and money, respectively, each year during 
his lifetime, the donations to become effective upon acceptance. They are 
therefore not in the nature of donations <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span> but <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>.</p>
<p align="justify">The principal characteristics of a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>, which 
distinguish it essentially from a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>, are that in the former 
it is the donor's death that determines the acquisition of, or the right to, the 
property, and that it is revocable at the will of the donor. In the donations in 
question, their effect, that is, the acquisition of, or the right to, the 
property, was produced while the donor was still alive, for, according to their 
expressed terms they were to have this effect upon acceptance, and this took 
place during the donor's lifetime. The nature of these donations is not affected 
by the fact that they were subject to a condition, since it was imposed as a 
resolutory condition, and in this sense, it necessarily implies that the right 
came into existence first as well as its effect, because otherwise there would 
be nothing to resolve upon the non-fulfillment of the condition imposed. Neither 
does the fact that these donations are revocable, give them the character of 
donations <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>, inasmuch as the revocation is not made to depend on the 
donor's exclusive will, but on the failure to fulfill the condition imposed. In 
relation to the donor's will alone, these donations are irrevocable. On the 
other hand, this condition, in so far as it renders the donation onerous, takes 
it further away from the dispositions <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span> and brings it nearer to 
contract. In this sense, by virtue of this condition imposed, they are not 
donations throughout their full extent, but only so far as they exceed the 
incumbrance imposed, for so far as concerns the portion equivalent to or less 
than said incumbrance, it has the nature of a real contract and is governed by 
the rules on contracts (art 622 of the Civil Code). And in the part in which it 
is strictly a donation, it is a donation <span style="font-style: italic;">inter vivos</span>, because its effect was 
produced by the donees' acceptance during the donor's lifetime and was not 
determined by the donor's death. Upon being accepted they had full effect. If 
the donor's life is mentioned in connection with this condition, it is only to 
fix the donor's death as the end of the term within which the condition must be 
fulfilled, and nqt because such death of the donor is the cause which determines 
the birth of the right to the donation. The property donated passed to the 
ownership of the donees from the acceptance of the donations, and these could 
not be revoked except upon the non-fulfillment of the condition imposed, or for 
other causes prescribed by the law, but not by the mere will of the donor. </p>
<p align="justify">Neither can these donations be considered as an advance on 
inheritance or legacy, according to the terms of section 1536 of the 
Administrative Code, because they are neither an inheritance nor a legacy. And 
it cannot be said that the plaintiffs received such advance on inheritance or 
legacy, since they were not heirs or legatees of their predecessor in interest 
upon his death (sec. 1540 of the Administrative Code). Neither can it be said 
that they obtained this inheritance or legacy by virtue of a document which does 
not contain the requisites of a will (sec. 618 of the Code of Civil Procedure). 
</p>
<p align="justify">Besides, if the donations made by the plaintiffs are, as the 
appellants contend, <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis causa</span>, then they must be governed by the law on 
testate succession (art. 620 of the Civil Code). In such a case, the documents 
in which these donations appear, being instruments which do not contain the 
requisites of a will, are not valid to transmit the property to the donees (sec. 
618, Code of Civil Procedure.) Then the defendants are not justified in 
collecting from the donees the inheritance tax on property which has not been 
legally transferred to them, and in which they acquired no right.</p>
<p align="justify">For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed, 
without special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>STREET, J.: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Of course I agree with so much of the discussion in the 
majority opinion as declares that the various donations made prior to his death 
by Rev. Braulio Pineda to various nephews and nieces were not donations <span style="font-style: italic;">mortis 
causa</span>. But this is by no means decisive of the case. Among the forms of 
succession which are by law made subject to the inheritance tax are <span style="font-style: italic;">advances in 
anticipation of inheritance</span> (Adm. Code, sec. 1636, as amended); and I consider 
these donations to be taxable in that character. The device adopted in this case 
for the distribution of the bulk of the donor's property before his death is, to 
my mind, a transparent attempt at an evasion of the tax. The donations in 
question were made to all of the persons who would have been entitled to inherit 
if no will had been made, except one; and this one was instituted as sole heir 
in the will. If no will had been left, all of the donees and the heir instituted 
in the will would have shared jointly in the estate by regular succession. It is 
thus seen that the making of the donations and the making of the will were part 
of a single purpose, which was, to effect the distribution of the donor's 
property. What else is necessary to make an advance "in anticipation of 
inheritance?" </p>
<p align="justify">The suggestion in the opinion that the institution of another 
person as heir in the will had the effect of destroying the capacity of the 
donees to take as heirs, is not well founded, for the question whether these 
donations should be considered advances in anticipation of inheritance ought to 
be determined with reference to the situation at the time the donations were 
made. The very reason that the prospective heir to whom no donation had been 
made was instituted as sole heir in the will is of course found in the fact that 
advances had already been made to the others. The purpose of the statute was to 
impose a tax on successions; and in order to prevent the successful use of 
devices of this kind, the lawmaker expressly made the tax applicable to advances 
in anticipation of inheritance. If the situation before us is not within both 
the letter and meaning of that provision, the undersigned has entirely 
misinterpreted its purport. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment affirmed</span>.</p></div><p></p>
