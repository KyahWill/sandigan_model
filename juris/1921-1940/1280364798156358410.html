				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED ANTONIO ESCOBAR. THE BANK OP THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, ADMINISTRATOR. ESTATE OF THE DECEASED LUCIANA DE LOS SANTOS, REPRESENTED BY THE EXECUTOR JOSE SANTOS, CLAIMANT AND APPELLEE, VS. MARIA LUCIANO, CLAIMANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the claimant Maria 
Luciano from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the 
dispositive part of which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Wherefore, the court declares that the only heir 
of the deceased Antonio Escobar was his wife Luciana de los Santos, now 
deceased, whom her heirs succeeded and whose testamentary proceedings 
are likewise pending in this court, as above stated, and that neither 
Maria Luciano nor Petrona Esguerra is entitled to participate in the 
estate of the deceased Antonio Escobar.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "After this judgment becomes final, the entire 
estate of the deceased Antonio Escobar shall, by operation of law, pass 
to the testamentary estate of the deceased Luciana de los Santos. Let a 
copy of this resolution be attached to the record of the testamentary 
proceedings of the deceased Luciana de los Santos, civil case No. 43599.
 So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In support of her appeal, the appellant assigns the 
following sole alleged error as committed by the court <em>a quo</em> in
 its order to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "The lower court erred in not recognizing and 
declaring Maria Luciano as the sole legal heir of the deceased Antonio 
Escobar and therefore entitled to the entire intestate estate of the 
latter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The following facts proven at the trial, some by 
stipulation of the parties and others by a preponderance of the 
evidence, are necessary and pertinent to the resolution of the questions
 raised in this appeal, to wit:</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 1, 1837, a girl four days old, alleged to
 be a natural daughter of Leon Escobar and Josefa Esguerra, was baptized
 in the Ermita church and given the name of Tomasa Escobar (Exhibit 
1-Maria Luciano).</p>
<p align="justify"> Leon Escobar and Josefa Esguerra were married on 
August 2, 1838 (Exhibit 1), and subsequently had legitimate children 
named Antonio and Fortunato Escobar. With said spouses and their two 
legitimate children lived Tomasa, Guia and Nicolas Escobar. All of them 
called said spouses "tatay" (father) and "nanay" (mother), respectively.
 Tomasa was called by the other children "manang" (a term accorded in 
certain regions to the elder sister). Tomasa Escobar grew up and lived 
under the care of the spouses Leon and Josefa Escobar until she married.
 Said spouses supported her, treated and presented her as their 
daughter, and she was publicly known as such. When Tomasa Escobar became
 a widow, she went back to live with said spouses, together with her 
only daughter, the herein claimant-appellant Maria Luciano who was born 
on December 17, 1864 (Exhibit 4). Leon Escobar built a house for Tomasa 
Escobar and her daughter and the two lived there. Leon Escobar visited 
them in said house almost every day and sent his sons Antonio and 
Fortunato to keep them company at night. Upon Tomasa Escobar's death, 
Leon Escobar took said Maria Luciano into his home until she married and
 was taken by her husband to the province. Leon Escobar died on February
 12, 1887 (Exhibit 2-Luciana de los Santos). When Fortunato Escobar 
became ill, his brother Antonio Escobar asked Maria Luciano to come to 
Manila to nurse him, sending her money for passage. Upon Fortunato 
Escobar's death, Antonio Escobar took Maria Luciano into his home where 
she lived until Antonio's death.</p>
<p align="justify"> The claimant-appellant Maria Luciano claims to be 
the legitimate niece of the deceased Antonio Escobar, alleging that she 
is the legitimate daughter of Tomasa Escobar, a legitimated sister of 
said deceased Antonio Escobar by the subsequent marriage of their 
parents, and therefore the only heir to the estate of her said uncle.</p>
<p align="justify"> First of all, it is necessary to determine whether 
or not Tomasa Escobar was a natural daughter of the spouses Leon Escobar
 and Josefa Esguerra, legitimated by subsequent marriage of the latter.</p>
<p align="justify"> We have seen that Tomasa Escobar was born on 
December 29, 1836, and her alleged parents Leon Escobar and Josefa 
Esguerra were married on August 2, 1838, that is under the prior 
legislation which is Law I, Title XIII* Partida IV. Her status as a 
legitimated daughter should therefore be determined by said law which 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> <em>"Law I, Title XIII, Partida IV</em>.â€”Moreover,
 the children which a man has by a woman whom he keeps as a concubine 
will be legitimate, if he marries her afterwards; for although children 
of this kind are not legitimate when they are born, marriage has such 
force that, as soon as the father and mother are married, the children 
become for that reason, legitimate. This same rule applies where a man 
has a child by his female slave and afterwards marries her; for marriage
 has such extraordinary power that, as soon as this is done, the mother 
becomes free, and the children legitimate, for this reason."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> It is a well-established doctrine, both in Spain and
 iN the Philippines, interpreting Law 11 of Toro, that a child is 
considered natural when at the time of its conception or birth its 
parents could have married without dispensation and when the father has 
expressly or tacitly acknowledged it. (Mijares <em><em>vs.</em></em> 
Nery, 3 Phil., 195; Llorente <em>vs.</em> Rodriguez, 3 Phil., 697; 
Capistrano <em>vs.</em> Estate of Gabino, 8 Phil., 135; De Gala <em>vs.</em>
 De Gala, 42 Phil., 771; Larena and Larena <em>vs.</em> Rubio, 43 Phil.,
 1017; Donado <em>vs.</em> Menendez Donado, 55 Phil., 861.)</p>
<p align="justify"> The fact that before and after their marriage the 
spouses Leon. Escobar and Josefa Esguerra had Tomasa Escobar with them 
and their legitimate children; the fact that they supported her, took 
care of her, and treated and presented her to society as their daughter,
 and the fact that they built a house for her and her daughter, all show
 that said spouses Leon Escobar and Josefa Esguerra acknowledged her as 
their daughter. Pursuant to the provisions of Law 11 of Toro, cited 
above, such acknowledgment, in addition to the freedom of her parents to
 marry without dispensation at the time of her conception or birth, gave
 Tomasa Escobar the status of a natural child of Leon Escobar and Josefa
 Esguerra (Requejo <em>vs.</em> Rabalo, 34 Phil., 14), and according to 
Law I, Title XIII, Partida IV, quoted abov$, the subsequent marriage of 
the latter legitimated her(Cosio <em>vs.</em> Pili, 10 Phil., 72; 
Requejo <em>vs.</em> Rabalo, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
<p align="justify"> The question now arises whether or not the 
claimantappellant Maria Luciano, as legitimate daughter, born under the 
prior legislation, of Tomasa Escobar, a child legitimated by subsequent 
marriage, is entitled to inherit from the intestate estate of a brother 
of her mother who is a legits imate son of said Tomasa Escobar's 
parents, and who died on July 21, 1932, under the present law.</p>
<p align="justify"> The twelfth transitory provision of the Civil Code 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "12. Rights to the inheritance of a person who may
 have died, with or without a will, before this Code was in force, shall
 be governed by the prior legislation. The inheritance Of those who died
 after that time, with or without a will, shall be allotted and divided 
in accordance with this Code, but in harmony, in so far as the latter 
permits it, with the testamentary dispositions, therefore the legitimes,
 betterments, and legacies shall be respected; but their amounts shall 
be reduced when it is not possible in any other manner to give to each 
participant in the inheritance the share pertaining to him, according to
 this Code."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> According to the above quoted transitory provision, 
inasmuch as Antonio Escobar died after the Civil Code took effect, his 
inheritance should be allotted and divided in accordance with said Code.</p>
<p align="justify"> Article 953 of the Civil Code provides that should 
children of brothers or sisters exist, the surviving spouse shall, 
concurrently with said children, be entitled to receive the part of the 
inheritance in usufruct assigned him or her in article 837, that is, 
one-half of the estate in usufruct. When Antonio Escobar died intestate 
on July 21, 1932, his niece, the herein claimant-appellant Maria 
Luciano, daughter of his sister legitimated by subsequent marriage of 
their, parents, was entitled to inherit the full ownership of onehalf of
 his estate and the naked ownership of the other half, the usufruct of 
which belonged to the surviving spouse. However, the usufructuary right 
of the widow Luciana de los Santos was extinguished upon her death which
 took place on December 27, 1932 (article 513 of the Civil Code), 
thereby consolidating the naked ownership with the usufruct of the other
 half in the herein claimant-appellant Maria Luciano.</p>
<p align="justify"> The court <em>a quo</em>, in rejecting the claim of 
the claimantappellant Maria Luciano to the estate of her uncle Antonio 
Escobar, based its opinion on article 943 of the Civil Code which 
provides that "a natural or legitimated child has no right to succeed <em>ab
 intestate</em> the legitimate children Â£nd relatives of the father or 
mother who has acknowledged it; nor shall such children or relatives so 
inherit from the natural or legitimated child," interpreting the word 
"legitimated" to mean a child legitimated by royal concession as well as
 one legitimated by subsequent marriage. Such interpretation could not 
have been the intention of the legislator, inasmuch as article 122 of 
said Code considers a child legitimated by subsequent marriage to be in 
parity with a legitimate child and grants the former the same rights as 
those of the latter, while article 127 of the same Code grants a child 
legitimated by royal concession only those rights conferred upon 
acknowledged natural children by article 134. If children legitimated by
 subsequent marriage have the same rights as legitimate children, and 
those legitimated by royal concession only have the same rights as 
acknowledged natural children, the word "legitimated" employed in 
article 943 <em>et seq.</em> of Section III, Chapter IV of Book Three of
 the Civil Code, alternately with the word "natural", with reference to 
the hereditary portion to which the child of one class or another is 
entitled, refers only to a child legitimated by royal concession and not
 to one legitimated by subsequent marriage. Therefore, the provisions of
 the above cited article 943 of the Civil Code are not applicable to the
 herein claimant-appellant Maria Luciano, and the provisions of article,
 953 of the same Code are the ones applicable to her.</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the foregoing considerations, we are of 
the opinion and so hold: (1) That the continuous possession of the 
status of a natural child, justified by direct acts of its parents and 
their family under the legislation prior to the Civil Code, constitutes 
tacit recognition of paternity (Law 11 of Toro); (2) that a child, who 
has enjoyed the continuous possession of the status of natural child, 
justified by direct acts of its parents and their family both before and
 after their marriage which was celebrated under the prior legislation, 
is considered as legitimated by subsequent marriage (Law I, Title XIII, 
Partida IV); (3) that the legitimate daughter of a daughter legitimated 
by subsequent marriage, now deceased, is entitled to inherit from a 
brother of her mother who is a legitimate son of the same parents who 
legitimated her mother by subsequent marriage, and who died after the 
Civil Code took effect; and (4) that the word "legitimated" employed in 
Section III, Chapter IV of Book Three of the Civil Code, refers to 
children legitimated by royal concession and not to those legitimated by
 subsequent marriage.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, the order appealed from is reversed and 
the claimant-appellant Maria Luciano is declared to be the sole heir to 
the intestate estate of Antonio Escobar, with the costs against the 
appellee. So ordered.</p>
