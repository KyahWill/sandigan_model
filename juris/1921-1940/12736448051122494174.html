				<H3>LA INSULAR, FABRICA DE TABACOS Y CIGARRILLOS, INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. YU SO, OWNER OF LA GRANDEZA CIGARETTE FACTORY, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The trial judge found no unlawful similarity between Exhibit B-1, the package 
for cigarettes used by the defendant, under the name <i>La Simpatica</i>, and 
Exhibit A-1, the package for cigarettes used by the plaintiff, under the name 
<i>La Insular</i>, and accordingly dismissed the complaint without costs.
<p>On the combined question of fact and law, we agree with the trial judge. 
Counsel for the appellee points out sixteen differences between the trade-marks 
and labels of the appellee and the appellant, and while we have not gone to the 
trouble to note all of these differences, we yet conclude that the goods of the 
defendant have not been given such an appearance as would deceive the public in 
their purchase of cigarettes. Moreover, it appears of record that <i>La 
Simpatica</i> has been using this label and selling these cigarettes since 1908, 
and that it was only in 1920 that this complaint was filed.</p>
<p>It is rudimentary that the simulation of the plaintiff's mark must be such as 
would appear likely to mislead the ordinarily intelligent buyer into accepting 
the article with the simulated wrapper as and for the genuine. Seasonable 
measures must be taken to protect the interests of the person who claims that 
his trade-mark has been fraudulently imitated, or who complains of unfair 
competition. (U. S. <i>vs</i>. Manuel [1906], 7 Phil., 221; La Yebana Co. 
<i>vs</i>. Francisco Chua Seco &amp; Co. [1909], 14 Phil., 534, which discloses 
facts constituting unfair competition; Rueda Hermanos &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Felix 
Paglinawan &amp; Co. [1916], 33 Phil., 196, also finding unfair competition; 
Forbes, Munn &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Ang San To [1919], 40 Phil., 272, also finding 
unfair competition; Dy Buncio <i>vs</i>. Tan Tiao Bok [1921], 42 Phil., 190, 
finding no unfair competition to exist; La Insular <i>vs</i>. Jao Oge [1921], 42 
Phil., 366, a somewhat similar case, but relating merely to the question of 
whether or not the complaint stated a good cause of action.)</p>
<p>Finding no reversible error and further discussion being unnecessary, it 
results that judgment must be affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p><i>Johnson, Avance√±a, Villamor,</i> and <i>Romualdez, JJ.,</i> 
concur.<br><i>Street,</i> and <i>Johns, JJ.,</i> concur in the result.</div>
