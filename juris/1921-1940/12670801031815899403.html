				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition filed by the Aleosan Transportation Co., Inc.,&nbsp; to review the&nbsp; decision rendered by the Public Service Commission on August 31, 1935, denying the application for a&nbsp; permit to increase its services on its present lines Iloilo-Leon via San Miguel, Oton or Tigmauan; Iloilo-Alimodian&nbsp; via San Miguel and Oton, and to extend them on the lines Iloilo-San&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; (Antique); San Jose-Capiz via Tibiao and Ibajay; Iloilo-Calinog via Zarraga or Janiway; Iloilo-Dumangas via Zarraga or Janiway;&nbsp; IIoilo-Estancia via Zarraga;&nbsp; Iloilo-Igbaras;&nbsp; Iloilo-Tubungan; Iloilo-Maasin;&nbsp; Iloilo-Lambunao;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Capiz-Estancia,&nbsp; all of the Island&nbsp; of Panay, with a&nbsp; thirty-minute time schedule&nbsp; from 5.30 a. m.&nbsp; to 5.30 p. m.,&nbsp; daily, by increasing&nbsp; the number of trips to&nbsp; an interval of ten minutes if necessary.<br><br>In support of its&nbsp; petition, the petitioner assigns five&nbsp; alleged errors as committed by the respondent Public Service Commission in its decision in question, which will be discussed in the course of this decision.<br><br>The Public Service Commission, in denying said application, stated as follows:<br><blockquote>"The Commission&nbsp; is not&nbsp; convinced from the evidence submitted that the increased services applied for by the applicant on his present lines Iloilo-Leon and Iloilo-Alimodian are necessary.<br><br>"The applicant claims that there&nbsp; is a great&nbsp; need for transportation facilities for&nbsp; carrying&nbsp; freight in the territory applied&nbsp; for as&nbsp; a result of the refusal of the Panay Autobus Co. to transport heavy&nbsp; freight in their trucks. The evidence submitted shows, however, that freight is not refused to be transported by the Panay Autobus Company, there being space in the&nbsp; trucks of said company specially reserved for freight of its&nbsp; passengers.&nbsp; If it is the applicant's intention to operate an auto-truck service devoted primarily to&nbsp; the transportation of freight, it should have filed with this commission an application for&nbsp; authority to operate TH auto-truck service instead of additional&nbsp; TPU services."</blockquote>It is already a settled doctrine of this court, interpreting section 35 of the Public Service Act, as amended by section 1 of Act No. 3316, that this court has jurisdiction to review, modify and set aside decisions and&nbsp; orders&nbsp; of the Public Service Commission only when it clearly appears that there is no evidence to reasonably support such&nbsp; decisions and orders, or when the&nbsp; case&nbsp; is without the jurisdiction of the commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Manila Electric Company vs. Balagtas,&nbsp; 58 Philv 429; Ampil vs. Public&nbsp; Service Commission, 59 Phil., 556; Calabia vs. Orlanes &amp; Banaag&nbsp; Transportation Co., 55 Phil., 659.)<br><br>We have reviewed&nbsp; all the evidence of record and, although we have found contradictions and differences between that of the&nbsp; petitioner and that of&nbsp; the respondents, as the Public Service Commission, after a&nbsp; careful and conscientious consideration of&nbsp; the respective merits&nbsp; thereof, had arrived at the conclusion' that the public necessity and convenience and the interests of the parties do not warrant the increase of services and the extension&nbsp; of&nbsp; lines applied for by the petitioner, it is likewise an already settled doctrine of this court not to&nbsp; modify said conclusions, which we find&nbsp; to be correct and we adopt for purposes of this decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ynchausti&nbsp; Steamship Co.&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Utility&nbsp; Commissioner and Board of Appeal,&nbsp; 44 Phil.,&nbsp; 363; Mejica vs. Public Utility Commission,&nbsp; 49 Phil., 774;&nbsp; San Miguel Brewery vs. Lapid, 53 Phil, 539;&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Yellow Taxicab Co.&nbsp; and Aero Taxicab Co.&nbsp; vs. Danon, 58 Phil.,&nbsp; 75.)<br><br>For the foregoing&nbsp; considerations,&nbsp; and finding that the errors assigned by the petitioner&nbsp; in its brief are not well founded, the&nbsp; appealed decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Public Service&nbsp; Commission is affirmed, with costs to the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avancena,&nbsp; C. J., Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
