				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">As
to the nature of the present proceedings, it may be noted from a
reading of the so called motion or petition quoted below, that the
appellees are attempting to compel someone, without mentioning whom, to
sell a parcel or parcels of land to them, without indicating the extent
or location of the same, further than to say that said parcels are
located or included within the <em>Hacienda de Maysilo</em>. The record shows that the <em>Hacienda de Maysilo</em> covers several millions of square meters of land.
  <p>
The present motion is an aftermath of two other cases. The first was a
petition for partition of a large tract or parcel of land belonging to
the Tuason estate located in the municipalities of Caloocan and
Malabon, of the Province of Rizal, which was commenced in the year
1906. The second was an action for the registration of said tract or
parcel of land commenced by the Tuason family in 1908. The two actions
have a long history, and considering the way they were handled and the
numerous unnecessary delays and the confusion found in the records,
very little credit is due to any of the parties connected with said
causes.</p>
  <p> During the proceedings in the petition for partition
as well as in the action for the registration of said tract or parcel
of land, many persons appeared and laid claim to parts of the same. Due
to the claims presented by many of the occupants of said tract or
parcel of land, the Tuason family authorized the trial court to appoint
a commission to sell to such claimants any part or all of said tract or
parcel of land involved in the said two actions. Said commissioners
under that authority did sell various parcels of more or less extent to
many of said claimants. Notwithstanding the authority of said
commissioners and notwithstanding the fact that they were negotiating
with many of the claimants to sell parcels of said tract, the petition
for partition was finally closed and the heirs of the Tuason family
were granted their respective shares. And not only was the action for
partition closed, as just indicated, but a decree of registration,
under the Torrens system, was also granted, with the evident
understanding that whatever parcels or portions of said original tract,
which had been or might be sold by said commissioners, should be
excluded from said tract in the method and manner provided for by law.</p>
  <p>
In the original authority granted to said commissioners, they were
directed to close their negotiations within the period of six months.
That period was extended from time to time and the sale of numerous
parcels was consummated, and deeds of sale were executed in favor of
many of the purchasers. The greater portion of said sales were
consummated between the years 1910 and 1913.</p>
  <p> While the
present claimants contend that they have a right to purchase certain
parcels, no demand on their part was made for the consummation of their
right until the 17th day of August, 1922, when they filed the present
motion (not a petition) in the Court of First Instance of the Province
of Rizal. Said motion is as follows:</p>

  <p>
It will be noted from a reading of said motion that its purpose was to
obtain the specific performance of a contract of sale of land. No
respondents are named. No land is described. Said motion contains no
facts upon which the judgment could be rendered, even though no defense
was presented. The lower court should have, without delay, dismissed
the action, with costs against the petitioners.</p>
  <p> The fact
that the court took jurisdiction and continued to hear and determine
the question presented not upon the facts stated in the motion but upon
the evidence adduced, shows to what extent parties litigant may be
annoyed without just cause.</p>
  <p> As will appear later in this
discussion, the appellees claim but small parcels of land, without
indicating the exact area. Sabas Bustamante, however, admitted that he
was entitled to purchase six hectares only, or 60,000 square meters,
whereas in the plan which he presents, he claims 521,465 square meters.
While Agapito C. Cruz claimed in his testimony that he was entitled to
one small parcel only, in the plan which he presents, showing the land
to which he has a right to purchase, he claims three parcels with a
total area of 1,125,657 square meters. While Demetria Cruz in her
testimony claimed but one parcel of land, the plan which was presented
gives no indication that she is the owner of any parcel. These facts
indicate very little less than an attempt to defraud Jose Maria Tuason.</p>
  <p>
On the 25th day of August, 1922, Mr. Gabriel La O, represented by P. J.
Sevilla, without stating whom he represented, appeared and answered
said motion as follows:</p>

  <p>
No further pleadings were presented in court and nothing further seems
to have occurred with reference to said motion until the time set for
the trial on the 10th day of March, 1923. At the beginning of the trial
it appears of record that Mr. Vicente Foz appeared for the owners of a
portion of lot No. 25. Attention was called to the fact that the motion
filed by the present petitioners failed absolutely to describe the land
which they claimed they had a right to purchase, or to even locate it
by sitio, barrio or municipality. They did, however, attempt to locate
it within the <em>hacienda</em> mentioned in the two other actions for partition and registration (Nos. 391 and 4429). Their <em>own testimony</em>
given during the hearing is equally as indefinite and uncertain, as to
the location of the parcels of land. Their theory, however, is based
upon an allegation that one Apolinario Baltazar represented them in the
purchase of the respective parcels of land to which they now lay claim.</p>
  <p>
Mr. Apolinario Baltazar testified as a witness and presented exhibits
showing or attempting to show that the land which he had purchased for
himself and as a representative of the appellees, if any they had
purchased, was in lot No. 23. The court <em>a quo</em> awarded to the
appellees lot No. 25, notwithstanding the fact that the only pretension
of Apolinario Baltazar was that he and the present appellees were
entitled to purchase lot No. 23. From an examination of the various
plans presented in the other two actions, the fact clearly appears that
lot No. 25 of the <em>Hacienda Maysilo</em> is north of a street known as <em>Calle Samson</em>, while lot No. 23 is a long distance from <em>Calle Samson</em> to the south. It may be added that <em>Calle Samson</em> seems to be a principal street crossing the said <em>hacienda</em>.</p>
  <p>
Examining the testimony of the three appellees with reference to the
location of the respective lots, we find that Sabas Bustamante
testified that he was the owner of six hectares; that he and his
parents had lived upon and occupied the same for a period of about
fifty years; that the land was bounded on the north by Pedro Bautista,
on the east by Tuason (evidently the Tuason Estate), on the south by <em>Calle Reparo</em>,
and on the west by the Golf Club. He failed to give the sitio, barrio
or municipality of his land. He admitted, however, that he was living
in the barrio of Talisay, of the municipality of Caloocan; that the
barrio of Talisay is located near the <em>Cementerio del Norte</em>. It will be noted from an examination of the various plans presented, that the <em>Cementerio del Norte</em> is a long distance, perhaps more than one mile south of <em>Calle Samson</em>, and that the Golf Club as well as lot No. 25 are on the north side of <em>Calle Samson</em>.
That being true, it is difficult to understand, how land located in the
barrio of Talisay could, by any possibility, be bounded by the Golf
Club. Sabas Bustamante further contradicts the testimony of Apolinario
Baltazar in the fact that while Apolinario Baltazar swears that the
appellees furnished him the money with which to purchase the parcel of
land, Sabas Bustamante declares that he furnished the money to <em>Capitan</em>
Baltazar. The testimony of Sabas Bustamante furnishes no proof that the
money, even admitting his statement, which he furnished to <em>Capitan</em> Baltazar, was ever paid to the heirs of the Tuason Estate.</p>
  <p>
Examining the testimony of Agapito C. Cruz, another one of the
appellees, concerning the location of his land, we find that he also
denies the fact that Apolinario Baltazar purchased the land for him. He
asserts also that he delivered the money, for the purpose of purchasing
the land, to Silverio Baltazar (<em>Capitan</em> Baltazar). With
reference to the description of the land, he says that it is bounded on
the north by a river, on the south by Pedro Bautista, on the west by
the railroad and on the east by the <em>Tuason Hacienda</em>, and that
he and his ancestors had occupied said land probably for sixty or
seventy years. It will be noted that Agapito Cruz makes no attempt to
give the sitio, barrio, or municipality in which said land is located.</p>
  <p>
Looking now to the declaration of the other appellee, Demetria Cruz, we
find that she also contradicts the statements of Apolinario Baltazar,
and says that she or her husband delivered the money to Silverio
Baltazar (<em>Capitan</em> Berio) and not to Apolinario Baltazar. She
does not attempt to say how much land belonged to her. In effect she
positively says that she does not know. In describing her portion of
land she gives the following boundaries: On the west by the railroad,
on the south by Sabas Bustamante, on the east by the <em>Tuason Hacienda</em> and on the north by Agapito Cruz. When she was asked whether the payment she made to <em>Capitan</em>
Baltazar was rent or not, she answered that she did not know whether it
was rent or the purchase price. It will be noted that she gave neither
the sitio, barrio, or municipality in which the land which she
described is located.</p>
  <p> With reference to Exhibit K, which is
a plan of lot No. 25 and the land which the lower court awarded to the
present appellees, it may be said that the surveyor Mr. Espinosa, who
prepared the plan, stated that he had obtained <em>all</em> of his information for the preparation, of the same from the appellees.</p>
  <p>
For the respondents, Mr. Hermenegildo Meresina testified as a witness.
He declared under oath that he was the cashier for Jose Ma. Tuason and
had been since 1918; that he collected the rent from the tenants of the
<em>Hacienda Maysilo</em>; that he knew lot No. 25; that Sabas
Bustamante was one of the tenants of said lot and had paid rent for the
same; that he knew Agapito C. Cruz; that he was also one of the tenants
and had paid rent for the lot which he occupied; that he knew Demetria
Cruz; that she was one of the tenants and had paid rent; that each of
said persons had paid rent for the use and occupation of parts of lot
No. 25; and that they were old tenants of the <em>Hacienda Maysilo</em>.
The fact that the appellees had paid rent to Jose Ma. Tuason is also
confirmed by the declaration of Santiago Espiritu. Demetria Cruz was
recalled as a witness and admitted that she had made payments to Jose
Ma. Tuason for the years 1917 to 1920.</p>
  <p> From an examination
of the other two cases, first, for partition, and second, for
registration, some very interesting facts relating to the claim of
Apolinario Baltazar are noted. His principal theory is, that the lands
which he and those for whom he acted, had a right to purchase, in fact
purchased by his father Silverio Baltazar and that he (the father) had
purchased five parcels of land or at least had entered into a contract
to purchase them. The record shows that Silverio Baltazar presented ten
oppositions to ten different parcels of land to the registration of the
<em>Hacienda Maysilo</em> in the name of the Tuason family. The total
area of said ten parcels claimed by him was about 160,000 square
meters, more or less. The record shows that four parcels of land had
been sold to Apolinario Baltazar. The record further shows that none of
the four parcels sold to Apolinario Baltazar were any of the ten
parcels claimed by his father in his opposition to the registration of
the <em>Hacienda Maysilo</em>.</p>
  <p> The records, in the other
cases, further show by Exhibit C, that Melecio Saludes and Fermin
Mariano had presented to the commissioners sometime theretofore a list
of persons, among whom was Silverio Baltazar, who desired to purchase
parcels of land within the <em>Hacienda Maysilo</em> and that later <em>they</em>
notified said commissioners that they had acquired the rights of all of
the persons who were mentioned in a letter of the 27th day of April,
1910 (pp. 405; 253-260).</p>
  <p> After a thorough examination of all
of the evidence adduced in the present action, in relation with the
hundreds of pages in the <em>expedientes</em> for partition and registration, we are convinced that a large preponderance of the evidence shows the following:</p>
  <p>    (<em>a</em>)
That the present action is an effort to compel Jose Ma. Tuason to
specifically perform a contract of sale of certain parcels of land.
Neither the motion nor the proof supports that claim. </p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>)
That neither the allegations of the motion nor the evidence adduced is
sufficient to identify the land in question as lot No. 25, nor to
sustain the contention that Jose Ma. Tuason had ever promised to sell
said lot to the appellees.</p>
  <p> Therefore the judgment appealed
from is hereby revoked, the defendants are hereby absolved front all
liability under these proceedings, without prejudice to the right of
the appellees, if they have in fact a contract for the purchase of any
parcel of land within the Hacienda Maysilo, to commence another action,
to compel a compliance therewith. And, without any finding as to costs,
it so ordered.</p>
  <em>Villamor, Ostrand</em>, and <em>Romualdez, JJ</em>., concur.
  <br>
  <p><em>Malcolm, J</em>.,
concurring in part: I concur with so much of the dispositive part of
the decision as reads: "Therefore the judgment appealed from is hereby
revoked, the defendants are hereby absolved from all liability under
these proceedings, without prejudice * * *. And, without any finding as
to costs, it is so ordered."</p>
  <em>Johns, J</em>., concurring in
the result: The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action and for such reason the complaint should be dismissed
without prejudice and to that extent I concur in the result. </div>
