				[ G. R. No. 42071, July 20, 1934</h4>
				<H3>FELIX V. KATIPUNAN ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. FRANCISCO ZANDUETA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GODDARD, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify"> The herein petitioners instituted a joint election
contest proceeding in the Court of First Instance of Rizal on June 11,
1934, in which the offices of municipal president, vice-president and
municipal councilors of the town of Binangonan, Rizal, were involved.
After receiving copies of the motion of protest, the respondents, in
that proceeding, filed a motion in which they prayed for the dismissal
of the protest upon the ground that the Court of First Instance of
Rizal had no jurisdiction to hear and decide an election contest in
which all of the above-mentioned offices were contested in one protest.
This motion of dismissal is based upon the following provision of
section 479 of the Administrative Code, as amended by Act No. 3834,
approved November 5, 1931:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "La protesta * * * se referira a cargos especificos: <em>Entendiendose, sin embargo, </em>que las protestas sobre cargos de vicepresidente y concejales podran unirse en una sola mocion de protesta."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The original bill in which this law was embodied
was in the Spanish language. The English translation is practically
meaningless.</p>
<p align="justify"> This amendment permits the filing of a joint
election protest by candidates for the offices of vice-president and
municipal councilors and prohibits a candidate for the office of
municipal president from joining in such a protest. The reason for the
adoption of this amendment is the fact that the new Election Law, Act
No. 3387, provides for an appeal to this court from a decision of the
Court of First Instance in an election contest proceeding in which the
office of municipal president is involved; whereas, the decision of the
Court of First Instance is final in such a proceeding in which the
offices of vice-president and municipal councilors are in question. The
object being to avoid bringing to this court the whole record,
including all of the evidence, in a case, only part of which is
appealable and to prevent unnecessary expense and probable confusion.</p>
<p align="justify"> After due hearing the respondent judge, Francisco Zandueta, in an order dated June 25, 1934, held as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Estimando que el escrito o mocion
de protesta presentada en este asunto adolece del defecto de partes
demandadas o recurridas, por cuanto que segun la Ley ultimamente
aprobada por la Legislature, No. 3834 'La protesta * * * se refiere a
cargos especificos: Entendiendose, sin embargo, que las protestas sobre
cargos de vicepresidente y concejales podrian unirse en una sola mocion
de protesta', y habiendose incluido en una sola mocion de protesta
tanto la que se refiere al cargo de presidente, como al de
vicepresidente y concejales, parece ser que la objecion formulada en la
mocidn de los recurridos de fecha junio 21, 1934, merece cierta
consideracidn. Pero el defecto que se nota en el escrito de protesta no
despoja, sin embargo, en absoluto de la jurisdiccion del Juzgado para
conocer del asunto. Podria existir una confusion de jurisdiccion por el
estado en que se encuentra el escrito de protesta, pero semejante
defecto no es motivo suficiente para el sobreseimiento definitivo de la
protesta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> "Por lo tanto, a menos que los recurrentes
enmienden su escrito de protesta en el sentido de poner este en el
estado de ser visto por sus mSritos y subsane los defectos apuntados en
la mocion de los recurridos dentro del plazo de tres dias desde que
r^ciban copia de esta orden, sera sobresefda la protesta."</p>
<p align="justify"> The present action of certiorari was brought on the
ground that the respondent judge had exceeded his jurisdiction and
abused his judicial discretion in ruling as he did in the order copied
above. The respondent judge has not answered.</p>
<p align="justify"> The petitioners pray that the order of the
respondent judge be annulled and that he be ordered to proceed with the
hearing of the protest and decide the same upon its merits. The
respondents pray that this action of certiorari be denied; that the
lower court be declared without jurisdiction to hear and decide the
election protest in question and that this court order the dismissal of
the petitioners' motion of protest.</p>
<p align="justify"> The joint protest of the herein petitioners was
filed in good faith. They allege a common ground of action. The same
evidence will be relied upon by all of them and under section 114 of
the Code of Civil Procedure all persons having an interest in the
subject of the action and in obtaining the relief demanded should be
joined as plaintiffs, or, if any person having an interest in the
subject of the action, and in obtaining the relief demanded, refuses to
join as plaintiff, he may be made a defendant.</p>
<p align="justify"> The only question before this court is whether the
respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction and abused his discretion by
ordering the petitioners to amend their joint protest.</p>
<p align="justify"> Does the fact that the petitioners united in filing
a protest, in which Felix V. Katipunan is contesting the election of
one of the respondents as municipal president and the other petitioners
are contesting the election of one of the respondents as municipal
vice-president and some of them as town councilors, deprive the
respondent judge of his jurisdiction to order the petitioners to amend
their protest?</p>
<p align="justify"> The only question raised by the motion of the
respondents praying for the dismissal of the protest is that there is a
misjoinder of the protesting parties. A demurrer on the ground of a
defect or misjoinder of parties does not raise the question of the
jurisdiction of the court to try the action. A motion to dismiss on the
same ground is in effect a demurrer and does not raise the question of
the jurisdiction of the court to proceed with the trial and order the
amendment of the pleadings in case there is a defect or misjoinder of
parties.</p>
<p align="justify"> The petitioners should be allowed to amend their
protest and the party or parties excluded therefrom should be allowed
to file a separate protest as of the date of the filing of the joint
protest of the petitioners.</p>
<p align="justify"> Certiorari denied, without costs.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Imperial, </em>and<em> Butte, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
