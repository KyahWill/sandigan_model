				<H3>MARTIN GONZALEZ, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE, VS. SISENANDO TURLA ET AL., OPPOSITORS. SISENANDO TURLA, APPELLANT.<BR><BR> D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In July, 1918, one Martin Gonzalez filed an application for the registration 
of a large tract of land situated in the municipality of Lubao, Province of 
Pampanga. Shortly afterwards, Sisenando Turla, the herein appellant, applied for 
the registration in his favor of a portion embracing 49 hectares of the tract 
mentioned. Aside from this parcel, Turla also claimed another parcel in the 
northwestern part of the Gonzalez land, but had not applied for its 
registration.</p>
<p>The two applications for registration were tried together, and upon the 
evidence, the Court of First Instance denied the application of Sisenando Turla 
and ordered the registration of the land in favor of Martin Gonzalez. Turla 
appealed from, the denial of his application, and upon an examination of the 
record of the case, the judgment of the court below was set aside as to the 
parcel described in the appellant's application, and the parcel was registered 
in favor of Turla in the year 1922.3 In the meantime, one Ponciano Mauricio laid 
claim to a large portion of the so-called lot No. 2 of the land of Martin 
Gonzalez, but the Court of First Instance refused to reopen the case. Mauricio 
thereafter instituted mandamus proceedings in this court, and a writ was issued, 
and the case was remanded to the court below for the hearing of the opposition 
of Ponciano Mauricio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>The Court of First Instance again adjudged the land to 
Gonzalez, and Ponciano Mauricio appealed. Notwithstanding the fact that the 
unregistered parcel claimed by Turla was a part of lot No. 2, he failed to 
appeal after the new trial, being under the impression that his former appeal 
was sufficient.</p>
<p>After lengthy discussions, this court on December 31, 1927, modified the 
judgment of the court below and ordered the registration of the land in favor of 
Gonzalez, including the parcel claimed by Turla.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup></p>
<p>On January 17, 1928, Turla filed a motion asking that the decision be 
modified so that the portion of the land in dispute between him and the 
applicant, Martin Gonzalez, be excepted from the effects of said decision, and 
that the trial court be ordered to take the necessary steps. This motion was 
denied, the court being without jurisdiction to order the court below to permit 
another appeal in the case, and the time for granting such appeal having expired 
long before.</p>
<p>The final decree for the registration of the aforesaid lot No. 2 was issued 
in favor of Gonzalez on October 31, 1928, and on July 15, 1929, Sisenando Turla 
filed a motion in the Court of First Instance praying that the decree be 
reversed and that he be given opportunity to again present his evidence. The 
motion was denied, and Turla thereupon appealed to this court.</p>
<p>The appeal is, in our opinion, of no merit. A review of a final decree can 
only be accomplished under section 38 of the Land Registration Act and must rest 
on fraud on the part of the person or persons in whose favor the decree has been 
issued. That is not the case here. As far as the record shows, Gonzalez did not 
obtain the decree by fraud, and the court below did not err in denying the 
review. We may say further that the failure of Sisenando Turla to present his 
appeal in time, was his own fault; without such appeal this court was not in 
position to reverse the judgment of the court below as far as Turla was 
concerned. Moreover, taking into consideration his clearly untrue testimony 
while a witness for Ponciano Mauricio, this court would hardly have disturbed 
the conclusions of the trial court notwithstanding an appeal.</p>
<p>The decision of the court below is affirmed with the costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns, Romualdez 
</i>and<i> Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.</p>
