				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These two cases were presented to this court, together with G.R.&nbsp; No. 34338,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> by the writer&nbsp; of this opinion, owing to the fact&nbsp; that they are closely related.<br><br>Bernabe&nbsp; B. Aquino and the municipality of Bayambang, Pangasinan, both appeal from&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision rendered&nbsp; in these two&nbsp; cases which&nbsp; had been tried&nbsp; together.<br><br>The first of these,&nbsp; namely, G. R. No. 34336, was brought by Bernabe B. Aquino to recover some real property from said&nbsp; municipality of Bayambang, and the second was instituted for the purpose of registering said property under Act No. 496.<br><br>The&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; have each assigned a&nbsp; number of errors.<br><br>Bernabe&nbsp; B. Aquino contends that he purchased the property&nbsp; from&nbsp; Agustin V.&nbsp; Gomez&nbsp; as evidenced by&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed (Exhibit L-Aquino), registered in&nbsp; the&nbsp; registry of deeds. Agustin V. Gomez bought the said property together&nbsp; with some others, of Getulio Pitco (Exhibit K—1-Aquino)&nbsp; who had also purchased them from Juan Fajardo (Exhibit K— 1-Aquino), who,&nbsp; in&nbsp; turn, had in the year 1892, obtained a possessory information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; testified&nbsp; at the hearing that Juan Fajardo&nbsp; and&nbsp; his&nbsp; successors, had indeed been in possession of the property, cultivating it.<br><br>On the other hand, the municipality of Bayambang maintains that the lots here claimed are&nbsp; part of the fisheries it has owned&nbsp; from time immemorial.<br><br>Taking up first of all the claim presented by the municipality of Bayambang, appellant, we do not find&nbsp; sufficient evidence of record to show that said municipality was&nbsp; in possession&nbsp; of the property&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; previous to&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1928.&nbsp; Neither has it been shown that the Insular Government duly&nbsp; transferred said property to it; and even assuming that it has been in possession thereof, this court has repeatedly&nbsp; held that the mere occupation and possession of land, and the collection of rent therefor, does not give the municipality any&nbsp; title thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Municipality&nbsp; of Tacloban vs. Director of Lands, 17 Phil., 426; 18 Phil., 201; Municipality of Hagonoy vs. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, 29 Phil., 320.)<br><br>We find no merit in the appellant municipality's assignment of error.<br><br>Passing now to the appellant Bernabe B. Aquino's claim, we find that there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that the&nbsp; property here in litigation is the same described as the second parcel in the possessory information (Exhibit K-Aquino).<br><br>We believe the road mentioned in said information as the northern boundary of the property, which today no longer exists, was sufficiently shown to have existed on the northern side of the whole property belonging to Juan Fajardo at that time, of which&nbsp; the&nbsp; land litigated in these two cases is a part.<br><br>The eastern&nbsp; and western boundaries&nbsp; are satisfactorily identified in the testimony of Marciano Fajardo, which is corroborated by Esteban&nbsp; Cajulao and&nbsp; Cosine Valdez; and as for the southern side of the second parcel mentioned in the possessory information, we find, in view of the evidence, that it today forms the boundary line between two municipalities, Bayambang and Moncada.<br><br>The value of the&nbsp; possessory information (Exhibit&nbsp; K-Aquino), as evidence of possession is not impaired by&nbsp; the fact that it&nbsp; was registered only in the year, 1920.&nbsp; To be sure, before&nbsp; being recorded in the registry it availed nothing against a third person;&nbsp; but when&nbsp; it was&nbsp; adduced&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present case, it had already been duly recorded.<br><br>Marciano&nbsp; Fajardo, it&nbsp; is charged, recognized that&nbsp; the property in question&nbsp; was part of the fisheries belonging to the municipality of&nbsp; Bayambang,&nbsp; inasmuch as it was&nbsp; he who, being the municipal president in 1911, furnished&nbsp; the data regarding that property at the instance of said municipality. But Marciano Fajardo has, in our&nbsp; opinion,&nbsp; explained the matter sufficiently.&nbsp; The 1911 survey was made not because the municipality&nbsp; claimed the property,&nbsp; but in order to fix the line between said municipality and those conterminous with it, which had been in controversy for a long time.&nbsp; With reference to the ordinance (Exhibit 1-Bayambang), it has not been shown that the property there mentioned is within the land in question.<br><br>As to appellant Aquino's petition that his title be recognized in these proceedings, we find that the land in question is agricultural,&nbsp; and that said appellant has been in possession as owner publicly and continuously, and that before him his predecessors&nbsp; held the land under like circumstances, so that the total unbroken&nbsp; possession of Aquino and his predecessors dates back to the year,&nbsp; 1887.<br><br>From Marciano Fajardo's testimony it appears that his father made an assessment declaration of all these lands for the year, 1902, though he did not pay the tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pp. 146, 147, 184, t. s. n.)<br><br>The successive transfers of&nbsp; the land are&nbsp; also&nbsp; clearly shown.&nbsp; Bernabe B. Aquino&nbsp; bought it of Agustin V. Gomez, who had bought it of Getulio Pitco,&nbsp; who in turn, had ac- quired it from Juan Fajardo, in whose name the possessory information was obtained.<br><br>Therefore under paragraph (b), section 45, Act No. 2874, the appellant Bernabe B. Aquino is&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to the&nbsp; land in question.<br><br>For these reasons, the claim of damages set up&nbsp; by the municipality of Bayambang is unfounded.&nbsp; Neither is appellant Aquino's claim of damages against this municipality sufficiently&nbsp; proved.&nbsp; It is not shown that the persons alleged&nbsp; to&nbsp; have caused the damages acted in pursuance of an order of said municipality, either&nbsp; official or maliciously.<br><br>We find nothing in the record to justify our holding the municipality of Bayambang&nbsp; liable for the damages claimed by appellant Aquino.<br><br>Wherefore, the judgment&nbsp; appealed from is hereby modified, and it is held that the land litigated in these two cases is&nbsp; not public land, but belongs exclusively to Bernabe B. Aquino, who is entitled to have&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper title issued to him through the proper&nbsp; proceedings under&nbsp; Act No. 496 and its amendments; and the&nbsp; judgment is reversed&nbsp; in so far as it dissolved the injunction against the municipality of Bayambang, which injunction is&nbsp; hereby held to be in force henceforth and&nbsp; forever, and so far as damages were adjudicated&nbsp; to&nbsp; said&nbsp; municipality *to which it is not en- titled; finally, the judgment is affirmed in so far as it denies to said municipality the title it claims to said property.<br><br>This judgment is rendered without an express finding as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C.
