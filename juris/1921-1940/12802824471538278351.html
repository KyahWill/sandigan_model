				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Appellants were convicted in the Court of First 
Instance of Tarlac of a violation of article 133 of the Revised Penal 
Code, which reads:
</p><p align="justify"> "ART. 133. <em>Offending the religious feelings</em>.â€”The
 penalty of <em>arresto mayor </em>in its maximum period to <em>prision 
correccional </em>in its minimum period shall be imposed upon anyone 
who, in a place devoted to religious worship or during the celebration 
of any religious ceremony, shall perform acts notoriously offensive to 
the feelings of the faithful."</p>
<p align="justify"> In the barrio of Macalong, municipality of La Paz, 
Province of Tarlac, there is a chapel where it is customary to hold what
 is known in local parlance as a <em><em>pabasa</em></em>. As stated by 
the lower court, "the term <em>pabasa</em> is applied to the act of the 
people, professing the Roman Catholic faith," of assembling, during 
Lent, "at a certain designated place, for the purpose of reading and 
chanting the life, passion and death of Jesus Christ. A book known as 
the 'Vida, Pasi6n y Muerte de Jesucristo', which contains a full account
 in verse of the life, passion and death of Jesus Christ, is used in 
this celebration." The <em>pabasa</em> in Macalong used to begin on Palm
 Sunday and continue day and night, without any interruption whatsoever,
 until Good Friday. As usual, refreshment and food were served in the 
yard adjoining the chapel, and the expenses incidental thereto were 
defrayed by different persons.</p>
<p align="justify"> While the <em>pabasa</em> was going on the evening 
of April 10, 1933, between 11 and 12 o'clock, the defendants Procopio 
Reyes, Policarpio Nacana, Florentine Clemente, Hermogenes Mallari, 
Marcelino Mallari, Castor Alipio, and Rufino Matias arrived at the 
place, carrying bolos and crowbars, and started to construct a barbed 
wire fence in front of the chapel. Alfonso Castillo, who was chairman of
 the committee in charge of the <em>pabasa</em>, tried to persuade them 
to refrain from carrying out their plan, by reminding them of the fact 
that it was Holy Week and that it was highly improper to construct a 
fence at that time of the evening. A verbal altercation ensued.</p>
<p align="justify"> When the people attending the <em>pabasa</em> in the
 chapel and those who were eating in the yard thereof noticed what was 
happening, they became excited and left the place hurriedly and in such 
confusion that dishes and saucers were broken and benches toppled over. 
The <em>pabasa</em> was discontinued and it was not resumed until after 
an investigation conducted by the chief of police on the following 
morning, which investigation led to the filing of the complaint 
appearing on pages 1 and 2 of the record.</p>
<p align="justify"> Many years ago the Clemente family by informal 
donation gave the land on which the old chapel was erected. When it was 
destroyed, the present chapel was erected, and there, is now a dispute 
as to whether the new chapel is not now impinging on the land that 
belongs to the Clemente family. The appellants are partisans of the 
Clemente family.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is to be noted that article 133 of the Revised 
Penal Code punishes acts "notoriously offensive to the feelings of the 
faithful." The construction of a fence, even though irritating and 
vexatious under the circumstances to those present, is not such an act 
as can be designated as "notoriously offensive to the faithful", as 
normally such an act would be a matter of complete indifference to those
 not present, no matter how religious a turn of mind they might be.</p>
<p align="justify"> The disturbance or interruption of any ceremony of a
 religious character under the old Penal Code was denounced by article 
571 and was punished by arrest from one to ten days1 and'a fine of from 
15 to 125 <em>pesetas</em>. But this article was omitted from the 
Revised Penal Code and the offense, if any was committed by the 
appellants, is denounced in article 287 as an "unjust vexation" and 
punished by <em>arresto menor</em> or a fine ranging from 5 to 200 pesos
 or both.</p>
<p align="justify"> It is urged upon us that the act of building a fence
 was innocent and was simply to protect private property rights. The 
fact that this argument is a pretense only is clearly shown by the 
circumstances under which the fence was constructed, namely, late at 
night and in such a way as to vex and annoy the parties who had gathered
 to celebrate the <em>pabasa</em> and is further shown by the fact that 
many of the appellants saw fit to introduce as their defense a false 
alibi.</p>
<p align="justify"> Appellants are therefore acquitted of a violation of
 article 133 of the Revised Penal Code but found guilty of a violation 
of article 287 of the Revised Penal Code and are sentenced each to a 
fine of P75 with subsidiary confinement in case of insolvency, together 
with the costs in both instances. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"> <em>Avancena, C. J., Abad Santos, Vickers,</em> and <em>Diaz,
 JJ.,</em> concur.
